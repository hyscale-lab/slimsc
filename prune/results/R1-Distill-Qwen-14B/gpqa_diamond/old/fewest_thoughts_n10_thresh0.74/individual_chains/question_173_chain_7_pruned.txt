Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle is related to quantum mechanics, something about not being able to know both the position and momentum of a particle precisely at the same time. Oh right, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.

The question says an electron is moving at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, so how do I approach this? I think the uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula, if I remember correctly, is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, but sometimes it's written as Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, so maybe we can approximate using that.

First, I should find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Because once I have that, I can relate it to energy. But how? Because energy for a particle is given by its kinetic energy, which is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So, if I find Δp, I can find the uncertainty in kinetic energy.

Wait, but does the uncertainty in energy relate to the uncertainty in momentum? I think so because the kinetic energy is directly related to momentum. So, maybe the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be approximately (Δp²)/(2m). That makes sense because if p is uncertain by Δp, then the kinetic energy would be uncertain by that amount squared over twice the mass.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate Δp using Δx and the uncertainty principle.
2. Use Δp to calculate the uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE.

But wait, the uncertainty principle gives the product of Δx and Δp as approximately ħ/2. So, Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2 → Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx).

Wait, I should double-check the exact formula. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty would be when it's equal to ħ/2. So, Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

Okay, so let's compute Δp.

Given:

Δx =
