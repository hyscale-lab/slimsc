Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again and then think through each step. Hmm.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I think is the same as 200.00 mL or 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water.

Wait, the problem mentions T is 25°C, which is room temperature, so that's probably standard conditions. The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, orthophosphate would be PO4^3-? But wait, wait. Let's think about the phosphate species.

I remember that H3PO4 is triprotic, so it can donate three protons. The different K values tell us the strength of each deprotonation. So, the first dissociation is the strongest (Ka1 is about 7.5e-3), then Ka2 is much weaker, and Ka3 is super weak.

But wait, the problem is about orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-, right? Because that's the dihydrogen phosphate ion. So when they ask for the concentration of orthophosphate, I think they're referring to [HPO4^2-]. Or wait, sometimes orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, no, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, so the salts would have different degrees of deprotonation. KH2PO4 is the potassium salt of H2PO4^- (so dihydrogen phosphate), and Na2HPO4 is the sodium salt of HPO4^2- (dihydrogen? Or is it phosphate? Wait, no. Wait:

H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-
H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-
HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-

So, if I have KH2PO4, it's H2PO4^- in solution. And Na2HPO4 would give HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem is asking for orthophosphate ions. Oh, wait, sometimes HPO4^2- is called orthophosphate... but I'm not entirely sure. Or is it PO4^3-? Hmm, I think orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.

Wait, the question says "orthophosphate ions," which might be PO4^3-, but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, maybe it's HPO4^2-? The problem could be a bit ambiguous, but I think in the context of the given salts, let's look at the solutions.

So, let's think about the solution. We have two salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's find their moles first.

Moles of KH2PO4:

Mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007335 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Wait, but wait, Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So when dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Similarly, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

So, in solution, I have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, phosphate in solution can exist in different forms depending on pH. The presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that the solution is probably in a region where the pH is such that both are present, which is around the pKa2, since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are conjugate acid-base pairs with Ka2 ~6.2e-8.

So, the solution is a buffer solution, consisting of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So, the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, then we can calculate that.

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate here refers to PO4^3-, but in this solution, the PO4^3- concentration would be negligible because the solution is buffered around pKa2, where PO4^3- is minimal. So, I think the correct species here is HPO4^2-.

But wait, let me think again. The problem states that we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, in solution, the HPO4^2- comes from the Na2HPO4, and the H2PO4^- comes from the KH2PO4.

So, the concentrations of these ions are going to be determined by the moles present and the dilution.

Wait, the total volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L.

So, the concentration of H2PO4^- is moles / volume. Let me compute that.

Moles of H2PO4^- = 0.007335 mol. So concentration is 0.007335 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036675 M.

Moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005613 mol. Concentration is 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

Now, the solution is a buffer solution, and the pH can be determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, considering Ka2.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Here, the acid is H2PO4^- (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and the base is HPO4^2-.

So, pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

So, pH = 7.208 + log(0.028065 / 0.036675) 

Let me compute that ratio: 0.028065 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.766.

Log(0.766) ≈ -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.114 ≈ 7.094.

Now, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is PO4^3-, how much is that in solution?

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the sum of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- as orthophosphate, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps they are considering the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem statement says "orthophosphate ions." Orthophosphate is HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Hmm, I might need to clarify that.

Wait, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. So the conjugate bases are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

Orthophosphate could refer to any of these, but in common usage, I think orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the naming: ortho, meta, para applies to aromatic compounds, but for phosphoric acid, the different forms are called different things. So, H3PO4 is orthophosphoric acid, H2PO4^- is dihydrogen phosphate, HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is phosphate.

Ah, so PO4^3- is called phosphate. So, when the question asks for orthophosphate, perhaps it's referring to HPO4^2-, which is hydrogen phosphate. Or maybe they are using orthophosphate as a shorthand for HPO4^2-? Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps in the context of this problem, the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total concentration of all phosphate species, but that doesn't seem to fit the question.

Wait, the problem is about orthophosphate ions in solution. So, if the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is what's being asked.

Wait, looking at the options, they are all around 1e-7 M. Wait, but the concentrations I calculated are 0.036 M and 0.028 M, which are way higher than 1e-7. So that can't be right. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Because the options are in the 1e-7 range, which is much lower than the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So why would PO4^3- be present in such low concentrations? Because PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, and the solution's pH is around 7.1, which is below the pKa3 of HPO4^2-.

Wait, the third dissociation of H3PO4 is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is about 11.74. So, at pH 7.1, the solution is acidic compared to pKa3, so PO4^3- would be very low.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- can be calculated using Ka3 and the H+ concentration.

Wait, but how?

So, first, let's find the concentration of H+ ions in the solution, using the pH we calculated earlier.

Wait, the pH is approximately 7.094, so [H+] ≈ 1e-7.094 ≈ 8.25e-8 M.

Then, the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the third dissociation: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

Rearranging, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 × [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M (from earlier)

[H+] is ~8.25e-8 M

So:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.25e-8

Let me compute that:

1.8e-12 * 0.028065 ≈ 5.0517e-14

Divide by 8.25e-8: 5.0517e-14 / 8.25e-8 ≈ 6.12e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.1e-7 M.

But looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, perhaps my calculations are a bit approximate. Let me do more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact pH to get a better [H+] value.

Let me recalculate the pH.

The ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028065 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.766.

Taking the log of 0.766.

Log(0.766) = log(766e-3) = log(7.66e-1).

Using log(7.66) ≈ 0.885, so log(7.66e-1) ≈ 0.885 - 1 = -0.115.

So pH = 7.208 - 0.115 ≈ 7.093.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.093) ≈ 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.843 ≈ 8.43e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.43e-8) 

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = (1.8 * 0.028065) * 1e-12 ≈ 0.050517 * 1e-12 = 5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 8.43e-8.

So 5.0517e-14 / 8.43e-8 → (5.0517 / 8.43) * 1e-6.

5.0517 / 8.43 ≈ 0.5996 → 0.5996e-6 = 5.996e-7.

So approximately 6.0e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Let me recheck the calculations for any possible errors.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact ratio more accurately.

Let me compute the initial moles again.

KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = approximately 0.0073348 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = approximately 0.005613 mol.

Then, the concentrations in 0.2 L:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0073348 / 0.2 = 0.036674 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

So the ratio is 0.028065 / 0.036674 = exactly 0.766.

Log(0.766) ≈ -0.1148.

So pH = 7.208 - 0.1148 = 7.0932.

[H+] = 1e-7.0932 ≈ 8.42e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.42e-8)

Compute 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Divide by 8.42e-8: 5.0517e-14 / 8.42e-8 = 5.0517/(8.42e8) ) Wait, no, Wait, 5.0517e-14 divided by 8.42e-8 is (5.0517 /8.42) * 1e-6.

5.0517 /8.42 ≈ 0.5999 → so 0.5999e-6 = 5.999e-7 M ≈ 6.0e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 6.24e-7. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact values without rounding.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [H+] more accurately.

Given that pH = 7.0932, [H+] = 10^(-7.0932) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0932)

10^(-0.0932) ≈ e^(-0.0932 * ln(10)) ≈ e^(-0.0932 * 2.3026) ≈ e^(-0.2144) ≈ 0.807.

So [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.807 = 8.07e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.07e-8

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 8.07e-8.

So 5.0517e-14 / 8.07e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.07) * 1e-6.

5.0517 /8.07 ≈ 0.6263 → 0.6263e-6 = 6.263e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.26e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me check: the problem is about orthophosphate, which if I'm correct, is PO4^3-. So the concentration is approximately 6.26e-7 M, which matches option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. But in that case, the concentration would be 0.028 M, which is way higher than the options provided. So that's not the case, which suggests that the problem is asking for PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait another thing: the solution could involve the total concentration of all phosphate species, but that doesn't make sense because the options are much smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer, and the actual concentrations are affected by the pH. So the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the pH and the available HPO4^2-.

Yes, that's exactly what I did.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option A, 6.24e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we start by analyzing the given data. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The molecular weights are 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007335 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol} \)

### Step 2: Determine concentrations in solution
- KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻. Thus, \([H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007335}{0.2} \approx 0.036675 \, \text{M}\).
- Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into 2Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻. Thus, \([HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005613}{0.2} \approx 0.028065 \, \text{M}\).

### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the solution
The solution is a buffer system involving H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with pKa₂ = \(-\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208\). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log\left(\frac{0.028065}{0.036675}\right)
\]
The ratio \(\frac{0.028065}{0.036675} \approx 0.766\), and \(\log(0.766) \approx -0.114\). Thus:
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 - 0.114 \approx 7.094
\]

### Step 4: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using Ka₃
The third dissociation of H₃PO₄ is:
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \quad K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
\]
Using \(K_a = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}\), rearrange to solve for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]
From the pH, \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.25 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028065)}{8.25 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0517 \times 10^{-14}}{8.25 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.12 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \(6.12 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which is closest to option A (\(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)).

ANSWER: A
