Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, I remember that when charges are placed near conductors, the conductor's response affects the potential energy. The question is about a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I'm supposed to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, I think when a conducting sphere is grounded, it allows charges to move freely, right? So any induced charges will flow to ground if necessary. Oh wait, but if the charge q is placed near the sphere, it will induce charges on the sphere. Because the sphere is conducting, the induced charges will be on the surface.

Let me think about this setup. The charge q is outside the sphere because d is the distance from the center, and the sphere has radius R. So d must be greater than R. Because if d were less than R, the charge would be inside, but the problem says d is the distance from the center, so when they say placed d away, it's probably outside.

So when a charge is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's response is to have induced charges on its surface. But wait, the sphere is grounded, so any induced charges can flow away. Hmm, does that mean the sphere doesn't have any net charge? Or maybe it does?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ground is at zero potential. When the charge q is placed near the sphere, it will induce a charge on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge would flow to ground. So the sphere remains at zero potential. Wait, so how does that work?

I remember that for a grounded conducting sphere, when you bring a charge near it, the induced charges redistribute to
