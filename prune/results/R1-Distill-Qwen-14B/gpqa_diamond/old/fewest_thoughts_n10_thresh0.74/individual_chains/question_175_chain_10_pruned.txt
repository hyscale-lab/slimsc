Okay, so I have this question about an oscillating charge distribution that radiates power, and I need to find the correct fraction of the maximum power at a specific angle and the form of the power function. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The setup is an oscillating charge that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, it's probably an dipole radiator, but maybe higher multipole? Well, since it's spheroidal, maybe a dipole or quadrupole? But wait, oscillating charges usually radiate as dipoles. So let's think about the dipole radiation.

The question is about the power radiated at a specific angle theta. The maximum power is A, and they want the fraction at theta=30 degrees. Also, the possible forms of f, which is the power per unit solid angle as a function of lambda and theta.

I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern has a specific dependence on theta. The intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is proportional to (sin(theta))^2. So at theta=90 degrees, it's maximum. But wait, the question is about theta=30 degrees. Let me think about the fraction.

So, for a dipole, the intensity pattern is I ~ sin^2(theta). The maximum intensity occurs when theta is 90 degrees (sin^2(90)=1), and the intensity at theta=30 would be sin^2(30) which is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the fraction would be 0.25, which is 1/4.

But wait, the problem says "radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of lambda and theta." So f(theta) is the intensity. For a dipole, the intensity also depends on the wavelength, right? The power radiated by a dipole is proportional to (d^2 p/dt^2)^2, where p is the dipole moment. But when considering radiation, the peak power would depend on the frequency, which is related to lambda.

Wait, the maximum power is A. So the function f(theta) would be the intensity, which is proportional to the square of the electric field, and for a dipole, the
