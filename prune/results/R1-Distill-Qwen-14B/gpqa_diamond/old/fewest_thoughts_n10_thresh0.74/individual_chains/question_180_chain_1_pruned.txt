Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of a system with charges. Let me see what I can do. I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but let me think through it.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, so each has a charge of 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. That's 3.2e-19 C per particle.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. Hmm, so the setup is like this: one charge is at the center, and the other twelve are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters around it. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the arrangement, but since it's about the potential energy of the system, the configuration might matter. But wait, for point charges, the potential energy depends on the distances between each pair. Oh but wait, if the twelve charges are all at the same distance from P, then each of them is at the same distance from the charge at P.

Wait, to find the minimum energy, I think I need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of the entire system. Because potential energy is a state function, and for a group of point charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Right, the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U
