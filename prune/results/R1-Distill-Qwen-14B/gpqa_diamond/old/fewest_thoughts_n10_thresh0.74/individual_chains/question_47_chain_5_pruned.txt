Okay, so I've got this spectroscopy problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the structure of the compound based on the given data. Let me see what I can do here. The compound is C9H11NO2, and the options are A, B, C, D. Hmm.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2. X is zero. So plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturationâ€”that's probably a benzene ring (which accounts for 4) and a double bond or an amide or ester group (so one more). So likely, the compound has a benzene ring and maybe an ester or amide group.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches, maybe from an amide or an amine. Oh wait, but amides usually have a single peak around 3300. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine. Or maybe two different N-H groups, like in a secondary amide. Also, the IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for esters or amides. Esters usually have around 1740-1700, and amides maybe a bit lower. Or maybe it's a carbonyl from a ketone, but given the formula, more likely an ester or amide.

Now the 1H NMR. Let's go through each peak:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Could be adjacent to an oxygen or nitrogen. Maybe an OCH2 or NCH2 group. But since the integration is 2H, perhaps it's a methylene next to an electronegative atom.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests it's next to a CH2 with two protons. So maybe a CH2CH2 group. Wait, no, quartet is splitting into four peaks, so perhaps a CH2 connected to another CH2. So maybe an ethyl group adjacent, like OCH2CH2.

Wait, but the 4.5 is quartet; that's a bit more upfield than typical for OCH2CH3. Oh, but wait, in an ester, the OCH2 would be around 4.1-4.3 maybe, but
