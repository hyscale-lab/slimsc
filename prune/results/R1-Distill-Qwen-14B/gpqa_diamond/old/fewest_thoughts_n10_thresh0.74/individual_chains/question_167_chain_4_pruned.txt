Okay, so I have this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N, where N is the normalisation constant. The normalisation N is given by sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). The relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is delta_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the state and tau is the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, I remember that for Gaussian states, the density matrix is Gaussian, so the reference state here is Gaussian. The non-Gaussianity is measured by this relative entropy difference.

So the question is asking for the non-Gaussianity when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

First, let's compute N. Let's plug in phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

Compute sin(2*phi): 2*phi is 2*(-pi/4) = -pi/2. sin(-pi/2) is -1.

So sin(2*phi) = -1. Then exp(-2*alpha²) is exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5). Which is about 0.6065.

So N squared is 1 + (-1)*0.6065. So 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935). Let me calculate that. Square root of 0.3935 is approximately 0.6275.

Wait, but wait, N is in the denominator, so |psi> is normalized. So rho is |psi><psi| divided by N squared, right? Because when you make a density matrix, you take the outer product and then divide by the norm squared.

Wait, wait. Actually, the normalization N is defined such that |psi> is normalized, so <
