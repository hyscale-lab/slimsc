Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me see what I can do. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction product's NMR spectra. Hmm, the compound reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I think that's a ring-opening reaction, maybe an epoxide opening?

Wait, the options are all oxiranes or epoxides. Oh right, because 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, I think it's used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. So when an epoxide reacts with a base like this, it probably does a nucleophilic attack. But maybe the solvent and conditions are more about the reaction mechanism.

The resulting product's NMR data is given. Let's look at the 1H NMR first. The signals are:

- Î´ 2.28 (3H, s): That's a singlet for a methyl group, probably attached to something deshielded but not near any protons. Maybe an aromatic ring's methyl substituent? Or maybe a carbonyl group.

Wait, but wait. Another singlet at 2.31 (3H, s). Two singlets for two methyl groups? That's interesting. Both are around 2.3 ppm. Maybe they're in similar environments, like two methyl groups attached to something symmetric.

Then, aromatic signals: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Hmm, that's four signals, but two doublets each with 2H and 1H. Let me think about how that would split. Maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring with substituents that cause some splitting.

Wait, let me think. The 1H NMR shows four types of aromatic protons. Two doublets of 2H and 1H each. So perhaps a structure with an ortho, meta, para arrangement? Or maybe a meta-substituted group causing a doublet for the adjacent H. Alternatively, it could be part of a styryl group, which is a vinyl benzene.

Looking at the 13C NMR, it's a bit more complicated. The signals are:

- 21.3 (s, 1C)
- 28.4 (s, 1C)
- 126.9 (s, 2C)
- 127.1 (s, 1C)
- 129.1 (s, 2C)
- 130.3 (s, 1C)
- 141.5 (s, 1C)
- 144.1 (s, 1C)
- 197.7 (s, 1C)

Wait, 197.7 is really high. That might be a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester. But in epoxide reactions, what could form a carbonyl? Maybe an oxidation product, but 1,4-diazabicyclo is more of a base. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol from epoxide ring-opening. But wait, 197 is more like a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone or an ester.

Wait, but the options for X are all epoxides. So after reaction, what's the product? Let me think again. The reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane, which is a strong base. So maybe it's an epoxide ring-opening via a nucleophilic attack. But what would that produce?

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction is ring-opening with a base, perhaps it's adding across the epoxide.
