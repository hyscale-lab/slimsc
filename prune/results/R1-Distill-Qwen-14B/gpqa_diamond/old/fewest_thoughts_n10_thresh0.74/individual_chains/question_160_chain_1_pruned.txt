Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

Hmm, the problem involves an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light, which means it's a single wavelength λ, is shining along the z-axis and falls vertically on this aperture. The result is a diffraction pattern with intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh right, and we can approximate tan(theta) as theta because the angles are small.

Wait, what do I remember about diffraction patterns? Oh right, the far field diffraction pattern is what we usually think about in problems like this. The key formula for the minima in single-slit diffraction is a sin(theta) = m λ, where m is the order of the minima, m = ±1, ±2, etc. But wait, that's single-slit. What about a polygonal aperture?

Wait, the problem says N is infinitely large. So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. Oh, so if N is infinitely large, the aperture becomes a circular one. So maybe the problem is about a circular aperture's diffraction pattern.

Wait, but wait. The formula for the minima in a circular aperture is different. I think for a circular aperture, the minima occur when the path difference between light coming from the edge of
