Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the algorithm that converts a DNA sequence into a number, and then apply it to a new sequence. The given examples are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. The question is asking what ACAGTGACC gives, with options A to D.

Hmm, let's start by looking at the examples. The first example is AGG. Let's think about possible ways to convert this to 115. DNA sequences are made up of four nucleotides: A, T, C, G. Each one has a specific value. Maybe each nucleotide is assigned a number.

Wait, I remember that sometimes in coding, A is 0, T is 1, C is 2, G is 3. Or maybe they're mapped differently. Let me check that. Let's assign each letter a number and see if the sum or product gives the output.

For AGG: A, G, G. If A is 0, G is 3. So 0,3,3. How does that turn into 115? Hmmm. Maybe not addition. What if it's a product? 0*3*3 is 0. No, that's not 115. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each nucleotide's value is added together. Let me think of another approach. Wait, maybe each nucleotide is converted to a digit, and then the entire string is treated as a number in a certain base. Like binary, ternary, or another base.

Wait, DNA has four nucleotides, so perhaps it's base 4. Let's check.

Wait, base 4 digits go from 0 to 3. So each letter would map to a number 0-3. Let's assign A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. Then, for AGG, that would be 0,3,3. So, as a base4 number, it's 0*4^2 +3*4^1 +3*4^0 = 0 +12 +3 =15. But the output is 115, not 15. Hmm. Maybe it's a different base.

Wait, another idea: perhaps each nucleotide is treated as a number, and the entire sequence is a number in base 10, but that seems unlikely because each digit would have to be 0-3.
