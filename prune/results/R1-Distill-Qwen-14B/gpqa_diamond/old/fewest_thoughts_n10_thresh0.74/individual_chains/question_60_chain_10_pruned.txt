Okay, so I have this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about an alien astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. Their spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. We need to find out approximately how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective, and whether they will live long enough to reach Earth.

Wait, wait. The options are given, and one of them says the astronaut will die before reaching Earth. Others are in the 70-80 year range. So first, I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time, right? Because in special relativity, time dilation affects the traveler's experienced time differently than the time observed from Earth.

So, let's think about the problem. The spacecraft is moving at a constant speed, so we can use the time dilation formula from Einstein's theory of relativity. The formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where τ is the proper time (time experienced by the astronaut), t is the time measured in the Earth's frame (the time it takes from Earth's perspective), and v is the spacecraft's velocity.

But wait, to find τ, we need t first. How do we find t? We need the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I remember that the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Wait, is that right? I think the approximate distance is around that. So if the spaceship is going at almost the speed of light, the time from Earth's perspective would be distance divided by speed.

So let me calculate that. Distance is approximately 163,000 light-years. The speed is 0.99999987 c. Let me compute t. Since one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, so at speed v, the time is distance divided by v. So, t = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c) * (c / ly per year) ) Wait, units should cancel. So the time in years would be (163,00
