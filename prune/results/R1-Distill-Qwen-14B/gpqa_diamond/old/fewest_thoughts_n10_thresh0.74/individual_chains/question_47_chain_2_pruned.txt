Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's see. The options are A, B, C, D. I'll need to figure out which structure fits the IR and NMR data provided.

First, the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. Those are probably N-H stretches because those wavenumbers are typical for amines or amides. The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. So, the compound likely has both an N-H and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, which usually corresponds to a CH3 group attached to something that splits the signal into a triplet. Maybe an ethyl group (like CH2CH3), where the CH3 is next to a CH2. So, the triplet with 3H is likely a methyl group from an ethyl chain.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad signals are often from NH groups, but since it's a singlet and 2H, maybe it's part of an amide or an ethyl group adjacent to something that makes the splitting broad. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3, but wait, the triplet is at 1.20, so maybe the ethyl is elsewhere.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet integrating for 2H. A quartet usually arises from coupling with a neighboring group with two protons. So, this could be a -OCH2- group. Like an ethyl ester, where the OCH2 is next to another CH2. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen and another CH2 group.

- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two doublets each integrating for 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets indicate two sets of protons, each with two equivalent protons, probably in a 1,4 substitution pattern. So, maybe a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

Putting this together. The aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. The substituents on the benzene ring must be affecting the chemical shift. Let's think about the substituents. If the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group like a nitro, carbonyl, or an amide group, the ring protons would be deshielded and appear upfield or downfield depending on the substituent. Alternatively, an electron-donating group like OCH3 would cause the protons to be more shielded, appearing downfield or upfield.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. So, the benzamide group is at position 1 and ethoxy at 3. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,4,5,6. Wait, but the substitution pattern would lead to different splitting. Maybe two doublets for two sets of protons.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So, the formamide group (HCON-) is attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. The benzene would have substituents at positions 4 (ethoxy) and 1 (formamide). The aromatic protons would be at 2,3,5,6. Wait, but in para substitution, the protons opposite each substituent would be equivalent. So, perhaps two doublets for the two pairs.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is CH2CH2COO-NH2 attached to benzene at position 4. Wait, no, propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. The 4-aminophenyl would have an amino group. Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H, broad), which might be the amino group, but the amino group would usually show up as a broad signal, possibly around 1-5 ppm. But in this case, maybe it's part of an ester or something else.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So, the structure would be the benzoate ester: O-CO-OCH2CH3, but wait, no, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group on the benzene and the ester group as well
