Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the uncertainty principle, right? So it's related to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. I've heard about that before. The principle says that there's a limit to how precisely we can know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously.

The problem states that an electron is traveling at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nanometers. We need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron.

Hmm, I remember that the Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainties in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, right, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So to find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp), I can rearrange the formula. Δp would be approximately ħ/(2Δx). Because we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I think we can take Δp as ħ/(2Δx) since that would give the smallest possible uncertainty in momentum.

But wait, the question asks about energy uncertainty, ΔE. Oh right, I remember that ΔE is related to the uncertainty in momentum through the kinetic energy formula. Because the kinetic energy (K.E.) is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So if there's an uncertainty in p, then there's an uncertainty in K.E. as well.

So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be approximately the derivative of K.E. with respect to p, multiplied by Δp. Or wait, maybe there's a simpler way. Since ΔE is proportional to p², and p is involved quadratically, the uncertainty in energy would be something like (2pΔp)/(2m), but I might be mixing up the formulas here.

Wait, let me think again. Let me write down the relations.

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx).

The kinetic energy is K.E. = p²/(2m). So if p has an uncertainty of Δp, then the uncertainty in K.E., ΔK.E., is (Δp)^2/(2m) * [some factor maybe]. Or perhaps it's the derivative. Let me think about it as a Taylor expansion. The change in energy would be dK.E./dp * Δp.

dK.E./dp is (2p)/(2m) = p/(m). So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, but p is the momentum. Alternatively, since p is the average momentum, maybe it's better to express p in terms of the given velocity. Since v is given, and p = mv, so p = m_e * v.

Wait, but we have Δp, so let me see. Let me calculate Δp first.

Given Δx = 0.1 nm. Wait, 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m.

So Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-10 m) = approximately (1e-34) / (2e-10) = 5e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 1.05e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1.05/2) * 1e-24. 1.05/2 is about 0.525, so 0.525e-24 kg·m/s. Or 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, the mass of the electron, m_e, is about 9.109e-31 kg.

So now, the
