Okay, so I've got this pretty complex chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best to think it through.

The question is about some mixtures and reactions. Hmm. So, let's see what the problem says.

First, there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Wait, decolorizing bromine water usually means that the mixture has compounds that can react with bromine. Like, alkenes or something unsaturated because they can undergo addition reactions with bromine, which would remove the color. So mixture X probably contains alkenes or maybe something else with double bonds.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes some reaction to form an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Oh, so Y doesn't have the same functional groups as X. Since X caused the bromine water to lose color, Y must not have those double bonds anymore. Or maybe Y is a product where the double bonds have been altered in a way that they don't react with bromine anymore.

Wait, but the process uses platinum as a catalyst. Platinum is often used in hydrogenation reactions. Oh, but wait, the mixture X is treated with platinum when heated. Oh, wait, no, wait. The treatment is with platinum when heated. So maybe it's a hydrogenation catalyst, but if X is a mixture of alkenes, hydrogenation would add hydrogen and convert them into alkanes, which are saturated and wouldn't react with bromine. But that would make Y a mixture of alkanes, which explains why Y doesn't decolorize bromine water.

But then the problem says that mixture Y is formed due to a disproportionation. Wait, what's disproportionation? That's when a single species is both oxidized and reduced. Like, for example, in some redox reactions. Oh, wait, but in this case, it's a mixture of two liquids. So maybe X has one compound that undergoes disproportionation into two different products.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each of the two liquids in X can undergo some reaction. Or maybe one of them is undergoing disproportionation, producing two new compounds, hence making Y a mixture of two liquids.

Let me think
