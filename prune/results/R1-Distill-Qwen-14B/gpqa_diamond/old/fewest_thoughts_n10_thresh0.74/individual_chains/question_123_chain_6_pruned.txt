Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, so I don't have to worry about acceleration or anything like that. Oh, and gravity is ignored, so no gravitational pulls messing things up. Also, rotation and revolution are out of the picture, which probably simplifies things a lot.

Alright, so the setup is that the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so if the ejecta is moving at v relative to the Galaxy, then from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving at -v, right? Because in relativity, velocities are frame-dependent. So if someone in the ejecta sees the Galaxy moving towards them at 60,000 km/s, then the ejecta's velocity in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s towards the center.

Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Because when you switch frames, velocities don't just flip signs; you have to use the velocity addition formula. Oh, wait, but wait a second—this question is about how much distance is covered, and it's in the context of classical mechanics because we're not given any relativistic effects like time dilation or length contraction. Oh, wait, no, the problem doesn't specify that it's non-relativistic, so maybe I should be cautious. But looking at the numbers, 60,000 km/s is way higher than the speed of light (which is about 300,000 km/s). Wait, no, wait—60,000 km/s is 0.2c, since 3e5 km/s is the speed of light. Oh, so in that case, relativistic effects might matter, but the problem says to ignore gravity and rotation, so perhaps we can proceed with a classical approach. Or maybe they're expecting a classical solution.

Wait, but the problem gives us the velocity as 60,000 km/s. Let's think: if the ejecta is moving at v
