Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it carefully. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, right. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, and it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The stability constant (K) tells us how stable the complex is. A high K means the complex is more stable, so the reaction tends to go to the product side.

Wait, the problem says it's a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But we want to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

I think this is a solubility problem. The Ca-EDTA complex might not be very soluble, but wait, no, wait. Actually, the complex is already in solution, so we're considering the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. The equilibrium would be:

Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The stability constant K is given by [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [Ca-EDTA]. So K = 5e10.

Wait, wait, but EDTA is a hexadentate ligand. So the formula of the complex is probably CaY²- (where Y is the EDTA^4-). So the complex would dissociate into Ca²+ and Y^4-.

The initial concentration of CaY²- is 0.02 M. Let's let the change be x. So, as the complex dissociates, [Ca²+] = x, [Y^4-] = x, and [CaY²-] = 0.02 - x. But wait, because the complex is stoichiometric, each mole of complex releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA.

But since K is so large (5e10), the dissociation will be very small. So x will be much smaller than 0.02,
