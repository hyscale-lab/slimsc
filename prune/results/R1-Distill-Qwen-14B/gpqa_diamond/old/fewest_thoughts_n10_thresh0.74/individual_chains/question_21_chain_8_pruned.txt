Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice chemistry question. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers have the same molecular formula but different structures. There are two types mentioned here: constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the arrangement of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same arrangement but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A asks which compound does not show tautomerism among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Let me tackle part A first. I need to figure out which of the two compounds doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, leading to different isomers. This usually happens in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism or similar.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. I think benzoquinone can exhibit keto-enol tautomerism because each ketone group can potentially tautomerize. For example, if there's a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl, the molecule can shift into an enol form. So benzoquinone would show tautomerism.

What about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at the 1,3,5 positions. So all three are on the ring. Can this compound undergo tautomerism? Wait, tautomerism typically requires a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl. If all three carbonyls are in 1,3,5 positions, each might have a hydrogen on adjacent carbons. But wait, in a cyclohexane ring with three ketones, each ketone is opposite each other? No, wait, 1,3,5 are every other position, so each is adjacent to two others.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is on a carbon that's next to two other carbons bearing ketones. So each of those carbonyl groups is adjacent to another carbonyl. So for tautomerism, wouldn't you need a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl that's not already in a conjugated system? Or perhaps, in this case, there are no alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are carbonyls. Let me think: the structure would be O=C-C-O-C-C-O, but arranged in a ring. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me visualize cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: the ring has six carbons, each at positions 1, 3, 5 has a ketone group (O=C-O), but wait no, the trione means three ketone groups. So each of those positions is a carbony
