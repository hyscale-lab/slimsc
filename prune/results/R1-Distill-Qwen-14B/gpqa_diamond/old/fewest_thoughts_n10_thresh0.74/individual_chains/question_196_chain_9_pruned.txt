Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has this maximum speed, right? But this is relativistic, so things get a bit more complicated.

The question gives me a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, which is Hooke's law. So it's a simple harmonic oscillator, but under relativistic considerations. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, what's the difference between relativistic and classical here? In classical mechanics, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's the non-relativistic case, which is option C. But the question is about relativistic, so that's not the answer.

Relativity comes into play when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So we probably need to use relativistic equations. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the case of the oscillator, the total energy E is conserved. The total energy in the relativistic case would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. At the maximum displacement (amplitude), all the energy is potential, and at maximum speed, all is kinetic (ignoring potential energy when moving fastest, I think).

Wait, but the potential energy in a relativistic oscillator might not be the same as classical. Oh wait, the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy would be the integral of F dx, which is (1/2)kx², same as classical. But the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement A, the kinetic energy is zero (since it's momentarily at rest), so E = (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc² + mc²? Wait, no. Wait, the total energy E would be mc² (rest energy) plus the potential energy (1/2)kA², since at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so kinetic is just rest energy plus potential.

Wait, maybe not. Because in the classical case, potential is ½kA², and kinetic is ½ mv². So in the relativistic case, the total energy is E = mc² + (γ - 1)mc² = γ mc². But that's when the velocity is maximum. Wait, perhaps I should approach it as:

At the maximum displacement A, all the energy is potential. So E = ½kA² + mc² (rest energy) + kinetic energy. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is ½kA² + ½ mv², but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (γ -1 )mc². So the total energy should
