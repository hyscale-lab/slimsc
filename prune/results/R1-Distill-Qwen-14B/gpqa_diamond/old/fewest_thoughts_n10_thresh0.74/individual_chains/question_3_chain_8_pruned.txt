Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try my best.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, I remember that the expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured the observable many times on systems in the same state.

So, the operator is a combination of σz and σx. I think I can split the expectation value into two parts: one for 10σz and another for 5σx. Because expectation values are linear, right? So, ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

First, I'll tackle ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this might be easier. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So, if the state is a superposition, the expectation value should be the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let's compute the probabilities. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. The probability for |↑⟩ is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The probability for |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2. Let me calculate that: (sqrt(3))^2 is 3, divided by 4, so 3/4 = 0.75. So, the expectation value of σz is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. Oh wait, wait a second, let me double-check that math. 0.25 is 1/4, and 0.75 is 3/4. So, (1/4)(1) + (3/4)(-1) = (1/4 -3/4) = (-2/4) = -0.5. Yep, that's right.

So, the first part, 10⟨σz⟩, would be 10*(-0.5) = -5. Okay, got that part.

Now, onto ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But in our case, the state is expressed in the σz basis, so I need to find the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ in this state.

I think the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is calculated as the sum of the coefficients' products in a certain way. Alternatively, I can remember that for a spin-1/2 particle in state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is 2*(|a|^2 - |b|^2) multiplied by something, wait no, perhaps I should think in terms of the expectation value formula.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for expectation value as ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me write out the state as ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, ψ is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The Pauli X matrix is [[0, 1],[1, 0]]. So, σx multiplied by |ψ⟩ would be a matrix product. Or, perhaps I can compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ directly.

So, let me compute it step by step. First, the state ψ is a column vector:

ψ = [0.5, (sqrt(3)/2)]^T. Then, σx * ψ would be [ (sqrt(3)/2), 0.5 ]^T. Because σx swaps the components. So, σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about it as matrix multiplication. Let me compute σx * ψ.

σx is:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

Multiplying by ψ gives:

First component: 0*(0.5) + 1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2
Second component: 1*(0.5) + 0*(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5

So, σx |ψ⟩ = [ sqrt(3)/2 , 0.5 ]^T.

Now, the inner product ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is ψ† (
