Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. A chemist found a white solid, and I need to figure out what it is based on the spectral data provided. Hmm, let's go through each clue step by step.

First, the mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's also a peak at m/z 158 with 32%. I remember that molecular ion peaks can sometimes indicate the molecular formula or help determine the structure. The molecular weight is 156 g/mol. The other peak at 158 might be due to something like a chlorine isotope, because chlorine has isotopes. Chlorine-35 is more common, but Cl-37 would add 2 mass units. So, if the molecule has a chlorine atom, the molecular ion would show a peak at both 156 and 158. Let me calculate: if the molecular weight is 156, and the Cl is causing the isotopic peak, so the molecular formula might have one Cl. So the molecular formula could be C8H5ClO2 or something like that. Wait, let me think: 156 minus the Cl (35.5) would be about 120.5. Hmm, but perhaps I should think in terms of exact masses. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2? Wait, let's calculate the molecular weight of each option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's see, benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Chlorine adds 35.5, hydroxy adds 17 (OH). So formula would be C7H5ClO2? Wait, let's count: benzaldehyde is C7H6O, but 3-chloro-2-hydroxy would replace two H's. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: (7*12) + (5*1) +35.5 + (16*2) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, perhaps I'm not counting correctly. Oh wait, maybe it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me compute: 12*7=84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. So total is 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156, so maybe the molecular formula is C8H5ClO2? Or perhaps the formula includes more oxygens.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl would make it C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight calculation: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5, and 2*16=32. 84+5=89+35.5=124.5+32=156.5. Again, that's 156.5, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, but maybe the molecular ion is actually 156, which would be the exact mass? I'm a bit confused about exact mass vs nominal mass here. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the molecular formula must sum to 156, considering the Cl is 35.5
