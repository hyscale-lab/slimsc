Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that an electron is traveling along the x-direction with a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. They ask for the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE. The options are given in different orders of magnitude, so I think I need to calculate it and see which option it matches.

I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, I'm trying to find the uncertainty in energy, not momentum. Hmm, how does that tie in?

Oh, right! The Uncertainty in Energy relates to the uncertainty in momentum because the kinetic energy of a particle depends on its momentum. So I think I should first find the uncertainty in momentum, then use that to find the uncertainty in energy.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
2. Use the momentum to find the kinetic energy uncertainty (ΔE).

Wait, but how exactly? Let me think. The Heisenberg principle gives Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Since Δx is given, I can calculate Δp.

So, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Let me write down the formula:

Δp ≈ ħ / (2Δx)

Plugging in the numbers:

Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters. So,

Δp ≈ (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 0.1e-9 m) )

Let me compute that denominator first: 2 * 0.1e-9 = 0.2e-9 = 2e-10.

So,

Δp ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-10) = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-24 = approximately
