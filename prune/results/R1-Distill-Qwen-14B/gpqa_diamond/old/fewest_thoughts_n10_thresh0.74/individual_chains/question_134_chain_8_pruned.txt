Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value is around -57 kJ per mole of H+ or OH- ions involved, but I'm not entirely sure if that's always the case. Oh wait, but in this case, since we're mixing three solutions, I guess I need to find out the moles of H+ and OH- ions and see which one is the limiting reagent.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let's break down each one.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Its concentration is 0.2 M, and the volume is 500 mL. Moles of HCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So that's 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is HCl â†’ H+ + Cl^-, each mole gives one mole of H+. So 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

Next, H2SO4 is also an acid, and it's a strong acid as well. But wait, it's a diprotic acid, right? So each mole can donate two H+ ions. The concentration is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So the OH- concentration is 2 per mole of Ba(OH)2. The volume is 200 mL, concentration 0.5 M. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.
