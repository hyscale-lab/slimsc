Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, okay. I need to go through each reaction step and see what's happening each time.

First step: treatment with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used for deprotonating things. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So probably an alkylation reaction.

The starting molecule has a cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is like a vinyl group attached (CH2-C(CH2)). Wait, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)-? No, wait. Let me think. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait. The structure is CH2=C(CH2) but wait, that can't be. Wait, no. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl: so the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2)-, but wait, that doesn't make sense because of the double bond. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(CH2)-. No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-? No, because the substituent is on C2. So the structure would be CH2=C(CH2)-, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe it's CH2=C-CH2? No, wait. Oh, perhaps I should draw it. Prop-1-en-2-yl is actually CH2=C(CH2) group? Wait, no, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh wait, wait, no. The correct structure is CH₂=C-CH₂, but the substituent is on C2. So prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH₂-C(CH₂)=? Or maybe it's CH₂=C-CH₂ with the substituent on C2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the substituents.

The starting molecule: cyclohexanone with a hydroxymethyl at C3 and a prop-1-en-2-yl at C5. So the positions are 3 and 5 on the cyclohexane ring. The hydroxymethyl is -CH2-OH, and the prop-1-en-2-yl is probably a substituent like CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Or maybe it's a vinyl group attached as CH2-C=CH2. Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH₂-CH(CH₂)- but with
