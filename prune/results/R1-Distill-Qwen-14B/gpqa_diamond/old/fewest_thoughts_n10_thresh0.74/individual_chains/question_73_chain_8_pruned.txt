Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's think. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to remember the formulas.

The problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, I remember there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically. The formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). But wait, which one is moving from the perspective of the other? Let me think. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference divided by the denominator.

Let me assign the velocities correctly. Let's say astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, and astronaut B has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's B's speed? Or wait, actually, the relative speed would be the speed of B as seen from A's frame, right?

So, using the velocity addition formula: u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Here, u is the velocity of B in the lab frame (0.5c), and v is the velocity of A (0.6c). Wait no, wait. Wait, actually, if I'm in A's frame, I want to find the speed of B. So, the formula is (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/c² ) = u, where u is the velocity in the lab frame. Wait, maybe I got it backward. Let me think again.

The correct formula for relative velocity is u_relative = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, no, actually, that's when you have two velocities in the same direction. Wait, no, I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Let
