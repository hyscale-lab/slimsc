Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem talks about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A, for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix called Ay. The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction.

The matrix operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row being (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). 

The question is asking which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. There are four options to choose from: A, B, C, D.

First, I think I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix Ay. Let me start by writing down the matrix.

So, S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Then, Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * S. So multiplying each element by (h/(4π)), we get:

Ay = [ 0, -(h/(4π))i ]
        [ (h/(4π))i, 0 ]

Wait, actually, wait. Let me compute that correctly. If c is h/(4π), then each element of S is multiplied by c. So the first row of S is 0, -i. So Ay's first row is (0, -i * c). Second row is (i * c, 0). So:

Ay = [ 0      -i*(h/(4π)) ]
        [ i*(h/(4π))    0 ]

Which can also be written as (h/(4π)) times the Pauli Y matrix, which is where the Y comes from. The Pauli matrices are well-known, and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors are standard.

Wait, the Pauli matrices. The Pauli Y matrix is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So that's exactly what S is. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * Y, where Y is the Pauli Y matrix. 

Now, the eigenvalues of the Pauli Y matrix are known. I recall that the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±i, but let me double-check. For a 2x2 matrix like Y, the eigenvalues λ are found by solving det(Y - λ I) = 0.

The Pauli Y matrix is:

[ -λ   -i ]
[ i    -λ ]

Wait, no. Let me write the matrix Y as:

Y = [ 0   -i ]
        [ i    0 ]

So, Y - λ I = [ -λ   -i ]
                 [ i    -λ ]

The determinant is ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - ( (-i)(i) ) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) )

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1.
