Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about titrating acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Wait, I need to figure out the pH at two points: 25% of the way to the equivalence point and at the equivalence point itself. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I think I should find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point. Because, the equivalence point is where the moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid.

So, initially, the volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume in liters. So, 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters.

When we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). But wait, the moles of acetic acid don't change upon dilution; only the concentration changes. So, after dilution, the concentration becomes 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. But maybe I don't need that for the equivalence point calculation.

For equivalence point in a titration between a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), the moles of NaOH needed are equal to the moles of acetic acid. So, moles of NaOH = 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. To find the volume needed: moles / concentration = volume (in liters). So, 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So, the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, I need to find the pH at two points: after adding 2.5 cm³ (which is 25% titration) and at the equivalence point (10 cm³ NaOH added).

Let me handle each case separately.

First, the 25% titration point.

At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Since each
