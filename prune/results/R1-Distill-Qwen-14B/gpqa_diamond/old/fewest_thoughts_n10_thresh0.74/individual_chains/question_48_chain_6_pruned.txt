Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down. So, the question involves several reactions starting from cyclohexanone and ending with product 4. The main goal is to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4.

First, let me list out the reactions:

1. Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1.
2. Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form product 2.
3. Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine to form product 3.
4. Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(LiAlH3)) to form product 4.

I need to figure out what each product looks like after each reaction.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2.

Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When ketones react with bromine, I think it's usually an addition reaction. But wait, in the presence of Br2, especially under certain conditions, it might undergo a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation, but that's for alkenes. Hmm. Wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond, so dihydroxylation isn't possible. Oh wait, maybe it's an enolate formation or some kind of addition.

Wait, another possibility: the alpha position. Cyclohexanone has alpha carbons (the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl). Bromine can add to the carbonyl, but in ketones, bromine can add via the Baeyer-Villiger reaction? Or perhaps it's an electrophilic addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromohydrin formation. Wait, but that's when water is present. Hmm.

Wait, I think another possibility is that bromine adds to the carbonyl, but in a cyclic ketone, perhaps it's a bromination via the enolate. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: adding bromine to a ketone. Oh wait, bromine can add to the carbonyl group in a ketone via a conjugate addition if the conditions are right. No, actually, I think cyc
