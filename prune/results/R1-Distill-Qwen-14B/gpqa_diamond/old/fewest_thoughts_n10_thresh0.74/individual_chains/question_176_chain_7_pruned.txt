Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in a certain order, and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes: 0 for P and -1 for Q.

First, I remember that when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator. The probability of each outcome depends on the state vector and the eigenvectors of the operator.

The state of the system is given as a column matrix: (-1, 2, 1). I think that's a vector in three-dimensional space, so maybe it's in a three-level system or something like that.

The operator for P is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out to visualize better:

P =
[ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
  [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
  [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]

Hmm, the operator for Q is:

Q =
[ [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -1] ]

Wait, so Q is a diagonal matrix. That makes things easier because its eigenvalues are just the diagonal elements. So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, and -1. But in the question, we're looking for when Q is measured and the result is -1. So we're concerned with the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue -1 for Q.

But wait, the question is about measuring P first and then Q. Oh wait, no, the question says measuring Q just after P, so the order is first P, then Q. But wait, no, the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. Oh, wait, the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the measurements are done in the order P first, then Q.

Wait, but actually, no. The order is that P is measured first, and then Q. So the process is: measure P, then measure Q. So the first step is to find the possible results of P, then see, for each possible outcome of P, the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector of P, and then from there, measure Q.

But wait, the problem is asking for the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and then -1 when measuring Q. So the joint probability of P=0 and Q=-1.

But wait, when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses into the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, when we measure Q on that state, what's the probability of getting -1?

Alternatively, perhaps the state after measuring P=0 is an eigenstate of P, so when you measure Q, you just calculate the inner product between that state and the eigenvectors of Q.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

First, to find the probability that P is measured to be 0 and then Q is measured to be -1.

So, the steps are:

1. Find all possible eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P.

2. For each eigenvalue of P, determine the probability that measuring P yields that value.

3. For each such eigenvalue, if the outcome is 0, then the system's state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.

4. Then, using that new state, calculate the probability of measuring -1 for Q.

5. Multiply the probability of P=0 by the conditional probability of Q=-1 given P=0, and sum over all possibilities. But since in this case, the only relevant case is when P=0, the total probability is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given that P=0.

Wait, but the state after measuring P=0 is the eigenvector of P, which is an eigenstate of P. Then, when measuring Q, the state is that
