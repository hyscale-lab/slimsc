Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance.

Wait, so if plx is 1/d, then d must be 1/plx. So substituting that into the equation for N, we have N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me see, that's the same as 1 divided by (1/d)^5, which is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

But the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh wait, so it's about the differential, like how many stars are there per a small change in distance, dr. So I think I need to find dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to d.

Since N ∝ d^5, let's say N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. Taking the derivative, dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to d^4. 

Wait, but the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the
