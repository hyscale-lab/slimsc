Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully and break it down.

So, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues come from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different formulas: C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2. The answer choices are labeled A to D.

First, let's think about the FTIR part. The IR shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have characteristic absorption bands, especially a strong peak around 1740 cm^-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So this compound must have an ester functional group.

Now onto the 1H NMR spectrum. It shows six signals. Let's list them:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons could be in different environments, so maybe para or ortho substitution. But wait, if it's di-substituted, the aromatic region would have specific patterns. Wait, but wait, the compound is a six-membered aromatic ring, which is likely benzene. So di-substituted benzene. The number of aromatic signals depends on substitution. For example, para substitution would give two sets of equivalent protons, so two signals. So two aromatic signals make sense for para substitution perhaps.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are attached to double bonds, like in alkenes or aromatic rings. So maybe there's an ethenyl group (CH2=CH-) attached somewhere. Or perhaps it's part of the substituent on the benzene ring.

3. Two signals corresponding to -CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups. Each might be connected to different parts of the molecule, maybe as substituents or part of an ester.

Also, there are no signals for -CH2 groups. So the molecule doesn't have any methylene (CH2) groups. That's an important clue.

Let me try to imagine the structure. Since it's a di-substituted benzene with an ester group, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, an ester is more like R-O-CO-R'. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, like an aryl ester or an alkyl ester.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl-H. So maybe there's a vinyl group attached to the benzene ring. For example, if one substituent is a vinyl group and the other is an ester? Or perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group that includes a vinyl.

Wait, the ester group would typically be something like R-O-CO-R''. So if the benzene has an ester substituent, perhaps that's one substituent, and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of another substituent, like a methacrylate group or something similar.

But let me think about the NMR data again. The NMR shows six signals in total.

Breaking it down:

Aromatic-H: two signals. So likely para-substituted, giving two sets of H. Or perhaps it's ortho, but that would lead to more complex splitting, but the count is two. Wait, for a para-substituted benzene, the substituents are opposite each other, leading to two equivalent sets of aromatic H. So in that case, the aromatic region would have two signals, each integrating for two H each (since the ring is symmetrical). So that would account for 4 H in total (2 signals x 2 H each), but benzene has 6 H. Wait, no, wait. No, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents would have four H in total. Wait, no, if it's di-substituted
