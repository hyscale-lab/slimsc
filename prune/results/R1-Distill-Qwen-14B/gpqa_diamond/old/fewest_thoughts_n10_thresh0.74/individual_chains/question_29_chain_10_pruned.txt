Okay, so I've got this genetics question about barley mutants and anti-nutritional compounds. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has this bad compound that makes it unusable for food. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the target gene in each.

The question is, which mutation will eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, I think this means the gene's product (probably a protein) is responsible for making the compound. If we can disrupt the gene's function, the compound won't be made. So, we need a mutation that stops the gene from being expressed or changes the protein so it doesn't work.

Looking at the sequences, the wild type is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

And the mutants have changes in the first exon area. So, first exon is the beginning part of the gene. Exons are coding regions, so any mutation here potentially affects the protein.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild type: The first part is ATGTTT vs ATGTTCTA. Wait, let me check each position.

Wild: ATGTTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCT ACG GCT GGT ACT TCT G...

Wait, maybe I should look for where the changes occur. Let's see, the first few bases.

Wild starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, the wild type has 'TTTCTCGC' in the first part. Mutant 1 has 'TTCTACGC'.

Wait, the first part is ATG TTT CT C GCT GGT... So, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant 1's sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, the first few nucleotides after ATG are TTT in wild, and TCT in mutant1. Let me count:

Wild: positions 4-6: TTT
Mutant1: positions 4-6: TCT

Wait, that's a substitution. So, the third base in the third codon changes from T to C.

So, the wild type codon is TTT, which is phenylalanine. Mutant1 changes it to TCT, which is serine. So, a missense mutation.
