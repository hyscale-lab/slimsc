Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break down what each part is saying.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, is heated to 200°C without air. So, heating in the absence of air probably means it's a decomposition reaction, maybe something involving thermal decomposition of the salts.

When they heat the salts, only a mixture of gases is formed. Then, this gas mixture is passed through several tubes. Let me list what each tube does.

Tube 1 has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is used as a drying agent, especially for absorbing moisture. So any water vapor in the gas would be absorbed here. The weight of tube 1 increased by 3.60 grams. So that suggests that 3.60 grams of water were absorbed. So, the gas mixture must have contained some water vapor.

Tube 2 is a Ca(OH)2 solution. If gas passes through a solution of calcium hydroxide, it could react with CO2, for example. But in this case, the weight of tube 2 didn't change. So no reaction happened here. That probably means there was no CO2 in the gas mixture, because if there were, Ca(OH)2 would absorb it, and the tube would gain weight.

Tube 3 has red-hot copper. I think when gases pass over hot copper, CO2 might be formed if there was some carbon monoxide (CO) present. Because CO would react with Cu at high temperatures to form CO2 and Cu. But the tube's weight increased by 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed. So the increase is from the CuO produced. Let me calculate the moles of CuO here.

The formula for CuO is CuO, so the molar mass is 64 + 16 = 80 g/mol. 0.80 grams of CuO would be 0.80 / 80 = 0.01 moles. So 0.01 moles of CuO. That implies that 0.01 moles of O2 were added, but wait, no. Alternatively, each mole of CuO requires one mole of O. So since it's formed from CO, each mole of CO would produce one mole of CuO. Because the reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. Wait, no, let me think again. The reaction when CO passes over hot Cu (like in the presence of air or oxygen?), but the problem says the setup was without air, so maybe it's a different scenario. Hmm, perhaps when CO passes over hot Cu, it's oxidized to CO2. But in that case, the Cu would react with CO to form CuO and CO2. Wait, the reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO(s) + CO2. So for every 2 moles of CO, you get 1 mole of CuO and 1 mole of CO2. So if 0.01 moles of CuO formed, that suggests 0.02 moles of CO passed through. Because for every mole of CuO, 2 moles of CO reacted. So 0.01 moles CuO comes from 0.02 moles CO.

Wait no, no. Let's get the stoichiometry right. The balanced equation is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So 2 moles CO produce 1 mole CuO. So moles of CO would be twice the moles of CuO. So 0.01 moles CuO → 0.02 moles CO. So that's 0.02 moles CO in the gas.

Now, after all that, only 2.24 liters of gas C
