Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and these are ultra-relativistic with a Lorentz factor of about 20. Oh wait, and on average, one third of them reach the inner walls. Now, the question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of them reach the walls?

So, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma relates to time dilation and length contraction. The key here is probably how much time the particles have before they decay and whether they can reach the detector walls within that time.

The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The particles are produced at the center, so the distance they need to travel is 30 meters to the inner wall. Oh wait, no, the detector is spherical, so the inner wall is 30 meters away from the center in all directions. So the distance is 30 m.

The particles are moving at a high Lorentz factor. The lifetime of the particles is important here. I think the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But from our lab frame, due to time dilation, the lifetime is longer. The lifetime is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.

So, the time available for the particle to reach the detector wall is the distance divided by its speed. Oh wait, but at ultra-relativistic speeds, the speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So, time t = distance / speed ≈ 30 m / (c). Let me calculate that. The speed of light is about 3e8 meters per second. So 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds. That's 0.1 nanoseconds, right?

But wait, the speed is relativistic, so maybe it's better to think in terms of gamma. Oh right, because the particles' lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime. So, the proper lifetime is tau, and the lab lifetime is gamma * tau.

So, the condition is that the particle must reach the detector wall before it decays. That is, the time it takes to travel 30 meters (t = 30/(gamma c)) must be less than or equal to the lifetime (gamma tau). Wait, wait, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, particles are moving at speed v ≈ c. The time they have in the lab frame is the distance divided by their speed. So the time is t = (30 m) / (v). But v is approximately c, so t ≈ 30/(c) seconds.

But in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau (tau is proper lifetime). So for the particle to reach the detector, t must be less than or equal to gamma tau.

Wait, no. Because the particle only moves for a time t in the lab frame before it decays. So, for the particle to reach the wall, the time it takes to reach the wall must be less than its lifetime.

So, t = 30 / (v) < gamma * tau.
