Okay, so I've got this question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Alright, the setup is that there's a charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point. The velocity at the generating time is v.

Wait, so the charge emits fields at time tr, and we're looking at the potentials at time t, where t > tr. So the potentials are due to the charge's position and velocity at tr, but we observe them at a later time.

I remember that in electrodynamics, the scalar potential and vector potential for a point charge can be expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time. Oh right, the retarded time concept.

The scalar potential V is usually something like q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance between the charge and the observation point at the retarded time. But wait, in this case, the charge is moving, so the distance isn't just static. Oh, right, it's the distance at the time when the field was emitted, which is tr.

Wait, but the vector potential A comes into play for the magnetic field part. I think A is related to the velocity of the charge. The formula for A involves the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, right?

The general expressions for the potentials are:

V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance at the retarded time.

And for the vector potential A, it's something like (μ₀/(4π)) times (q v̂) / c² times the same denominator as V, maybe.

Wait, I need to get the exact formulas right. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) times (v̂ / (c²)) divided by (r')? Or is it (v)/(c² r')?

Wait, more accurately, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) * (q v)/(c²) multiplied by (1/r'), but considering the direction. Let me think: The direction of A should be along the
