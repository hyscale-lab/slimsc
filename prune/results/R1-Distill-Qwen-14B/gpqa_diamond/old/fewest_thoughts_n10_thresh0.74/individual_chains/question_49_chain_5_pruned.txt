Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question has three different reactions, each producing a product A, B, or C. I need to figure out which option correctly lists all three products.

First, let's recall what sigmatropic rearrangements are. They involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. Examples include the Cope and Claisen rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermally induced and can form rings or change the structure of molecules.

Looking at the first reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) → A

Hmm, the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like an ethanamine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. But but-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol—specifically, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol would actually be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would have four carbons, so positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps it's (Z)- or (E)-but-3-en-2-ol. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, but that can't be right because but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C2 and C3.
