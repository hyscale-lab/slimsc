Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that the energy levels for a single particle in such a well are quantized. The formula I think is something like E_n = (n² * pi² * ħ²) / (2mL²), right? And the question gives E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each particle's energy is n² times E. Oh wait, so for a single particle, the energy levels are E, 4E, 9E, 16E, and so on because n starts at 1.

But wait, the question involves four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh right, identical particles obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two identical fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. Since they're spin-1/2, which is a fermion, each can have a unique set of quantum states.

In a 1D infinite well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n. But wait, each particle also has a spin quantum number which can be +1/2 or -1/2. So maybe each state is described by (n, s), where s is the spin. That means for each n, there are two possible states: one for each spin.

So for four particles, how do we arrange them? The ground state would be the lowest energy possible, which is the state with the lowest n's filled up as much as possible with different spins. Let's think.

In the ground state, the lowest
