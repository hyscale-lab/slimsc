Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the spin state given is (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's a two-component vector. So I should represent it as a column vector: [3i; 4]. Or maybe in some sources, it's written as a row vector, but I'm more familiar with column vectors when dealing with matrix operations.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula <S_y> = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, where ψ is the state vector. Oh right, and S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction.

Wait, but what's the expression for S_y? Oh, in the note, they give σ_y, the Pauli matrix for y. The Pauli matrices are related to the spin operators. I remember that S = (ħ/2) σ for each component. So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y.

So σ_y is the matrix:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So putting it together, S_y is (ħ/2) times that matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, the state vector ψ is [3i; 4]. To compute the expectation value, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ.

Wait, let me write that out. The expectation value is ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ.

So first, let's compute ψ†. The state vector ψ is [3i, 4]^T, so the conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -3 (because (3i)* is -3i?), wait wait, let's double-check. Hmm, the components are 3i and 4. So the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 is 4. So ψ† would be a row vector: [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The original vector is (3i,4). So ψ is a column vector with first element 3i
