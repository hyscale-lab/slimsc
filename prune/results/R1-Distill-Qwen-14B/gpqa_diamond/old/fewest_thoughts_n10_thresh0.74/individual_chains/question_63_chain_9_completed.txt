Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule's transition between energy states. Hmm, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, right? So it's a non-rigid rotor. Wait, but I think the non-rigid rotor is a bit different, but maybe for this question, it's treated as a rigid rotor for the rotational part and a quantum harmonic oscillator for the vibrational part?

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the ground state would have the lowest energy, so maybe both the rotational and vibrational modes are in their lowest states. But wait, the question is about absorbing a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what's the next state after the fundamental? Probably the next higher state, but which transition would that be—rotational or vibrational?

Wait, the molecule is modeled with rotation and vibration. So in the quantum mechanical model, each state is a combination of vibrational and rotational levels. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, which is n=0 for vibration, and the lowest rotational state, probably J=0 for rotation. But wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational state J starts at 0, and the vibrational state starts at 0 as well. So the ground state is (n=0, J=0). But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For the harmonic oscillator, E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w.

So the molecule is in the ground state. When it absorbs a photon, it will transition to the next higher energy state. Now, the next state could be either a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1) or a combination. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy—so which transition requires less energy?

I think the vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than rotational ones. Because the vibrational energy levels have spacing of h w, while the rotational spacing is on the order of B, which is probably much smaller. So the photon needed for a vibrational transition would have higher energy than a rotational one. But wait, if the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, J=0), the next possible transition would be to n=1 (vibrational excitation) or J=1 (rotational excitation). Which requires a smaller photon energy?

Wait, the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w. The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 for rotation is E_rot = B (1)(2) - B (0)(1) = 2B. So, if 2B is less than h w, then the rotational transition requires less energy. But wait, what's the typical relation between B and w?

B is the rotational constant, which is (ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. And the vibrational frequency w is related to the force constant and reduced mass. But I think that for a diatomic, the rotational energy spacing (like B) is much smaller than the vibrational spacing. So the rotational transition would require a lower energy photon.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule would preferentially transition to the state with the least energy increase. So if a rotational transition requires a lower energy photon, that's the next state.

But wait, the molecule is a diatomic, so when it's in the ground state (n=0, J=0), the next possible state could be (n=0, J=1) or (n=1, J=0), depending on which requires lower photon energy.

So calculate the energy differences for both transitions and see which is smaller.

First, compute the vibrational energy difference:

ΔE_vib = h w (for n=0 to n=1, since each vibrational step is a quantum of energy h w).

Then, compute the rotational energy difference for J=0 to J=1:

E_rot = B J (J+1), so the difference between J=1 and J=0 is E_rot = B * (1)(2) = 2B.

So the photon energy must match either 2B or h w, whichever is smaller.

But to find B, I need the moment of inertia I. I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

The given masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 amu.

Wait, 20 amu and 2 amu. So Mx is 20, My is 2. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 20/11 is about 1.818, so 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ (let's see) 1.818 * 1.66 is about 3.02, so around 3.02e-27 kg.

The bond length r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ r² = (3.02e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 12.08e-47 kg m² ≈ 1.208e-46 kg m².

Now B is ħ²/(2I). Planck's constant ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) 

Calculate numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.208e-46 = 2.416e-46.

So B ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.605e-23 J.

Wait, no wait, units. B has units of J, but actually, B is in terms of energy per rotational level. So each rotational level is E_rot = B J (J+1), which gives energy in Joules.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the energy difference 2B and compare it to h w.

h w is Planck's constant times angular frequency. w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So h w = (6.626e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 2.65e-19 J.

Now compute 2B:

2 * 4.605e-23 J = 9.21e-23 J.

Compare 9.21e-23 J (rotational) vs. 2.65e-19 J (vibrational).

Which is smaller? 9.21e-23 is much smaller than 2.65e-19. So the rotational transition requires a lower energy photon. So the molecule would transition to (n=0, J=1) state with the photon energy being 2B.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the "fundamental state". I thought that referred to the ground state, but perhaps the fundamental state refers to the first excited state? No, no, the ground state is the fundamental state. So to go to the next state with the lowest possible energy, that would be the next higher state with the least energy. So in this case, the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon must have energy 2B. So the photon's energy is E_photon = 2B.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. Momentum p of a photon is E/c, since E = pc for photons.

Wait, no, wait again. For a photon, E = h f = hc / λ, and p = E/c = h f / c. Alternatively, since f = w/(2π), p = (h w)/(2π c).

Wait, but the energy of the photon is E = h w_phot, where w_phot is the angular frequency of the photon. Then, p_phot = E/c = (h w_phot) / c.

Alternatively, since E_photon = 2B, then p_phot = (2B) / c.

Wait, but what's B again?

Earlier, I found B to be about 4.605e-23 J. So 2B is about 9.21e-23 J.

So p_phot = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the numbers are around 1e-27 to 2e-27. So my calculation is way off. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of B. Because if B is as large as 4.6e-23 J, then 2B is 9e-23 J, which is much higher than the options given. So perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the moment of inertia. Let me recalculate that.

μ is (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) ) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = (20/22) * (20 + 2) is not right. Wait, no, the reduced mass is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.02 (since 1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988, and 0.018 *1.66 is 0.02988, so total about 3.01788). So μ ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ r² = (3.02e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Now B = ħ²/(2I). ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46).

Calculate numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 2 * 1.208e-46 = 2.416e-46.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.605e-23 J.

Wait, that's what I got before. So 2B is 9.21e-23 J.

h w is (6.626e-34 J s)(4e14 rad/s) = 2.65e-19 J.

So 2B is way smaller than h w, so the photon energy is 9.21e-23 J.

But the options are on the order of 1e-27 Ns, which is about 1e-27 kg m/s. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe the transition isn't a pure rotational or pure vibrational transition, but a combination. Or perhaps, the question is only considering the rotational part.

Wait, the question says the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor. Wait, but the non-rigid rotor model (also known as the rotation-vibration model) usually considers the vibrational energy as part of the rotational energy levels. Hmm, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering both effects, but for the transition, the photon must account for both possible changes.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the (n=0, J=0) state, and the next state is (n=0, J=1), which requires a photon with energy equal to the rotational transition, 2B. Alternatively, the next state could be (n=1, J=0), which would require a photon of energy h w.

But since 2B is much less than h w, the photon with energy 2B is the one needed. So the photon's momentum is p = E_photon / c.

E_photon = 2B = 9.21e-23 J.

p = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all around 1e-27 kg m/s, which is much larger than this. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground vibrational state but the lowest rotational state (n=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be (n=0, J=1) or (n=1, J=0). But in that case, the photon's energy must match the difference. So:

The energy difference for rotation is 2B.

The energy difference for vibration is h w.

Which one is lower? If 2B < h w, then the photon must have energy 2B.

But wait, let's compute 2B and h w numerically.

h w is 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

2B is 9.21e-23 J.

So 2B is much smaller than h w. So the photon energy is 9.21e-23 J.

But how does this translate into momentum p_photon?

p_photon = E_photon / c.

So 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But that's way smaller than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule's transition from its ground state (vibrational n=0, rotational J=0) to the next possible state, which could involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But I think the allowed transitions are usually either vibrational or rotational, not both. Unless it's a combination band, but that's more advanced and probably not intended here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition because the rotational states are much closer in energy, and the next state is the first vibrational excited state. But wait, in that case, the photon's energy would be h w. So p_photon = h w / c.

h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But none of the options have that value. Wait, looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Hmm, 8.8e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, but the energy is not 2B but another value.

Wait, I think perhaps I should recompute B correctly.

Wait, wait. Let me recompute B.

B is the rotational constant: B = (h/(8π² c I)) * something? Wait, no, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So B is ħ²/(2I).

I think I did that correctly earlier.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in units? Let me check.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is μ r².

μ is in kg, r in meters. So I is in kg m².

So I = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Then, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.112e-68) / (2 *1.208e-46) = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.605e-23 J.

So that's correct.

Hmm, but I'm getting a p_photon of about 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I should consider that the question is asking for the photon's energy to cause a transition to the next state, which is the first vibrational state. So the photon's energy is h w.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule is in the (n=0, J=0) state and wants to go to (n=0, J=1), which would require 2B energy. But then the momentum is 9.21e-23 J /3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s. None of the options are close.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass.

Wait, the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = (40)/(22) = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

20 * 2 =40, 40/22= 1.81818... amu.

Now, μ in kg is 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu.

Let me compute 1.81818 * 1.6605:

1.818 * 1.6605 = let's compute it step by step.

1.6 *1.6605 = 2.6568.

0.2 *1.6605 = 0.3321.

0.018 *1.6605 = 0.029889.

Adding up: 2.6568 + 0.3321 = 2.9889 + 0.029889≈3.0188.

So μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

So I=μ r² =3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.0188e-27 * 4e-20= 1.2075e-46 kg m².

So same as before. So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the vibration-rotation coupling, so the energy transition includes both. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy required for the first possible transition, which may be the rotational.

But then, the photon's momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't any option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question isn't about the transition within the rotation-vibration model, but just about the vibrational part. So the molecule is in n=0 (vibrational ground state), and the photon's energy is h w, so p = h w / c.

Let me compute that.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14= 2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon= E/c = 2.6504e-19 J /3e8 m/s =8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28. Option D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, wait, perhaps the model expects the rotational energy to be considered. Maybe the question is in the rigid rotor model, but perhaps I'm supposed to find the momentum of the photon that causes a transition to the next vibrational state, not the rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition, so the photon's energy is h w, and the momentum is h w / c.

But in that case, the calculated p is about 8.8e-28, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is intended to compute the angular momentum, but no, the question is about linear momentum.

Hmm, perhaps I should recompute using the given numbers:

Wait, the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg m/s. So the options are in kg m/s.

But according to my previous calculation, if the photon's energy is 2B=9.21e-23 J, then p=3.07e-31 kg m/s. But that's way smaller than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the first vibrational excited state (n=1) which requires energy h w.

p_photon= h w / c = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/(3e8) = (2.6504e-19)/(3e8)= approx 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is about 8.8e-28, but that's not one of the options.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28), but it's about half. Did I miscalculate something?

Wait, let me recompute h w / c.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

c=3e8 m/s.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, so none of the options match that. So perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next rotational state.

Wait, let me compute 2B again. 2B=9.21e-23 J.

p=9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But that's way smaller than any options. So perhaps I must have an error in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for B. Let me double-check.

The rotational constant B is given by:

B = (h/(8 π² I)).

Wait, no. The energy levels are E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1), so B here is ħ²/(2I).

Wait, wait, another possible formula for B is (h^2)/(8 π² I). Since ħ is h/(2 π), so ħ² = h²/(4 π²). So B= (h²/(4 π²)) / (2I) )= h²/(8 π² I).

So B = h²/(8 π² I).

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute using this formula.

So B = h²/(8 π² I).

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is approx (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

I is 1.208e-46 kg m².

So 8 π² I = 8 * (9.8696) * 1.208e-46 ≈ 8 *9.8696=78.9568; 78.9568 *1.208e-46 = 95.44e-46 = 9.544e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 / 9.544e-45 = (4.39/9.544) e^(-67+45) = approx 0.46e-22 =4.6e-23 J.

Which matches my previous calculation. So B is indeed 4.6e-23 J.

Hmm, so I'm confident that the calculation of B is correct.

So, the photon's momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't in the options. So what's going on?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next energy state, regardless of whether it's rotation or vibration. The next state would be the one with the lowest energy possible. The vibrational transition requires more energy, so the rotational transition is the one to take.

But the photon's momentum in that case is 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of the photon's energy being the vibrational energy, which gives a larger p than the rotational case.

Wait, but that's not matching the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor and not including the vibrational part. So the transition is purely rotational.

But then the energy would be 2B=9.21e-23 J.

p=3.07e-31 kg m/s. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which could be (n=1, J=0), which requires energy h w.

So p_photon = (h w)/c.

Which is 8.83e-28 kg m/s. Not in the options.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass or bond length.

Wait, bond length is given as 2 angstroms. That's 2e-10 meters.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in calculating the moment of inertia. Let me recheck.

μ is 20 amu and 2 amu.

Ah! Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for μ. Because Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Which is (approx) 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.0178e-27 kg.

r is 2e-10 m. So I = μ r² = 3.0178e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.0178e-27 *4e-20 =1.2071e-46 kg m².

B = h^2/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2/(8 π^2 *1.2071e-46).

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 * π² =78.9568; 78.9568 * 1.2071e-46 ≈ 95.3e-46.

So B=4.39e-67 /95.3e-46 =4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 = approx (4.39/9.53) *1e-22 ≈0.46 *1e-22=4.6e-23 J.

Same as before. So B is 4.6e-23 J.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, which requires 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J. So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J. So p_photon = E/c = (9.2e-23 J)/(3e8 m/s) =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model? Or perhaps the question is about the photon's angular momentum.

Wait, the question is about linear momentum. So perhaps I'm missing a factor, like considering the photon's energy as the sum of rotational and vibrational, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state (n=1, J=0), which would require energy h w, and that's the correct approach. But then the photon's momentum is 8.8e-28 kg m/s, which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute h w /c.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, that's 8.8e-28. The options are:

A)1.9e-28.

B)2.3e-27.

C)1.1e-27.

D)1.4e-28.

So 8.8e-28 is not present. So perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next rotational state, which would be 2B, but then the momentum is 3e-31. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational transition is not allowed in this model? Or maybe the question is about the vibrational transition, but it's considering the photon's energy as h w, which is correct, but the options don't match.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition, leading to a photon with p=8.8e-28 kg m/s. But since none of the options match, perhaps the question is intended to compute the rotational transition, but the numbers don't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the photon's energy equal to the vibrational energy, but the options are computed with a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the model. The question says the molecule is a diatomic modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor. In that model, the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration. So the energy levels are not just simple sums, but perhaps more complex.

But I'm not exactly sure how that would affect the transition. Perhaps the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state (which is a combination of n=1 and J=0) would be h w plus the rotational energy difference. But that seems more complicated, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to compute the momentum of the photon using the photon's energy as the vibrational energy, but the options don't match. So perhaps the intended correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w. Let me compute it again.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p_photon=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm. So this is 8.8e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a factor of 4.6 less than my calculated value.

Hmm, 8.8e-28 /4.6 =approx 1.9e-28. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w.

Wait, perhaps w is given as 4e14 s^-1, but I thought it was rad/s. Oh wait, the problem states w is 4e14 rad/s, which is correct. So the calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using w in s^-1, not rad/s. Let me try that.

If w is 4e14 s^-1, then h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Same as before. So no change.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the (n=0, J=0) state to (n=0, J=1), which requires 2B energy, but the p_photon is 3.07e-31 kg m/s. But again, that's way smaller than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences, but that would be higher than either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is misprinted or the options are wrong. But that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the photon's energy being the vibrational energy, but the options are given in terms of momentum, which requires the calculation. So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate it as h w / c, which gives 8.8e-28 kg m/s.

Looking again at the options, option A is 1.9e-28. So is there a mistake in the given values?

Wait, perhaps the angular frequency is given as 4e14 Hz (which is equivalent to 8e14 rad/s). Let me check that.

No, the problem says w=4e14 rad/s.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is 2 angstroms, but in the calculation, I used 2e-10 m. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is given in atomic mass units, but the calculation used kilograms correctly.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the photon's momentum is E/(c), but E is the rotational energy, 2B.

So p=2B/c =9.21e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But again, that's nowhere near the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first vibrational excited state, but the photon's energy is the vibrational energy. So, p=8.8e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options again, perhaps I should re-express 8.8e-28 as 8.8e-28 kg m/s = 8.8e-28 N s, since 1 N s = 1 kg m/s.

So p_photon =8.8e-28 N s.

But the options are:

A)1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

So 8.8e-28 is not an option, but perhaps the intended approach used a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the energy of the photon as the rotational energy, but I've made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy difference is B, not 2B.

Wait, no. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). So for J=0 to J=1, the difference is E= B (1*(1+1) - 0) )= 2B.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state as the first vibrational state, but perhaps the energy is not h w but some other value.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. The transition from n=0 to n=1 requires ΔE= h w.

So the photon's energy is h w, so p= h w /c.

Compute that:

h=6.626e-34 J s

w=4e14 rad/s

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, same as before.

But none of the options match, so perhaps the intended answer is option A, 1.9e-28. But why?

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of h w.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) * 1e-34+14 =26.504e-20 → 2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using frequency ν instead of angular frequency w.

Because sometimes, in some contexts, w = 2 π ν. So if the given w is actually ν, then the calculation would be different.

Wait, the problem states w is 4e14 rad/s. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to give w in units of 1/s (Hz), and I treated it as rad/s. Let me try that.

If w=4e14 Hz (which is 4e14 s^-1), then h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J, same as before.

So same result.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=1 to J=2, but that would require higher energy, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, no, the next state is J=1.

So I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the correct photon momentum for the rotational transition is 3e-31 kg m/s, and for the vibrational transition, it's 8.8e-28 kg m/s. Neither of these match the options.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28. Because 8.8e-28 is approximately 4.6 times option A. Maybe I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the energy required is h w/2, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (n=1, J=0), which requires energy h w. So p_photon=8.8e-28.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28, which is roughly 8.8e-28 divided by 4.6.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, let me recalculate μ.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ=(20 *2)/(20+2)=40/22=20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Ah! Because 20 +2=22, so 40/22 is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass is given as Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So the reduced mass is (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22=20/11 amu.

Wait, but 20/11 is about 1.818 amu.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the reduced mass in atomic mass units instead of converting to kg. But that can't be because the moment of inertia is in kg m².

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which complicates things. But without more information, I can't proceed.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I think the intended answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns, which is the closest to the calculated value of 8.8e-28, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass or the moment of inertia.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies, but that would be much higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the molecule is in its fundamental vibrational state, but the rotational state is J=0, and the next state is J=1, requiring 2B, but the momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be the vibrational energy, but the calculation of p was done incorrectly.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula p = h/(2π c), which is E_photon/(c π).

Wait, but that's not correct. Because E_photon = h f, and p = E/c.

So, perhaps the calculation is using f instead of w.

Wait, w = 2 π f → f= w/(2 π) =4e14/(6.283)≈6.37e13 Hz.

Then, h f=6.626e-34 *6.37e13=4.22e-20 J.

p_photon=4.22e-20 /3e8 =1.407e-28 kg m/s.

Ah! That's about 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which matches option D.

So perhaps the problem expects the photon's energy to be hf, where f is the frequency (w/(2π)), which is 6.37e13 Hz. So h f would be 4.22e-20 J, and p_photon is 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

So that would be option D: 1.4e-28 N s.

Wait, but why would the question use frequency instead of angular frequency? Because the given w is in rad/s. So using f= w/(2π) would be correct.

So perhaps that's the intended approach.

So the correct calculation would be:

p_photon = h f /c = (6.626e-34 J s * (4e14 rad/s)/(2π)) ) / (3e8 m/s).

Compute f=4e14/(2π) ≈6.366e13 Hz.

h f=6.626e-34 *6.366e13=4.22e-20 J.

p_photon=4.22e-20 /3e8=1.407e-28 kg m/s.

So p_photon≈1.4e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

Ah, so perhaps that's the intended calculation. The problem states w but requires using frequency f= w/(2 π), leading to the correct option.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the system using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in its ground state, corresponding to the vibrational state \(n=0\) and rotational state \(J=0\). The next possible state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (\(n=0 \to n=1\)) or a rotational transition (\(J=0 \to J=1\)).

### Key Calculations:

1. **Vibrational Transition**:
   - The energy difference for a vibrational transition is given by:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega
     \]
     where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\). Substituting:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.6504 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c},
     \]
     where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Substituting:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{2.6504 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.8347 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
     \]

2. **Rotational Transition**:
   - The rotational constant \(B\) is calculated using:
     \[
     B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I},
     \]
     where \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), and the moment of inertia \(I = \mu r^2\). The reduced mass \(\mu\) is:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \times 2 \, \text{amu}}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
     Converting \(\mu\) to kilograms (\(1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):
     \[
     \mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]
     The bond length \(r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), so:
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2072 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
     \]
     Substituting into \(B\):
     \[
     B = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \times 1.2072 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.605 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The energy difference for a rotational transition (\(J=0 \to J=1\)) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 4.605 \times 10^{-23} = 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon is:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
     \]

3. **Comparison**:
   - The vibrational transition requires significantly more energy (\(2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)) than the rotational transition (\(9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)). Therefore, the rotational transition is the next state with the lowest possible energy.

4. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:
   - The momentum of the photon for the rotational transition is \(3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}\). However, this value is far smaller than any of the provided options. Reassessing the problem, it appears the question may instead consider the vibrational transition, where the momentum is \(8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}\). This value is closest to option **A** (\(1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\)), but it does not match exactly.

5. **Revisiting the Vibrational Transition**:
   - If the angular frequency \(\omega\) is interpreted as the frequency \(f\) (i.e., \(\omega = 2\pi f\)), then:
     \[
     f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.37 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}.
     \]
     The energy of the photon becomes:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h f = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (6.37 \times 10^{13}) = 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]
     The momentum of the photon is:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.407 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
     \]
     This matches option **D** (\(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\)).

### Conclusion:
The most consistent answer, considering the possibility that \(\omega\) was intended to represent frequency \(f\), is **D**.

**Answer: D**
