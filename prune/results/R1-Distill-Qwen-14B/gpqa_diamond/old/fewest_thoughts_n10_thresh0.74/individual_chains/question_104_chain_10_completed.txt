Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, or maybe the closer it is? Wait, no, the wobble depends on the mass and the distance. Oh right, because if the planet is closer, it exerts a stronger gravitational pull, making the star move more, but wait, no, the star's velocity depends on the mass of the planet and the distance between them. 

So the question says both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. We're told that the RV method detected shifts in their spectral lines. Planet 1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, Planet 2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. And we need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet 2 is compared to Planet 1.

Wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for this semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) 

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K. I think the formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) ) 

But since the planets have similar masses to Neptune and the stars are Sun-like, M_p is much smaller than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So we can approximate K ≈ ( (27 * pi * G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( c * M_*^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps there's a simpler way. Since the shifts are given, and the formula relates K (the velocity) to the orbital period. Let me think: the formula for K is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p) * (1 - e²) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (P * (1 - e²) )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e^2) )) )^(1/3) ) * something else... Wait, maybe I should look for the formula that relates K to the planet's period.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (2 pi G ) / ( c * P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But again, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and (1 - e²) is approximately 1 for small eccentricities. So K ≈ ( (2 pi G ) / ( c * P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / ( M_*^(2/3) )

So if I have two planets, 1 and 2, with K1 and K2, then:

K1 ≈ ( (2 pi G) / (c P1) )^(1/3) * (M_p1) / M_*^(2/3)

Similarly,

K2 ≈ ( (2 pi G) / (c P2) )^(1/3) * (M_p2) / M_*^(2/3)

But in this problem, both M_p are similar to Neptune's mass. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So we can set M_p1 = M_p2 = M_p.

So taking the ratio K2/K1:

K2/K1 = [ ( (2 pi G)/(c P2) )^(1/3) * M_p / M_*^(2/3) ] / [ same for P1 ]

Which simplifies to ( (2 pi G / c )^(1/3) * M_p / M_*^(2/3) ) cancels out. So,

K2/K1 = ( (1/P2)^(1/3) ) / ( (1/P1)^(1/3) ) )

Which is same as (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

So K2/K1 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Taking cube both sides,

(K2/K1)^3 = P1 / P2

So P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3

Wait, but wait! Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K implies shorter period. Because if the planet is closer, K is higher (since it's causing more wobble), and the period is shorter.

So we have K2 = 7 milliangstroms, K1 =5. So K2 > K1, meaning P2 < P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again.

Question: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So P2 / P1 = ?

From the calculations, from K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

So K1 =5, K2=7.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = (25/49) ≈ 0.5102.

So the period of planet 2 is approx 0.51 times that of planet 1. So planet 2's period is shorter, which makes sense because higher K implies closer orbit, hence shorter period.

Wait, but the options are A through D. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) ~0.36
B) ~1.40
C) ~1.96
D) ~0.85

Wait, 0.51 is not an option. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let's re-examine the formula for K. Another way to write it is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that P² ∝ a³ / (M_* + M_p). But M_p << M_*, so P² ∝ a³ / M_*

But the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(P * (1 - e²) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the formula for K in terms of P.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think that the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital period P and the semi-major axis a.

Another approach: The star's velocity K is related to the planet's velocity v_p via the mass ratio. Since M_* >> M_p, the star's velocity is K ≈ (M_p / M_*) * v_p.

The planet's velocity v_p is given by v_p = 2 pi a / P.

But a is the semi-major axis. From Kepler's third law, a^3 = (G (M_* + M_p) P² ) / (4 pi² )

Again, M_* >> M_p, so a^3 ≈ (G M_* P² ) / (4 pi² )

So a ≈ [ ( G M_* P² ) / (4 pi² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting back into v_p:

v_p = 2 pi a / P = 2 pi [ ( G M_* P² / (4 pi² ) ) ]^(1/3) / P

Simplify that:

= 2 pi * [ ( G M_* )^(1/3) (P²)^(1/3) ) ] / (4 pi² )^(1/3) ) * (1/P )

= [2 pi / (4 pi² )^(1/3) ] * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ) / P )

= [ 2 pi / ( (4 pi² )^(1/3) ) ] * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^( -1/3 )

Simplify the constants:

4 pi² to the 1/3 is (4^(1/3) ) * (pi^(2/3) )

So denominator is (4^(1/3) pi^(2/3) )

So the coefficient becomes 2 pi / (4^(1/3) pi^(2/3) )

= 2 pi^(1 - 2/3) / 4^(1/3)

= 2 pi^(1/3) / (4^(1/3) )

= 2 / (4^(1/3) ) * pi^(1/3 )

Simplify 2 /4^(1/3) = 2/(2^(2/3)) )= 2^(1 - 2/3 )= 2^(1/3 )

So coefficient is 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 )

So v_p = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Then K = (M_p / M_* ) v_p

= (M_p / M_* ) * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) (G M_* )^(1/3) P^(-1/3 )

Simplify:

= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) (G )^(1/3) (M_p ) (M_* )^(-2/3) P^(-1/3 )

So K = [ (2 pi G )^(1/3) (M_p) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) ] * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Since M_p is same for both planets, and M_* is same for both stars, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 )

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, no. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ), so K1 = k * (1 / P1^(1/3) ), K2 = k * (1 / P2^(1/3) )

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So (K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1

So P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3

Which is the same as before.

So with K1=5, K2=7.

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So the period of planet 2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet 1. So it's about 0.36 times as long, which means it's shorter.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the ratio is P2/P1 = ~0.364, which is less than 1. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long, so it's shorter. So the correct ratio is 0.36 times longer? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because 0.36 times longer would imply it's shorter. Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as P2's period is longer than planet 1's. But according to our calculation, P2 is shorter. So perhaps I'm getting the inverse.

Wait, let me check the formula again. Could it be that higher K implies shorter period?

Yes, because if K is larger, the star is moving faster, which would mean the planet is closer (so shorter period, as per Kepler's laws).

So in this case, Planet 2 has a higher shift (7) than Planet 1 (5), so Planet 2 is closer, meaning shorter period. Therefore, P2 < P1.

So the question asks, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is shorter, so the ratio is P2/P1 = 0.364. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

But let me check the options. Option A is ~0.36.

So the answer should be A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning a higher \( K \) corresponds to a shorter orbital period. The formula for the ratio of the periods is derived as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Given:
- \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \)
- \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \)

Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36. This corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
