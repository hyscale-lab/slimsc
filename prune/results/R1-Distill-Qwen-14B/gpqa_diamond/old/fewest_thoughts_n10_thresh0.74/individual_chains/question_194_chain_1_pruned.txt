Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I'm supposed to find the partition function Z. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? Beta is 1/(kT), but since the options have beta in them, I don't need to worry about k and T separately.

So each spin has two possibilities: +1 or -1. There are three spins, so total number of states is 2^3 = 8. But wait, maybe some states are equivalent or have the same energy. Let me think.

The energy depends on the products S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3. Each of these products can be either +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are aligned or opposite.

Let me consider each possible combination of S1, S2, S3. But that sounds time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps grouping the states by their energy.

Each term in the energy is S_i S_j, which is +1 if the spins are aligned and -1 if anti-aligned. The sum of these three terms is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J multiplied by this sum.

Wait, E = -J (sum of S_i S_j). So for each state, compute the sum, multiply by -J, and then exponentiate.

Alternatively, let's find the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's call that sum H. So H can vary, and each H will correspond to a certain number of states, and each of those states will contribute a term e^{-beta * (-J H)} } = e^{beta J H}.

Wait, E = -J H, so the Boltzmann factor is exp(-beta E) = exp(beta J H).

So first, find all possible values of H.

Let me list all 8 possible states and their H values.

Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3), each being +1 or -1.

1. (+1, +1, +1)
   H = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 +1 +1=3.

2. (+1, +1, -1)
   H = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) =1 -1 -1= -1.

3. (+1, -1, +1)
   H= (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1= -1.

4. (+1, -1, -1)
   H= (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)= -1 -1 +1 =-1.

5. (-1, +1, +1)
   H= (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)= -1 -1 +1= -1.

6. (-1, +1, -1)
   H= (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)= -1 +1 -1= -1.

7. (-1, -1, +1)
   H= (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)=1 -1 -1= -1.

8. (-1, -1, -1)
   H= (1) + (1) + (1) =3.

Wait a second, so the possible H values are 3 and -1. Let me count how many states have H=3 and how many have H=-1.

Looking at the list:

States 1 and 8 have H=3. So 2 states.

States 2,3,4,5,6,7 have H=-1. That's 6 states.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-beta E). But E = -J H, so exp(-beta (-J H)) = exp(beta J H).

So for each state, the term is exp(beta J H).

For the two states with H=3: each contributes exp( (3 J beta) ), so 2 * e^{3 J beta}.

For the six states with H=-1: each contributes e^{- J beta }, so 6 * e^{- J beta}.

So Z = 2 e^{3 J beta} + 6 e^{- J beta}.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ}, which is the opposite of what I have. Option B is 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}, which matches.

Wait, let me double-check. Because the energy is E = -J H. So the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is -beta E = beta J H.

So when H is 3, the energy is -3J, so the factor is e^{3 J beta}.

When H is -1, E is J, so factor is e^{- J beta}.

Yes, so Z = 2 e^{3 J beta} +6 e^{- J beta}.

Looking at the options, option B is Z=2 e^{3Jβ}+6e^{-J
