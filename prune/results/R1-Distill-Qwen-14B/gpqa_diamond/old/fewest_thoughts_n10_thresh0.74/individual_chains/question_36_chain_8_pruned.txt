Okay, so I've got this question about absorption lines in the Milky Way. Hmm, I remember that absorption lines are used to determine what elements are present in space by looking at the wavelengths of the absorbed light. But wait, what's the context here? 

The question says that observations are being made at about 2.1 gigaparsecs away. That's pretty far, but I'm not sure how the distance affects the absorption line energy. Oh wait, maybe the energy is related to the redshift or something. Redshift would make the wavelength longer, right? But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

The detected absorption line energy equivalent is 3.9 micro electron volts. Micro is 1e-6, so that's 3.9e-6 eV. I think I remember that different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum have different energies. Like, radio waves are low energy, then infrared, visible, UV, X-rays, gamma rays. So 3.9 micro eV would be in the radio or maybe microwave region? Because visible light is around 1-3 eV. Wait, visible is higher than that. So 3.9e-6 is way lower than visible. So it's in the radio.

What emits or absorbs at such low energies? I think that's related to 21 cm radiation, which is a hyperfine transition in hydrogen. The 21 cm line is about 0.00006 eV, wait, no. Wait, 21 cm is a wavelength, which corresponds to a frequency. Let me calculate the energy. Frequency is c/(lambda). c is about 3e8 m/s. 21 cm is 0.21 m. So frequency is 3e8 / 0.21 ≈ 1.4e9 Hz. Energy is h*f, h is Planck's constant, 4.135e-15 eV·s. So 4.135e-15 * 1.4e9 ≈ 5.8e-6 eV. Oh, so 21 cm is about 5.8 micro eV.

Wait the detected energy here is 3.9 micro eV. Hmm, that's a bit lower. So maybe it's a different line or perhaps it's a redshifted version of the 21 cm line?

Wait, the object is at 2.1 gigaparsecs. Let me think about how redshift relates to distance. But wait, 2.1 Gpc is a pretty large distance. I think that corresponds to a significant redshift. Let me think about the Hubble's law: velocity = H0 * distance. H0 is roughly 70 km/s/Mpc. So 2.1 Gpc is 2100 Mpc. 70 *2100 = 147,000 km/s. So that's a high redshift, z. Because redshift z is approximately v/c for small z, but when z is large, it's more like (1 + z) = 1 + v/c. So v=147,000 km/s is 0.49c (since c is ~3e5 km/s). So z is about 0.49? Or wait, is there a better way to calculate it? Alternatively, for large z, 1 + z ≈ (1 + v/c)/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), but maybe that's complicating too much.

But if the observed wavelength is longer than emitted due to redshift, the energy would be lower. Because energy is inversely proportional to wavelength (E = hc/lambda). So if the source emits at 21 cm (which is 5.8e-6 eV), but due to redshift, the observed energy is lower. So let me see: observed energy E_obs = E_emit / (1 + z). So E_emit is 5.8e-6 eV, E_obs is 3
