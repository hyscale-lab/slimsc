Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. I need to figure out which of the given compounds can exhibit this property. Hmm, optical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. So, if a compound has such a carbon, it can have enantiomers, leading to optical activity.

Let me look at each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, this structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond, and each ring has substituents. The substituents are nitro groups at position 6 and carbonyl OMe groups at position 2 on each ring. Wait, but can the biphenyl structure cause any chirality? Biphenyls can have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the two rings non-superimposable mirror images. If the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then maybe the biphenyl can be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each phenyl ring are not mirror images, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are such that the arrangement around the single bond creates a chiral axis. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, axial chirality refers to the arrangement around the single bond between two aromatic rings. If each substituent on the benzene rings is different, then the arrangement could lead to optical isomerism. Let's think: each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carbonyl ester at 2. So, on each ring, the substituents are nitro and ester. Are the two rings identical? No, because each has the same substituents but on different positions (6 and 2), but wait, the numbering might be such that each ring has nitro at 6 and the ester at 2. Wait, the parent is [1,1'-biphenyl], which means the two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So, positions 6 and 2 would be on each ring. Let me draw it mentally. Each benzene ring has
