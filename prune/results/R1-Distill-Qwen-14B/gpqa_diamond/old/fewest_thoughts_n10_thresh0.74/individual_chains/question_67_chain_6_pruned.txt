Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, I remember that p orbitals have l=1. The question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum state.

The state given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so each electron has l=1, right? Because l1 and l2 are both 1. And the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question asks about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. I need to find the joint probability that both measurements give -ħ. Oh wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, so I'm looking for the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ.

Wait, orbital angular momentum for each electron is L=ħ√(l(l+1)) for each axis? Or wait, no, Lz for each is m times ħ, right? Because m is the magnetic quantum number. So for each electron, the possible Lz values are -l, ..., l, so for l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So Lz can be -ħ, 0, +ħ.

But the given state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1. The total m is m1 + m2, right? Because Lz_total = L1z + L2z. So m1 + m2 = m_total.
