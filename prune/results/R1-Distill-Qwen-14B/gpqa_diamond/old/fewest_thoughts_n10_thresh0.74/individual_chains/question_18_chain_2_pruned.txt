Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to break it down. Hmm. So the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Both stars have masses higher than our Sun, but I'm not sure if the mass plays a role here. Maybe it does, but perhaps the question is more about the given abundance ratios.

Wait, the question gives me some [X/Y] ratios for each star. I remember that these brackets represent logarithmic ratios relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, maybe it's [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun? Yeah, that sounds right. So if [X/Y] for a star is positive, that means X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

Let me list out the given data to organize my thoughts. 

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So Si is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So Mg is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Si than in the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0. So Mg is the same abundance relative to H as the Sun.

Also, the Sun's photospheric composition is given:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that. 12 + something equals 7.5, so that something is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5. Which means nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). 

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5. So nMg/nH =10^(-5).

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me make sure. The notation is 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals a number. So for Fe, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5. Similarly for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log is -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

So, I think I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. That is, n_Si,1 / n_Si,2.

Wait, but how? I
