Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding those that exchange with the deuterated solvent.

Hmm. Let's break this down. I'll start by analyzing each reaction step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + excess KOH → product 1.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So 1 and 3 positions have bromine. When heated with a strong base like KOH, likely an elimination reaction occurs. Dehydrohalogenation, since KOH is a base and heating suggests elimination over substitution.

But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr, right? Because each Br is in a position that might allow for dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond. So if each Br is adjacent to a carbon, perhaps each elimination leads to a double bond. But wait, the structure of adamantane—does it have adjacent Brs?

Wait, 1,3-dibromo implies that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons? Or are they on opposite faces? Hmm. But regardless, when KOH is used, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two dehydrohalogenation steps happen.

Wait, but the product from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could form a diene, maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination to form a double bond, but with two Brs, perhaps forming a conjugated diene.

Wait, but the product 1 is a light yellow solid. That makes me think of an epoxide? Because epoxides are often light yellow solids. Wait, but how does KOH lead to an epoxide? Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a more substituted double bond. So each Br is on adjacent carbons, so eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond between those carbons. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Oh wait, perhaps the structure is such that the two Brs are on opposite faces but same positions, so that elimination could form a bridge or a ring with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantane with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which then eliminates another Br, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: when 1,3-dibromocyclohexane is treated with
