Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about gene interactions related to disease resistance in white lupine. Let me read through the problem again and break it down.

So, the setup is that they did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants for each (g1, g2, g3), and double mutants as well (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). They tested these mutants' resistance to anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. The control (wild type) has 100% resistance, and the mutants have varying percentages.

The question is about determining the gene interactions based on the resistance levels. The options involve concepts like transcription factors, pleiotropy, redundancy, and epistasis.

First, let me list the data:

- g1: 75% resistance (so, more susceptible than wild type)
- g2: 0% (super susceptible, same as no resistance)
- g3: 50% (moderate susceptibility)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

Wait, so when you have the double mutants, some of their resistance levels are lower or same as the individual mutants. Hmm.

I remember that in gene interaction, if a double mutant doesn't show a more severe phenotype than either single mutant, it suggests redundancy. Because if you knock out two redundant genes, the effect would be the same as knocking out one. But if the double mutant is worse, that's additive.

But in this case, looking at the double mutants:

g1g3: 10% which is lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So, their combined effect is worse than either single. Hmm, that suggests that their functions are additive, not redundant. Because redundancy would mean that knocking out both doesn't make it worse than the worst single.

Wait, no. Redundancy is when the proteins can compensate for each other. So, if you knock out one, you have some loss, but if you knock out both, it's worse. So for example, if G1 and G3 are redundant, g1 would be 75%, g3 50%, but g1g3 would be even lower. That's what we see here: 10% when both are knocked out. So that suggests they are redundant.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. If G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they can perform the same function, then knocking out one (g1 or g3) reduces the function, but knocking out both would reduce it further. So, the double mutant would be more susceptible than either single. Which is what's observed here: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, but g1g3 is 10%â€”much lower. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are redundant. So they function in
