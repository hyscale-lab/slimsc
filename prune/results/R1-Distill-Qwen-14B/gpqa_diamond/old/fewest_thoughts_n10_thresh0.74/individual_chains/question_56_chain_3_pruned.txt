Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about hydrogen atom transitions. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules.

Wait, dipole transitions are electric dipole transitions, right? The selection rules for these are usually that delta l (the change in angular momentum) is plus or minus 1, and delta m (the change in magnetic quantum number) is 0, plus or minus 1. Oh, but wait, for the electric dipole approximation, the transition is only allowed if the matrix element is non-zero. The matrix element involves the integral of the wavefunctions multiplied by the dipole operator, which has components proportional to r, y, and x or something like that.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. Since we're talking about a two-step transition, it must go through an intermediate state. Let me think about possible intermediates. The first transition from 3,0,0 to some state, and then from that state to 1,0,0.

First step: from |3,0,0> to some |n', l', m'>. The selection rules require that in a dipole transition, delta l is ±1. So since initial l is 0, the next l can be 1. And for m, delta m is 0, ±1. So from m=0, possible m' is 0, +1, or -1.

So possible intermediates would have l'=1, and m'=0, +1, or -1. But wait, the final state after two transitions has l=0. So the second transition must take l=1 to l=0. So each transition steps l down by 1. So the first transition goes from l=0 to l=1, then l=1 to l=0.

Wait, no. Wait, because the initial state is n=3, l=0. So first transition must go to a state where l=1 because delta l can be +1. So the intermediate state must be l=1, m can be 0,
