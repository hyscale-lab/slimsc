Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm. Let me read it carefully. So, there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and the periods between consecutive primary eclipses are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. 

Then, the spectroscopic observations give the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. In system_1, the two stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, their amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars.

Wait, I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity method can help determine the masses. Oh right, the more massive star has a smaller velocity because it's less massive stars that move more. Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So the velocity is inversely proportional to the mass.

But how do I get the masses from the RV amplitudes? Oh, I think the mass ratio comes into play here. The mass ratio q is the mass of the secondary divided by the mass of the primary. And the velocity amplitude ratio is the inverse of the mass ratio. Because if q is M2/M1, then M1 v1 = M2 v2, so v2/v1 = M1/M2 = 1/q.

So for system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. Let's say the primary has the larger velocity amplitude, but wait no. Wait, because the more massive star has less velocity. So the larger velocity would be the less massive star. So if system_1 has velocities 10 and 5, then the primary (M1) would have 5 km/s, and the secondary (M2) 10? Or wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, in a binary system, the more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude. So if the primary is more massive, it moves less. So if one star has velocity v1 and the other v2, then M1 v1 = M2 v2. So the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = v1/v2.

Wait, let me think again
