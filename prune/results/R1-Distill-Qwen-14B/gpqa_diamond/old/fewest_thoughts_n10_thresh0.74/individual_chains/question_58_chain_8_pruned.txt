Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm. Let's break it down.

The question gives four options: Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinite quantities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle these infinities.

So, thinking about each option:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I've read that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics with general relativity. One of its advantages is that it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories because it's a theory of strings vibrating at different frequencies rather than point particles. So maybe superstrings don't require regularization because they inherently avoid these divergences? Or wait, do they still need it in some contexts? Hmm, not sure. I'll have to think more.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD has a property called asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling constant becomes small, making perturbative methods workable. But wait, does that mean it doesn't need regularization? Or is it the opposite? Because even with asymptotic freedom, you still have loop divergences. So I think QCD does require regularization, maybe even renormalization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED was the first successful quantum field theory and that it does require renormalization because of issues like the electron's self-energy (an electron interacting with its own emitted photons) leading to infinities. So yes, QED needs regularization techniques.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, wait, this is the non-quantum version, right? So like Maxwell's equations and all that. In classical theory, there are no infinities or divergences in the same way as in quantum theories. Because it's not a quantum field theory, you don't have the same kinds of loop diagrams that cause divergences. So maybe classical ED doesn't require regularization because it
