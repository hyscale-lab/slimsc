Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So, I remember that Einstein's equation E=mc² relates mass and energy, but I'm not sure if that comes into play here directly. Wait, the nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments. The more massive one has twice the rest mass of the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh, wait, so M is the initial rest mass, but the two fragments add up to 99% of that. That means there's some mass deficit, maybe due to the energy released in the explosion? But I'm not sure yet.

The question is about finding the difference between the correct T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) and the value calculated using the classical approximation. So, I need to find T1 correctly, probably using relativistic equations, and then compute the difference when using a non-relativistic approach.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the rest masses of the two fragments.
2. Use conservation of energy and momentum to find their kinetic energies.
3. Calculate the correct T1 and the classical approximation T1.
4. Find the difference between the two.

First, the rest masses. The problem says one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2. So, m1 = 2 * m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Wait, because the sum is 99% of M. So substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum:

2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. Then, m1 = 0.66 M.

Wait, but M is the initial mass. So, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So the initial nucleus has energy Mc² = 300 GeV.

After fission, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M, so the mass difference is M - 0.99 M =
