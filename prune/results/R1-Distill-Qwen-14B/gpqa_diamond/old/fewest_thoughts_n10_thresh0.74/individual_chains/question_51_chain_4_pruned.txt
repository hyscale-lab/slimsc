Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says: A charge q is placed at a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A to D.

Wait, okay, so the setup is a charge near a conducting sphere that's grounded. Grounded means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge would go into the ground. But since the sphere is a conductor, the charges inside would rearrange themselves.

I remember that when you bring a charge near a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges redistribute. But because it's grounded, the induced charges can leave the sphere. So the sphere's surface will have induced charges opposite to the approaching charge. But how does that affect the potential energy?

Potential energy in electrostatics... right, the potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble the charges. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So maybe we just need to consider the work done by bringing the charge q from infinity to the point d away from the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is conducting and grounded. So any change in charge on the sphere would be offset by the ground. So the sphere's own charge would be zero? Or does the presence of the external charge induce charges on the sphere that stay there because the sphere is conducting, even while grounded?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. When a conductor is grounded, it can lose or gain electrons until its potential is the same as the Earth.
