Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given information includes the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A through D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the equilibrium here is between calcium ions and EDTA. Wait, wait. The formation constant, K, is for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or something like that), and K is given as 5e10.

Wait, but in solution, the EDTA is usually in different forms because of the pH. But the question says the pH is ideal, so I probably don't have to worry about that. Maybe it's given that the pH is such that the EDTA is in the form that can bind calcium. Oh, okay, so perhaps the problem assumes that all EDTA is in the correct form, Y^4-.

So the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let me think about the dissociation of the complex. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

The formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the formation reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

The equilibrium expression would be K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the complex. So initially, before any dissociation, [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M. But some of it will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So let me set up the variables. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex. Then, the concentration
