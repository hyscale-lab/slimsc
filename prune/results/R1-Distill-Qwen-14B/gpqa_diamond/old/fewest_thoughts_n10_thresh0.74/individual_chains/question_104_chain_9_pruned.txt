Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, each with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, and both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

The RV method detects shifts in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect as the star moves because of the planet's gravity. The shift tells us about the star's velocity.

Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method measures the star's velocity, which relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is related to the velocity semi-amplitude, K. K depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period.

But wait, the problem states both stars have the same mass, and their planets have similar masses to Neptune. So the masses are the same for both systems—so the only varying factors would be the orbital periods and the velocities (shifts).

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is something like:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ something? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, another approach. The RV method gives the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's orbit. The velocity semi-amplitude K can be calculated using the formula:

K = [ (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/1)

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K ≈ (G * M_p / (M_s^(1/3) P^(1/3)) ) )^(1/ something else? Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula
