Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound X is based on the reaction and the NMR data given. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the reaction setup. The compound X is C11H12O. It's reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, wait, what's that reagent? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common base used in the Hofmann elimination or other elimination reactions. It's also known as DBU (1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene, but wait no, the structure here is [2.2.2], so it's actually 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which I think is more commonly called DBU. Wait, no, DBU is [3.3.1], right? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that confused. Anyway, the point is, it's a strong, non-nucleophilic base, often used to deprotonate and eliminate in E2 reactions.

So, the reaction conditions are likely leading to an elimination. If the starting material is an epoxide, for example, DBU might open it. Wait, no, epoxide ring opening usually requires acids or nucleophiles. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diol or something else. Wait, the starting compound is C11H12O. Let me think about the molecular formula. For a compound with an epoxide group (which is an oxygen in a three-membered ring), the formula would be similar, but let's see.

Wait, the product is presumably the result of this reaction. But the question isn't about the product; it's about identifying compound X. So, the reaction probably transforms X into the product whose NMR is given.

Wait, no, wait the question says the product's NMR is provided. So, the product is formed from X, which is reacting with DBU. So, the question is to figure out what X was, given the NMR of the product.

Hmm, but what kind of reaction would X undergo with DBU to form the product? Well, DBU is a strong, bulky base. It's used in eliminations, like E2 mechanisms, and in some cases for deprotonation of acidic protons to form conjugate bases. Alternatively, maybe it's acting as a base in a ring-opening of an epoxide, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe X is an epoxide, and DBU is causing its ring-opening via some mechanism, but I'm not exactly certain.

Wait, let me look at the product's NMR data. The product's 1H NMR shows the following signals:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7
