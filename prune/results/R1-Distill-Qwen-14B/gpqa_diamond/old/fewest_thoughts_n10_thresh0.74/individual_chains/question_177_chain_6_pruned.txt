Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Through spectroscopy, both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. The radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The astronomers assume the stars radiate as black bodies and want to find out by how much the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. The options are A to D, each a number around 2.2 or so.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find the ratio of the luminosities, L1/L2. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I'm recalling is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the luminosity is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says both stars have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law. Wien's displacement law states that λ_max * T = constant (approximately 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same? Because if λ_max is the same, T would be same since the product λ_max * T is a constant. So T1 = T2. Or wait, is that correct?

Wait no, wait. Let me think. Suppose Star_1 and Star_2 have the same λ_max. Then according to Wien's law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if λ_max is the same, T must be the same too. Because λ_max * T = constant, so if λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point.

Wait but wait, the radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. How does that affect things? Oh, because
