Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions and EDTA. Hmm, I remember EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium. The question is asking about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where the Ca-EDTA complex is at 0.02 M. Oh, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so maybe activity coefficients are taken as 1 or something like that.

Wait, the given K is 5x10^10. Oh, right, K stands for the formation constant here. The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

The solution has a stoichiometric amount of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that means all the calcium and EDTA are tied up in that complex. But wait, in solution, some of the complex might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would depend on how much the complex dissociates.

Wait, but when the solution is at stoichiometric amounts, like 1:1 ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA, and the K is large, which indicates a stable complex. Oh, right, because K is 5e10, which is a big number, so the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

The formula I think I need is to use the Kf expression. Let me set up an ICE table. Let’s call the concentration of the complex as C, which is 0.02 M initially. Let's let x be the amount of complex that dissociates. So:

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2-] = C - x ≈ 0.02 M (since x is small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So the Kf expression is (0.02) / (x * x) = Kf = 5e10.

So that's 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

Wait, no, wait. The Kf is [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So substituting, Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10? Wait, wait. Let me compute that correctly.

0.02 divided by 5e10 is 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) )= (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So
