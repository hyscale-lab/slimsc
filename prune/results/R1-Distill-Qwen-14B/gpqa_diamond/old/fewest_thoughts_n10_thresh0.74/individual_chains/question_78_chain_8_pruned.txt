Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the potentials in the electromagnetic field due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that this has to do with scalar and vector potentials. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, which is a position vector from the origin. The vector d is the displacement from where the field was generated at an earlier time tr to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at time tr is v. And we need to find the expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t, where t is after tr (so t > tr).

Wait, I think I remember that the potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations. For a point charge, the potentials can be derived considering the retarded time, which accounts for the finite speed of light. Oh right, because the fields propagate at the speed of light, so the charge's effect isn't instantaneous everywhere.

So, the scalar potential V is usually given by something like (1/(4πε₀)) * q / r, but when the charge is moving, there's a factor involving the velocity. Wait, no—that's the static case. When the charge is moving, the potentials become more complicated because of the motion and the time delay.

Wait, let's think about the retarded potential. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v t_r))], but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. No, wait. The retarded time is the time when the effect arrives. So the potentials depend on the position and the velocity at the retarded time, which is when the field was generated.

Wait, I think the scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(r - (v t_r)) ), but no, that's not quite right. Or maybe it's V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(d c - d·v)] times c or something. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expressions.

Wait, I remember that the scalar potential for a moving charge involves a term where the denominator has (dc - d·v), where d is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point. So, d is a vector, and c is the speed of light. The expression would involve dividing by (dc - v·d), but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, let me think about the exact formulas. The scalar potential is (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| c - (d · v) ) / c ] ? Or maybe it's [c/( |d| c - d·v ) ] times q/(4πε₀). Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me try to recall the general form. The scalar potential due to a moving charge is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ (1/(r - (v t_r)) ) ]

But wait, no, that's not
