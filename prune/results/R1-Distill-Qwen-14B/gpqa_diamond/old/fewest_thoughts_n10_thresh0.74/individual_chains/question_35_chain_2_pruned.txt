Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, it's about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The question says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as c multiplied by S. The constant c here is h divided by 4π. Oh wait, and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I should probably write that matrix S down.

So S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

And Ay is c * S. So substituting c, that would make Ay = (h/4π) * S. Therefore, the matrix Ay would be:
[ (h/4π)*0   (h/4π)*(-i) ]
[ (h/4π)*i    (h/4π)*0 ]

Simplify that, and it becomes:
[ 0     -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  0 ]

The problem is asking me to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, based on that, determine which statement among the options A to D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So I need to think about each option and see which one aligns with what I know.

First, let's recall that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So the matrix Ay minus λ I would be:
[ -λ     -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ].

Calculating the determinant: λ² - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

Multiply those terms: i*(-i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So it's (h/(4π))² * 1. So the determinant is λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So the equation
