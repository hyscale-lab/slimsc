Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio question. Hmm, let me think. I remember that neutrinos are produced in the Sun through various nuclear reactions, and the pp chain is one of them. The question says the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, right, that's roughly the time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III stops in the core, the neutrinos we detect on Earth would be affected only after that time delay.

But wait, neutrinos from the Sun are produced in different layers. The main pp chain produces a lot of neutrinos, especially the Beryllium-7 neutrinos in the pp-III branch. Oh, right, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, which is the dominant process in the Sun. So if the pp-III stops, then the production of neutrinos from that branch would stop too.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find flux(band1)/flux(band2).

I remember that the solar neutrino spectrum has different components. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with certain energies. Let me recall: the main neutrino emission from the pp chain comes from the decay of Beryllium-7. The Be-7 neutrinos are emitted when a proton captures a
