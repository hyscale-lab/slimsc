Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, so the setup is that there are two planets orbiting a star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is transiting its star, which has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet, which has a radius 2.5 times Earth's, and we need to find its maximum orbital period so that it both transits and occultates. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, wait. So, both transit and occultation events. Let me think. When a planet transits, it's when it passes in front of the star from our point of view. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, making it temporarily invisible because the star's light blocks it. For both events to occur, the planet must pass both in front and behind the star, which probably means that its orbital period is such that it's in a different position relative to the star compared to the first planet.

But wait, no. The two planets need to have their orbital periods such that their orbital positions allow these events. I remember that both transits and occultations are part of the same orbital mechanics. For a planet to both transit and occultate, it must be in a position where the orbital plane is edge-on (so transiting is possible), and when it's behind, it's occultation. But I'm not sure if the orbital period of the second planet is related to the first in some way.

Wait, the question says the second planet shares the same orbital plane as the first. So their orbits are coplanar and edge-on. So both can transit, but the question is about the maximum period so that both transit and occultation events occur.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, occultation events happen when the planet moves behind the star, so it's the opposite of transit. So for a planet to have both events, it must be in a position where during its orbit, it sometimes passes in front (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation). But for that to happen, the orbital period must be such that it's not always on the same side. Or maybe it's about the timing of when the second planet's orbital period allows it to both transit and be occulted.

Wait, perhaps the maximum orbital period refers to the condition where the two planets are in a 1:1 orbital resonance, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about the synodic period or something related to their orbital periods.

Wait, let me think again. The first planet has a period of 3 days. The second has period P. The problem is asking for the maximum P such that the second planet will exhibit both transit and occultation events. So, when would a planet have both events?

Wait, perhaps the second planet's orbital period must be shorter than a certain value to cause these events.
