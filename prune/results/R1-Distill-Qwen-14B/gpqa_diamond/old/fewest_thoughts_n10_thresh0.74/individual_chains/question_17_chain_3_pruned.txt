Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I'm assuming that means the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. They also give the formation constant, KCa-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Wait, but I should make sure I understand what KCa-EDTA represents here.

I remember that formation constants, also known as stability constants, measure how strong a complex is. The formula for such a constant is usually something like Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]), where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. So, Kf is a very large number indicating a stable complex.

But wait, the way the problem states it is KCa-EDTA = 5e10. So I think that's the same as Kf. So the complex is CaY²−, and Kf is 5e10.

The question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in this solution. So, normally, if you have a complex, the concentration of the ions in solution would be much less than the concentration of the complex because the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me write that down:
[CaY²-] = 0.02 M.

In the solution, the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and Y⁴-:
CaY²- ⇌ Ca²+ + Y⁴-.

The formation constant equation is Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y⁴-]).

Wait, but wait, if I let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates, then [Ca²+] = x, and [Y⁴-] = x as well because each complex produces one of each ion. So [CaY²-] would be 0.02 - x, but since Kf is so large, x must be very small compared to 0.02. So I can approximate [CaY²-] ≈ 0.02.

So substituting into the Kf equation:
5e10 = (0.02) / (
