Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.

The problem is about nuclear fission, right? So an atomic nucleus of mass M is initially at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, let me jot down what I know:

- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV. So Mc² = 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV / c². But since we're dealing with energy, maybe c is 1 in these units. I'll have to see.

- The nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions so that their momenta cancel out. So conservation of momentum tells me that their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Wait, but momentum is mass times velocity. So for the two fragments, m1*v1 = m2*v2, but since they're in opposite directions, their velocities are opposite. Wait, but the problem states that the more massive fragment has a kinetic energy T1. So which fragment is more massive? The one that's twice as massive as the other. So if one is twice as the other, let's say m1 = 2m2. Then, the more massive fragment is m1.

Wait, but the problem says that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. And since m1 = 2 m2, substituting that: 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.99 M / 3 = 0.33 M. And m1 = 0.66 M.

Wait, but wait, wait. Because the initial rest mass is M, but when it splits, the sum of the rest masses is less than M. So that's where
