Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. Hmm, I think this relates to diffraction patterns, right?

Wait, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So I'm guessing this problem is about a circular aperture and the diffraction pattern it produces.

I remember that for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot called the Airy disk. The first minima around this disk are the points where the intensity drops to zero. The angular position of these minima is given by a specific formula.

What's that formula again? Oh right, the first minimum occurs at an angle θ where sinθ = λ/(π a), but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression. Alternatively, I think it's based on the condition for destructive interference. For a circular aperture, the diffraction minima can be found using the formula involving the Bessel functions, but since the problem tells me to use the small angle approximation, maybe I can simplify it.

Under small angles, sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ, and θ is in radians. For the first minimum, the condition is a * θ = λ / (π * 1.22 or something like that?), wait no, I might be mixing things up. Oh wait, the first minimum occurs at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(a), but wait that's the actual calculation. Or is it the other way around?

Wait no, I think the first minimum for a circular aperture occurs at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(a). Because I remember the formula for the minima in single-slit diffraction is a sinθ = m λ, but that's for a single slit, which is different. Oh right, for a single slit, the first minimum is at θ where a sinθ = λ, which is a sinθ ≈ λ, so θ ≈ λ/(a). But for a circular aperture, like a pinhole, the first minimum is at a larger angle. 

So wait, for the circular aperture, the formula for the minima is based
