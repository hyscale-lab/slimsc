Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal structures, right? It's based on a cube but with all sides equal and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Interesting.

The question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for that involves the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, the Miller indices here are (111). So the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by 1/(d) = sqrt( (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) + ... something with the angles between the axes? Oh wait, maybe I should remember the exact formula. 

Rhombohedral systems are a bit tricky because all the edges are the same length, but the angles can differ. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, but the angles alpha, beta, gamma are usually not 90 degrees. In this case, all angles are 30 degrees. So a = b = c = 10 Angstrom each.

The interplanar distance formula for a general rhombohedral system. I think it's something like d = [ (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) - (2 a^2 (hk cos gamma + hk cos beta + kl cos alpha )) ) ]^(-1/2) multiplied by something? Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula correctly.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is derived from the general formula considering the lattice parameters and angles. Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the unit cell vectors.

Alternatively, I recall that in a rhombohedral system, the lattice can be considered as a cube with all edges equal but with angles not 90 degrees. So the interplanar distance for a given hkl can be found using the formula involving the reciprocal of the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral crystal is given by:

d = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos
