Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has some specific NMR characteristics: the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.

Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3. The key difference is their NOESY NMR spectra: the major has a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. The question is about identifying which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

Wait, let me break this down.

First, the starting material is a cis-alkene dicarboxylic acid. Dehydration of such a compound would typically form an anhydride. The dehydration of a cis-dicarboxylic acid would form a cyclic anhydride, I think. Because when you lose water from two carboxylic acid groups, you form an anhydride ring.

The NMR data for the anhydride: 1H NMR shows a singlet at 7 ppm. That's a region for possibly alkene protons. But wait, a single peak suggests symmetry or equivalent protons. Maybe it's a bridgehead position in a cyclic structure. Alternatively, perhaps all four protons from a cyclopropane or something else, but 7 ppm is more like vinyl or aromatic, but in this case, the anhydride would have a double bond.

Wait, the anhydride from a cis-dicarboxylic acid would have a structure where the two carbonyl groups are adjacent. Hmm, wait, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride. So, the structure would have two ester-like groups connected as a ring. For example, if the dicarboxylic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but cis-alkene. Wait no, the dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene, so the structure would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond instead, like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but CH2 becomes CH2-CH2, but that's not right. Wait, perhaps the dicarboxylic acid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with the middle CH2 replaced by a CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the initial compound is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So the structure would be something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-C
