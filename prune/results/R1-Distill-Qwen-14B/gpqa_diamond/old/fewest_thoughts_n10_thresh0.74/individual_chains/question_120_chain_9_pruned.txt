Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think this through.

Parallax, I remember, is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in terms of parallax is distance d = 1/plx, where plx is in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let me visualize this. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means their density is constant. Wait, density is number per unit volume, right.

So, as we go further out (higher distance), each shell (a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr) would contain more stars because the volume of the shell increases. The volume of a shell is 4πd² dr, so the number of stars in a shell would be the density multiplied by this volume. Let’s say the density is n (number per unit volume), so stars per shell would be n * 4πd² dr.

But the question is about parallax. Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me rewrite the expression in terms of plx.

dr is the change in distance. Since d = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) d plx. Oh wait, because if plx increases, d decreases. So when considering a
