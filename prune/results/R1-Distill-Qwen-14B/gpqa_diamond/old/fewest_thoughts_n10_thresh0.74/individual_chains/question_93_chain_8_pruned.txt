Okay, so I've got this qPCR question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says.

So, the scientist is running a quantitative PCR, which I remember is used to quantify the amount of a specific DNA in a sample. He made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted the control in a series and ran three technical replicates for each dilution. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. Hmm, wait, I think the slope in a qPCR calibration (standard curve) is related to the efficiency. Oh right, the formula for the slope is usually -3.32 if the efficiency is 100% (which is 2, so ln(2) is about 0.693, and 3.32 is 10 divided by 0.693). So if the slope is -3.3, that's close to what we expect for 100% efficiency. So that's good; the efficiency is correct.

Looking at the results, each dilution has three technical replicates. So let's see the Ct values:

100000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average is around 34.2. Let's see the other concentrations.

At 10000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Average ~31.

1000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Average ~27.6.

100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6. Average ~24.3.

10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3. Average ~21.

Wait, I'm noticing that each dilution step is a tenfold decrease. So from 100,000 to 10,000 is a tenfold, then to 1,000, etc. Each should correspond to an increase in Ct of about 3.3 cycles because each tenfold dilution should add about 3.3 Ct (since 10^(-1) in quantity would be a 10-fold decrease, and the Ct increases by log base 10, which is 3.32 for each tenfold. So each step should have a Ct increase of approximately 3.3.

Looking at the Ct values:

From 10,000 (avg 31) to 100,000 (34), the difference is about 3.2. That's close.

From 100,000 to 10,000: Ct increases by ~3.2, which is consistent.

Wait no, wait, wait. Wait, when you dilute the sample, the concentration goes down, so the Ct should go up. So 10,000 is more concentrated than 1000. Wait, no, higher concentration would have less Ct. Wait, no, lower concentration means you need more cycles to reach the threshold, so higher Ct. So 100,000 is more concentrated than 10,000, so lower Ct. Wait, that's not right. Wait, higher concentration of DNA would reach the threshold faster, lower Ct.

Wait, in the results, at 100,000 copies, the Ct is 33.9-34.5. At 10,000, it's 30.6-31.2. Wait, that's a lower Ct (30s) for a higher concentration (10,000 is lower concentration than 100,000). Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought. Oh wait wait, no. Wait, 100,000 is a higher concentration than 10,000, so the Ct should be lower, right? Because there's more starting material. So yes, 100,000 would have a lower Ct, but looking at the numbers, 100,000 has a Ct of around 34, which is higher than 10,000's 31. Wait, that's not correct. Because higher concentration should lead to lower Ct. So that's a problem.

Wait, no, wait the data shows that higher concentration (100,000) has higher Ct? That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, wait, perhaps I got the numbers wrong. Let me recheck.

The question says:

At 100000 copies per µl: Ct's are
