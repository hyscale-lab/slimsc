Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is initially at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, okay, so the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since momentum is conserved, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me jot down some variables. Let me denote the two fragments as fragment 1 (more massive) and fragment 2 (less massive). So, fragment 1 has mass 2m, fragment 2 has mass m. Or wait, wait. Wait, the problem says one fragment is twice as massive as the other. So, if the masses are m1 and m2, m1 = 2 m2. And m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, because the sum is 99% of the initial mass.

So, substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum: 2m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M => m2 = 0.99 M /3. So m2 = 0.33 M, and m1 = 0.66 M. So fragment 1 is 0.66 M, fragment 2 is 0.33 M.

Now, since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the momentum of fragment 1 is equal and opposite to that of fragment 2. Let me denote their velocities as v1 and v2. But I have to be careful here: because the masses are different, their velocities will be different. Wait, but in terms of momentum, m1 v1 = m2 v2
