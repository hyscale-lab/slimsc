Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

Wait, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions, right? Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually Ruthenium-based, and it's good for breaking alkenes into different combinations.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's an equal mixture of both enantiomers, but wait, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene... Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene is CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂ but with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So it's CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But if it's 3-methyl, then the double bond is between C1 and C2, and a methyl group is on C3. So structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons properly.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent means five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2 (since pent-1-ene). So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3
