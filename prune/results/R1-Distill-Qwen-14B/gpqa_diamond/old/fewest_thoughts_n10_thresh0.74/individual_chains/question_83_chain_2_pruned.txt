Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about titration, which I remember involves neutralizing a solution with a base. The question is about acetic acid being titrated with NaOH. I'll need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Alright, let me read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the volume is doubled, which should halve the concentration. Oh wait, that's because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration becomes half. So the initial concentration after dilution would be 0.025 M acetic acid.

Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options give two pH values each, so I need to calculate both.

Let me start by finding out the moles of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 L. The concentration is 0.05 M, so moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, as I thought.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with acetic acid (CH3COOH) in a 1:1 mole ratio. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

For the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will be neutralized. So moles of NaOH needed would equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate that. The moles of acetic acid are 0.001, so moles of NaOH needed = 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the problem is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Because 10 cm³ is the equivalence point, 2.5 cm³ is a quarter of that.

So for 25% titration, 0.25 of the moles of acetic acid will have been neutralized. Let's calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles. So moles of CH3COOH remaining = initial moles - reacted = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate ion (CH3COO-) formed will be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume of the solution at this point is the initial diluted solution plus the added NaOH. The initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³, and adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH makes it 42.5 cm³. So the concentrations will be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L = let's calculate that. 0.00075 ÷ 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647
