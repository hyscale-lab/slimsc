Okay, I've got this physics problem here about angular momentum operators, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, and then determining which of the options is correct. 

First, let me parse the problem. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S. c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, putting that together, S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
      [i, 0] ]

So, Ay = c * S. Let me compute that. Since c is h/(4π), multiplying each element by c gives:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
                      [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Wait, let me write that out more clearly. The matrix elements would be:
- Ay[1,1] = 0
- Ay[1,2] = -i*(h/(4π))
- Ay[2,1] = i*(h/(4π))
- Ay[2,2] = 0

So, the matrix Ay is a 2x2 with those elements. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operator. 

Eigenvalues are found by solving the equation det(Ay - aI) = 0. So, let's set up the characteristic equation. The matrix (Ay - aI) would be:

[ -a      -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   -a ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i*(h/(4π)))(i*(h/(4π))) ].

Let me compute each part. The (1,1) element is -a, (1,2) is -i*(h/(4π)), (2,1) is i*(h/(4π)), and (2,2) is -a.

So determinant is (a^2) - [ (-i*(h/4π)) * (i*(h/4π)) ) ]

Wait, the product of (1,2) and (2,1) elements is (-i)*(i) * (h/(4π))^2.

Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1, so (-i)*i = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product becomes (1) * (h^2)/(16 π²).

So the determinant equation is a^2 - ( (h²)/(16 π²) ) * (1) ) = 0.

So a^2 = (h^2)/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π)

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). Wait, but wait. Because when you take the square root, you get a = ± sqrt( (h²)/(16 π²) ) ) which is h/(4 π) multiplied by ±1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the determinant calculation. The determinant is (a^2) - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h/(4π))^2 ].

Wait, (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = 1 (since i^2 is -1, so negative i squared is 1). So the determinant is a^2 - (1) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0.

So a^2 = h^2/(16 π²), so a = ± h/(4 π). 

Wait, but in the options,
