Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

The question says that cyclohexanone was treated with bromine to form product 1. Then, product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2. Next, product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to make product 3. Finally, product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (that's a mouthful) to form product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present on product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, okay. I need to figure out each step and the structures involved. Let's start with the first step.

First Step: Cyclohexanone + Bromine â†’ Product 1.

Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Bromine in what conditions? I remember that ketones can undergo various reactions. Oh wait, bromine can add to the carbonyl group. But wait, in a cyclic ketone, the carbonyl is conjugated with the ring. Adding bromine might not be a straightforward addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's an enolate formation? Or maybe a different kind of addition.

Wait, no. Another possibility: the bromine might be adding to the carbonyl, but since cyclohexanone is a ketone, maybe it's undergoing a bromination via the enolate. But wait, enolate formation typically requires a base. Alternatively, if it's just treated with bromine, maybe it's a diaddition to the carbonyl.

Wait, wait. Another thought: cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, and when treated with bromine (Br2), perhaps it undergoes a bromohydrin formation. Wait, no, that's when there's water present, I think. Or, maybe it's a dibromination via the formation of a diradical? Or perhaps the cyclohexanone is undergoing bromination via conjugate addition on the ring?

Wait, no, that might not fit. Let me think again. When a ketone like cyclohexanone is treated with Br2, I think it undergoes a 1,2-addition. So the Br adds to the carbonyl carbon, and another Br
