Okay, so I've got this problem here about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

So each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Wait, I remember that in statistical mechanics, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is exp(-beta E), where beta is 1/(kT).

Right, so I need to find all possible states the system can be in and calculate the energy for each. Then sum up exp(-beta E) for each state.

Let me list all possible states. Each spin has 2 options, so total states are 2^3 =8. Yeah, that's manageable.

Let me enumerate them:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now for each state, calculate S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me compute each:

1. (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = 1+1+1=3. So E= -J*(3) = -3J
2. (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) =1 -1 -1 = -1. E= -J*(-1) = J
3. (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) =-1 +1 -1 =-1. E=J
4. (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) =-1 -1 +1 =-1. E=J
5. (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) =-1 -1 +1 =-1. E=J
6. (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) =-1 +1 -1 =-1. E=J
7. (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) =1 -1 -1 =-1. E=J
8. (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) =1+1+1=3. E=-3J

So each state's energy is either -3J or J. Let's count how many states have each energy.

Looking at the list:

- States 1 and 8: E=-3J → 2 states.
- The rest (states 2-7): E=J → 6 states.

So the partition function Z is the sum over each state's Boltzmann factor. So:

Z = (number of states with E=-3J) * exp(-beta * (-3J)) + (number of states with E=J) * exp(-beta * J)

Wait, wait. Because E is the energy, the Boltzmann factor is exp(-beta E). Let me make sure.

So for each state:

If E = -3J, then the term is exp(-beta*(-3J)) = exp(3 beta J).

If E = J, then the term is exp(-beta*J).

So Z = 2 * exp(3 beta J) + 6 * exp(-beta J).

Looking at the options:

Option A: Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ) → No, because our first term is e^(3Jβ), not e^(-3Jβ).

Option B: Z=2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ) → Yes, this matches.

Option C: Z=2e^(2Jβ) +6e^(-2Jβ) → No, because exponents are 3 and -1.

Option D: Z=6e^(2Jβ) +2e^(-2Jβ) → No, same reason as above.

Wait, did I get the exponents right? Let me double-check the calculation for each state.

State 1: all spins up. Each S_i S_j is 1, so sum is 3 → E=-3J. So the Boltzmann factor is e^(-beta (-3J)) = e^(3beta J). So 2 states contribute 2 e^(3beta J).

The other 6 states have E= J. Wait, no, wait: E = -J*(sum). In state 2:

Wait, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. So S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J. So each of the 6 states has E=J, so their Bolt
