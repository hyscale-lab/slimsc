Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. Hmm.

Alright, the problem is about heating a mixture of salts A and B. They're equimolar, so the same number of moles. The total mass is 7.20 grams. When they're heated to 200°C without air, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through some tubes, and we get some weight changes and a remaining gas volume.

The setup is that the gases go through three tubes. Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is anhydrous—I think that means it will absorb water or maybe other moisture. Tube 2 is a Ca(OH)2 solution, which is good for absorbing CO2, maybe? Then tube 3 has red-hot copper, which probably reacts with certain gases, like maybe carbon monoxide or something else.

The results are that tube 1 gained 3.60 grams, tube 3 gained 0.80 grams, and tube 2 didn't change. Then, after all that, there's 2.24 liters of gas C left at standard temp and pressure.

The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I think I need to figure out what the gases are. Let's think about the reactions happening when salts A and B are heated. Without air, so no oxygen, probably. So maybe decomposition reactions are happening, releasing gases.

The first tube, Mg(ClO4)2, which is a desiccant. It absorbs water. So if the gases after heating have water vapor, the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, causing the tube to gain mass. The tube gained 3.60 grams. That must be the mass of the water absorbed.

So that suggests that the decomposition of the salts produced H2O vapor. So H2O is one of the gases.

Then, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas was CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But in this case, the weight of tube 2 didn't change. So maybe no CO2 was present, or it wasn't absorbed. Alternatively, maybe the gas didn't react with the solution—like, if the gas was something else that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2, like maybe NH3? Or maybe N2 or something inert. Wait, but the problem states that only a mixture of gases was formed, which were passed through these tubes.

Wait, or perhaps the gas didn't go into solution. Maybe it's a gas that doesn't dissolve in the solution. Alternatively, maybe the solution was saturated and couldn't absorb more CO2, but the problem says the weight of tube 2 didn't change, so perhaps no reaction occurred.

Then, the third tube has red-hot copper. So maybe the gas is something that reacts with copper. For example, carbon monoxide reacts with copper at high temperatures to form CO2 and Cu. Alternatively, maybe hydrogen reacts, but I'm not sure. Or maybe another reducing agent like H2S? Wait, but H2S is a gas that might be absorbed by other things earlier.

Wait, the tube 3 gained 0.80 grams. Since CuO is formed, that suggests that the gas reacting is something that can oxidize copper. Like, perhaps H2O isn't reacting, but CO? Because CO can react with CuO to form CO2 and Cu. Wait, but in this case, the copper is red-hot. Let me think: when CO is passed over hot copper, it reduces the copper oxide. Wait, no, CO is a reducing agent. So the reaction would be CO + CuO → CO2 + Cu.

So
