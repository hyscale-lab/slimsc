Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question says there are two planets detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star has certain properties: mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets have their own masses and radii too. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature is calculated based on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. But wait, how does that work exactly? The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )^(1/2) ? Or wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_planet = T_star * ( (L_star/(16πσ a²) )^(1/4) ), but actually, L_star is the star's luminosity, which depends on its radius and effective temperature via the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR_star²σ T_star^4. So substituting that into the planet's temperature formula, we get T_p = T_star * ( ( (4π R_star² σ T_star^4 )/(16 π σ a² )) )^(1/4). Simplify that.

Simplify inside: 4π cancels with 16π as 1/4. R_star² over a² is (R_star/a)^2. So that becomes ( (R_star² T_star^4 )/(4 a²) )^(1/4). Wait, because when I expand the terms, L/(16πσ a²) would be (4π R² σ T^4 )/(16 π σ a² ), which is ( R² T^4 )/(4 a² ). So the (1/4) exponent of that term.

So when I take the fourth root, each part is raised to the 1
