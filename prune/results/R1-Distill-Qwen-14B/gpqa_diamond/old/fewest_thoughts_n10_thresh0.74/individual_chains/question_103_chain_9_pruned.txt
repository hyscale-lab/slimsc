Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options A to D.

First, let me draw the target molecule. It's a ketone, ethan-1-one, which means the carbonyl group (C=O) is attached to a carbon that's connected to another carbon. The substituents on the benzene ring are a bromine and a nitro group. Looking at their positions, bromine is at position 3 and nitro at position 5. Wait, benzene is a ring with six positions, numbered in a way that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So if there's a bromine in position 3 and nitro in 5, that leaves positions 1, 2, 4, and 6. But wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group.

Wait no, the ketone is part of the substituent. Wait, the compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me think. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-. So the benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl group. So it's phenyl group with substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point where the ketone is attached.

So the benzene ring is connected to the carbonyl group. So that's position 1â€”so the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So the ring has: at position 1: the ketone (as a substituent), position 3: bromine, position 5: nitro group.

Alternatively, maybe the numbering is such that the substituents are in the meta and para positions relative to each other. Wait, no, because 3 and 5 are both meta to each other if the ketone is at position 1. Let me visualize the benzene ring.

Imagine the benzene ring with a ketone group attached at position 1. Then, position 3 is two carbons away (so meta), and position 5 would be four
