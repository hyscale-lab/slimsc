Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different exponents of 1/plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from different points in Earth's orbit. The formula I recall is that parallax plx (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by distance d. So plx = 1/d. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So I'm thinking about how the number of stars depends on both the distance and the volume of space. Because stars are spread uniformly, the number should depend on the volume of a sphere at a certain distance.

The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So if I imagine a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be approximately 4πd² dr. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to this volume.

But parallax is 1/d, so d is 1/plx. Let me express everything in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. The volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. Because dr is a change in distance, I think that's equivalent to a change in parallax. Wait, if d = 1/plx, then when plx changes by dplx, d changes by (d plx) = (change in d). Hmm, maybe I should express the volume in terms of plx and see how the number of stars per unit plx behaves.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So for a given range of plx (like from plx to plx + dplx), how many stars are there?

Alternatively, maybe it's about the differential number of stars per unit plx. So if I consider a small range dplx, how many stars are there in that range.

Since the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume, let's think about the volume corresponding to a change in plx. Let's say plx is p. Then d is 1/p. The volume of a thin shell at distance d is about 4πd² dr, where dr is the change in distance. But dr is related to the change in parallax dplx.

Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The derivative of d with respect to plx is dd/dplx = -1/(plx)^2. So when plx increases by dplx, the distance changes by dr = dplx * (dd/dplx) )? Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of differentials.

If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking derivative: dd = (-1/plx²) dplx. So, dr = -dd = (1/plx²) dplx. But since plx decreases as distance increases, the thin shell between plx and plx + dplx would correspond to a change in d of dr = (1/plx²) dplx. But wait, when plx increases by dplx, d decreases because d =1/plx. So maybe I should think about the shell in terms of plx.

Alternatively, perhaps I should integrate the number of stars over the volume. Let's say the number density of stars is n (stars per unit volume). Then the number of stars in a volume element dV is n*dV.

The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πd² dd, where d is the distance. So the number of stars between d and d+dd is n*4πd² dd.

But we need to express this in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, plx = 1/d.

Let me substitute d
