Alright, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Okay, let me think through this step by step.

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Pi(+) is at rest, so that means the initial momentum is zero. Since momentum is conserved, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. Which implies that the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So their magnitudes of momentum are the same.

Hmm, but wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very tiny masses, almost negligible compared to other particles. But in this case, the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, and the pion is 139.6 MeV. So the pion is a bit heavier, which makes sense because it's decaying into a muon and a neutrino.

I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum here. The pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The products are the muon and the neutrino. Since momentum is conserved, their momenta must be equal and opposite. So if I denote the momentum of the muon as p, then the neutrino's momentum would be -p, but the magnitude would be the same.

The total energy of the system after decay will be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4) / c^2, but since I'm working in MeV units and c=1, it's just sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). Similarly, the neutrino's energy is approximately p, because its mass is negligible.

So the total energy after decay is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p. But this must equal the total energy before decay, which is 139.6 MeV.

So setting up the equation: sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, how do I solve for p here? Let me rearrange things. Let me call sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) as E_mu. So E_mu + p = 139.6.

I can write E_mu = 139.6 - p.

Squaring both sides: p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2.

So subtracting p^2 from both sides, the equation becomes:

105.7^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p.

Let me compute the squares. 139.6^2 is about 139.6 * 139.6. Let's see, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is a bit less. Let me calculate 139.6 squared:

139.6 * 139.6 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 - 112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, 105.7^2 is 105.7 *105.7. Let me compute that:

100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 +1140 +32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So putting numbers into the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6*p.

Let me rearrange to solve for p.

2*139.6*p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Calculate 19488.16 minus 11172.49. Let me subtract:

19488.16  
-11172.49  
= 8315.67 MeV².

So 2*139.6 * p = 8315.67.

Compute 2*139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that division. 279.2 * 29 = let's see, 280 *30 is 8400, but 279.2 is a bit less. Let me see: 279.2 * 29.7 ≈ 279.2 *30=8376. But I'm getting confused. Alternatively, 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *20=5584, plus 279.2 *9=2512.8 → total 8096.8. 279.2 * 30 is 8376. But 8315.67 is less than that. So 29. So, 29.7?

Wait, perhaps a better way: 279.2 * p =8315.67 → p=8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute this:

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 → because 279.2 * 30 is 8376, so 279.2*29=8376-279.2=8096.8.

So 8096.8 is 29 *279.2.

But 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

So 218.87 /279.2 → approximately 0.782.

So p ≈29.782 MeV/c.

Wait, that's about 29.78 MeV/c. Hmm.

Wait, so p is approximately 29.8 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Let me compute 8315.67 divided by 279.2.

So 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8. Subtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 218.87 / 279.2 = approximately 0.782.

So p ≈29.782 MeV/c.

Wait, 29.782 ≈29.8 MeV/c.

So p is about 29.8 MeV/c.

Now, the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.8)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Compute 29.8^2: approximately 888.04.

105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.

So sqrt(888.04 +11172.49)= sqrt(12060.53) ≈ approx 109.8 MeV.

Wait, because 109.8^2 is about 12056.04. Close enough. So E_mu ≈109.8 MeV.

So the muon's energy is about 109.8 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is p ≈29.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the pion's rest mass was 139.6 MeV, and the sum of the muon's and neutrino's energies is 109.8
