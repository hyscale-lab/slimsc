Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I need to find the probability of getting specific outcomes when measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. Let me think about how to approach this.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a column vector, right? So I should probably represent it as a vector in a 3-dimensional space. Let me note that down. The vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Then, there are two operators, P and Q. The operator P is a 3x3 matrix. Its first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, I wonder what P represents. Maybe it's an observable related to some kind of spin or another property.

The operator Q is another 3x3 matrix. First row is [1, 0, 0], second row [0,0,0], and third row [0,0,-1]. Oh wait, that looks like a diagonal matrix. So its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. And the corresponding eigenvectors would be the standard basis vectors, I think. So |q+> is (1,0,0), |q0> is (0,1,0), and |q-> is (0,0,1).

The problem asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first, then Q. Wait, no, the question says measuring Q just after P. Oh wait, wait, the measurements are done in the order P then Q. So first, we measure P, and get 0, then measure Q and get -1.

Wait, but when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the first measurement is P, getting 0, which would collapse the state into an eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, using that new state, we measure
