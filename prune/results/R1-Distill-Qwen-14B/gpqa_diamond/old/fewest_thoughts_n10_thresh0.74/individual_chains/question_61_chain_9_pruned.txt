Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with benzene. Each step forms a product, leading up to product 5. The options are possible structures for product 5, so I need to figure out what each step does and then see which option matches.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitrating benzene involves using a nitrating mixture, which is HNO3 and H2SO4. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution. The nitration of benzene typically adds a nitro group. But where does it go? Benzene is symmetric, so the product will have the nitro group in a specific position. Wait, nitration usually substitutes the para position if possible, but in benzene, since it's symmetric, it forms nitrobenzene with the nitro group in the meta position? No, wait. Wait, nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene where the nitro group is in the para position? Or is it ortho and para? Oh right, when benzene undergoes nitration, the nitro group can go into ortho, meta, or para positions. But for pure benzene, the most stable is para, so product 1 is nitrobenzene, with the nitro group in the para position? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the reaction of benzene with concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3 is nitration. In benzene, the nitro group can enter in the ortho, meta, or para positions. But since benzene is symmetric, nitrobenzene is actually a mixture, but the major product is para-nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene, with the nitro group in the para position relative to where? Wait, in benzene, the positions are relative. So, product 1 is nitrobenzene, which is a single structure because all positions are equivalent. Oh wait, no, nitrobenzene is a single structure because the ring is symmetric. So in that case, product 1 is nitrobenzene, mono-substituted with a nitro group.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with
