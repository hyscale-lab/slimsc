Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves an electron state described by a vector and an operator. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the state given is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, I think I need to normalize this state first because probabilities are involved. Oh wait, the question says it's proportional, so normalization is definitely necessary.

First task: Find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A, whose matrix elements are Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, what's the operator A look like? Since it's a 2x2 matrix, right? Because we're dealing with spin up and down. So for a 2x2 matrix, A would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, no—wait, if i and j are the row and column indices, then when i≠j: Aij = ħ/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are 0, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2. So yeah, that's correct.

So the operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. Wait, but that's not Hermitian. Oh, wait—wait, but operators in quantum mechanics must be Hermitian. Oh, because the matrix given has real elements if ħ is real, so maybe it's okay. Let me think: if i and j are different, Aij = ħ/2, same as Aji. So the matrix is symmetric, hence Hermitian. Yeah, that's correct.

So the operator A is a Hermitian matrix, which means it has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. The eigenstates of A are probably |up> and |down> or some other basis.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, the operator given is A with elements Aij = ħ/2 for i≠j and 0 otherwise. So, in matrix form, it's [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So it's like a spin operator in the x-direction. Wait, no. Spin in x-direction is (ħ/2)σx, where σx is the Pauli matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So yes, I think that's correct. So A is (ħ/2) times σx, so its eigenstates are the eigenstates of σx, which are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2), right? So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x> or something like that.

Wait, but the initial state is given in the |up> and |down> basis, which are the eigenstates of σz. So to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of A, I need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A and then find the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is Hermitian, the measurement probabilities correspond to the eigenvalues of A, and the state's expansion in the eigenbasis.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Normalize the state |alpha>.

2. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator A.

3. Express |alpha> in terms of the eigenbasis of A.

4. The probabilities will be the square of the coefficients in this expansion.

5. Then, the average value of A is the expectation value, which is <alpha|A|alpha>.

Wait, but perhaps another approach could be to compute the expectation value directly, since I have the state in the computational basis (|up>, |down>), and A's matrix is known. Hmm, that might be easier.

But first, I need to normalize |alpha>. The state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, the vector in the basis is:

C_up = 1 + i
C_down = 2 - i

The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes. So:

|C_up|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2
|C_down|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5
Total squared magnitude: 2 +5 =7

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Next, I need to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of A. But wait, let's think about the operator A: since A is (ħ/2)σx, its eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively. So the eigenstates are the superpositions I mentioned earlier.

Wait, but maybe the problem isn't asking for the eigenstates of A, but the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix is A. Wait, the question says, "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij..." So the operator is A, and the eigenstates are its eigenvectors. So the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the projections of |alpha> onto each eigenvector.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

Matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A - λ I) =0.

So determinant:

( -λ ) ( -λ ) - (ħ/2)^2 = 0 → λ^2 - (ħ^2/4) )=0 → λ^2 = ħ²/4 → λ= ± ħ/2.

Eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ= ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I ) |v> =0 → [ [-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2] ] |v> =0.

So the equations are:

(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1,1]^T.

Similarly, for λ= -ħ/2:

(A + (ħ/2) I ) |v> =0 → [ [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ] ] |v> =0.

Equations: (ħ/2)(v1 +v2)=0 → v1 = -v2.

Eigenvectors proportional to [1, -1]^T.

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, in the σx case, the eigenstates are |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2), etc. Yeah, so that's correct.

So the eigenstates are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down> )/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down> )/sqrt(2)

Wait, but in our case, the state |alpha> is in the |up>, |down> basis. So to find the probability of measuring +x and -x, I need to write |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, then the coefficients' squares will be the probabilities.

So let's compute the components.

First, |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> )

So, express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me denote |+x> as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> as (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

We can find a and b by expressing |alpha> in terms of these.

Alternatively, we can compute the inner products: a = < +x | alpha > and b = < −x | alpha >.

So let's compute a:

a = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) ( <up|1+i> + <down|2 -i> )

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i) * 1/sqrt(2) + (2 -i)*1/sqrt(2) ].

Wait, let me compute this:

a = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2 -i) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

a = (1/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2))) [ (1 +i) + (2 -i) ]

Combine terms:

(1+2) + (i -i) = 3 + 0i =3.

So a= 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute b = <−x | alpha>.

b = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] |alpha>.

So,

b = (1/sqrt(7)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) *1 - (2 -i) *1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1 -2) + (i +i) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (-1) + 2i ]

So, a=3/sqrt(14), b= (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2: (3/sqrt(14))^2 =9/14 ≈0.642857...

|b|^2: | (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) |^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is about 0.35714. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait a moment, but that's not matching any of the answer options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

Option D) 0.61, 0.29 and 2 hbar/sqrt(7)

Hmm, but my calculation gives probabilities of 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36).

So the first part of the answer would have probabilities 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36). So the first part matches option A and option B.

Wait, but option A says the average is hbar/7, which is about 0.1428 hbar. Hmm, let's see. I'll proceed to compute the average value.

The expectation value of A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σx, and σx has expectation value <sigma_x> = (alpha_down - alpha_up)* something.

Wait, another approach: since |alpha> is in the |up>, |down> basis, and the matrix of A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], the expectation value is:

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i, 2+i) ] * A * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T.

Wait, no, let me compute it correctly. Let me write |alpha> as a column vector:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ [1+i], [2 -i] ]

Then, A is a 2x2 matrix:

A = [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]

So |alpha> is a column vector [ a; b ], where a = 1+i, b=2 -i, scaled by 1/sqrt(7).

So the expectation value is (1/sqrt(7)) * [ a*, b* ] * A * [a; b] * (1/sqrt(7)).

Wait, wait, no: more accurately, it's <alpha| A |alpha> = (1/7) (a* b_A a + a* c_A b + c_A a* b + b* a_A a + ... Hmm, perhaps better to compute as:

[ a*, b* ] * A * [a; b ].

But let's compute it step by step.

Compute [ a*, b* ] = [ (1-i), (2+i) ]

Multiply by A:

[ (1-i)  (2+i) ] * A = [ (1-i)*0 + (2+i)*(ħ/2), (1-i)*(ħ/2) + (2+i)*0 ]

Wait, no, A is applied to the vector [a; b], so:

A * [a; b ] = [ (0)(a) + (ħ/2) b, (ħ/2) a + 0*b ]

= [ (ħ/2) b, (ħ/2) a ]

Then, [ a*, b* ] * A [a; b ] = a* (ħ/2) b + b* (ħ/2) a.

Which is (ħ/2) ( a* b + b* a ) = (ħ/2) ( 2 Re(a* b) ) )= ħ Re(a* b).

So compute a* b:

a =1+i, b=2 -i.

a* = (1 -i)

So a* * b = (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i(2) + (-i)(-i)

= 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2 is -1, so:

= 2 -3i -1 =1 -3i.

So Re(a* b) = 1.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * 2 * (1/7) )? Wait, wait, no:

Wait, the expectation value is (1/7) multiplied by [ a* (ħ/2) b + b* (ħ/2) a ].

Which is (1/7) * (ħ/2)(a* b + b* a )

Which is (1/7) * (ħ/2) * [ 2 Re(a* b) ].

So that's (1/7) * (ħ/2) * 2 Re(a* b) ) = (1/7) * ħ * Re(a* b).

Since Re(a* b ) is Re(1 -3i )=1.

So expectation value is (1/7)* ħ *1 = ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7. So that's the third part.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, ħ/7. Which matches our calculation of probabilities and average.

Wait, but earlier I thought the probabilities were 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571.

Option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to 9/14 and 5/14.

So the options are:

A) 0.64, 0.36, ħ/7.

That would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me recheck the a and b calculations because maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, when I computed a, I had:

a = (1/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ].

Calculating (1+i)+(2 -i) → 3.

So a= 3/(sqrt(14)).

So |a|^2 =9/14 ≈0.642857, which is approximately 0.64.

Similarly, |b|^2 is 5/14 ≈0.35714, which is about 0.36. So option A is 0.64 and 0.36.

So the answer would be option A.

Wait a minute, but let me think again: perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvectors. Because |+x> is (|up> + |down> )/sqrt(2) and |−x> is (|up> - |down> )/sqrt(2). So when I expressed |alpha> in terms of these, I got a and b as 3/sqrt(14) and (-1+2i)/sqrt(14), respectively.

But wait, the probabilities are the magnitudes squared. So for a: |3/sqrt(14)|^2 =9/14 = approx 0.6428.

For b: [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

So the average value is ħ/7, which matches option A.

So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by the total squared magnitude of the coefficients:

\[
|C_{\uparrow}|^2 = |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |C_{\downarrow}|^2 = |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
\]

The total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Next, we analyze the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \hbar/2 \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) for \( i = j \). This corresponds to the matrix:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \hbar/2 \\
\hbar/2 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives \( \lambda = \pm \hbar/2 \). The corresponding eigenvectors are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. The coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) in \( |\alpha\rangle = a|+x\rangle + b|-x\rangle \) are computed using the inner products:

\[
a = \langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
b = \langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|a|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad |b|^2 = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{1 + 4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is computed as the expectation value \( \langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle \). Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), the expectation value is:

\[
\langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left( (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) \right) \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
\langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \hbar/7 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
