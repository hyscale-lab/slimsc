Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this so I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. The question is about finding the value of 'a'. We're told that when measuring the position of the particles, they were only found between x=1 and x=3. So, I think this has to do with the normalization of the wave function because the particle's probability must integrate to 1 over the region where it exists.

Wait, right, the wave function needs to be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. But since the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should be 1.

The given wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit odd. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So ψ(x) is a complex function. So the absolute square would be the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

So, |ψ(x)|² = [a² / (1 + x)] + (0.5)^2. Because (0.5i) squared is (0.5)^2 * i², which is -0.25, but since we're taking the absolute square, which is the sum of squares of real and imaginary parts, it's (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2.

So ψ*(x)ψ(x) = (a²)/(1 + x) + (0.25).

The integral from x=1 to x=3 of this expression dx should equal 1.

So the equation becomes ∫₁³ [ (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me split this integral into two parts: the integral of (a²)/(1 + x) dx from 1 to 3, and the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

First, let's compute the integral of 1/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x) + C. So for the first part, multiplied by a², it's a² [ ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) ] = a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so subtracting ln(2) leaves ln(2). So the first integral is a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.
