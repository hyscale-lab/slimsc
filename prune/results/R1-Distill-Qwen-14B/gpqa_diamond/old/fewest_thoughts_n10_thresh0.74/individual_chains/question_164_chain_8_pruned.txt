Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about binary star systems. Hmm, let's see. I remember binary stars orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about figuring out which system is more massive and by what factor.

So, both systems exhibit eclipses. The periods are given: system_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. Wait, but wait, the period mentioned is the time between two primary eclipses. Oh right, in binary systems, the orbital period is the same as the eclipse period because each star would eclipse the other once per orbit.

The radial velocity (RV) data is given for each system. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10. I think the RV amplitude is the maximum speed each star moves toward or away from us during the orbit. So each star's velocity amplitude is given.

I recall that in a binary system, the more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude. Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star, so the less massive one moves more. So the bigger velocity amplitude corresponds to the smaller mass.

So, for system_1: star A has 10, star B 5. So star B must be more massive than star A because it's moving less? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the more massive star has a smaller velocity. Because the center of mass is determined by their masses. So if one star has a higher velocity, it must be less massive. So in system_1, the star with 10 km/s is less massive, and the one with 5 is more massive. So the mass ratio (q) is m2/m1 where m1 is the more massive. Wait, no, wait, maybe I should think in terms of mass and velocity. The ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to their masses because of the center of mass condition.

Wait, the center of mass condition is m1 * v1 = m2 * v2, since the momenta must balance. So m1/m2 = v2/v1.

In system_1, velocities are 10 and 5. Let me call the primary star (the more massive) as m1 and secondary as m2. So if star A has velocity
