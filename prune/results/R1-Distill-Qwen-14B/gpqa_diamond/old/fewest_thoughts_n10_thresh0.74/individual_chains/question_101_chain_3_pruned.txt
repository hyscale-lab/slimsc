Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I'm supposed to select the suitable reagent A and catalyst B from the given options.

Hmm, first I need to understand what kind of reaction this is. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine. The parent compound is 3-methylpyrrolidine, which is a six-membered ring with five carbons and one nitrogen. The product adds a new substituent at position 1.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the structure would be a pyrrolidine ring where the nitrogen has a CH2 group attached, which is connected to a cyclohexylidene group. Wait, cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexene ring, right? So the substituent is a methylene group attached to a cyclohexene ring. Like, the structure is CH2 connected to the cyclohexene ring, and that CH2 is connected to the pyrrolidine's nitrogen.

So, how do we get that? Let me think about possible reactions. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. So, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of alkylation or maybe a substitution.

Wait, the reaction is acid-catalyzed. Acid-catalyzed reactions often involve things like carbocation formation or maybe some sort of enol formation. Alternatively, think about Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's more for arenes. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldol reaction? Or maybe a conjugate addition.

Wait, the product has a cyclohexylidene group. The cyclohexylidene is an aromatic ring? No, wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexenyl group attached via a methylene group.

Wait, if the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine, maybe
