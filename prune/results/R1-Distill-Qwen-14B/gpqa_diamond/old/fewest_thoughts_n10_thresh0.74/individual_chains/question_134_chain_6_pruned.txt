Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the problem says we have 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. They're all being mixed together, and I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but this might be a bit more complicated because there are multiple acids and a base involved here.

First thing I think I should do is figure out how much of each acid and base is present in terms of moles. Moles are calculated by concentration (M) multiplied by volume (L). Oh wait, the volumes are in mL, so I need to convert those to liters.

Let's start with HCl. It's 500 mL, which is 0.5 L, and 0.2 M. So moles of HCl would be 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl- ions.

Next, H2SO4. That's sulfuric acid. It's 300 mL, so that's 0.3 L, and 0.3 M. So moles of H2SO4 are 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid too, and it's diprotic, so each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. So 0.09 moles * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

Then there's Ba(OH)2. That's barium hydroxide. It's 200 mL, which is 0.2 L, and 0.5 M. So moles are 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So 0.1 moles * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Now, the neutralization reaction is between H+ ions and OH- ions. The total H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4. So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. The OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. Which one is in excess here? Let's see: H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the OH- will be the limiting reactant
