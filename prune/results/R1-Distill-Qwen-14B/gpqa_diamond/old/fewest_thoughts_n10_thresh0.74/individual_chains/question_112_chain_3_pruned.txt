Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step. Let me try to unpack what's being asked.

The question is about an electron described by a state |alpha>. The state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh wait, but wait, the first thing I should probably do is normalize this state because the problem says it's proportional, so the coefficients might not add up to 1 in probability. So normalization is the first step.

Wait, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the spin-z operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. That means the inner product of up and down is zero, and each has a norm of 1.

So the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's denote the coefficients as a and b. So a = 1+i and b = 2 - i.

To find the probabilities, I think I need to compute the squared magnitudes of these coefficients. But wait, first, I should find the normalization factor because the state is only proportional. So the norm is sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2).

Calculating |a|²: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. Wait, wait, no: |1+i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 because for any complex number z = x + iy, |z|² = x² + y². So 1^2 +1^2=2. 

Similarly, |b|² is |2-i|²: 2^2 + (-1)^2 =4+1=5. So the total norm squared is 2+5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7). Therefore, the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So the probabilities for measuring up and down are |a|^2 /7 and |b|^2 /7 respectively. So for up, it's 2/7, and for down, 5/7. Wait, but looking at the options, the probabilities given are numbers like 0.64, 0.36, etc., which don't match 2/7 (~0.2857) and 5/7 (~0.714). Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Wait, the problem isn't just asking about the spin-z measurement; it's about measuring the eigenstates of another operator. Oh, right, the operator whose matrix representation is A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, but wait, the matrix for a 2x2 system.

Wait, since the state is in a two-dimensional space (because it's a spin-1/2 system, with up and down states), the operator A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out. The diagonal elements are 0 because when i=j, A_ij=0. And the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix looks like:
