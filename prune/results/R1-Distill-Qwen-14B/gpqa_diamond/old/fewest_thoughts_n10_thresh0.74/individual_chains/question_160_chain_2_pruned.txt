Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length a. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field pattern, particularly the angular distance between the first two minima. N is infinitely large, so I think that means the aperture becomes a circle. Hmm, wait no, wait. Wait, if N approaches infinity, a polygon would approximate a circle. But wait, the apothems are all the same length, which would be the radius of the circumscribed circle, right? Or is it the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side? Oh wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which is the radius of the inscribed circle. So for a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius (the distance from center to a vertex) by a = R * cos(π/N). But when N is very large, the polygon is almost a circle. So in the limit as N approaches infinity, the apothem a becomes the radius R, since cos(π/N) approaches 1. So the aperture is effectively a circular one with radius a.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So for a regular polygon, the radius (to a vertex) is R = a / cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches cos(0) which is 1, so R is approximately a. So the radius of the polygon is a when N is large. So the aperture becomes a circle of radius a. But wait, the problem says when N is infinitely large, so it's a circle. That makes sense.

So the question becomes, for a circular aperture, what is the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field? Wait, but I thought for a circular aperture, the first minimum is the first dark ring in the diffraction pattern. But wait, in the far field (Fraunhofer diffraction), the intensity pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy disk. The central maximum is surrounded by rings, and the minima occur at specific angles.

Wait, no, actually, the Airy pattern for a circular aperture has a central bright spot, and the first minimum occurs at an angle θ where sinθ = 1.22 λ/(π a), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall the formula. The minima in the Airy disk occur where the Bessel function J1 has its zeros. The first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs at θ1 where J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The zeros of J1 are at (n*π - phase) approximations. Wait, the first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317, but wait, no—no, wait, correct me: J1(x) is zero at x ≈ 3.8317, 7.0156, etc. So the first minimum occurs when ka sinθ = 3.8317, or sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a). But wait, wait, no, I think I'm mixing up some factors here.

Wait, the formula for the minima in the Airy pattern is given by sinθ = (n * λ)/(π * a), where n is the order of the zero. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. For the m-th minimum, the condition is that J1(ka sinθ) = 0, where ka sinθ = (m) * (π), but wait, actually, the zeros of J1 are at x ≈ 3.8317, 7.0156, etc. So the first zero is at x ≈ 3.8317, so the condition for the first minimum is ka sinθ = 3.8317. So sinθ = 3.8317 λ/(π a) × (1/π?), wait no, ka is (2π/λ) a, right? Because k is
