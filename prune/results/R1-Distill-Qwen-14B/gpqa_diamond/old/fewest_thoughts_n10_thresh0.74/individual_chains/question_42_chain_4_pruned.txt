Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

Astronomers found three exoplanets using the TTV method. The question gives me the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, the mass ratios, and the same albedo. I need to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [ (L(1 - a) ) / (16πσ D²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance. But wait, since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), that should cancel out when taking the ratio.

The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. And between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3, so T2/T3 = 2.3.

Wait, so T1/T2 = 1.4 → T1 = 1.4 T2.

And T2/T3 = 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3.

So combining these, T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 * T3? Let me check: 1.4 * 2.3 is approximately 3.22. So T1 ≈ 3.22 T3.

But I'm not sure if that's directly useful yet. The question is about orbital periods, so I should think about Kepler's third law. The formula is P² ∝ (D³)/(M), where M is the mass of the star, and D is the semi-major axis. Oh wait, but wait, Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis divided by the mass of the star (assuming we're using the version where M is the mass of the star, and the planet's mass is negligible). But wait, in our case, the planets' masses might not be negligible if they are causing TTVs, but the question gives the mass ratios between the planets, not
