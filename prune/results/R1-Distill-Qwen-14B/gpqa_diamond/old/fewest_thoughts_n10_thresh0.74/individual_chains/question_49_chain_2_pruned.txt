Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. The question has three parts, and I need to figure out the products of each reaction based on the given reagents and conditions. Let me take it step by step.

First, let's understand the question. Each reaction involves a specific starting material, some reagents (like H+ and heat), and produces a product labeled A, B, or C. The options given are A, B, C, or D, each with different possibilities for A, B, and C.

The first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A.

Hmm. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine sounds like a molecule where the ethylamine group has two methoxy groups attached to the nitrogen. Wait, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethylamine? Or maybe it's ethylamine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. Let me draw it out. So, the structure would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2? No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2. So the ethanamine part is CH2NH2, but the first carbon (the one adjacent to NH2) has two methoxy groups attached.

Wait, but that would make the structure something like:

O

OCH3
|
CH2-NH2
|
OCH3

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. The substituents are on carbon 1, which is the one attached to the amine. So 1,1-dimethoxy would mean two methoxy groups on carbon 1, so the structure is (CH3O)2CH2NH2. No, wait, carbon 1 is the one with the amine. So perhaps it's like:

CH2OCH3

CH2OCH3

NH2

Wait, no, that can't be right because ethan-1-amine has two carbons: the am
