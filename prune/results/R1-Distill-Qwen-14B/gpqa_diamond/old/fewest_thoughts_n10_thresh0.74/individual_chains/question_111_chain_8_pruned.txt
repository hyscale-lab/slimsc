Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products for two reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, with t-BuOK as the base. The second reaction is between 1-nitropropane, KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through each part.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A.

Hmm, so the starting material is a ketone. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that mentally: the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (since it's 2,6-dimethyl), but wait, wait. Wait, 2-ethyl means there's an ethyl substituent on carbon 2, and 2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl groups on carbons 2 and 6. Wait, but that can't be right because the main chain is cyclohexanone. Let me clarify.

Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the numbering starts at the ketone. So position 1 is the carbonyl. Then, position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group. Oh wait, 2,6-dimethyl: so carbons 2 and 6 each have a methyl group. Plus, carbon 2 has an ethyl group as well. So that would be a pretty crowded carbon 2—maybe that's relevant for steric hindrance.

So, the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1. C2 has an ethyl group and two methyl groups (since it's 2,6-dimethyl, but wait, no—wait, 2,6-dimethyl would be methyl on C2 and C6. But 2-ethyl would be an ethyl on C2. So
