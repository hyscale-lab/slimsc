Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question describes a series of reactions starting from a compound, and I need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. The options are A) 8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Alright, let's break down each step.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is norbornane, right? And the substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, the structure is norbornene with an oxygen connected to a tert-butyl group.

Next step: combining this with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a nucleophile, but wait, in the presence of dibromomethyl groups... Oh, wait, the dibromomethyl groups would be good leaving groups. So maybe this is a Diels-Alder reaction? Or perhaps a substitution?

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexadiene has two substituents at positions 5 and 6, each being a dibromomethyl group. So each of those positions has a -CH2Br2 group? Or perhaps each substituent is a CH2Br group, but since it's bis, maybe each has two Br atoms. Wait, no, waitâ€”bis(dibromomethyl) would mean each substituent is a CH2Br2? Or maybe each substituent is CH2Br, but since it's bis, perhaps two substituents per carbon? No, wait. Let me think: 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl) would mean that on carbons 5 and 6, each has a substituent which is a methyl group with two bromines. So, each substituent is CH2Br2? So the structure would be:

cyclohexa-1,3-diene (so double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions), with at C5 and C6, each having a CH2Br2 group. So each of these is a good leaving group, I think. So when you have sodium iodide, which is a source of iodide ions, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution occurs, but what's the structure here?

Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo structure with an oxygen. Maybe the reaction is a Diels-Alder? Because the norbornene has a diene part, and the other compound is a dienophile? Or wait, the other compound is cyclohexa-1,3-diene, which is a conjugated diene. Hmm, but in Diels-Alder, the diene reacts with a dienophile. So maybe norbornene is the dienophile? Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, but the starting norbornene derivative is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,
