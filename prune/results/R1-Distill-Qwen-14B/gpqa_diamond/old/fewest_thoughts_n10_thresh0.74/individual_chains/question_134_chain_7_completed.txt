Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. Alright, the question says we're mixing three different solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to calculate the enthalpy change when they're mixed together.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. Oh right, and it's often measured in kJ per mole. But wait, the options are in kcal and kJ, so I'll have to pay attention to the units.

First step, I should figure out which acids and which bases are reacting. Let's break down each solution:

1. HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate into H+ and Cl-.
2. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. Since it's a diprotic acid, in solution it can donate two H+ ions. But wait, in dilute solutions, the second dissociation isn't complete. Wait, but for neutralization, maybe I should consider how much H+ is actually reacting. Hmm, but in this problem, since all are being mixed, perhaps all the H+ from both acids will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

So the next step is to calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base.

Let's start with the HCl. The volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L) and concentration is 0.2 M. Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one mole of H+, so 0.1 moles H+ here.

Next is H2SO4. Its volume is 300 mL (0.3 L), concentration 0.3 M. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Now, H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole can donate 2 H+ ions. But wait, wait a minute. In aqueous solution, H2SO4 dissociates first into H+ and HSO4^-; the second dissociation HSO4^- to SO4^2- and H+ is not complete, but for the sake of neutralization, since it's a strong acid, perhaps both H+ are available. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, I think in the initial neutralization, the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second is only partially. But in this problem, maybe I should consider both as available because the concentrations are relatively high? Hmm, but perhaps the problem expects me to take both H+ from H2SO4. So, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 would contribute 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid but it's diprotic. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Wait, first H+ comes off completely, so H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or wait, isn't it H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- in the first step, which is complete, and then HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2- which is only about 1/3 dissociated in dilute solutions. But in this case, because the concentrations are not extremely high, perhaps for the neutralization, the first H+ is fully available, and the second is only partially so? Or maybe the problem expects me to treat both H+ as available.

Wait, perhaps I should treat each H2SO4 as providing 2 H+ in this problem. Because when you mix strong acids and strong bases, all the H+ is available. So I'll proceed assuming that all H+ from the acids are available for neutralization.

So, for H2SO4, 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+.

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 is a strong acid, but the second H+ may not be as strong. Wait, actually, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-? No, no, wait. Wait, actually, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2- is incorrect. Wait, no, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (completely), and the second HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2- is only about 10% dissociated in water. So in practice, each mole of H2SO4 gives one mole of H+ (from first dissociation) and about 0.1 moles (10%) of H+ from the second. But in this problem, perhaps the assumption is that all H+ are available, so each mole gives 2 H+.

Wait, but the problem is about neutralization. So the H+ from the first dissociation is definitely available, and the H+ from the second may not be, unless it's a strong acid. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that only the first H+ is available. Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it's fully dissociated into two H+ ions, right? Or does it only donate one? I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, but the second is not as strong. So in aqueous solution, the first H+ is completely ionized, but the second is only about 10% ionized. So for the purpose of neutralization, perhaps I should consider only the first H+ as available, or maybe both as available?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to consider both H+ as available. Let's proceed with that assumption for now, and if that leads to an incorrect answer, I'll revisit.

So, HCl provides 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4 provides 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Now, the Ba(OH)2 solution: volume is 200 mL (0.2 L), concentration 0.5 M. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- (since Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-). So 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but in neutralization, the H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

So the total H+ available is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

The OH- available is 0.2 moles.

Wait, so H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2. So the OH- is the limiting reagent here. Because 0.2 < 0.28, so all the OH- will react, and there will be leftover H+.

So the reaction will proceed until all OH- is consumed.

So the moles of H+ that react are 0.2, and the moles of OH- that react are 0.2.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change per mole is typically around -57 kJ/mol (but sometimes given as -55.8 or -57 kcal/mol, depending on the source). Wait, wait, the user says 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization', which is usually the enthalpy change per mole of H+ neutralized. So each mole of H+ reacting with OH- releases 57 kJ or so.

Wait, but I've heard of the enthalpy of neutralization being about -57 kJ/mol. So for each mole of H+ reacting, it's -57 kJ. Alternatively, some sources say that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases.

Wait, but wait, I'm trying to remember: the H+ from HCl and H+ from H2SO4. But in this case, the H2SO4's first H+ is fully available, but the second may not be. Hmm.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we'll proceed with the assumption that all H+ are available, as I thought earlier.

So, the moles of H+ reacting are 0.2, so the heat released would be 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. But wait, the options have some in kcal and some in kJ. Oh, and I have to look at the options.

Wait, let me check the options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, the options have both kcal and kJ, so perhaps I should calculate in both units or see what the question expects.

Wait, the problem is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when the three solutions are mixed. So the total reaction is the sum of H+ from the two acids reacting with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, the total H+ from HCl is 0.1, and from H2SO4, assuming two H+ per mole, 0.18. So in total, 0.28 H+.

OH- is 0.2 moles. So the H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles, leaving 0.08 moles H+ unreacted.

So the neutralization reaction would involve 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

The enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles × enthalpy per mole.

Wait, but wait another thing: H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So the first H+ is strong, but the second is weak. So in the reaction, only the first H+ will fully react. The second H+ will not, because the OH- might be limited.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: each mole of H2SO4 contributes one mole of H+ that reacts with OH- (since the second H+ is not as strong and may not fully react). But wait, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider all H+ from H2SO4 as available, so proceed with 0.18 moles H+.

But let's get back. The OH- is 0.2. So which H+ reacts first? The strongest acid's H+ would react first. HCl is a strong acid, so its H+ will react first, then the H2SO4's H+ (but again, perhaps only the first H+ is strong).

Wait, perhaps I should prioritize the strongest H+ first. HCl is a stronger acid than H2SO4's first dissociation. Wait, no, H2SO4's first H+ is as strong as HCl. Wait, HCl is a strong acid (pKa ~ -8), H2SO4's first dissociation is also strong (pKa ~ -3), but the second is weaker (pKa ~ 1.99). So, HCl is stronger than the second H+ of H2SO4.

So, in the neutralization, all the H+ from HCl (0.1 moles) will react with OH- (0.1 moles), leaving 0.1 moles of OH- to react with H+ from H2SO4.

Wait, let me think. The OH- is 0.2 moles. The H+ from HCl is 0.1, so all of that reacts, leaving 0.1 moles OH-.

Now, the H2SO4 provides H+ in two steps. The first H+ (from H2SO4) is strong, so it will dissociate completely (0.09 moles ×1 = 0.09 moles H+). The second H+ is weaker, so perhaps not. But in neutralization, perhaps only the first H+ is reactive enough to react with the remaining OH-.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.1 moles. The H2SO4's first H+ is 0.09 moles. So all of that 0.09 moles H+ will react with 0.09 moles of OH-. Now, the remaining OH- is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles.

But wait, H2SO4's second H+ is weaker. So perhaps the remaining OH- (0.01 moles) can't react with the second H+ from H2SO4 because it's not strong enough, or because it's limited.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, which is the heat released when an acid and base are neutralized. So perhaps only the H+ that actually reacts contributes to the enthalpy change.

So in this scenario, the total H+ that reacts is from HCl (0.1) and the first H+ of H2SO4 (0.09), and part of the second H+.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider all H+ that can react with the available OH-.

Hmm, maybe I should calculate how much OH- is available and which H+ will react with it.

Total OH-: 0.2 moles.

Total H+ available:

HCl: 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: first H+ is 0.09 moles. Second H+ is 0.09 × (some dissociation), but since it's a weak acid, perhaps only a small part reacts.

But in this case, the OH- is 0.2 moles. So let's see:

H+ sources:

1. HCl: 0.1 moles, all strong.

2. H2SO4 first H+: 0.09 moles, strong.

3. H2SO4 second H+: 0.09 moles, but only some may dissociate.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is to consider that the second H+ from H2SO4 is not as strong, so only the first two H+ sources are considered.

So in total:

H+ available from strong sources: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.09 (H2SO4 first H+) = 0.19 moles.

The OH- available is 0.2 moles. So the H+ is 0.19, which is less than 0.2, so all H+ will react, and there's 0.01 moles of OH- left.

Wait, but wait, the second H+ from H2SO4 is weak. So in this case, the H+ from HCl and the first H+ from H2SO4 react first. Then, any remaining OH- would react with the second H+ from H2SO4, but only as much as possible.

Wait, perhaps another way: the total H+ available is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.09 (first H+ of H2SO4) + 0.09×some fraction (second H+ of H2SO4, which is weak). But for simplicity, perhaps the problem assumes that all H+ from H2SO4 is available, so 0.18 H+.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on this point. Maybe the problem expects me to treat all H+ as available, so proceed with 0.28 H+.

But let's approach this step by step.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.1.

H+ from H2SO4: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18.

Total H+ available: 0.28.

Total OH- available: 0.2.

So, the H+ and OH- would react in a 1:1 ratio, so 0.2 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH- react, producing 0.2 H2O.

The remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles unreacted.

So the neutralization would involve 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

The enthalpy change is the moles of H+ reacted multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

But wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol (per mole of H+). So 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because 57 kJ is per mole of H+ × 1 mole of OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy per mole of H+ is -57.3 kJ/mol.

Wait, 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46 kJ. So the enthalpy change would be -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. But the options don't have this. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider that the H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole contributes two H+ but perhaps each H+ contributes the same enthalpy. Alternatively, maybe the enthalpy is per mole of H2O formed, which would be 0.2 moles × 57.3 kJ/mol = 11.46 kJ, same as before.

But none of the options have 11.46 kJ. However, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, maybe I should convert kJ to kcal. Because 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ.

So 11.46 kJ × (1 kcal /4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.736 kcal.

But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is much larger. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy is per mole of reaction, which might involve more than one mole of H+.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Let me double-check that. Oh wait, wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given as about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). So for each mole of H+ and OH- reacting, the enthalpy change is -57.3 kJ.

So in this problem, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting would give 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm, so that's not matching. So maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, let me re-calculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL × 0.2 M = 0.5 L ×0.2= 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL ×0.3 M = 0.3 L ×0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since it's diprotic, 0.09 ×2 = 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL ×0.5 M = 0.2 L ×0.5 = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each provides 2 OH-, so 0.1 ×2 = 0.2 OH-.

So H+ total: 0.1 + 0.18 =0.28.

OH-: 0.2.

Limiting reagent is OH-, so 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- react.

So 0.2 moles ×57.3 kJ/mol = 11.46 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. Wait, the options have D as -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the stoichiometry wrong because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and Ba(OH)2 is a dihydroxide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more accurately written as:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

But wait, that's the reaction when H2SO4 (a diprotic acid) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (a dihydroxide base). So the balanced equation would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

In that case, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O.

So the mole ratio is 1:1 for H2SO4 to Ba(OH)2.

But wait, considering the moles:

H2SO4: 0.09 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles.

So the H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here, because 0.09 < 0.1.

So all 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 moles of BaSO4 and 0.18 moles of H2O.

But wait, that's only part of the reaction. What about the HCl?

HCl would react with the remaining Ba(OH)2.

After H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.01 ×2 = 0.02 moles of OH-.

HCl provides 0.1 moles of H+.

So H+ from HCl + OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react.

Moles of OH- left: 0.02.

So H+ from HCl: 0.1 → 0.02 moles will react with OH-, leaving 0.08 moles H+.

So total H+ that reacted: 0.09×2 (from H2SO4) + 0.02 (from HCl) → wait, no.

Wait, let me clarify: when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-. So the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

In this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 consumes 1 mole of Ba(OH)2, and produces 2 moles of water, releasing enthalpy.

The enthalpy change for this reaction would be based on the number of moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the heat released from both reactions:

1. H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2.

2. HCl reacting with the leftover OH-.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's approach it differently.

First, calculate the moles of each component:

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles, which will contribute 0.18 moles H+ (assuming both are available).

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles, which will contribute 0.2 moles OH-.

But wait, in the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for H2SO4 to Ba(OH)2. So:

moles H2SO4 =0.09

moles Ba(OH)2=0.1

So H2SO4 is limiting. So they will react completely, consuming 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.1 -0.09 =0.01 moles Ba(OH)2.

The reaction:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 will consume 2 moles of OH- (since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-):

So 0.09 moles H2SO4 × 2 OH- = 0.18 moles OH- consumed.

So after this reaction, the remaining OH- is 0.2 -0.18 =0.02 moles.

Now, the HCl's H+ (0.1 moles) will react with the remaining 0.02 moles OH-.

So total H+ that reacts: 0.18 (from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction) + 0.02 (from HCl and OH-) =0.2 moles.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ.

But wait, the options don't have that. They have option B as -11.42 kcal and option D as -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is calculated per mole of H2SO4 reacting, which would be different.

Wait, another approach: calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ from HCl:0.1.

H+ from H2SO4:0.09 ×2 =0.18.

Total H+ =0.28.

OH-:0.2.

So the reaction is 0.28 H+ + 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O + 0.08 H+.

The heat released is 0.2 ×57.3 kJ =-11.46 kJ.

So the answer would be approximately -11.46 kJ, which isn't exactly any of the options. But option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, perhaps the calculation was done in kcal instead of kJ. Let me check.

Wait, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 57.3 kJ is about 13.68 kcal (since 57.3 /4.184 ≈13.68).

So for 0.2 moles, it would be 0.2 ×13.68 =2.736 kcal.

But the options don't have that either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of H2SO4 and HCl, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that Ba(OH)2 contributes more OH- than the H+ available, so the H+ is the limiting reagent.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that the H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2, so the OH- is limiting.

Wait, perhaps the solution is looking for the total heat released, but considering all possible neutralization, including the H2SO4's second H+.

Wait, but I think I'm stuck. Let's look at the options again. The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, option B is approximately -11.42 kcal, which is about 48.5 kJ (since 11.42 ×4.184 ≈47.7). But my earlier calculation was 0.2 ×57.3=11.46 kJ. So option D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the enthalpy per mole is -57 kJ. Maybe it's -55.8 kJ per mole. Let me check:

55.8 ×0.2 =11.16 kJ. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy per equivalent, where for H2SO4, each mole contributes 2 equivalents (since it's diprotic), and Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 equivalents per mole.

Wait, but that's more about normality. Wait, the normality of HCl is 0.2 N (since it's 0.2 M and valence 1).

H2SO4: 0.3 M ×2 =0.6 N.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M ×2 =1.0 N.

The equivalent points would be where equivalents of acid = equivalents of base.

Equivalents of acid = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.3 * 2 *0.3 =0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) =0.28.

Equivalents of base = 0.2 (Ba(OH)2).

So the base is limiting, as before.

So the total equivalents reacted is 0.2.

The enthalpy change would be 0.2 ×55.8 kcal (if using kcal per equivalent). Wait, but 55.8 kcal per equivalent is 233.2 kJ per equivalent, which is way high. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to find the correct approach.

Another approach: find the total moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ = 0.1 + 0.09*2 =0.28.

OH- = 0.1 *2 =0.2.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles of H+ that react: 0.2.

Moles of OH- that react:0.2.

Enthalpy change = 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

So the answer would be approximately -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the total moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4 as 0.1 +0.09= 0.19 (only first H+ from H2SO4). Then, OH- is 0.2.

So H+ available: 0.19.

OH- available:0.2.

So H+ is limiting, 0.19 reacts, OH- left is 0.01.

Enthalpy change: 0.19 × (-57.3) =-10.887 kJ, which is about -10.89 kJ. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the moles of H+ from HCl and the first H+ from H2SO4, which is 0.1 +0.09=0.19. OH- is 0.2, so all H+ will react, leaving 0.01 OH-.

Enthalpy change: 0.19 × (-57.3) =-10.887 kJ.

But again, not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, such as -3.80 kcal per mole. But that seems too low.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of acid, not per mole of H+.

Wait, for HCl, the neutralization enthalpy is about -57.3 kJ per mole of HCl (since each mole releases that much).

H2SO4's neutralization enthalpy per mole would be different, perhaps around -114.6 kJ per mole (since it donates two H+), but that's not correct because the second H+ isn't fully ionized.

But perhaps for the sake of this problem, each mole of H2SO4 releases 2 ×57.3 =114.6 kJ.

Wait, but let me think. If all the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 react, and the OH- is the limiting reagent, then the heat would be based on the H+ reacted.

But perhaps the problem is using enthalpy per mole of H2O formed. Each mole of H2O releases about 57.3 kJ.

Wait, in that case, 0.2 moles H2O →0.2 ×57.3 =11.46 kJ.

So the answer would be approximately -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.4 kJ. So that's not matching.

Option D is -16.0 kJ. That's about 3.8 moles ×4.184 kJ/kcal = approximately 16 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the moles.

HCl:

Volume =500 mL =0.5 L.

Molarity=0.2 M.

Moles =0.5 ×0.2 =0.1.

H2SO4:

Volume=300 mL=0.3 L.

Molarity=0.3 M.

Moles H2SO4=0.3 ×0.3=0.09.

Each mole H2SO4 gives 2 H+ →0.18.

Ba(OH)2:

Vol=200 mL=0.2 L.

Molarity=0.5 M.

Moles Ba(OH)2=0.2 ×0.5=0.1.

Each mole gives 2 OH- →0.2 moles.

So H+ =0.1 +0.18 =0.28.

OH- =0.2.

So OH- is limiting. 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- react.

Enthalpy change =0.2 ×57.3 =11.46 kJ. So answer is -11.46 kJ.

But none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using enthalpy per mole of H2O, which is 57.3 kJ, but then it's 0.2 H2O →11.46 kJ.

So option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately the same as 11.46 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, let's convert 11.46 kJ to kcal.

11.46 kJ × (1 kcal /4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.736 kcal.

But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 48.3 kJ (since 11.42 ×4.184 ≈47.7). That's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor because H2SO4 is diprotic and the problem expects me to calculate based on equivalents.

Wait, in terms of equivalents, HCl and H2SO4 contribute:

HCl: 0.1 eq (since 1 H+ per mole).

H2SO4: 0.3 ×2 =0.6 eq (since 2 H+ per mole).

Total equivalents of acid: 0.1 +0.6 =0.7 eq.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 ×2 =0.4 eq (since 2 OH- per mole).

So in neutralization, the acid equivalents and base equivalents will neutralize each other. The limiting is the base, which has 0.4 eq.

So 0.4 equivalents of acid will react, and 0.3 equivalents of acid will remain.

Each equivalent contributes 57.3 kJ, so 0.4 ×57.3 =22.92 kJ. But that's higher than any option, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate based on the stoichiometry of the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, and then any leftover OH- reacting with HCl.

So, H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Molar ratio is 1:1.

Moles H2SO4=0.09.

Moles Ba(OH)2=0.1.

So H2SO4 is limiting. So 0.09 moles react, consuming 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, and producing 0.09 ×2=0.18 moles H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction is 0.09 ×57.3 kJ =5.157 kJ? No, wait, each mole of H2SO4 would release 114.6 kJ (since two H+ are neutralized), so 0.09 ×114.6 =10.314 kJ.

But wait, that's because each mole of H2SO4 provides two H+.

Wait, but the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would involve 2 H+ from H2SO4 and 2 OH- from Ba(OH)2 per mole, so each mole of H2SO4 would release 2 ×57.3 kJ =114.6 kJ.

So 0.09 ×114.6 =10.314 kJ.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 -0.09=0.01 moles, which gives 0.02 moles OH-.

Then, HCl provides 0.1 moles H+.

So, the OH- (0.02) will react with H+ (0.02), releasing 0.02 ×57.3 =1.146 kJ.

Total enthalpy is 10.314 +1.146 =11.46 kJ.

So again, the total is about -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is B) -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.4 kJ, which is much higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy per mole of H2SO4 as 114.6 kJ, and per mole of HCl as 57.3 kJ. But that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the H2SO4 as a diprotic acid in terms of neutralization. Maybe only the first H+ is considered, so H2SO4 contributes 0.09 moles of H+, and HCl contributes 0.1. Total H+ is 0.19, OH- is 0.2. So H+ is limiting, and 0.19 reacts, releasing 0.19 ×57.3=10.89 kJ.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and find the difference, then multiply by 57.3.

But I've tried that.

Hmm, looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -48.4 kJ, but our calculation is about -11.46 kJ. So option D is -16.0 kJ, which is 4.54 times higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, like 55.8 kcal/mol instead of 57.3 kJ/mol. Wait, no, 55.8 kcal is about 233 kJ, which is way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H2SO4 as 114.6 kJ, but considering only the first H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the total volume and concentration after mixing. Let me think.

After mixing, the total volume is 500+300+200=1000 mL=1 L.

The concentrations of H+ would be (0.1 +0.18) /1 =0.28 M.

OH- is 0.2 /1 =0.2 M.

But the reaction will proceed until either H+ or OH- is exhausted.

So, the moles reacting are 0.2 each.

Enthalpy change is 0.2 ×57.3=11.46 kJ.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal. So 11.46 kJ × (1 kcal /4.184 kJ) ≈2.736 kcal. So approximately -2.74 kcal, which is close to option A) -2.72 kcal.

But wait, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is approximately 11.46 kJ converted to kcal. So maybe that's the answer intended.

But earlier I thought the answer would be -11.46 kJ, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not close.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me check again.

HCl: 0.2 M *0.5 L =0.1 moles.

H2SO4:0.3 M *0.3 L=0.09 moles. Since it's diprotic, 0.09 *2=0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2:0.5 M *0.2 L=0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles.

So H+ =0.28, OH- =0.2.

So 0.2 moles react. 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ.

Ah, but wait, the options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.4 kJ, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization per mole of solution or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to calculate the total number of moles of H+ and OH- and find the difference, but that's not how it works.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula:

q = n × ΔH, where ΔH is per mole.

But perhaps I should calculate using the formula:

q = (n_acid - n_base) × ΔH, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach, and the correct answer is option B) -11.42 kcal.

But why would the option have B as kcal and D as kJ?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, like 55.8 kcal/mol instead of 57.3 kJ/mol. Let me check.

55.8 kcal is about 233.1 kJ. So 0.2 moles ×55.8 kcal =11.16 kcal, which is close to option B) -11.42 kcal.

But 55.8 kcal is more than 200 kJ, which is much higher than the usual 57 kJ. So perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the value of 57 kJ per mole, but I'm miscalculating the moles.

Wait, perhaps I should check the stoichiometry again.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

HCl is strong acid, dissociates into H+ and Cl-.

H2SO4 is diprotic; first H+ is strong, second is weak.

So when mixed, the H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

The reaction:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

Total H+ available: 0.1 (from HCl) +0.09 (from H2SO4, first H+) =0.19.

Because the second H+ of H2SO4 is weak, it won't fully react unless there's excess OH-.

But in this case, OH- is 0.2, so H+ from HCl and first H+ of H2SO4 sum to 0.19, which is less than 0.2. So all H+ will react, and 0.01 moles of OH- will remain.

So the moles reacting: 0.19 H+ and 0.19 OH-.

Enthalpy change:0.19 ×57.3 =10.887 kJ.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the closest option is B) -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.4 kJ, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, since I'm getting -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option B) -11.42 kcal, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, with option D) -16.0 kJ, but I don't see how that arises from the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L =0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH- →0.2 moles. Correct.

HCl: 0.2 *0.5 =0.1. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 *0.3=0.09. Each gives 2 H+ →0.18. But perhaps only the first H+ is available, so 0.09.

So if H+ available is 0.1 (HCl) +0.09 (H2SO4 first H+) =0.19.

OH- available:0.2.

So H+ is 0.19. So all H+ reacts with 0.19 OH-, leaving 0.01 OH-.

Enthalpy:0.19 ×57.3 =10.887 kJ.

But again, this doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of both H+ from H2SO4, so 0.18 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So, 0.18 reacts, releasing 0.18 ×57.3 =10.314 kJ.

But that's still not matching the options.

Hmm. I think the intended answer is option B) -11.42 kcal, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps option D) -16.0 kJ is the answer, but I can't see how.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are considered:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     As a diprotic acid, it can donate 2 H⁺ ions, contributing \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

   - **Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, contributing \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

2. **Identify the limiting reagent:**  
   Total H⁺ available = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Total OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Since OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, only \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H⁺ and OH⁻} \) will react.

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**  
   The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) (or \( -13.68 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)) for the reaction \( \text{H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O} \).  
   For \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ reacting} \):  
   \[
   \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
   \]

4. **Match with the options:**  
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) corresponds to \( \approx 11.46 \, \text{kJ} \), which is incorrect.  
   - Option B: \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) corresponds to \( \approx 48.4 \, \text{kJ} \), which is much higher than the calculated value.  
   - Option C: \( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \) corresponds to \( \approx 15.8 \, \text{kJ} \), which is also incorrect.  
   - Option D: \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) is closer to the calculated value of \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \), but it is still not exact.

Given the calculations, the closest match to the enthalpy change is **Option D: -16.0 kJ**, even though it is not perfectly aligned with the computed value.

Answer: D
