Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r). The setup is that the vector field falls off radially as 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. The integral is over a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, right. I remember from vector calculus that there's something called the divergence theorem, which relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. The divergence theorem states that the integral of ∇·f over a volume is equal to the flux of f through the surface enclosing that volume.

So, the integral we're asked to compute is ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV. According to the divergence theorem, this should be equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere of radius R, which is ∫∫ f · n dA, where n is the outward unit normal vector to the surface.

Wait, but what's the field f(r) look like? It's given that the magnitude of f(r) is 1/r², and it only has a radial component. So in spherical coordinates, f(r) would be f_r(r) ȓ, where f_r is the radial component. Since the magnitude is 1/r² and it's only radial, f_r(r) must be 1/r².

So, f = (1/r²) ȓ. 

Now, to find the divergence of f. In spherical coordinates, the divergence for a vector field that only has a radial component is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r). Let me write that formula again. So, ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r).

Substituting f_r = 1/r² into this, we get:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ] 

Simplify inside the brackets: r² * (1/r²) is 1. So, the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, ∇·f = (1/r²)(0) = 0.

Wait a minute, so the divergence of f is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin. Because the field f is defined as 1/r², but at r=0, it's undefined. So the divergence is zero in the volume except at the origin. But when we're integrating over the volume, including the origin, does that affect anything?

Wait, the divergence theorem applies to vector fields that are continuously differentiable within the volume. But in this case, at r=0, f has a singularity. So maybe we have to be cautious here.

But the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. So the volume integral of ∇·f would be zero except possibly at the origin, but the origin is a single point and in integration, points don't contribute. So the integral of ∇·f over the volume would be zero.

Wait, but then according to the divergence theorem, the flux through the surface (which is the sphere of radius R) should also be zero. But let's compute the flux directly to check.

The flux
