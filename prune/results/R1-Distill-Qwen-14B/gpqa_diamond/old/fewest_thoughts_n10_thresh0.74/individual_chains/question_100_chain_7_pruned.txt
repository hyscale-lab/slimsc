Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that the formula C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane, but I think more likely it's propene because it's more common in reactions like bromination. Wait, or is it? Wait, C3H6 is also the formula for cyclopropane, but I think the context here points more to propene because the reaction sequence involves adding bromine and then KOH.

So, compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in CCl4. Bromination in CCl4 is typically an addition reaction, but wait, wait. Wait, adding bromine to propene. Oh wait, propene is CH₂=CH₂CH₃. Bromination in CCl4 is probably a dibromination via an addition across the double bond. So when propene reacts with bromine, it adds across the double bond. So compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, I think. Structure is CH₂Br-CHBr-CH3.

Then compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions. So, in this case, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When you eliminate HBr, you'll form an alkene. So for 1,2-dibromopropane, removing two HBr molecules would give you propene again, but wait, no. Wait, elimination would require adjacent leaving groups. So if it's 1,2-diBr, then upon treatment with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate to form propene (CH₂=CHCH3) again. Wait, but wait, is that correct? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different elimination. Wait, wait, no—1,2-dibromopropane would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, leading to a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, so propene. So compound C would be propene, which is a flammable gas. So option D says C is a flammable gas, which would be correct.

Then, compound C (propene) is passed through a red-hot
