Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when acetic acid is titrated with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this should be a classic acid-base titration problem.

First, let's jot down the given information. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) with a concentration of 0.05 M. Then, it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. Oh wait, no, wait: when you mix 20 with 20, it's 40, right. Yeah, so the new concentration can be calculated using M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L. Let me compute that: 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001 moles, divided by 0.04 L is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid solution is 0.025 M.

Next, I'm titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's find out how much NaOH is needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Since we diluted it to 0.04 L, wait no, wait: actually, after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M, but the moles are still the same as before dilution. Because when you dilute, you're just adding water, so the number of moles doesn't change. So moles of acetic acid is 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the problem asks about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Let me tackle the two parts: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point.

First, 25% titration:

At 25% of the equivalence point, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So the moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing acetate ions.

So initially, we have 0.001 moles of acetic acid. After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, moles of acetic acid will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles, and moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed will be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume at this point is original 40 cm³ (20+20) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 liters.

So concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let's calculate that. 0.00075 ÷ 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, this is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson
