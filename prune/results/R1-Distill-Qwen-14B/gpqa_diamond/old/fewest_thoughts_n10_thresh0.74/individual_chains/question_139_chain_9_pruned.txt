Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that two compounds, A and B, are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. Each reaction produces a different diketone. My job is to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when you treat certain compounds with HCl, NaNO2, and water, it's often related to diazotization reactions, but wait, wait. Diazonium salts are usually formed from aromatic amines, right? Or maybe this is about something else. Oh wait, another possibility: the Beckmann rearrangement. I think Beckmann rearrangement involves oximes. When you have an oxime, treating it with HCl and water might lead to a rearrangement to form a ketone. But wait, the products here are diketones, so maybe the starting materials were diols or something else.

Wait, another thought. I've heard about the treatment of amines with nitrous acid, HCl, and water. For example, in the production of nitro compounds or diazonium salts. But in this case, the products are not nitro compounds but diketones. Maybe it's the hydrolysis of an imine or some kind of amide?

Wait, another possibility: the production of ketones via the hydrolysis of epoxides. But under what conditions? Epoxides typically hydrolyze with acid or base, but I'm not sure if that would produce diketones.

Wait, I think I'm on the wrong track. Let's think about the reagents: HCl, sodium nitrite, and water. Oh wait, sodium nitrite and HCl in acidic conditions are used to form nitrous acid (HNO2). So perhaps the starting materials are alcohols or amines that react with nitrous acid to form certain intermediates which then undergo some rearrangement.

Wait a second, there's the Stephen reduction which uses HCl, NaNO2, and H2O, but that's for the reduction of ketones to aldehydes. No, wait, the Stephen reduction uses HCl, NaNO2, and then something else like H2O or another acid. Or maybe
