Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm. Let's see, I remember ESPRESSO is used on the VLT, which is a big telescope. The question is about the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. Need to reach at least 10.

First, the stars are options a to f. I think I need to figure out each star's detectability based on their magnitudes and distances. Wait, the ESPRESSO's sensitivity or how bright the star needs to be for a certain S/N must be a factor here.

I recall that the signal-to-noise ratio depends on the brightness of the star. Brighter stars (lower magnitude) will have a higher S/N. The formula for S/N is something like S/N = (flux) / (noise). Flux is proportional to the star's brightness. But how does that translate into whether they'll have S/N >=10?

Wait, the ESPRESSO instrument's sensitivity. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, but its sensitivity depends on the brightness of the star. I think it can observe stars down to a certain V magnitude. Like, maybe about 15 or so? Because I've heard that the VLT can see pretty faint objects, but for spectroscopy, the brightness is a limiting factor.

Wait, the question gives specific stars. Let's list them:

a) Canopus â€” I think Canopus is
