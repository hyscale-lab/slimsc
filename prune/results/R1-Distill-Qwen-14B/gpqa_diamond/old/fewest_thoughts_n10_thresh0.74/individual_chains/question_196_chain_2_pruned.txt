Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, in a regular (non-relativistic) harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². At maximum speed, these are equal, so v = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's option C. But wait, the question is about a relativistic oscillator, so I can't just use the classical formula. Relativistic effects change things because as speeds approach the speed of light, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

In relativity, the kinetic energy is given by (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So instead of the classical approach, I need to consider relativistic energy.

Let me think about energy conservation in the relativistic case. The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but wait, no. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator increases as the amplitude increases, so I think the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved.

But wait, in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², right? Because Hooke's law is non-relativistic, F = -kx. So the potential energy is the integral of that, which is (1/2)kx², just like before.

So the total energy E of the oscillator is (1/2)kA², because that's the potential energy at maximum displacement (x=A), where velocity is zero. At that point, all the energy is potential. Then, when the mass passes through the equilibrium position (x=0), all that energy converts into kinetic energy. But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv², so I need to calculate the kinetic energy as (gamma - 1
