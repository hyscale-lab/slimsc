Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to unpack it. Alright, so the question is about an atomic nucleus that undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value obtained using a classical approximation.

First, let me jot down the given data. The initial nucleus has a rest mass M with rest-mass energy 300 GeV. When it fissions, it splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other, so let me denote the masses. Let's say the lighter fragment has mass m, so the heavier one is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M, which is 0.99M.

So, m + 2m = 3m = 0.99M → m = 0.99M / 3. Let me compute that. 0.99 divided by 3 is approximately 0.33, so m ≈ 0.33M, and the heavier fragment is 0.66M. Wait, but wait: 0.33 + 0.66 is 0.99, which matches the given sum. So m is approximately 0.33M and 2m is about 0.66M. 

But wait, the initial nucleus's rest mass is M, and after fission, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99M. So the mass defect is 0.01M. That means energy is released, right? Because in fission, some mass is converted into energy.

In a nuclear reaction, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 (heavier, 0.66M) and v2 (lighter, 0.33M). Since momentum is conserved, m1*v1 = m2*v2 (but wait, I'm mixing up the notation here. Wait, the heavier fragment has mass 2m, which is 0.66M, and the lighter is m,
