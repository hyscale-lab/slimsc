Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model extension and calculating the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson through radiative corrections. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

First, the problem gives a Lagrangian with some terms. Let me parse that. The Lagrangian has terms like i bar{N_R} gamma^mu partial_mu N_R, which looks like a Dirac term for a singlet fermion. Then there's (1/2)(partial phi)^2, so that's the kinetic term for a scalar phi. The term |D^mu S|^2 suggests that S is a scalar doublet with some gauge interactions, so it's probably in the SU(2) symmetry. Then there are interaction terms: - y_i /2 phi bar{N_i R}^c N_i R^c. Oh wait, N_i R is a singlet, so this is a Yukawa coupling between phi and the right-handed neutrinos? Not sure, but I think that's the case.

The scalar fields are phi, S, and H. Wait, the potential V(phi, S, H) is given, but I don't know the exact form. The vacuum expectation values are given as <phi> squared equals x^2 + v^2, and <phi> is x, <h> is v. Wait, but in the Standard Model, the Higgs field h gets a vev v. So here, phi has a vev x, and h has vev v. So I'm guessing that phi and h are two different scalars, maybe part of a larger field setup.

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons typically come from spontaneous symmetry breaking where a global symmetry is broken, leading to massless bosons unless there's some explicit symmetry breaking. But in the Standard Model, the Higgs mechanism gives mass to the W and Z bosons, and the Higgs field itself has components that become massive. So in this model, perhaps there's an extra scalar field which leads to a new pseudo-Goldstone.
