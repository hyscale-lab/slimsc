Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroidal with the symmetry along the z-axis. So it's like a prolate spheroid maybe, like an American football shape. Because it's oscillating, it radiates energy. The wavelength is λ, and in the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, the angle from the z-axis.

The maximum power is A, and they're asking two things: what's the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and what's the form of function f in terms of λ dependence.

Wait, the options give possible fractions (like 1/2, 1/4, etc.) and possible λ dependencies (like λ^-4, λ^-3, etc.). So I need to figure out both parts.

I remember that the radiation from a dipole antenna, for example, has a radiation pattern that depends on the angle. The intensity in the far field (radiation zone) for an oscillating dipole varies with the cosine squared of the angle. Wait, or is it the sine? Let me think. Oh right, for a dipole, the radiation is maximum at the equator (θ=90 degrees) and minimum along the axis (θ=0 or 180). So the intensity pattern is proportional to sin^2 θ. But wait, that was for a dipole's radiation, right? But what about a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating?

Wait, the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating. So maybe it's similar to a dipole oscillation but spheroidal. Alternatively, perhaps it's a quadrupole or something else. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a dipole-like radiation pattern.

Wait, another approach: the power radiated per unit solid angle (intensity) for an oscillating dipole is given by something like I = ( (μ0 μ_e^2 ω^4 ) / (12 π c^3) ) * sin^2θ, where μ_e is the electric dipole moment. So the intensity is maximum
