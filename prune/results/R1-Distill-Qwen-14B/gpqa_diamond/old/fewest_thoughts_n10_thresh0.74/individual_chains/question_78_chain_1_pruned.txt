Okay, so I've got this problem about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, let me see. The question is about a point charge q moving with some trajectory, and we need to find the scalar and vector potentials at a certain time and position.

Wait, I remember that the potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field. Oh right, the potentials are usually expressed in terms of the charge and current distributions.

So the scenario is that the charge is moving, and the field is observed at a later time. The vector d is from where the field was generated to the observation point r. So, the charge was at some position at time tr, and the field generated then propagates to r, which is a distance away.

I think the scalar potential for a moving charge would be similar to the static case but modified because the charge is moving. In the static case, the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, there are other factors due to the time delay and possibly the velocity.

The vector potential A is related to the current, but in the case of a moving charge, the current is the charge times its velocity. Wait, but since the charge is a point charge, the current is J = q v, but only at the position of the charge.

Wait, no, more accurately, the vector potential is given by the Biot-Savart law kind of expression for a moving charge, or more generally from Ampère's law for currents.

Wait, but considering the retarded time, since the charge's position at tr affects the field at t. So the potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at time tr, which is earlier than t.

So for a moving charge, the scalar potential is not just q/(4πε₀ r), because r is the distance from where the charge is now, but the field we're seeing is due to where it was at tr. So maybe I need to consider an expression that accounts for the charge's velocity and the vector d.

Wait, the options have V and A expressions. Let me look at the options.

Option A: V is q/(4πε₀ r), and A is (v²/c²) V. Hmm, that seems off because I don't see the dependence on the vector d here. Also, the units don't seem right. Vector potential should have units of velocity multiplied by something with units of magnetic field or something.

Option B: V same as A, and A is v/c² times V. Hmm, that's interesting. So if V is correct, then A would be (v/c²) * V. Let me think about the units. The vector potential A has units of (velocity × something), perhaps? Let me see: V has units of volts (which is kg·m²/(s³·A)), and A would have units of m/s multiplied by V, but wait that doesn't directly make sense. Maybe I should think in terms of units for each option.

Wait, maybe another approach. The scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v at time tr is given by the Lienard potential expressions. So the scalar potential V would be (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by some factor involving the vector d and the velocity.

Wait, I think the general expressions for the potentials when a charge is moving with velocity v are:

V(r, t) = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ 1 / ( r - (v/c²) t_r ) ]

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Another approach: the scalar potential for a moving charge can be written as:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ (1/(d - (v·d̂) t_r)) ) ] but I'm not sure about the exact form.

Wait, no, the retarded time tr is the time when the field was generated. The distance from the charge's position at tr to the observation point is d. So the scalar potential should be based on the charge's position at tr, but considering that the charge
