Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation means a two-component vector, right? So the spin state is a column vector with components 3i and 4. So that would be |ψ> = [3i; 4], I guess.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula <S_y> = <ψ| S_y |ψ>. Oh wait, but wait, S_y is the spin operator along y. I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators are proportional to the Pauli matrices. So S_y should be (ħ/2) times the Pauli sigma_y matrix. Let me write that down.

The sigma_y matrix is given as:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix. Right? So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

Now, to compute the expectation value, I need to calculate ψ† S_y ψ. Let me write out the components.

ψ is a column vector [3i; 4], so ψ† would be the row vector [3i*, 4*], where * denotes complex conjugate. So 3i* is -3i, and 4* is 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the expectation value calculation becomes:

< S_y > = ψ† * (ħ/2) σ_y * ψ.

Let me compute σ_y ψ first. Let's compute the matrix multiplication.

σ_y * ψ is:
[0*(-3i) + (-i)*4, ... Wait, no, actually, the matrix is 2x2 and ψ is 2x1, so σ_y * ψ would be?

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Let me write the matrix:

σ_y is:

[ 0   -i ]

[ i    0 ]

So when we multiply σ_y by the vector [3i; 4], each component is computed as row of σ_y dotted with the column vector.

First component: (0)(3i)
