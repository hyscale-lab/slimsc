Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me see what it says. The question states that there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that method affects the way we calculate their temperatures.

The planets are in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1 has a period P1, Planet_2 is 2*P1, Planet_3 is 2.5*P1, Planet_4 is 3.5*P1, and Planet_5 is 5*P1. Wait, does the order matter? Like, are they arranged in increasing order of periods? I think so, because the numbers are in the order 1,2,2.5, etc., so Planet_1 is the innermost, right? Because closer planets have shorter orbital periods.

The question asks about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The planets have the same albedo, so albedo doesn't come into play here. That simplifies things because the albedo affects the absorption of sunlight, but if it's the same, we don't have to factor that in.

Equilibrium temperature... I remember the formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet. It's based on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula is something like T = T_star * ( ( L / (16 * π * σ * D² ) )^(1/4) ) or wait, maybe a simpler version when we assume the star is like our Sun. Oh right, the formula is T = T_sun * sqrt(R_sun / (2D)) ), but wait, maybe I should write it in terms of the planet's distance and the star's properties.

Wait, the formula I remember is that the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to ( L / (16πσ D² ) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - A) / 1 )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, D is the distance from the star, and A is the albedo. Since albedo is the same for all planets, A cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the square root of the inverse of their distances squared, but wait, let me think deeper.

Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature formula can be written as T = T_eff * ( ( L ) / (16 π σ D² (1 - A)) )^(1/4) )^(1/2) ? No, maybe I should approach this more methodically.

Wait, the correct formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ), assuming the star's radius is R_star and the planet is at distance D. Alternatively, another version is T_eq = ( L * (1 - A) / (16 π σ D²) )^(1/4). Yes, that makes sense because the star emits L power, the planet absorbs a fraction (1 - A), and the energy is spread over a
