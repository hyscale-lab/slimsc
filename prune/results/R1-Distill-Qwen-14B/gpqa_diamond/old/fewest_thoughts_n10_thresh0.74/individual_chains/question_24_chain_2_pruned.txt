Okay, I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

So, the question is about some mixtures reacting under certain conditions, and we're supposed to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X. The options are A) 16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

First, let's parse the given information.

1. **Mixture X**: An equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has double or triple bonds. So X's components probably have unsaturated bonds. Also, it's an equimolar mixture, so the two liquids are in 1:1 ratio.

2. **Treatment with Platinum when heated**: This leads to a disproportionation reaction, forming mixture Y. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So the starting material must be something that can undergo this.

3. **Mixture Y**: This is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that do NOT decolorize bromine water. So their structures probably don't have double or triple bonds anymore—maybe they're saturated. Also, Y's components are formed from X's via a disproportionation reaction.

4. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**: Both mixtures, when hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon, with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Also, Z is a solvent and doesn't react further with hydrogen. So Z must be a saturated hydrocarbon, probably an alkane since alkenes would hydrogenate further, but Z doesn't react more. But wait, wait, the problem says that mixture Y contains Z. Hmm, no, wait: the question says Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So when Y is hydrogenated, only Z comes out. Oh, but wait, hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. But Y is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each component of Y is hydrogenated to Z. Or maybe Y is something that, when hydrogenated, each part becomes Z. Or perhaps Y has two components that both hydrogenate into Z? That seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe Y's two components are such that each can hydrogenate into the same Z.

Wait, but the problem says hydrogenation of both X and Y gives the same hydrocarbon Z. So, when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, and when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So, perhaps the components of X hydrogenate to Z, and the components of Y also hydrogenate to Z.

But Y is a result of X undergoing a disproportionation. So let's think about possible reactions.

Let me think about possible candidates for X and Y.

Disproportionation reactions often involve elements changing oxidation states. For example, in the case of alkenes, perhaps the reaction isn't straightforward. Wait, but the starting point is X having two liquids that decolorize bromine, meaning they have double bonds. For example, maybe X is a mixture of propene and another double bond compound. But when X is heated with Pt, perhaps a dehydrohalogenation or some rearrangement occurs. Wait, no, Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but in this case, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, wait. Wait, when you have a diene or something, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that might not be the case here. Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of alkenes that when treated with Pt (as a catalyst) undergo some kind of addition reaction, but in the presence of heat, perhaps a rearrangement or isomerization. Or maybe the reaction is a hydrogenation, but in this case, it's a disproportionation.

Wait, but the question says that X, when treated with Pt and heated, undergoes a disproportionation to form Y. So the reaction is a disproportionation, meaning the same element is both oxidized and reduced.

Wait, but in the context of alkenes, perhaps we're thinking of something else. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture containing a compound with a triple bond, like an alkyne. Because alkyne hydrogenation can lead to either alkenes or alkane, depending on conditions. But in a disproportionation, perhaps it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture containing a diene and another diene, but that's maybe not helpful.

Wait, another approach: since both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z, which is an alkane, perhaps X is an alkene, and Y is something else that hydrogenates to the same alkane. But in X, two alkenes?

Wait, but the problem says that X is a mixture of two liquids, and Y is a mixture of two other liquids.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a mixture of an alkene and another compound that can disproportionate. For example, maybe X contains ethylene (ethene) and something else. But I'm not sure about this.

Wait, let's think about Z first. Z is a hydrocarbon with mass fraction of hydrogen 14.28%. Let's find its molecular formula. The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, so let's calculate the molecular formula.

Hydrogen's molar mass is about 1, and carbon is about 12. Suppose the formula is CnHm.

The mass fraction of H is (m * 1) / (12n + m) ) = 14.28% ≈ 0.1428.

So,

m / (12n + m) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = 0.1428*(12n + m)

m = 1.7136n + 0.1428 m

m - 0.1428 m = 1.7136n

0.8572 m ≈ 1.7136n

Divide both sides by 0.8572:

m ≈ (1.7136 / 0.8572) * n

Calculate that: 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.

So m ≈ 2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. Which is an alkene? Because alkenes have formula CnH2n. But Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with H2, so it must be an alkane. Wait, that's a problem. Because if it's an alkene, it would react more with H2. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe Z is an alkane. Let's recalculate.

If Z is an alkane, the formula is CnH2n+2. Let's compute the mass fraction.

Hydrogen fraction is (2n+2) / (12n + 2n +2) ) = (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 0.1428.

So,

(2n +2) = 0.1428*(14n + 2)

Multiply out:

2n + 2 = (0.1428 *14n ) + (0.1428 * 2)

0.1428 *14 ≈ 2, 0.1428 *2 ≈ 0.2856.

So,

2n + 2 = 2n + 0.2856

Subtract 2n from both sides:

2 = 0.2856 → which is not correct. Hmm, that can't be.

Wait, maybe I did the calculation wrong. Let's compute 0.1428 * (14n +2):

0.1428 *14n= 2n (because 0.1428 *14=2), and 0.1428*2=0.2856.

So,

2n + 2 = 2n + 0.2856 → subtract 2n,

2 = 0.2856 → which is not possible. So maybe Z is an alkene.

Wait, but in the problem statement, Z is
