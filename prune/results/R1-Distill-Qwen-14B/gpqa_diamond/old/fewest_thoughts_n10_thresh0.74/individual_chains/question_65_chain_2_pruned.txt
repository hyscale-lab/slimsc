Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to find the major products A and B from each. Then, I have to pick the correct option among A, B, C, D. Let's break them down one by one.

First reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is reacted with THF, KH, H+. What's going on here? I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. So perhaps this is a deprotonation followed by some kind of elimination or cyclization.

Wait, 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, right? So the structure is a spiro ring where the two rings are fused at one carbon. The substituents are a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) and an -ol (alcohol) group on the same carbon.

So, when you treat an alcohol with a strong base like KH, it can deprotonate to form an alkoxide. But wait, in this case, the -ol is on a spiro ring. Deprotonation would likely lead to an elimination reaction. Since there's a double bond nearby (non-5-en), maybe it's a conjugated system.

Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-type rearrangement? Wait, pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol (vicinal diol) is treated with a base, leading to the formation of a carbonyl compound. But in this case, it's a spiro alcohol. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an example of a Cope or Claisen rearrangement, but those typically involve 1,5-dienes or enol ethers. Alternatively, the base could abstract a proton leading to a conjugate elimination, forming a more stable double bond.

Alternatively, considering the structure, perhaps the spiro alcohol upon deprotonation can undergo some kind of cyclization. Let me think about the structure. 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol – that's a mouthful. So the
