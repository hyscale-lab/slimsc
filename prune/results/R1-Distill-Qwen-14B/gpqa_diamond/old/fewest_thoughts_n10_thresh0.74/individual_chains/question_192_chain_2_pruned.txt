Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the electric field outside a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let's see. The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The cavity isn't at the center because the centers are separated by a distance s. So, the conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R.

Now, they've placed a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so I remember from my physics class that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it is zero. But when you put a charge inside the cavity, charges will redistribute on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces.

Oh right, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge. Since the cavity has +q, the inner surface must have -q so that the conductor remains uncharged overall. But wait, noâ€”wait. The conductor itself is uncharged. Oh, wait, no. The conductor is neutral, but the charge inside the cavity induces charges on the inner surface. Because the conductor is neutral, the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then the outer surface must have +q to balance, so the total remains zero.

So, the cavity has +q, the inner conductor (the part of the conductor near the cavity) has -q, and the outer conductor has +q. But wait, no. Wait, the conductor as a whole is uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because +q (cavity) induces -q on the inner conductor to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the conductor's net charge is zero, so the outer surface must have +q.

Wait, but the conductor is initially uncharged. So when you put +q in the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to keep the total conductor's
