Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The production energy is 8 GeV, the mass is 1.2 GeV, and the width is 320 MeV. The options are given as A to D, but I'm not sure yet which one is correct.

First, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and they can decay pretty quickly. The mean decay distance would relate to how far the meson travels before decaying. I think this involves some kind of lifetime calculation because the distance is velocity multiplied by lifetime.

Wait, the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right! The uncertainty principle comes into play here. The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, right? So τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, I think I might have that backwards. Let me think: Γ is the energy uncertainty, so the uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ, and the uncertainty in time Δt is ħ/(ΔE) → so τ is approximately ħ/(Γ). Yeah, that's right.

So, to find the lifetime τ, I should compute τ
