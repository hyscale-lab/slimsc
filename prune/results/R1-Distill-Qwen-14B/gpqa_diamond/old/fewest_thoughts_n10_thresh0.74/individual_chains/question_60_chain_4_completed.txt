Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about space travel and time dilation, right? I remember from my classes that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's because of Einstein's theory of relativity. So, the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast—like, almost the speed of light.

The astronaut is 22 years old, and we want to find out how long it takes for them to reach Earth from their own perspective. Wait, wait, no, the question says, "from the point of view of the astronaut." So we're looking at the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

Let me get the given data straight. The spacecraft's speed is v = 0.99999987 * c. The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud... Hmm, wait, I don't think the distance is given. Oh wait, maybe it's a trick because the question is about the astronaut's own time, which uses the ship's frame of reference.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Time dilation formulas come into play here. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time, τ) is related to the time measured in the Earth's frame (let's say t) by the gamma factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²).

But wait, no, because if we're looking at the proper time for the astronaut, the ship's frame is the one where the distance is contracted. So the time experienced by the astronaut would be less than the time observed from Earth.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. So that's probably a red herring because the astronaut is 22 and we're looking at how long it takes from their perspective. But perhaps the 150 years relates to their lifespan from Earth's perspective, but since the astronaut is young, maybe the trip would take longer than their lifespan as seen on Earth. But no, the question is about the astronaut's own time.

So, to calculate the proper time τ, we can use the time dilation formula:

τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

But wait, in what frame is t measured? Because if the astronaut is moving at v relative to Earth, then from Earth's perspective, the time taken is t = distance / v. But the astronaut's own time is shorter. But wait, in this case, the distance would be contracted in the astronaut's frame, so the distance is shorter, and the time is shorter.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, when v is almost c, gamma is very large.

Wait, v is 0.99999987 c, which is very close to c. Let's compute beta = v/c = 0.99999987. Then, beta squared is approximately (0.99999987)^2. Let me approximate that. Let's compute 1 - beta².

Wait, 1 - beta² = 1 - (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. Let me think: (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². So 1 - x ≈ 2(1 - x) when x is close to 1. Wait, no, perhaps using binomial expansion. Let x = 0.99999987. So x ≈ 1 - 2.3e-7. So x² ≈ (1 - 2.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(2.3e-7) + (2.3e-7)^2. The (2.3e-7)^2 is negligible. So, x² ≈ 1 - 4.6e-7.

Then, 1 - x² ≈ 4.6e-7. So sqrt(1 - x²) is sqrt(4.6e-7). Let me compute that. Hmm, sqrt(4.6e-7) is approximately sqrt(4.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, no, sqrt(4.6e-7) is sqrt(4.6)*sqrt(1e-7) = approx 2.14 * (1e-3.5). Because sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 0.000316227766. So 2.14 * 0.0003162 ≈ 0.000677.

So gamma is 1 / 0.000677 ≈ 1477. So gamma is approximately 1477.

Wait, that's a rough calculation, but let's see. Alternatively, perhaps a calculator approach would be better. Let me compute v = 0.99999987 c.

Compute 1 - v²/c²:

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 0.99999987 as 1 - 0.00000013. So (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00000026, ignoring the tiny square term.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.00000026. Taking the square root of that: sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4. Because sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.162e-4. Wait, wait, 1e-7 is 10^-7, so sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.162e-4. So sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) ≈ 1.612 * 3.162e-4 ≈ approximately 5.099e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1960. So gamma is approximately 1960.

Wait, that's more accurate than my first estimate. So gamma is about 1960. Hmm.

Now, the problem is that the time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time. But what's the time from Earth's frame? Let's say the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud is D. But wait, the problem doesn't say. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, no, the problem states that the Large Magellanic Cloud is the home of the civilization, and Earth is the destination. But the distance isn't given. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the time from the Earth's frame is such that the astronaut would age a certain amount. But without the distance, I can't compute the time. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, maybe the question is intended to use the 150-year average lifetime as a clue. Because if the astronaut is 22, and their lifespan is 150 years, maybe the trip takes longer than that from Earth's perspective but less from their own.

Wait, but the problem is asking how long it takes from the astronaut's perspective, so it's the proper time. But without the distance, how can we compute that? Oh, wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the distance is one parsec, or perhaps it's using the time it would take at speed v, but again, without the distance, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again.

The question: How long will it take from the astronaut's perspective? So I need to calculate the proper time τ for the trip.

But to compute τ, I need to know the time experienced on Earth (t), and then τ = t / gamma.

But without knowing the distance, I can't compute t. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the distance is the same as the speed of light multiplied by the time experienced on Earth. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the time for the trip from Earth's perspective is t = D / v, but we don't have D. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have us ignore the distance and compute using the speed, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, wait, perhaps I've made an error. Let me think again: the astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 years. So, according to Earth, the astronaut would have about 150 - 22 = 128 years left. But if the trip takes longer than that from Earth's perspective, the astronaut would die before reaching Earth.

But from the astronaut's perspective, the trip is shorter. So maybe the trip time from Earth's frame is longer than 128 years, meaning the astronaut would die before reaching Earth. But that's the opposite of the question's intent.

Wait, no, the question is asking how long it takes from the astronaut's perspective. Let's say from Earth's perspective, the trip takes t years. Then the astronaut's experienced time is τ = t / gamma. But if t is, say, 100 years from Earth's frame, then τ would be about 100 / 1960 ≈ 0.05 years, which is about 19 days. But that doesn't match the options given.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Wait, the problem says that the spacecraft is designed to reach Earth. So maybe the distance is the same as the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth, which I think is approximately 160,000 light-years. Wait, no, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. So if the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, the time from Earth's perspective would be t = D / v.

So D is approximately 160,000 light-years. Let's compute t:

t = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987 c) = approximately 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + (160,000 * 0.00000013) ≈ 160,000 + 20.8 ≈ 160,020.8 years.

Wait, that's a very long time from Earth's perspective. So the time experienced by the astronaut would be τ = t / gamma. Gamma is ~1960, so τ ≈ 160,020.8 / 1960 ≈ about 81.6 years.

Wait, that's about 81 years. So the astronaut, who is 22, would experience about 81 years, making their age 22 + 81 = 103. But according to the average lifetime of 150 years, they would live long enough to reach Earth. So the answer would be option C) 81 years.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.99999987 c.

beta = v/c = 0.99999987.

beta squared = (0.99999987)^2 = let me compute this accurately.

Compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987. Let's think in terms of (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x², where x is 0.00000013.

So (0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00000026, since x² is negligible.

So 1 - beta squared ≈ 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - beta squared) = sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1960. So gamma ≈ 1960.

Now, D is the distance to Earth: approximately 160,000 light-years.

Time from Earth's frame: t = D / v = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c) = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 0.00000013) ≈ 160,000 + 20.8 ≈ 160,020.8 years.

Then, the astronaut's proper time τ = t / gamma = 160,020.8 / 1960 ≈ let's compute this.

160,020.8 / 1960 ≈ let me compute:

1960 * 81 = 1960 *80=156800, 1960 *1=1960; total 158,760.

1960 *81 = 158,760.

160,020.8 -158,760= 1,260.8.

1,260.8 /1960 ≈ 0.642.

So τ ≈81.642 years.

So approximately 81.6 years. So the astronaut would experience about 81.6 years, which is option C) 81 years.

But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. So their age upon arrival would be 22 +81.6 = 103.6 years. Their average lifetime is 150 years, so they would live long enough to reach Earth. So the answer is option C.

Another angle: perhaps the problem is asking about the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time. So using the formula:

tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Alternatively, tau = t_earth / gamma.

So t_earth is the time it takes from Earth's perspective. Which we calculated as about 160,020.8 years. So tau is 160,020.8 / 1960 ≈81.6, which is option C.


To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we need to account for time dilation due to the spacecraft traveling at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), where \( c \) is the speed of light. The astronaut's experienced time, known as proper time (\( \tau \)), is related to the time measured in Earth's frame (\( t \)) by the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \)):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed of the spacecraft is \( v = 0.99999987c \). First, compute \( \beta = v/c = 0.99999987 \). Then, calculate \( \beta^2 \):

\[
\beta^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 1 - 2(0.00000013) = 1 - 0.00000026
\]

Thus:

\[
1 - \beta^2 \approx 0.00000026
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \beta^2} \approx \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 5.099 \times 10^{-4}
\]

So:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \approx \frac{1}{5.099 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1960
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time from Earth's perspective (\( t \))
The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( D = 160,000 \) light-years. From Earth's frame, the time taken for the spacecraft to reach Earth is:

\[
t = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \times 1.00000013 \approx 160,020.8 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the astronaut's proper time (\( \tau \))
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:

\[
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} = \frac{160,020.8}{1960} \approx 81.6 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
The astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey. From their perspective, the trip takes approximately 81 years, making their age upon arrival \( 22 + 81 = 103 \). Since the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey and reach Earth.

### Conclusion
The time it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth, from their perspective, is approximately **81 years**.
