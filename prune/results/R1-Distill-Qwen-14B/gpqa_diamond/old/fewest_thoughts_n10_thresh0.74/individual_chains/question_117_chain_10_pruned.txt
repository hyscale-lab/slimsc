Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So, I should go through each of the given compounds and check if they have any chiral centers.

The question lists four compounds, and the options are combinations of them showing optical isomerism. Let's think about each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that causes the molecule to be chiral. Biphenyls can have something called cis-trans isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. But optical isomerism specifically refers to chirality, which is about the 3D arrangement. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or a different kind of asymmetry, like in allenes or certain bridged compounds.

In this case, the substituents are on the biphenyl rings. Let me visualize: each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The dimethyl ester groups are on the 2 positions of each ring, and the nitro groups are on the 6 positions. So, the biphenyl has two rings connected by a single bond. If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it might have a plane of symmetry or not. Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetrical, maybe there's a chiral center?

Wait, no. Wait, the biphenyl itself isn't a chiral center. But the arrangement of the substituents could lead to a situation where the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think: the molecule is dimethyl 6,6',dinitro... so each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each ring has two substituents, but are they arranged symmetrically?

If each ring has the same groups in the same positions, then when you look at the whole molecule, it might be symmetrical. Wait, but if the substitu
