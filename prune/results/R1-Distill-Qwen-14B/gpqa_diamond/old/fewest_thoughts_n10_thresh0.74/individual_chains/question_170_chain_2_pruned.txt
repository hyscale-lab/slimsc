Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again. The question says that an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4), and we need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given as A to D, and they involve some multiples of hbar/25 or hbar/2, so I think the calculation will involve fractions and hbar.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose (bra) of the state multiplied by the operator matrix, then multiplied by the state (ket). So the formula is ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, right?

Wait, but the state here is given as (3i, 4). Wait, in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually column vectors. So the state vector ψ would be a column vector with two components. So ψ = [3i; 4]. Or wait, sometimes I've seen them written as row vectors, but I think in this context, when applying operators, we need to treat them as column vectors. So ψ is a two-component column vector, with the first component 3i and the second component 4.

The operator for S_y is given as σ_y multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices are the spin matrices multiplied by 2ħ, right? Wait, no, wait. The Pauli matrices, σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are each 2S, where S is the spin operator. So S_y = (σ_y * ħ)/2. Or wait, I think I might have that reversed. Let me think. The spin matrices S are ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. So S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, etc. So that's correct.

So the operator S_y is (ħ/2) times the given σ_y matrix. The σ_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

So to find the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ.

Wait, but wait, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. So that's ψ† S_y ψ. Let's compute that.

First, let's write down ψ as a column vector:

ψ = [3i; 4]

So
