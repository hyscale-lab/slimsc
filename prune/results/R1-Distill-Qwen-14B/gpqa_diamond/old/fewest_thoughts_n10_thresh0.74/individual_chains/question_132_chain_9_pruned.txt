Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let's see what it says. The question is about a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

Hmm, I remember that in aromatic compounds, the protons can be deshielded due to electron withdrawal, which shifts their signals downfield. So the signals around 6.7 ppm are probably aromatic protons. Since there are two singlets, that suggests each compound has a certain symmetry, leading to equivalent aromatic protons.

The molecular formula is C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C10H14, each degree is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=4. So 4 degrees. Benzene has 3 (from the ring) plus 1 from each double bond, but wait, wait. Benzene has three double bonds, so that's three degrees. The fourth would be another ring or double bond. Oh, but wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So substituents would be C4H8. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps each compound is a tetramethylbenzene, which would fit C10H14 because benzene (6 C) plus four methyl groups (4*1 C) = 10 C. Each methyl is CH3, so four of them contribute 4*(3H)=12 H. Benzene has 6 H. 12+6=18 H. But the molecular formula is C10H14. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait. C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. If it's a tetramethylbenzene, each methyl is -CH3. So four methyl groups would add 4 C and 12 H. So total C: 6 +4=10. H:6 (from benzene) +12=18. But the formula is C10H14. So that doesn't match. So maybe each compound is not a tetramethylbenzene but something else. Wait, perhaps it's a diethyl group? Let me check.

Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups attached to the benzene ring. Each ethyl is -CH2CH3. So benzene (6 C) + 2 ethyl (2*2 C=4 C) totals 10 C. That matches. For hydrogen: benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl brings 5 H (since one H is attached to the benzene). Wait, wait. Each eth
