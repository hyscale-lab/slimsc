Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The problem gives me the matrices for the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think are the standard basis vectors here since P_z is diagonal.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, this is the state vector ψ.

The question is asking for the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So, I need to find ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Wait, but wait. Since P_z is an operator, and the state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors, maybe there's a simpler way. Oh right, in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is just the eigenvalue corresponding to the state. But wait, no. Because the state is given as an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the state is not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z, which means ⟨P_z⟩ won't be zero, but the uncertainty can be non-zero.

So I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, this might be easier.

Let me note down the matrix for P_z. It's given as:

P_z = [[ ħ, 0, 0 ],
       [ 0, 0, 0 ],
       [ 0, 0, -ħ ]]

So, the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. Each corresponds to the eigenvalues for the basis vectors |1>, |2>, |3>, assuming the basis is ordered as such.

The state ψ is the column vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Wait, let me check: the first element is -1/2, second is 1/√2, third is -1/2.

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Breaking it down:

⟨P_z⟩ = (-1/2) * ħ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ)
= (-ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2)
= (-ħ/2 + ħ/2) = 0. Oh, so the expectation value is zero. That's interesting.

Now for ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² would be [[ ħ², 0, 0 ], [0, 0, 0 ], [0, 0, (ħ)^2 ]]. Wait, no, because (-ħ)^2 is ħ², so P_z² is [[ ħ², 0, 0 ], [0, 0, 0 ], [0, 0, ħ² ]].

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ would be the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z². Wait, no, more accurately, each component of ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z², then summed.

So, each element a_i in ψ is multiplied by (P_z²)_ii.

So,

⟨P_z²⟩ = ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ² + ( (1/√2)^2 ) * 0 + ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ²
= ( (1/4) ) * ħ² + (1/2) * 0 + (1/4) * ħ²
= (1/4 + 1/4) ħ²
= (1/2) ħ².

So now, ΔP_z squared is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 = (1/2 ħ²) - (0)^2 = (1/2) ħ².

Taking the square root, ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The state ψ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So, for ⟨P_z⟩, it's:

ψ† P_z ψ.

Which is each component of ψ multiplied by the corresponding diagonal P_z element, summed.

So,

( (-1/2) * ħ ) + ( (1/√2) * 0 ) + ( (-1/2 ) * (-ħ) )

= (-ħ/2) + 0 + ( ħ/2 )

= (-ħ/2 + ħ/2) = 0. So yes, that's correct.

Now for ⟨P_z²⟩:

Each component squared (since the squared terms will be summed with the squared P_z eigenvalues).

Wait, no, wait. When you compute ψ† P_z² ψ, it's each component of ψ multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z squared.

So, the diagonal elements of P_z² are (ħ)^2, 0^2, ( -ħ )^2 → ħ², 0, ħ².

So,

⟨P_z²⟩ = ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ² + ( (1/√2)^2 ) * 0 + ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ²

= (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* ħ²

= (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² → (1/2) ħ².

So, then ΔP_z = sqrt( 1/2 ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2). So, the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is hbar/sqrt(2), which is the correct answer.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal:
\[
P_z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\hbar
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state of the system is given as the column vector:
\[
\psi = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1/2 \\
1/\sqrt{2} \\
-1/2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = (-1/2)(\hbar) + (1/\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\hbar).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\hbar/2 + 0 + \hbar/2 = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:
\[
P_z^2 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \hbar^2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = (-1/2)^2 (\hbar^2) + (1/\sqrt{2})^2 (0) + (-1/2)^2 (\hbar^2).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = (1/4)\hbar^2 + 0 + (1/4)\hbar^2 = (1/2)\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]
Substitute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = (1/2)\hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{(1/2)\hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{(1/2)\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
