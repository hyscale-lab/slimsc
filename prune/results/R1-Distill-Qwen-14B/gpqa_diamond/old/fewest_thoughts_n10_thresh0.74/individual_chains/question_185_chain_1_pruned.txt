Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian represents the energy of a system, and its eigenvalues correspond to possible energy measurements.

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. Oh right, the dot product here means the sum of each component multiplied together. So, σ · n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z, right?

Wait, but Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. Each σ_i (i=x,y,z) is a 2x2 matrix. So when you take the dot product with n, you're essentially combining them into a single 2x2 matrix. That makes sense.

I need to find the eigenvalues of this H matrix. I remember that for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, and the determinant is ad - bc for a matrix [[a,b],[c,d]]. The eigenvalues are (Tr ± sqrt(Tr² -4Det))/2.

But wait, another thought: for a spin-½ system, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues related to their properties. Specifically, each Pauli matrix σ_i has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But when you take a linear combination like σ · n, maybe the eigenvalues change.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the expectation value. The operator σ · n represents the spin component in the direction of n. Since spin operators have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually multiplied by ħ/2 in the spin operator. Oh, because the actual spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So maybe in this problem, the Hamiltonian is written in terms of σ, but perhaps without the ħ/2 factor.

Wait, let's read the problem again. H is ε multiplied by σ · n. So H = ε (σ · n). The σ matrices are 2x2, but they have eigenvalues ±1. So when you have σ · n, which is a combination of Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues would be ±1, because each Pauli matrix contributes that. Then multiplied by ε, the eigenvalues would be ±ε.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Because I remember that the spin in a particular direction has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So perhaps in this problem, ε already includes any constants. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the trace and determinant of H. Let's see. H is ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Each Pauli matrix has trace zero, because σ_x, σ_y, σ_z each have diagonal elements 1 and -1. So when you take a linear combination, the trace of H would be zero as well.

What about the determinant? The determinant of σ · n: each Pauli matrix has determinant -1, but when you take a linear combination, it's not straightforward. Wait, actually, for any Pauli matrix σ_i, the eigenvalues are ±
