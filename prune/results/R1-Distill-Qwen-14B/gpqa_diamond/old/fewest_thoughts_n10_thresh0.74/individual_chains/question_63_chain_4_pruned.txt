Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule switches to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, the molecule is diatomic, so it's something like X-Y. The masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. Oh right, the energy levels are quantized. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is probably the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

But wait, what's the next state after the fundamental? I think the molecule can transition to the next higher energy level, which would involve either a vibrational or rotational change. But since the question is about the "next state with the lowest possible energy," I think it's the next higher state, which might be a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes.

Wait, the "fundamental" state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be when either v increases or J increases, whichever requires less energy. But wait, the problem says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's the first excited state, which is the next energy level after the ground state.

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by a combination of both. The energy for each state is E = E_rot + E_vib. The ground state is v=0, J=0. The next possible state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But which transition requires less energy?

Wait, what's the energy of each transition. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the first vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1) requires an energy of h w. For rotation, the
