Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and the Miller indices.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, which I think is a type of hexagonal crystal system? Or maybe it's a special case where all the edges are equal but the angles aren't 90 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral structure, all the lattice parameters a, b, c are the same, but the angles α, β, γ are all equal and not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles are all 30 degrees. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, but in a crystal, the interatomic distance can vary depending on the type of bond and the structure. Oh, but in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be the edge length a. But this is rhombohedral, so maybe the edge length a is 10 Angstroms.

Wait, no. Wait, the interatomic distance might not be the same as the edge length. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is equal to the lattice parameter a. So perhaps for this problem, a is 10 Angstroms.

The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the reciprocal formula. Oh right, the formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - [ (h²)(k²)(cos² α)/(a²) ) + ... ] Wait, no, that's probably not right. Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is more complicated.

Wait, more accurately, the formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is derived from the Miller indices (hkl). The general formula is:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c²) - (2 hk cos βγ/(a b) ) - (2 hk cos αγ/(a c) ) - (2 kl cos αβ/(b c) ) )

But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the angles. Or
