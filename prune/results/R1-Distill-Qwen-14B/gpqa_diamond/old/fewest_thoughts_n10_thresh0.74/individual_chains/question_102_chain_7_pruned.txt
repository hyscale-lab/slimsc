Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this question about a genetic construct and why the green signal isn't showing up in the mice. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

First, the setup: there's a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic means it has two coding regions, so two proteins are expressed from the same vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

Wait, there's more about the vector structure. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. Oh, right, IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so it can drive translation without a strong promoter for the second gene in a bicistronic construct.

Now, between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So these are stop signals that prevent expression unless the Cre recombinase is present to excise them.

The person made antibodies against the proteins and tested expression via Western blot. Actin is used as a loading control, so that's fine. But in the mice, when they cross their homozygous construct mice with SOX10-Cre, they don't see green fluorescence.

SOX10-Cre is a transgenic mouse line where Cre is under the control of the SOX10 promoter. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives, like Schwann cells. So when you cross the mice, Cre should be expressed in those cells, leading to recombination in the construct.

Wait, how does the Cre recombinase affect the vector? The vector uses loxP and lox2272 sites, which are different. LoxP is the wild-type site, and lox2272 is a mutant. Cre can recognize loxP sites but not lox2272. Alternatively, I think that maybe the other way around? Or perhaps using different Cre variants? Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Oh right, the lox2272 site is a mutant version that is recognized by Cre but with altered specificity. The key thing is that Cre will delete the stop cassettes when it recombines the appropriate lox sites.

So for the ligand-mCherry construct: the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. But between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP. So when Cre is present, it should delete this, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together.

Similarly, for the receptor-eGFP, the stop cassette is between them with lox2272 sites. So when Cre is present, that stop cassette should be deleted, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the offspring, they're not seeing any green signal. The eGFP is supposed to be on the receptor. So why isn't it expressed?

Possible options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. That is, they act on different cells. But the question is about expression, not function. So maybe the construct isn't expressed, not the mode of action. So probably not the reason for no signal.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. That would mean the protein isn't getting to the cell surface or wherever eGFP is supposed to be. But the question is about expression, and the problem here is that the reporter isn't being expressed at all, because the Western blot suggests expression (since they checked with the antibodies), or perhaps not. Wait, no, the Western blot was done after plasmid transfection into primary astrocyte culture. So maybe the issue is in the actual mice, perhaps the Cre
