Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. I remember that spin-1/2 particles have magnetic moments related to their spin. Oh right, the magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz, where Sz is the spin in the z-direction.

The problem says the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. So initially, the field is along Z, and the particle is in a state aligned with that, meaning its spin is up along Z. Then, the magnetic field is turned off suddenly, and another one is turned on along +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude B. 

Wait, when the magnetic field is turned off, does that mean the particle's state remains the same? I think so because the system is isolated once the field is off. But then the new field is applied along Y. So the Hamiltonian must change because the magnetic field direction changes.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So I need to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is gamma times the expectation value of Sz, I suppose.

In a magnetic field, the energy levels are given by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian is H = -mu·B. Since mu is gamma Sz, H becomes proportional to Sz. So when the field was along Z, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = gamma B Sz. The energy levels were E = ±(gamma B / 2), I think, because for spin-1/2, Sz can be ± ħ/2. Wait, but wait, mu is gamma times Sz. So perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sz. Or maybe it's H = -mu·B, so since mu is gamma S, then H = -gamma B S·n, where n is the direction of the field.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the spin states. When the field is along Z, the eigenstates are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ along Z. The energies are E_up = (gamma B/2), E_down = -(gamma B/2)? Or wait, wait: the energy is H = -mu·B. And mu = gamma S. So H = -gamma B S_z.

So for spin up, S_z is ħ/2, so H = -(gamma B) (ħ/2), but wait, wait, maybe I should get the signs right. Because mu is in the same direction as the field, so when the field is along +Z, the magnetic moment, which is mu = gamma S_z, is along +Z. So the energy is H = -mu·B. Because the potential energy of a magnetic dipole in a field is U = -mu·B. So H = -gamma B S_z.

So the energies are E = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E = gamma B (ħ/2), but wait, wait, because S_z is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix. Let me clarify. For spin-1/2, S_z can be ± ħ/2.

So H_initial = -gamma B S_z. So the eigenvalues are E = (-gamma B)(± ħ/2) ) => E = ± (gamma B ħ)/2 * (-1) ?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of angular momentum. Alternatively, perhaps using the eigenvalues: the eigenvalues of S_z are ± ħ/2. So when you have H = -gamma B S_z, the eigenvalues are (-gamma B) * (± ħ/2) ) = ∓ (gamma B ħ /2). Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the signs here. Let me think again. The energy is H = -mu·B, and mu = gamma S_z. So H = - gamma B S_z.
