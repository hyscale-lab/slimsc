Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's break it down.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime, tau_0, is 8e-16 seconds. I need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, resolution in this context probably refers to the detection resolution, maybe the spatial resolution needed in the bubble chamber to observe the decay vertices. Because if the decay happens too quickly, the particles won't travel far before decaying, making it hard to detect.

Oh right! The concept here is the proper lifetime versus the observed lifetime due to time dilation. Because particles moving at relativistic speeds will have their lifetimes appear longer in the lab frame compared to their proper lifetime.

The formula I remember is tau = gamma * tau_0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. And gamma is equal to E/(m c²), since E is the total energy of the particle.

Wait, but in particle physics, often E is given in units where c=1, so maybe I don't need to worry about units conversion for c. Let me see: the mass is given in GeV/c², and the energy is 27 GeV. So gamma would be E/(m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV/c² * c²) )? Wait, no, because GeV is energy, and E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²) → but since E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV/c², let's compute gamma.

Wait, E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²). But when you have E in GeV and m in GeV/c², the calculation would be:

gamma = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV/c²) * (1/c²) ? Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of units. If E is in GeV (which is energy) and m c² is in
