Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Let me read the problem again and break it down.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same too, right? Because if T were different, the λ_max would change.

Then, the radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, how does radial velocity affect luminosity? Luminosity is intrinsic brightness, so maybe radial velocity comes into play with Doppler shift affecting observed wavelengths, but since we're told to assume the stars radiate as black bodies and the wavelengths are the same, maybe the Doppler effect is already accounted for in the observed brightness.

Wait, but the question is about the computed luminosity. Oh, right, the luminosity calculation would depend on their intrinsic properties. So maybe the velocities don't directly affect the calculation since the problem says to compute luminosity based on black body radiation. Hmm.

So the formula for luminosity of a star as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same T (because same λ_max), then L is proportional to R². 

Wait, but wait—radial velocity doesn't affect the actual luminosity, right? Because luminosity is an intrinsic property. So the fact that Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s probably affects the observed flux or brightness, but the question asks about the computed luminosity. So perhaps the radial velocity is a red herring here, or maybe it's used to calculate something else, but in this case, the luminosity only depends on R and T.

So Star_1 has R1 = 1.
