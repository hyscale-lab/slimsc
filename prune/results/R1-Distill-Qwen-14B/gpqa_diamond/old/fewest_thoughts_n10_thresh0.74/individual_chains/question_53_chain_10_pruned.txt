Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about determining the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues come from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, the FTIR shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O), so that's one functional group confirmed. Esters also have an oxygen, so the formula will have O2 perhaps because an ester is R-O-C-O-R', so two oxygen atoms in the ester group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It says there are six signals. Let's break down what each signal corresponds to.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substitution pattern will determine the number of unique aromatic protons. For example, in para substitution, there are two sets of equivalent protons. But wait, that's for two substituents. Alternatively, if the substituents are in the meta positions, but wait, a di-substituted ring can have different substitution patterns. Wait, the aromatic ring being 6-memberedâ€”so benzene, maybe substituted with two groups. The number of aromatic protons signals depends on the substitution. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, the protons are equivalent, so maybe two doublets (if the substituents are meta, but that would give more signals). Wait, but the NMR shows two aromatic signals. Hmm. Wait, a di-substituted benzene can have two substituents in the para positions, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. Each set would give a single peak. So two aromatic signals could be due to para substitution.

Wait, but wait. If it's para, then each aromatic H is equivalent, so maybe only one peak, but it's split into a doublet because of coupling. Oh, but wait, in para substitution, the ring is symmetric, so maybe two equivalent sets. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic protons are split into two groups. For example, if one substituent is in the ortho position and another
