Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct reaction sequence to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Breaking it down, the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions of these groups are important. 

Let me visualize the benzene ring. Numbering the positions clockwise, the substituents should be on positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the ethoxy is on carbon 1, tert-butyl on 2, and nitro on 3. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions of the benzene ring, which are adjacent to each other in a meta arrangement. Wait, no, 1,2,3 would be adjacent? Wait, no, 1,2,3 are adjacent in a way that each substituent is next to the others in a row. Wait, benzene is a ring with six positions, so 1,2,3 are adjacent making a sort of 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene in a row.

Wait, but sometimes the numbering can be tricky. Let me think: when you have three substituents, the numbering is chosen to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So, in this case, the substituents are at 1,2,3 positions, which are all adjacent. So the molecule would have a tert-butyl group at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. So, all three substituents are adjacent in a row.

So the challenge is to plan the synthesis steps to get all these substituents in the correct positions. The starting material is benzene.

Now, the options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to determine which sequence leads to the desired product.

Let me think about the possible reactions and their directing effects. The
