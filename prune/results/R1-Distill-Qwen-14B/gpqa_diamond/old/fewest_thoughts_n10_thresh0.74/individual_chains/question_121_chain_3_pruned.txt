Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about reacting a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate, specifically Me2CuLi. The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. I need to figure out what product forms when it's treated with Me2CuLi.

First, I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically attack epoxides in a ring-opening reaction. In such reactions, the nucleophile (like the methyl group from Me2CuLi) will add to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Also, in disubstituted epoxides, there's an inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks.

Wait, the question specifies that in disubstituted epoxides, inversion occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. So in such cases, the configuration (R or S) at that carbon flips.

Looking at the structure of the starting material: it's a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane system with a 7-oxa group, meaning there's an oxygen in the ring. The substituents are at positions 1,3,4, and 6. The configuration is (1R,3R,4R,6S). So the epoxide ring is part of this bicyclic structure.

Wait, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has two rings: a four-membered and a one-membered (which doesn't make sense, maybe I'm getting that wrong). Alternatively, the numbering is such that the bridge positions are at 1,3,4,6. Hmm, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is in a six-membered ring? Wait, no, it's bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, so the main ring has seven atoms with bridges. Let me think: bicyclo[m.n.p], where m is the largest bridge. So bicyclo[4.1.0] would have bridges of 4, 1, and 0? Or wait, I'm getting a bit
