Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says: If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, calculate the net potential energy of this system. The options are A, B, C, D.

I remember that when dealing with potentials and conducting spheres, image charges might come into play. Oh right, for a grounded conducting sphere, the charge induced on it will arrange such that the potential on the surface is the same everywhere.

Wait, the charge q is placed outside the sphere. So the sphere being conducting will have induced charges. Since it's grounded, the potential at the surface is zero. Or wait, no, the potential is the same as the surrounding, which is Earth's potential. But in these problems, the ground is considered to be at zero potential. So the sphere's potential is zero.

But how does that affect the potential energy of the system? The potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position near the sphere, considering the induced charges. Alternatively, it's the work done by the external field on the induced charges plus the work stored in the configuration.

Wait, but when a charge is placed near a conductor, the induced charges on the conductor create an image charge. For a conducting sphere, the image charge method might be useful here. I think the image charge for a point charge outside a sphere is given by some formula.

I recall that the image charge concept says that a point charge q outside a conducting sphere (radius R) can be replaced by a charge -q' inside the sphere, but I might be mixing it up. Or perhaps the sphere's induced charge is such that the potential due to both the charge and the induced charges is the same as if the image charge were present.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at its surface is zero. So the potential at infinity is zero as well. Oh wait, no, the sphere's potential is the same as the Earth's, which is our reference point (zero), so the potential at infinity is also zero. So the system's potential energy would be the work done in assembling the charges.

I think the potential energy U can be found using U = (1/2) q V, where V is the potential at the location of q due to the sphere. But wait, because the charge q and the sphere's induced charges contribute to the potential.

Alternatively, the image charge method might be better. For a conducting sphere, when a charge q is placed at a distance d from its center (d>R), the image charge inside the sphere is such that the potential on the surface is zero. Wait, the image
