Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's a multiple-choice question with two reactions, and I need to figure out the major products for each. Let's break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane, KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different products A and B.

Starting with the first reaction. I remember that when a ketone reacts with an acrylate ester under basic conditions, it's likely a conjugate addition or maybe a Michael addition. Wait, no, wait. Wait, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So maybe the reaction is a Claisen or aldol addition? Hmm.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclic ketone. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1, right? And the substituents are at 2, 2, and 6. So the molecule is a substituted cyclohexanone.

The other reactant is ethyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOEt. So it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. In the presence of a base like t-BuOK, I think this is a Michael addition scenario. Michael addition is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile adds to the beta position of an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, but wait. The ketone here is a cyclic ketone. Could it act as an enolate? Or is the ethyl acrylate the Michael donor? Let me think. In the presence of a strong base, maybe the acrylate is deprotonated to form an enolate, but wait, acrylate is already an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So perhaps the ketone is acting as the Michael acceptor, and the acrylate is the donor.

Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition where the cyclohexanone's enolate attacks the acrylate. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexanone is undergoing some kind of cycloadd
