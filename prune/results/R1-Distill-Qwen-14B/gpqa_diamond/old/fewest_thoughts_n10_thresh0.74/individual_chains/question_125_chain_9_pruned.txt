Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I need to find the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy.

Wait, I remember that in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². The energy levels are quantized, right? And for each energy level, there's a degeneracy, meaning multiple eigenfunctions share the same energy.

So the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0,1,2,...). But wait, I think n actually represents the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. So E = ħω(nx + ny + nz + 3/2). Or maybe it's better to think about it in terms of the principal quantum number. I think there's a formula where the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers.

Wait, no, maybe the correct way is that the energy levels are grouped by the sum n = nx + ny + nz. Each energy level corresponds to a specific n. So the energy is E = ħ ω (n + 3/2). But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. For 3D, each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them up gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each of the three directions.

So the energy levels are (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = nx + ny + nz. Each value of n corresponds to a certain energy level. Now, the ground state is when nx=ny=nz=0, so n=0, E=(0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be when n=1, which can be achieved by having one quantum number as 1 and others 0. So the energy is (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω.

Wait, but the question is about the third excited state. Hmm, so I need to clarify what the ground state and excited states are in this context. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=0. Each time n increases by 1, the energy increases. So the first excited state is n=1, second is n=2, third excited state is n=3. Wait, no, wait. Because in some contexts, the ground state is considered the zeroth excited state. So the first excited state is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3, etc. Yeah, that makes sense. So the third excited state is when n=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω.
