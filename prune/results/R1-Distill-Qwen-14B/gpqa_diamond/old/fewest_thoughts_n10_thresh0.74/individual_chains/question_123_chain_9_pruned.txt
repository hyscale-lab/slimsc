Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think through this step by step.

The problem says that the supernova's ejecta is moving towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames, which means no acceleration involved. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's super fast! Oh right, the speed is 6e4 km/s. 

The question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So we're dealing with time and distance between different reference frames.

Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving relative velocity and possibly time dilation, but wait—if the frames are inertial, it's just a matter of relative velocity. Oh wait, no, because in special relativity, time dilation comes into play when there's relative motion. But wait, are we considering that here? Because if the frames are moving at a high speed relative to each other, the time experienced in each frame will differ.

Wait, the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during that time. Or wait, no—wait, wait. Let me read the question again.

"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

Oh, right. So the time measured in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. We need to find how much the ejecta has moved in the galaxy's frame during that same time. Hmm, but how does time in one frame relate to the other?

Wait, no. Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at some speed. Let me think about it. Let's denote the speed of the ejecta relative to the galaxy as v. From the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards it at v. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v as well, but that's not quite right because in reality, velocities don't just reverse in direction; you have to consider relative motion correctly.

Wait,
