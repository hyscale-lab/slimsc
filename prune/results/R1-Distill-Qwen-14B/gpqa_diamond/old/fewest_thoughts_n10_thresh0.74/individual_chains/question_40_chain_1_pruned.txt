Okay, so I've got this question about two chemists talking, and I need to figure out what the second chemist means when he says, "my compounds are on top of each other." Hmm. Let me think about this.

I remember that in chemistry, when something is 'on top of each other,' it might be related to how molecules arrange themselves. Wait, maybe it's about how compounds come together in a mixture. Oh, right! When compounds have similar properties, they might not separate easily. 

Looking at the options, let's go through each one. Option A says similar polarities. Polar molecules would dissolve in each other, maybe leading to a solution rather than layers. But how does that relate to being on top? Not sure yet.

Option B mentions non-covalent or van der Waals interactions. Those are weak forces that can cause molecules to stick together. If the compounds have these interactions, maybe they form a solid or stick to each other, making it hard to separate them. So if a chemist's compounds are sticking, that could mean they're bonding weakly.

Option C talks about similar boiling points. If two compounds have the same boiling point, they might not separate during distillation. So when you try to isolate them, they stay mixed. That could make the compounds hard to separate, hence they're 'on top of each other' in the same phase.

Option D is about optical rotations. That's about the direction in which plane-polarized light is rotated. I don't see how similar optical rotations would cause the compounds to stick together or be on top of each other physically. They can have the same rotation but still separate.

So the question is, why would the compounds be on top? Maybe it's about their physical state. If they have similar boiling points, perhaps when you try to isolate them via distillation, they don't form separate layers. They remain in solution or vapor together, making it hard to separate them. Alternatively, if they have similar polarities, maybe they mix together in a solution, not layering. 

Wait, the phrase "on top of each other" might imply they are layered, like in a mixture. So if two compounds have similar densities, they might form a single layer, not separate. But that's not one of the options. The options given are about polarity, interactions, boiling points, or optical rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about chromatography. In chromatography,
