Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question is about the uncertainty in energy of an electron. The given data is that the electron is traveling at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Hmm, I remember something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Oh right! It relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The principle says that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is at least h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π). 

Wait, but how does that relate to energy uncertainty? Oh, right! Because the momentum p is related to kinetic energy. The kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So, if I can find the uncertainty in momentum Δp, I can find ΔE.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Use the Uncertainty Principle to find Δp.
2. Use the momentum-energy relation to find ΔE.

So, first step: Calculate Δp.
The formula is Δp ≈ h/(4πΔx). Because I think the minimum uncertainty is when the equality holds, so Δp = h/(4πΔx).

Wait, but I need to make sure about the units. Let's see, Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. The position uncertainty is 0.1 nanometers. Oh, nanometer is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m.

Plugging in the numbers:
Δp = (6.626e-34 J·s) / (4 * π * 1e-10 m)
Let me calculate that denominator: 4 * π is about 12.566. Multiply by 1e-10 gives 1.2566e-9.

So, numerator is 6.626e-34, denominator 1.2566e-9. Let me compute 6.626e-34 / 1.2
