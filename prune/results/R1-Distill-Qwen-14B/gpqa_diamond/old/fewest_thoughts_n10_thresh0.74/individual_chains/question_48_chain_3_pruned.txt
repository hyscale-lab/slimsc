Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I've just started learning about these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that cyclohexanone undergoes a series of reactions, and I need to find out how many distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Let me outline each step.

First step: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. I remember that ketones can undergo various reactions, but when they react with bromine, it might be a halogenation. Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Oh right, bromine can add to the carbonyl in a nucleophilic addition, but wait, the conditions matter. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, another possibility is that the ketone undergoes a bromination via a conjugate addition or maybe a ring-opening, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, wait. Another thought: in the presence of bromine, maybe it's an enolate formation. No, wait, cyclohexanone when treated with a halogen like Br2 in a certain solvent might undergo a dibromination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromohydrin formation. Alternatively, maybe it's a diels-alder reaction, but that's under different conditions. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe it's a bromination through the enol. So, cyclohexanone can enolize, and Br2 can add across the double bond. So, that would form a dibromocyclohexane? Or wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone group; adding bromine might lead to a bromo alcohol. Wait, no, another thought: perhaps the bromine adds to the carbonyl group. So, the ketone (O=C-) would react with Br2. The mechanism would involve the carbonyl oxygen attacking Br2, leading to a bromohydrin? But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromide addition. Wait, maybe the reaction is the bromination via the enol. So, the enol form would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. So, adding Br2 would lead to a vicinal dibromide. Oh, right, that's a possibility. So product 1 would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Because the
