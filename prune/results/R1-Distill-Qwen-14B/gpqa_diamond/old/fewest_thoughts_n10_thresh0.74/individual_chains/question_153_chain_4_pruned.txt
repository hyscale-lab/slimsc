Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question deals with the Michael addition reactions, which I remember is a type of conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

The problem has three different reactions labeled A, B, and C. Each has a set of reactants, and I need to find the major products. Then, I have to match these products with the options provided to find the correct answer.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). The product is labeled A.

I recall that in a Michael addition, the nucleophile (usually enolate) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Here, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because its enolate form is stabilized. The other reactant, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2-CO-OCH3 attached to a p-tolyl group. Wait, no, actually, the structure is CH2-C(C6H4-p-tolyl)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw that. The acrylate is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or wait, no. The acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So the structure should be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 where the CH2=CH group is attached to the carbonyl. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is at the 3-position. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So, when it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would have a substituent on the beta carbon. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The numbering: for acrylate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, the carbonyl is at carbon 3. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. But that can't be right because the carbonyl is at carbon 3. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-t
