Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, okay, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh right, it's the Lagrangian term for the interaction between the boson field X and fermions. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decay channels at the lowest order.

So, first, I remember that when a boson decays, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible decays depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions it can decay into.

The Lagrangian provided seems to involve X interacting with fermions. The term is written as something like -λ f ψ_f (ν + X) ψ_f. Wait, maybe I should think about what kind of interaction this is. It looks like a Yukawa coupling because it's a scalar (boson) interacting with fermions. So, the interaction term is something like X ψ ψ, which would mean the boson X can mediate the process of a fermion and an antifermion annihilating or creating the boson.

But wait, the given Lagrangian has (ν + X), but I'm not sure what ν represents here. Oh wait, maybe that's a typo or a notation issue. Alternatively, perhaps it's the field strength, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be something else. Maybe I should focus more on the mass and possible decay products.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, any fermions that it can decay into must have a combined mass (since the boson is at rest, the fermion pair must have a combined rest mass less than or equal to 6 GeV). But wait, in reality, the rest mass of the pair must be less than the mass of the boson because energy and momentum have to be conserved.

Wait, but each fermion has its own mass. So, for a decay X → f f̄, the sum of the fermion's rest mass must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Oh wait, no: each fermion must have a rest mass less than or equal to half of X's mass because in the rest frame of X, each fermion would have some kinetic energy as well. Wait, no, actually, for the decay to be kinematically possible, the rest mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to the mass of X divided by 2. Because when the boson is at rest, the fermion and antifermion would each have energy, but their rest mass must be less than or equal to the available energy. So, m_fermion ≤ m_X / 2.

So, let's calculate. m_X is 6 GeV, so m_fermion ≤ 3 GeV.

Now, let's look at the known fermion masses. The masses of the quarks and leptons are as follows (approximate):

- Up-type quarks: u, c, t. u is about 2 MeV, c is ~1.3 GeV, t is ~173 GeV.
- Down-type quarks: d, s, b. d is ~3 MeV, s is ~95 MeV, b is ~4.5 GeV.
- Leptons: e is ~0.5 MeV, mu is ~0.1 GeV (105.7 MeV), tau is ~1.78 GeV.

Wait, wait, let me get exact numbers.

Wait, let's list the masses:

Quarks:
- u: ~2.2 MeV
- d: ~3.3 MeV
- s: ~95 MeV (about 0.095 GeV)
- c: ~1.3 GeV
- b: ~4.5 GeV
- t: ~173 GeV

Leptons:
- e: ~0.511 MeV
- mu: ~105.7 MeV (~0.1057 GeV)
- tau: ~1.777 GeV
- neutrinos: very light, perhaps negligible. But in this problem, the interaction term has (upsilon + X), where upsilon is maybe the vacuum expectation value? Or perhaps it's a typo, and it's just X. Hmm, not sure, but probably not relevant for the decay products.

So, the fermions that X can decay into must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6/2=3 GeV).

Looking at the fermion masses:

- e: 0.5 MeV → yes, way below 3 GeV.
- mu: ~0.1 GeV → yes.
- tau: ~1.78 GeV → yes, under 3 GeV.
- d: 3.3 MeV → yes.
- s: 95 MeV → yes.
- c: 1.3 GeV → yes.
- b: 4.5 GeV → no, since 4.5 >3 GeV. So b quarks are out.
- t: 173 GeV → way too heavy.
- Similarly, any other fermions? Maybe neutrinos, but their mass is negligible, so X → ν ν̄ would be possible, but the interaction term may not involve neutrinos. Let me look again at the interaction.

The interaction term is given as: -λ f ψ_f (upsilon + X) ψ_f. Hmm, maybe this is a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the term is more correctly written as X ψ̄ ψ. So, the interaction would be X coupling to a fermion and its antifermion.

Wait, but the notation is a bit confusing. The term is written as -λ f ψ_f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Perhaps it's supposed to be X ψ̄ ψ. So, the term is X ψ̄ ψ, which would make sense for a Yukawa interaction.

So, the interaction is X coupling to fermions ψ_f. So, X can decay into any fermion-antif
