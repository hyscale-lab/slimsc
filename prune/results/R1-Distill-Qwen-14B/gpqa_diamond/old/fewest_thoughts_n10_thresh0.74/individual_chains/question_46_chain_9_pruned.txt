Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene?

Hmm, Grubbs catalyst. I remember that Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means the redistribution of alkene bonds, right? So Grubbs can cause the alkene to break and reform in different ways.

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene... Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a methyl branch on the third carbon of a five-carbon chain. Let me count: the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Carbon 3 has a methyl group. So structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be a methyl on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula of 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? No, wait. Let me think again. The pentene has five carbons. Position 1 is the first carbon of the double bond. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3 normally for pent-1-ene. But with a methyl on carbon 3: so carbon 3 is CH(CH3). So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait that's six carbons. Oh wait, no. Wait, pentene has five carbons in total. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between 1 and 2. So carbon 1 is CH2, carbon 2 is CH-, carbon 3 is CH(CH3), and then carbons 4 and 5. Wait, but how many carbons? Let's see: positions 1,2,3,4
