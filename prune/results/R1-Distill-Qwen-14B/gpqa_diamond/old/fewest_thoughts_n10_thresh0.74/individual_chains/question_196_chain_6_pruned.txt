Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, I guess we have to consider the effects of special relativity, like how mass increases with velocity.

Wait, right, the problem states that it's a 1-dimensional oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the force is like a spring. The mass is m, and the maximum amplitude is A.

In the classical case, the potential energy at maximum displacement (A) is (1/2)kA². That gets converted into kinetic energy (1/2)mv_max² at the equilibrium position, so v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic problem, so C can't be the right answer. So maybe the answer is something else.

Relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore because of the gamma factor. The total energy E should be gamma times mc². So in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude.

Wait, wait, wait. Or is the total energy the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy? Because the oscillator's
