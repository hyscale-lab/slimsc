Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are several steps involved, each with some hints provided. I'll need to think through each step carefully.

First, let me outline the reaction steps as given:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints provided are:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options for E are A to D, each a different cyclic ketone.

Let me start by analyzing the reaction steps and the hints.

Starting with hint a: A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. I remember that ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, which form alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. So, the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a ylide would give an alkene.

Looking at the product, 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The "propan-2-ylidene" part is the group attached. The substituents on the cyclopentane are at positions 1,2,4. So, the structure would have two methyl groups (probably) at positions 1 and 2, and the propenylidene group at position 4.

Wait, the Wittig reaction forms an alkene. So the starting material for the ylide reaction would be a carbonyl compound (like a ketone or aldehyde), which reacts with a ylide (like a phosphorus ylide) to form an alkene.

So, if the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, that suggests that the carbonyl group was part of a cyclopentane ring. Let me imagine the structure.

The starting compound A, when reacted with HCN, forms B. HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So, A is probably a ketone or aldehyde, since HCN would add to the carbonyl.

Wait, if A is a ketone, then when HCN is added, it would form a cyanohydrin. So, the product B would be a cyanohydrin.

Then, compound B is reduced with H2 over Pd. Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. If B is a cyanohydrin, which has a hydroxyl group and a cyano group adjacent, reducing it would add hydrogen across the double bond (if any) or perhaps break the nitrile?

Wait, wait. Let me think. If A is a ketone, reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin. For example, cyclohexanone reacting with HCN gives cyclohexane cyanohydrin, which has an -OH and -CN group on adjacent carbons.

Then, when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, what happens? I'm a bit confused. Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation, typically for alkenes or alkynes. But B is a cyanohydrin, which doesn't have a double bond. Wait, but maybe the initial step forms a double bond from the Wittig reaction. Let me think again.

Wait, I might have gotten the steps wrong. Let's reevaluate.

Wait, the reaction steps are:

A → (HCN) → B → (H
