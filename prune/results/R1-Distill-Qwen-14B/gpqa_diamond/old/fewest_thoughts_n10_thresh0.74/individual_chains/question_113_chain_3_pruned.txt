Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy data. The options given are four different chemical formulas. I remember that for such problems, each spectroscopic technique gives specific clues that can help narrow down the possibilities.

So, the techniques used were FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me go through each of these one by one and see what information they provide.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-ยน. I recall that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching. That could mean the compound has either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group, or maybe something else with an -OH stretch. But carboxylic acids have a very strong, broad peak, while alcohols are a bit less broad but still prominent. Another possibility is that it's an amide or something else, but those are less likely given the options.

Then, it mentions two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-ยน. Those are in the range for carbonyl groups. The 1700 is probably a C=O stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700, so maybe another carbonyl group? Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a conjugated carbonyl compound. Alternatively, it could be an absorption from an amide (but I don't see any options with N), but that's probably not relevant here.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR: it says there are several peaks, including ones corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound must have at least one double bond. The presence of vinyl protons suggests an alkene group. Depending on the splitting and integration, that could tell us about the structure, but without the actual NMR data, I'll have to rely on other info.

Then, the Mass Spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is an important mass. Let me think, what fragments have a mass of 45? Well, the molecular ion could break down in certain ways. For example, a common fragment is the CH3CO+ ion, which has a mass of 43 (but wait, 45 is a bit higher). Alternatively, maybe breaking off a methyl group (15) and leaving a larger fragment. Or perhaps a carbonyl group contributing.

Wait, 45 could be the fragment from a ketone or another carbonyl containing group. Let me think about possible structures.

Now, let's look at the possible formulas:

Options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So, the
