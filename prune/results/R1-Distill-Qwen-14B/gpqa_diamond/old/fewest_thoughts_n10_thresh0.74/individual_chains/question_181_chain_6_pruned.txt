Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but let me think through this.

Right, the pp chain in the Sun's core produces a lot of neutrinos, right? I remember that the proton-proton chain has a few branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, and there's also pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, the question specifies that only the pp-III branch stops. So the other branches continue as normal.

Neutrinos are produced mainly via the beta-plus decay in these reactions. For the pp-III branch, the process involves two protons fusing to make deuterium and then capturing another proton to form helium-3. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the steps. Let me think: the pp-III branch is when a helium-3 nucleus captures two protons to make carbon-5, which then decays into beryllium-5 and emits a positron and a neutrino. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, the pp-I branch is the most common, producing a helium-4 nucleus. The pp-II and pp-III are minor branches.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces a neutron, which quickly captures a proton to become deuterium. But it's a minor part of the overall fusion. So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos from that branch would stop.

But the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands
