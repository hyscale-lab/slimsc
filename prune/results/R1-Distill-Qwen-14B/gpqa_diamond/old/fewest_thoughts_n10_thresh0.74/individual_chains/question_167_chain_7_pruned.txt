Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I need to find the non-Gaussianity (nG) for a specific state when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

Wait, the state is given as a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. Oh right, |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? So I remember that coherent states are Gaussian states. But when you have a superposition of them, especially with different phases, it can become a non-Gaussian state, like a Schrödinger cat state.

The problem asks for the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

First, I need to find the density matrix rho for the given state |psi>. The state is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Wait, for phi = -pi/4, let's compute sin(2phi). 2phi is -pi/2, and sin(-pi/2) is -1. So N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2)).

Let me calculate that. exp(-2*(0.25)) is exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So inside the sqrt: 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

So the state |psi> is a normalized state. Now, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. Let's write that out. Expanding it, we get:

rho = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N * [cos(phi)<alpha| + sin(phi)<-alpha|]/N.

Multiplying that out, rho = (1/N²) [cos²(phi) |alpha><alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + sin(phi) cos(phi) |-alpha><alpha| + sin²(phi) |-alpha><-alpha|].

Hmm, okay. Now, the reference Gaussian state, tau, I think is the closest Gaussian state to rho. Since the state is a superposition of two coherent states, the closest Gaussian might be a thermal state or another coherent state, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the mixture of |alpha><alpha| and |-alpha><-alpha| with certain weights. Because the state rho is a pure state, but it's a superposition, so maybe the reference Gaussian is the state that minimizes the relative entropy, which would be the Gaussian state closest to rho in some sense
