Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of a certain operator for a spin-half particle. Hmm. Let me start by understanding what's given and what's being asked.

The particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So I think that's the state vector, right? And the up and down states are eigenstates of σ_z, which is the Pauli z-matrix. Oh, wait, I remember that σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. So when you measure σ_z, you get either +1 or -1, but here we're dealing with expectation values.

The operator we need to find the expectation value of is 10σ_z +5σ_x. So the expectation value is the average outcome if you measured this operator many times on the given state. Hmm.

I think the formula for the expectation value of an operator O is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. Right, so I'll need to compute this for each term in the operator, then add them together.

Let me break it down. The operator is 10σ_z +5σ_x. So the expectation value will be 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩. That makes sense because expectation values are linear, so I can compute each part separately and then combine them.

First, let's compute ⟨σ_z⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σ_z, this part should be straightforward.

The state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me check: 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. Wait, but 0.25 + 0.75 is 1, so that's a valid quantum state.

The expectation value of σ_z is straightforward because when you're in an eigenstate, the expectation is the eigenvalue. But here, ψ is a superposition. So perhaps I should compute it by expanding the expectation.

Alternatively, since σ_z |↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩ and σ_z |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩, then ⟨ψ| σ_z |ψ⟩ would be the sum of coefficients squared times their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, let's write it out. Let me denote the coefficients as a and b. So a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2.

⟨ψ|σ_z |ψ⟩ = |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1) ?

Wait, no. Because σ_z acts on |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so when you compute ψ† σ_z ψ, you get a^* a (σ_z for |↑⟩) + b^* b (σ_z for |↓⟩) plus some cross terms? Oh wait, no, because when you have ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, then σ_z ψ = a σ_z |↑⟩ + b σ_z |↓⟩ = a (1)|↑⟩ + b (-1)|↓⟩. So the expectation value is a a* (1) + b b* (-1), which is |a|^2 *1 + |b|^2*(-1).

So let's compute that.

a is 0.5, so |a|^2 = 0.25. b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that's the expectation for σ_z.

Wait, no wait, because σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, right? So when the state is |↑⟩, it's +1; |↓⟩, it's -1. So yes, your calculation is correct. So ⟨σ_z⟩ is -0.5.

Now, the next part is ⟨σ_x⟩. Hmm, that's a bit trickier. Because σ_x is the Pauli x matrix, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, not σ_x. So I can't directly say that the expectation is just a sum of |c_i|^2 times the eigenvalues of σ_x for each state. Because those states are not eigenstates of σ_x; instead, the eigenstates of σ_x are the |+⟩ and |−⟩ states, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

So I need to compute ⟨σ_x⟩ in another way. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value directly by expanding the operator.

The Pauli x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which I'll take as the standard basis, σ_x is represented as:

σ_x = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

So when I apply σ_x to the state ψ, which is a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, I get a|↑⟩⟨↓|ψ⟩ + b|↓⟩⟨↑|ψ⟩.

Wait, let's compute σ_x |ψ⟩:

σ_x (a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩) = a σ_x |↑⟩ + b σ_x |↓⟩.

Now, σ_x |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, because σ_x flips the spin. Similarly, σ_x |↓⟩ is |↑⟩. So,

σ_x |ψ⟩ = a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩.

So ψ is a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, and σ_x ψ is a|↓⟩ + b|↑⟩.

Now, the expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ is ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩.

Which is (a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓|) (a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩).

Let me compute this inner product:

= a* a ⟨↑|↓⟩ + a* b ⟨↑|↑⟩ + b* a ⟨↓|↓⟩ + b* b ⟨↓|↑⟩.

But ⟨↑|↓⟩ is 0, and ⟨↑|↑⟩ is 1, same for ⟨↓|↓⟩. So this simplifies to:

a* a * 0 + a* b *1 + b* a *1 + b* b *0.

So it's a* b (1) + b* a (1) = 2 Re(a* b).

Wait, because a and b are complex numbers, but in this case, they are real. So a* =a and b* =b.

So it's 2 a b.

Wait, let me compute that. Because a and b are real, so a* = a, b* = b.

So it's 2 (a b) because a* b + b* a = 2 a b.

Wait, but wait, let's compute each term:

⟨ψ|σ_x |ψ⟩ = a a* ⟨↑|↓⟩ + a b* ⟨↑|↑⟩ + b a* ⟨↓|↓⟩ + b b* ⟨↓|↑⟩.

Which is 0 + a b* (1) + b a* (1) + 0.

Since a and b are real, this is a b + a b = 2 a b.

So the expectation value is 2 a b.

Wait, but wait, in this case, a is 0.5, and b is sqrt(3)/2.

So a*b = (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) ) = (sqrt(3))/4.

So 2 a b is 2 * (sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866...

Wait, but sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So the expectation value of σ_x is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh, wait, in this scenario, a is 0.5 and b is sqrt(3)/2. So 2 a b would be 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) )= (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.866. So yes.

So ⟨σ_x⟩ = 2 a b = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but wait a second. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but for σ_x, the expectation can be any real number between -1 and 1, right? Since the maximum possible expectation is 1 when the state is an eigenstate, etc.

Wait, but in this case, the expectation is sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866, which is within that range, so that seems okay.

So now, going back to the original operator: 10 σ_z +5 σ_x.

The expectation value is 10 ⟨σ_z⟩ +5 ⟨σ_x⟩.

We have ⟨σ_z⟩ = -0.5, and ⟨σ_x⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So 10*(-0.5) is -5, and 5*(0.866) is approximately 4.33.

Adding them together: -5 +4.33 = -0.67, approximately.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.8660254.

So 5 * 0.8660254 = approx 4.330127.

So 10*(-0.5) is -5. So -5 +4.330127 ≈ -0.66987 ≈ -0.67.

Wait, but the options are given to one decimal place, so the possible answers are:

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

Hmm, but -0.67 is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Because the second decimal is 6, which is more than 5, so -0.67 rounds to -0.7.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me double-check all my steps because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

Compute ⟨σ_z⟩:

= |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1) = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Correct.

Compute ⟨σ_x⟩:

As discussed earlier, it's 2 a b, which is 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) )= 2 * (0.5 * 0.866) )= 2 * 0.433 = 0.866. So, yes, the expectation is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So 10σ_z contributes 10*(-0.5)= -5.

5σ_x contributes 5*(0.866) = 4.33.

Sum: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Rounded to one decimal: -0.7 (since 0.67 is closer to 0.7 than to 0.6, but wait, when the next digit is >=5, we round up. So 0.67 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal. But wait, 0.67 is actually 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place because 0.67 is closer to 0.7 than to 0.6.

Wait, wait, actually, when the first decimal is 6, the next digit is 7, which is more than 5, so you round up. So 0.67 becomes 0.7 when rounded to one decimal. But wait, -0.67 would be -0.7, because it's the same in terms of absolute value.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.

But wait, let me check for any computational errors.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using matrix representation.

Let me write the state vector in the standard basis. Since |↑⟩ is [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ is [0, 1]^T, the state ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩ can be written as a column vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The operator is 10 σ_z +5 σ_x.

The Pauli matrices:

σ_z = [[1, 0],[0, -1]], so 10 σ_z is [[10, 0],[0, -10]].

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], so 5 σ_x is [[0,5],[5,0]].

Adding them together, the operator O is [[10,5],[5,-10]].

The expectation value is ψ† O ψ.

Compute ψ† O ψ.

ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† O ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[10,5],[5,-10]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute O ψ:

O ψ = [[10,5],[5,-10]] * [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Compute each component:

First component: 10*0.5 + 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = 5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2.

Second component: 5*0.5 + (-10) * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2.5 -5 sqrt(3).

Now, ψ† times (O ψ) is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by the vector [5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2; 2.5 -5 sqrt(3)].

So,

= 0.5*(5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(2.5 -5 sqrt(3)).

Let me compute each part:

First term: 0.5 *5 = 2.5, 0.5 * (5 sqrt(3)/2 )= (5 sqrt(3))/4.

Second term: (sqrt(3)/2)*2.5 = (2.5 sqrt(3))/2, and (sqrt(3)/2)*(-5 sqrt(3)) = (-5 *3 )/(2) = (-15/2).

So putting it all together:

= 2.5 + (5 sqrt(3)/4) + (2.5 sqrt(3)/2) - 15/2.

Wait, let me write all terms:

= (2.5 + (5 sqrt(3)/4)) + ((2.5 sqrt(3)/2) ) - 7.5.

Wait, 2.5 -7.5 is -5.

Now, the sqrt(3) terms:

5 sqrt(3)/4 + (2.5 sqrt(3)/2) = (5/4 + 2.5/2) sqrt(3).

2.5 is 5/2, so 5/2 divided by 2 is 5/4.

Wait, 5/4 +5/4 =10/4= 2.5.

So the sqrt(3) terms add up to 2.5 sqrt(3).

So the entire expression is:

-5 + 2.5 sqrt(3) ≈ -5 + (2.5 *1.732) ≈ -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So the expectation value is about -0.7, which matches option C.

Wait, but let me compute 2.5 sqrt(3) exactly. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.

2.5 * 1.73205 = approx 4.330125.

Then, -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.

Which is approximately -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So the correct answer is C) -0.7.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) is a superposition with coefficients \( a = 0.5 \) (for \( |\uparrow\rangle \)) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) (for \( |\downarrow\rangle \)). The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(1) + |b|^2(-1).
\]

Substituting \( |a|^2 = 0.25 \) and \( |b|^2 = 0.75 \):

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) does not have \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) as eigenstates. Instead, the expectation value is computed using:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab,
\]

where \( a \) and \( b \) are the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( \psi \). Substituting \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = -0.5 \) and \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 0.866 \):

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
Rounding \( -0.67 \) to one decimal place gives \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
