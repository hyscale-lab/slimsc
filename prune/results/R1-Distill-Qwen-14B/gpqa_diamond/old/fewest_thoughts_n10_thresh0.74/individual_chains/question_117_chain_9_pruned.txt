Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, meaning they're not superimposable on their mirror images. Chiral centers usually come from tetrahedral geometry, where the central atom has four different substituents.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to figure out which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**

Wait, biphenyl compounds can have different conformations, but for optical isomerism, we're looking for something like a chiral center. Oh, wait, biphenyls can have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable. So if the substituents on each benzene ring are arranged so that the molecule isn't a plane of symmetry, it might have optical isomers. In this case, the substituents are at positions 6 and 2 on each ring. Let me visualize: each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', but the substituents on each are in positions that might lead to different configurations. So maybe this compound can have optical isomerism because the biphenyl axis could be a source of chirality. Yeah, axial chirality is a thing, right? So I think compound 1 has optical isomers.

2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

This is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a structure like CH3-C(OH)H-COOH, but since it's an ester, it's probably CH3-O-C-O-CH2-CH2-OH? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with substitution. Oh, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)COO-. So, the structure would be methyl ester, so OMe attached to the carbonyl. So the structure is CH3-C(O-)OCH3, but wait, the hydroxyl is on the adjacent carbon. Wait, maybe it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the carbon chain is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, so the carbon attached to the OH is the second carbon. So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, that carbon (the OH one) is connected to: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH (from the chain). So, four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and the adjacent CH (from the CH3-CH-...). Hmm, that would make it a chiral center. Because four different substituents. So this compound has a chiral center, so it
