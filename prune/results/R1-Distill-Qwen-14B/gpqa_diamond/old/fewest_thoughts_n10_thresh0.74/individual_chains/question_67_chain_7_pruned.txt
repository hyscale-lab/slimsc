Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. I remember that the p orbital has a quantum number l equal to 1. So each electron has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. So the state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. But wait, the total angular momentum quantum number l can't be more than the sum of l1 and l2. Oh right, because l1 + l2 is 1+1=2, so l can be 2, 1, or 0. So in this case, l is 2, which makes sense.

The problem asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ℏ. So each L_z for each electron would be m * ℏ, where m is the magnetic quantum number for that particle. But wait, in the coupled state, the individual m values might be a bit tricky because the state is a combination of different m1 and m2 states that sum up to m_total.

I think the state |l1, l2, l, m> is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators, but not necessarily the individual ones. So to find the probability of getting specific m1 and m2 values
