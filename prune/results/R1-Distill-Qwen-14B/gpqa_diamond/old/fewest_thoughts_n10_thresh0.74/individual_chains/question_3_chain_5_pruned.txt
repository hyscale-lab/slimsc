Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about spin-half particles and expectation values. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the particle is in a superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. And these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Oh right, expectation value is like the average outcome if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems.

Wait, the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩. So I'll need to compute that for this operator.

Let me break down the operator into two parts: 10σz and 5σx. The expectation value will be the sum of the expectations of each part, because expectation is linear. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

First, I'll find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, right?

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So ψ can be written as a column vector. Let me see: |↑⟩ is (1, 0), |↓⟩ is (0,1). So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The expectation value of σz is ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩. Since σz is diagonal with entries 1 and -1, when we compute this, it's just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Alternatively, since σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], the matrix product with |ψ⟩ would be [0.5, -sqrt(3)/2]^T, because when you multiply σz by ψ, the second component flips sign. Then the inner product with ψ is (0.5)(0.5) + (sqrt(3)/2)( - sqrt(3)/2 ). Let's compute that:

0.5 * 0.5 is 0.25. The second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*(-sqrt(3)/2) which is (-3)/4. So 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Alternatively, since the state is a linear combination, the expectation is |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1). Let's see: |0.5|^2 is 0.25, and |sqrt(3)/2|^2 is (3/4). So 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Same result. So that's correct.

Now for σx, the Pauli X matrix. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], which swaps the basis states. The expectation ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Let me compute σx|ψ⟩. σx swaps the components, so [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] becomes [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Wait no, more accurately, when you apply σx to |↑⟩, you get |↓⟩, and to |↓⟩ you get |↑⟩. So σx acting on ψ gives (0.5)|↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩.

Wait, no. Let me think again. σx is a matrix, so:

|↑⟩ = (1,0), so σx|↑⟩ is (0,1) which is |↓⟩.

Similarly, σx|↓⟩ is |↑⟩
