Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group. These three are meta to each other. That probably means each is separated by one carbon, so they're positioned at the 1, 3, 5 positions, but I need to get that right.

Wait, no. Meta means they are separated by two carbons, so each is two positions apart. Wait, for a benzene ring, if two groups are meta, theyâ€™re separated by two carbons. So positions 1, 3, 5 are all meta to each other, or any trio where each is two apart. So perhaps the substituents in the meta positions are the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano. But the question says all meta to one another, so each pair is meta.

But wait, the problem also describes substituents ortho and para to the carboxylic acid. Let me parse that.

The carboxylic acid has ortho substituents: a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Oh, so ortho to the carboxylic acid (which is at position X), are positions X+1 and X-1? Wait, but in a benzene ring, the positions are numbered in a circle. So if the car
