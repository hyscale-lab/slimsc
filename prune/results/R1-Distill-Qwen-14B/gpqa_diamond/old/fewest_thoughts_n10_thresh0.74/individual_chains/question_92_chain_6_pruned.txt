Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm. The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure.

Wait, enthalpy of formation. Oh right, the standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But here, the problem gives me bond energies, so I think I need to use Hess's Law approach. Because normally, the enthalpy of formation is calculated using bond energies of the reactants and products.

So the formula I remember is: 

ΔH°f (product) = sum of bond energies of reactants - sum of bond energies of products.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, I think it's the other way around. Because when bonds are broken, you're putting energy in (endothermic), and when bonds are formed, you're releasing energy (exothermic). So, maybe it's the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Or is it the other way?

Wait, no, let's think again. When forming a molecule from its constituent atoms, the bonds are formed. So for the reaction:

Elements (in standard states) → Compound.

The enthalpy of formation would be the energy change when this happens, which is the sum of bond energies of the product's bonds minus the sum of bond energies of the reactants' bonds. Wait, but wait, the reactants are the elements, which are in their standard states, and they form bonds in the compound. So, to calculate ΔH°f, you take the sum of all bond energies in the product minus the sum of all bond energies in the reactants.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think of a simpler example. For example, H2 (g) + ½ O2 (g) → H2O (l). The enthalpy of formation would be the energy released when forming H2O from H2 and O2. The bond energies would be: breaking H-H and O-O bonds (if any), and forming H-O bonds.

Wait, in this case, the reaction requires breaking the H-H and O-O bonds (but wait,
