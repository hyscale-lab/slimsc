Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. So, the setup is an atomic nucleus at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using the classical approximation.

Wait, okay, let's break this down. The initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after must also be zero. So the momentum of one fragment must equal the negative of the other's momentum. But when it comes to kinetic energy, we have to consider relativistic effects because the energies involved are so high—300 GeV is way beyond non-relativistic speeds.

Wait, but wait. The problem is asking about the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. So I have to calculate both and find the difference.

First, let's figure out the rest masses of the two fragments. The initial sum is 99% of M, which is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. Oh wait, M is the initial mass, so the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99*M, right? Because in fission, some mass is converted into kinetic energy and other forms like radiation or maybe binding energy? Hmm, but the question says to ignore electrons, so maybe that's not a factor here.

Wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, and the sum of the two fragments is 99% of M, so 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the total rest mass after is 297 GeV, which is less than the initial 300 GeV. So the mass deficit would be 3 GeV, which must have been converted into kinetic energy and other forms, but the problem says to ignore electrons, so perhaps that's just the kinetic energy of the two fragments plus any radiation or other products. But the question says the nucleus splits into two fragments and nothing else, so perhaps the entire mass deficit goes into their kinetic energy. But wait, that's not necessarily correct because some energy could go into other forms, but the problem states to ignore electrons, so maybe we can proceed.

Wait, the problem says: 'the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of initial mass M.' So the rest mass after is 0.99*M. So the initial rest energy was M c² = 300 GeV, and after fission, the rest energy is 0.99 M c² = 297 GeV. So the total energy after fission is 297 GeV (rest) plus the kinetic energies of the two fragments. But the initial nucleus was at rest, so initial total energy was 300 GeV. So the energy after must also be
