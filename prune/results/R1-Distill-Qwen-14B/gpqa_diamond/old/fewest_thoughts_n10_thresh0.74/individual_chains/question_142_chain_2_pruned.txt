Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, what does this look like in terms of vectors or points in space?

I think I need to express this ρ in terms of the Bloch sphere. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states. Every pure state can be represented as a point on the surface of a unit sphere, and mixed states are inside it.

Wait, wait. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. For a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture, like a convex combination of projectors. But the given ρ looks like it's a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Since each term is multiplied by 1/2, it's an equal mixture of the two basis states.

So, the density matrix ρ can be rewritten as (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. That's like a classical mixture of the two states. I think this corresponds to a completely mixed state. Because when a qubit is in a completely mixed state, it's like it's in a classical probabilistic state with no quantum coherence.

Now, how does this look on the Bloch sphere? The Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is usually found by taking the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. Oh, right, the Bloch vector r is (x, y, z) where each component is the expectation of the corresponding Pauli matrix.

So, for a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. So if I can express ρ in this form, I can find r.

Let me expand ρ. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a projector. Let me compute each term.

|0⟩⟨0| is a
