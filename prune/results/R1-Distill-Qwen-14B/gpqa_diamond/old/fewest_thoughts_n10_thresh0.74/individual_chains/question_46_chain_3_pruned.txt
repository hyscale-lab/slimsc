Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

Alright, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. I remember that metathesis involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds, specifically the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, when Grubbs is involved, it's probably a ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis, or maybe cross metathesis.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But since the molecule has a double bond, maybe the configuration around it is what's important. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₃, but with a methyl group on the third carbon, so 3-methyl would make it CH₂=CHCH(CH3)₂? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, wait. Wait, pent has five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's five carbons. Let me count: 1 (CH2=), 2 (CH-
