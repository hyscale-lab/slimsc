Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Oh wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P are often related to angular momentum.

Wait, the operator is given for each component: P_x, P_y, P_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices come into play. So P must be something like the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, the problem says to find the eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator in question is the total angular momentum operator along n, which is a vector direction in the x-z plane. So I should probably construct the operator P in the direction of n first.

Right, the general form of a spin operator along a direction n is (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). Since n lies in the x-z plane, the y-component of n would be zero. So n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P along n would be P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given the components:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

But since n is in the x-z plane, we can ignore P_y, right? So P = n_x * P_x + n_z * P_z.

So substituting the matrices:

P = (n_x * (ħ/2) ) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + (n_z * (ħ/2)) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Let me compute that matrix. Let me factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ n
