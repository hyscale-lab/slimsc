Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says. 

Alright, the problem is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for Transit Timing Variation, right? And these planets are in orbital resonance, which means their orbital periods are in some ratio. The periods are given in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 to Planet_5. 

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. They have the same albedo, so that simplifies things a bit because albedo affects how much light they reflect, but since it's the same, we don't have to worry about that factor. 

Equilibrium temperature... I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ d²) )^0.5 ), but wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the inverse square law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance from the star. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. The star's flux at the planet's distance is F = L/(4πa²), and the planet absorbs this with an efficiency based on its albedo. The equilibrium temperature is when the absorbed power equals the emitted power. So, the formula should involve the star's effective temperature, the planet's distance, and the albedo.

Alternatively, a simpler formula I've heard is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25, where A is albedo. But since the albedo is the same for both planets, when taking the ratio, the A terms will cancel out. So in this problem, we can probably ignore the albedo.

Wait, but how does the period relate to the distance? Oh, right, Kepler's third law. The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. Since all orbits are circular, a is the same as the semi-major axis. So for a star with mass similar to the Sun, the period P is related to a by P² = (4π²/GM) a³. But since we're dealing with a ratio of periods, maybe we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes.

Let me write down the given ratios. The periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1 to 5. So Planet_1 has a period P1, Planet_2 has P2 = 2*P1, Planet_3 P3 =2.5 P1, Planet_4 P4=3.5 P1, and Planet_5 P5=5 P1.

But wait, each planet's period is given in the ratio. So actually, we can treat each planet's period as P_i = k * i's ratio value times P1. Hmm, maybe I
