Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Michael addition. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each involves a different Michael addition reaction, and I need to determine the products.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol as the base. 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a sultone? No, wait. Dimethyl malonate is a diethyl ester of malonic acid. So when it reacts in a Michael addition, the enolate acts as the nucleophile. Oh right, the base (NaOEt) deprotonates the alpha position of dimethyl malonate, forming an enolate. Then, this enolate attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

So the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2-CO-OCH3, with the p-tolyl group on the double bond. The enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon (the carbon next to the carbonyl) of the acrylate. 

When the enolate attacks, it will form a new carbon-carbon bond. The product should be a conjugated system where the malonate part adds onto the acrylate. So the product after the addition will have the ester groups from the malonate attached. 

Wait, let me draw it mentally. The acrylate is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=COOCH3. The enolate from dimethyl malonate is a strong nucleophile. The attack occurs at the beta position of the acrylate, which is the CH2 part. So the enolate (from the malonate) adds to the CH2, making a new bond. Then, the oxygen of the ester would have a negative charge, which would pick up a proton.

After the addition, the product would have a bridge structure. The malonate part would have added across the double bond. So the product would be a tricarboxylate. Let me think about the structure. The p-tolyl group is on the acrylate, so after addition, the structure would be something like CH2-C(O)OCH3 attached to the malonate's CH2-C(O)OCH2-... Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the connectivity.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH2CO
