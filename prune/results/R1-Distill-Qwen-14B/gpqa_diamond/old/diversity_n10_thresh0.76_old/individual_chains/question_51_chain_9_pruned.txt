Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The question says that a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics... I remember that when you bring charges together, the potential energy depends on the work done to assemble them. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, that might change things.

Grounding the sphere means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge would flow away. Oh wait, but in this case, the sphere is initially neutral because it's grounded, right? So when I bring a charge q near it, the sphere might induce some charges. Or wait, because it's grounded, maybe it can't hold any net charge. So the sphere remains neutral. Or does the sphere have an induced charge?

Wait, no. Even if the sphere is grounded, when a charge q is placed near it, the charges in the conductor will redistribute. The induced charges on the sphere will be such that the inner surface has an induced charge opposite to q, and the outer surface would have induced charges in response to the grounding.

Wait, no, maybe not. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charge on the inner surface would cause a current until the potential is the same as the ground. So the sphere's inner surface would have an induced charge, but because the sphere is conducting and grounded, the total charge on the sphere must be zero
