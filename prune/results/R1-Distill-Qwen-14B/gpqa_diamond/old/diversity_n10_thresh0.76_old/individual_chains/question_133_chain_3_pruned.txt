Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see what it's asking for.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 0.2 liters since 1 liter is 1000 cm³. The solution contains 1.00 gram of KH2PO4 and 1.00 gram of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We're asked to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form of phosphoric acid, H3PO4. So, H3PO4 can lose three protons in three dissociation steps. The given Ka values are Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12. 

Wait, so the salts we're adding are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's think about their dissociation. 

KH2PO4 (which I think is potassium hydrogen phosphate) would dissociate in water as:
KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-

And Na2HPO4·2H2O (sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate) would dissociate as:
Na2HPO4 → 2Na+ + HPO4^2-

Wait, no, wait. Wait a minute. Let me think again. H3PO4 can lose one proton to become H2PO4^- (the first dissociation), then another to become HPO4^2- (second), and another to become PO4^3- (third). So, phosphate is PO4^3-.

So, if we have H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4), these are adjacent in the dissociation series. 

So, in solution, these two will influence each other because of the acid-base equilibria. So, the solution is a buffer solution? Because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Or wait, no, H2PO4^- is a weak acid (since it's the first dissociation), and HPO4^2- is
