Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions with two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The reducing agents used are LiBH4 and BH3. I'm supposed to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, wait. So reaction 1: A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R) product. Reaction 2: B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S) product. I need to find the starting materials A and B based on their stereochemistry.

Let me think about what these reducing agents do. I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups like ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. But wait, BH3 is another reducing agent. Oh right, I think BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, which are different from simple reduction. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, in this context, maybe both are being used as reducing agents. Wait, maybe they're both being used in a similar way. Let me clarify: LiBH4 is a borohydride reducing agent, which can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. BH3 is another borohydride, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, actually, BH3 is typically a Lewis acid used in hydroboration reactions, but maybe in this context, it's being used as a reducing agent for carbonyl groups. Or perhaps it's another type of reaction. Wait, or maybe LiBH4
