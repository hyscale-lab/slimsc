Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what it says.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The setup is a bit detailed, so I need to parse it carefully.

So, the first thing I remember is that the luminosity of a star relates to its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh wait, right, that's the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 M2. Hmm, but does mass affect luminosity directly here? Or is it a red herring? Well, maybe the mass is related to other factors like temperature, but I'm not sure right now.

The problem also mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the peak wavelengths are equal. I remember Wien's law, which says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2. That's a key point.

Wait, but wait. Oh, no, wait. Wien's law states that the peak emission wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ_max is the same, then T1 must equal T2. So both stars have the same temperature?

Wait, but wait a second. Because the problem says that the stars are radiating as black bodies. So their spectra would follow the blackbody curve, and Wien's law applies. So yes, same λ_max implies same T.

So both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point.

So, given that, let's think about their luminosities. Since L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is the same, L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴) = (R1² / R
