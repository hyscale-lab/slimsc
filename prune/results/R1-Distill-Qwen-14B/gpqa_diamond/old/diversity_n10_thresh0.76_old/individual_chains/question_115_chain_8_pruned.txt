Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about an electron and a positron moving towards each other, colliding, and then annihilating into two photons. The setup is that the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After the collision, both particles annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. Since they're matter and antimatter, their annihilation energy comes from their rest mass and kinetic energy. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics.

First, I should probably think about the conservation laws here. Energy and momentum must be conserved in the collision. So the total energy before collision must equal the total energy after, and the same goes for momentum.

Wait, but photons only carry energy and momentum in the direction of their propagation. So I'll need to calculate the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision and then use that to determine the properties of the photons.

Let me break this down.

The electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right, so they're moving towards each other. Let me set up a coordinate system where the positive x-axis is to the right. So the electron is moving along the positive x direction, and the positron is moving along the negative x direction.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says the positron is moving from the right towards the left. So if I imagine them on a line: electron is on the left moving right, positron on the right moving left. So in my coordinate system, the electron is moving in the positive x direction, and the positron is moving in the negative x direction.

Wait, no, wait. Oh, no. Let me clarify: the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so towards the right. The positron is moving along the same axis from the right, so it's moving towards the left. So, yes, in the same line but opposite directions.

So their speeds are given via Lorent
