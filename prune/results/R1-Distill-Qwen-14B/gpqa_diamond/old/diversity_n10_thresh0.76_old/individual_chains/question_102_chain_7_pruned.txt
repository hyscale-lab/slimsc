Okay, so I have this question about a ligand-receptor pair and a genetic construct setup. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think through it step by step.

So the setup is that someone identified a new ligand and receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein. Monomeric means it's a single subunit, right? It has eight alpha helicesâ€”so four extracellular and four intracellular? Wait, no, the question says four extracellular and three beta sheets forming the binding site. So maybe it's like a G-protein coupled receptor, but I'm not sure. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. Coiled-coil structures are usually for protein-protein interactions, like some signaling molecules.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. So the ligand gene is first, then mCherry. But wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think. Then between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So normally, the ligand is expressed, then the stop cassette prevents mCherry from being expressed unless something removes the stop.

Then the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, which is often used for co-expression of two proteins from a single mRNA. So the ligand and receptor are on the same transcript but are separate ORFs. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which might mean it's expressed in a different way, perhaps more efficiently in certain conditions.

Wait, but actually, IRES elements are often used to drive the expression of a second gene in a bicistronic construct. So the first gene is under a promoter, and the second is under an IRES. So in this case, the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the IRES drives the receptor. So the ligand and receptor are both expressed from the same transcript but as separate ORFs.

But then, the ligand is fused to mCherry. So the ligand would be expressed as a fusion protein with mCherry. Similarly, the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor-eGFP would be a single protein.

Now, the stops: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, lox2272-stop-lox2272. So without Cre, the stops prevent the downstream fluorescent proteins from being expressed. But when Cre is introduced, it would recombine the lox sites, removing the stop so that the downstream reporter is expressed.

Wait, but how does this work exactly? The loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre. The loxP-stop-loxP cassette is a transcriptional stop, so if Cre is present, it would excise the stop, allowing the downstream gene (mCherry in the ligand's case) to be expressed. Similarly for the receptor's part.

So if they have a bicistronic vector, and they use Cre to excise the stops, then both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP would be expressed.

But in the experiment, they transfected primary astrocyte culture with the plasmid, and then used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They did a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin. So both proteins were expressed? Or maybe the expression worked as expected.

Wait, the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So presumably, the ligand and receptor are being expressed, and the Western blot is showing their presence. So the construct works in the culture.

Now, the next part is about the mouse model. They made a mouse homozygous for the construct in the wild-type background. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. It's often used to drive expression in neural crest cells because SOX10-Cre is active in those cells. So the idea is that Cre would be expressed under the control of SOX10, leading to recombination in neural crest-derived cells, like the cells where the ligand and receptor are normally expressed.

So, in the offspring, the Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. Then they visualize the mice under a confocal microscope. But they don't see a green signal, which is from eGFP.

Hmm. Why no green signal?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression, not function. So I don't think this explains the lack of GFP.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent proper expression on the cell surface. So the GFP wouldn't be detected. But why would this happen specifically in the mouse, and not in the transfected astrocytes? Since the construct worked in culture, maybe the mouse has another issue. But I'm not sure if this is the case.

Option C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the construct uses strong promoters (CBA for ligand, IRES for receptor), so maybe they don't need an enhancer. Unless the tissue-specific expression depends on enhancers that aren't present. But wait, the Cre here is SOX10, which is supposed to drive expression in neural crest cells. If the construct doesn't have tissue-specific promoters but relies on the IRES and CBA, which are strong, maybe the problem is elsewhere.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, reading frame is crucial. If the stop cassette is between the receptor ORF and eGFP, and the stop isn't excised, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in the mouse, they crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should excise the stop. Wait, but
