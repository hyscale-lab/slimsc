Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding the question.

The question is in two parts. Part A asks which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism. Part B is about which of the two compounds between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. Then, the options combine A and B choices.

First, I'll tackle part A. I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen and the shift of a double bond, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So, for a compound to exhibit tautomerism, it needs to have a structure where such a shift is possible.

Benzoquinone. Wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic compound, right? It's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Oh wait, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho. Let me think. If it's para, then the two ketone groups are opposite each other. But in any case, does it have any acidic alpha hydrogens? Because without acidic alpha hydrogens, tautomerism isn't possible.

Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups. The alpha carbons are the ones next to the carbonyl groups. So, in benzoquinone, those alpha carbons. Are those alpha hydrogens acidic enough to lose a proton? Because if they are, then enol formation is possible, leading to tautomerism.

But wait, in a quinone structure, the conjugated system might make the alpha hydrogens more acidic. But is benzoquinone capable of enol tautomerism? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at alternate positions (1,3,5), so it's like a tricyclic ketone.

So, for cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl groups is separated by one carbon. So each of the carbonyls has adjacent carbons, which would be alpha carbons. Do such carbons have hydrogens that can be acidic
