Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. But wait, the question gives orbital periods in a ratio, not the distances. Oh right, because orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law.

The planets are in orbital resonance and their periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1 has the shortest period, and Planet_5 the longest. The question is about the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Oh, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, right?

I think the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's semi-major axis. But wait, since all the planets are around the same star, T_star and R are the same for all. So the temperature ratio would depend only on the square root of the inverse of the semi-major axis ratio.

So, first, I need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet_4 and Planet_2. But how? Because Kepler's third law says (P^2)/(a^3) is constant for a given star. So if the periods are in a ratio, then the a^3 would be proportional to P^2. Therefore, a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So for each planet, a_i proportional to P_i^(2/3). So the ratio a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Wait, no. Let me think again. Kepler's third law is P^2 ∝ a^3. So, a ∝ P^(2/3). So if Planet_4 has a period P4 and Planet_2 has P2, then a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

The periods are given as ratios: 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_2 has a period of 2 units, Planet_4 has 3.5 units. So P4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So a4/a2 = (1.75)
