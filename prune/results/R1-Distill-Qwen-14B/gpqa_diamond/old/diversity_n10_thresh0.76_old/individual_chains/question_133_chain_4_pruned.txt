Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on my phosphate equilibria, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C. The Ka values for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. We're to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, HPO4^2-.

Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-? Or is it H2PO4^-? I think orthophosphate usually refers to H3PO4, but I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, no, I think the different forms are called triphosphate, di-, mono-, etc. Hmm, wait. Let me clarify: The various species in solution are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-? Or perhaps H2PO4^- is the primary species.

Wait, the solution contains KH2PO4 (which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus water. So in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, right, because KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, so it gives H2PO4^- in solution. Na2HPO4 is disodium hydrogen phosphate, so it gives HPO4^2-.

So the solution is a buffer solution involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because they are conjugate acid-base pairs. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here, probably.

The Henderson-H
