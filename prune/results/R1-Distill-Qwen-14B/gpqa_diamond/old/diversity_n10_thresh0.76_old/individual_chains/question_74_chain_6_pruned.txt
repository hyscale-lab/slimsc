Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and that probability is constant regardless of how much time has already passed. Oh wait, that's the key here. I think it's called the exponential decay model.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So that's the decay probability given. Now, they say that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. And the question is, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused. So the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, does that affect the probability? Because I thought radioactive decay is memoryless. Like, each atom doesn't know how much time has already passed. So the probability should be based on the remaining time from the current point.

Let me think again. The initial decay probability is 32% over 100 minutes. So the probability of decay in 100 minutes is p = 0.32. But wait, how is this probability calculated? I think it's based on the decay constant multiplied by the time, but maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, another approach: the decay follows an exponential law. The probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. So the probability of decaying by time t is 1 - e^
