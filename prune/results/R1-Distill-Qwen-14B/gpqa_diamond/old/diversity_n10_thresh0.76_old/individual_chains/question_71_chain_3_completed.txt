Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again. 

The question says that there are five exoplanets with circular orbits, found using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All the planets have the same albedo, and we need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16 * pi * sigma * D^2 ))^(-1/4) ), but wait, maybe it's simplified. Oh right, another version is that it depends on the distance and the star's luminosity. 

Wait, the formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but I'm not sure. Oh wait, no, maybe it's the inverse square law and fourth power for temperature. Let me think. The basic formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L / (16 π ε σ D^2 )) ]^(-1/4) ), where L is the star's luminosity, D is the planet's orbital distance, ε is the albedo, and σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since all planets have the same albedo, ε cancels out.

Alternatively, another form is T_eq = T_star * ( (R_star/(2 D)) )^0.5 ), but I might be mixing up some factors here. Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. 

The key point is that the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of the star's temperature and the distance. But wait, when comparing two planets around the same star, their equilibrium temperatures would be inversely proportional to the square root of their distances from the star. Because the further away, the cooler.

So, the formula for the ratio of temperatures T4/T2 would be sqrt( (D2/D4) ), because as distance increases, temperature decreases. Because T is proportional to (1/D)^0.5. So the ratio would be sqrt(D2 / D3?), wait, no, Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, let's get their orbital periods. The ratio is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So let me list them as:

Planet_1: period P1 = 1 unit
Planet_2: P2 = 2
Planet_3: P3=2.5
Planet_4: P4=3.5
Planet_5: P5=5

Wait, but Kepler's third law says that P^2 is proportional to a^3, where a is the semi-major axis (distance from star). So P^2 ∝ a^3 → a ∝ P^(2/3).

So the distance of each planet from the star is proportional to (P)^(2/3). So to find the ratio of distances between Planet_4 and Planet_2, I can compute (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is about equilibrium temperatures, which depend on distance. So T is proportional to (1/a)^0.5. Because higher a (distance) means lower temperature.

So T ∝ 1/(a^0.5). Since a ∝ P^(2/3), then T ∝ 1/( (P^(2/3) )^0.5 ) ) → 1/( P^(1/3) ). So T ∝ P^(-1/3). 

So the equilibrium temperature of each planet is inversely proportional to the cube root of their orbital period.

So the ratio T4 / T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Let me plug in the numbers. P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So P2/P4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

Then, (4/7)^(1/3). Let me compute that.

I know that 0.5714 is approximately 4/7. The cube root of 4 is about 1.587, and cube root of 7 is about 1.913. So 1.587/1.913 ≈ 0.83. Wait, wait, no. Wait, (4/7) is about 0.571, so cube root of 0.571 is approximately 0.83. Because 0.83^3 is roughly 0.57.

Alternatively, compute 0.57^(1/3). Let me think: 0.7^3 is 0.343, 0.8^3 is 0.512, 0.83^3 is about 0.83*0.83=0.6889, then *0.83 again ≈ 0.571. So cube root of 0.571 is 0.83. So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because, if T is proportional to (1/a)^0.5, and a is proportional to P^(2/3), then T is proportional to (P^(-2/3))^0.5 = P^(-1/3). So T ∝ P^(-1/3). So T4 / T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

So the ratio is about 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, let me double-check. 

Alternative approach: Let me assign a base period, say P1=1, so P2=2, P4=3.5.

Using Kepler's law, a ∝ P^(2/3). So a2 = (2)^(2/3), a4 = (3.5)^(2/3).

The ratio a4/a2 = (3.5 / 2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3).

Calculate 1.75^(2/3). Let's see: 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3).

Cube root of (7/4)^2. So cube root of (49/16) → approximately 3.14/2.52 = 1.25. Wait, 49/16 is 3.0625. Cube root of 3.0625 is about 1.45 (since 1.44^3 = approx 3). Hmm, but maybe I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 1.75 = 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3) = (7^(2/3))/(4^(2/3)).

7^(1/3) ≈ 1.913, so 7^(2/3)≈ (1.913)^2 ≈3.66.

4^(1/3)≈1.587, so 4^(2/3)≈ (1.587)^2≈2.5198.

So 3.66 / 2.5198 ≈ 1.452.

So a4 is about 1.45 times a2.

Then, the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(1/1.452) ≈ sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829, which is about 0.83. So same result.

Yes, so the ratio is approximately 0.83, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \( a \), and Kepler's third law states that \( a \propto P^{2/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Combining these, \( T \propto P^{-1/3} \).

Given the orbital period ratios of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planets 1 through 5, we focus on Planets 2 (\( P_2 = 2 \)) and 4 (\( P_4 = 3.5 \)). The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \):

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}
\]

To approximate \( \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \), note that \( \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \). The cube root of 0.571 is approximately 0.83. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures \( T_4 / T_2 \) is approximately 0.83.

Among the given options:

- **A) ~0.57**: Too low.
- **B) ~0.69**: Too low.
- **C) ~0.83**: Correct, matches the calculation.
- **D) ~0.75**: Too low.

The correct answer is **C) ~0.83**.
