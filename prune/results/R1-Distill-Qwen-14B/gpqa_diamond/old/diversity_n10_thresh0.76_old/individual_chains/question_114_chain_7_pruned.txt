Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. 

The question involves two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents for each step from the given options. Let's look at the first reaction.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → secondary alcohol after some steps. Wait, let me think. Oh right, the mechanism is that the nucleophile (CN-) attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. The product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which looks like a cyanohydrin.

So the first step probably involves the formation of a cyanohydrin. The reagent A would be something that provides the acidic conditions needed. Because when you add NaCN to a ketone, you usually have an acid catalyst. So I think the reaction is done under acidic conditions. So A would be something like H3O+ or maybe another strong acid.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, the starting material has a nitrile group, and the product is a carboxylic acid. So what's happening here? The nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid.

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. But what are those conditions? Nitrile hydrolysis typically requires strong acid and heat. Alternatively, maybe using HCl as a catalyst. Wait, the product is a hydroxy acid as well, but the starting material already has a hydroxyl group. Wait no, looking again: the structure is 2-hydroxy... so the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid via hydrolysis. The typical conditions for nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid are using a strong acid, like HCl, under reflux or heat. Alternatively, sometimes you can use H2O with an acid catalyst. So reagent B is probably HCl. Because the product is a carboxylic acid, which is the result of hydrolysis.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes the hydrolysis of nitriles can be done under basic conditions to give a carboxylic acid, but that's typically using H2O and a strong base, maybe like H2SO4 or something else. Wait, no, in basic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylate salts, which then can be acidified to get the carboxylic acid. But in the presence of H2O and acid, perhaps it's an acidic hydrolysis.

Alternatively, maybe it's the hydrolysis using a strong acid. So in the first step, the nitrile comes from the cyanohydrin formation, which requires acid. So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ or another acid.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl
Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH
Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl
Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

So for the first reaction, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. I think the first reaction is done with an acid catalyst, probably H3O+ because that's a strong acid. So the first reagent A is H3O+.

Then for the second reaction, the re
