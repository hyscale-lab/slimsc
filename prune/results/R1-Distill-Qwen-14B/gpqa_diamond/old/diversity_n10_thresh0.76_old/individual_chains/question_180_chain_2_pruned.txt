Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the question again.

So, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm, okay. So, since all the charges are the same sign, I think this is going to involve calculating the potential energy between them, because like charges repel each other, so the potential energy will be positive. But wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So, maybe I should think about whether the system is in a configuration where the potential energy is as low as possible.

Wait, but wait a second. Since all the charges are the same positive charge (each is 2e), they all repel each other. So, the 13th charge at point P is also 2e, and the other 12 are each 2e, and they're all fixed at 2 meters from P. So, each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the fixed charge is 2e. So each of the 12 is contributing to the potential at point P, and vice versa.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Since the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each fixed at 2m away from P, their positions are fixed. So the system's potential energy comes from the interactions between each of those 12 charges and the 13th charge, as well as the interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, right. Because the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So, for each pair of charges, I have to calculate the potential energy between them and sum it all up.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum of U for each pair. So, let's break it down.

First, the 12 charges each are at 2m from P, and the fixed charge is at P. So each of the 12 charges contributes to the
