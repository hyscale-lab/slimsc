Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is about calculating the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, right, identical particles, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Since they're spin-1/2, which is fermions, each can have a unique set of quantum numbers. Oh right, because for fermions, the total wavefunction has to be antisymmetric under exchange.

So in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), which is equal to n² times E, where E is defined as π² ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy depends on its quantum number n.

But wait, because the particles are identical fermions, they can't all occupy the same quantum state. So each has to have a different set of quantum numbers. But wait, in a 1D box, the quantum number for each particle is just an integer—n=1,2,3,... So each particle must have a unique n, right? Or can they share n if their spin is different?

Wait, for spin-1/2 particles, each can have two possible spin states: up or down. So for each n, you can have two particles—each with opposite spins. So for example, n=1 can have two particles: spin up and spin down. Then n=2 can have two more, etc. But wait, the problem says four particles. So let's think about how they fill up the energy levels.

So the ground state is the lowest energy configuration. Since each energy level E_n can hold 2 particles (due to spin), the first level (n=1) can hold 2, the second (n=2) holds another 2. So four particles would fill n=1 and n=2 completely.

So the ground state energy would be the sum of each particle's energy. So two particles in n=1, each contributing E_1 = (1^2)E = E, and two in n=2, each contributing E_2=(2^2)E=4E. So total ground state energy is 2E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because each particle in n=1 contributes E, so two particles would make 2*E. Similarly, n=2 has two particles each at 4E, so 2 *4E=8E. So total is 10E. So ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 30E, 39E, 50E

Option B: 4E,10E,50E

Option C:4E,10E,15E

Option D:10E,15E,18E

Wait, according to my calculation, the ground state should be 10E. So the first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to the next available level. Hmm, wait. Wait, no, because particles fill up the lowest energy levels first.

Wait, let me think again. The ground state is when all four are in the lowest possible states, so two in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, no, wait. Each energy level can hold two fermions (because of spin). So four particles would fill up n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So the total energy is 2*E_1 + 2*E_2 = 2E + 2*(4E)= 2E +8E=10E. So ground state is 10E.

Now, what would be the first excited state? The first excited state would be the next possible configuration
