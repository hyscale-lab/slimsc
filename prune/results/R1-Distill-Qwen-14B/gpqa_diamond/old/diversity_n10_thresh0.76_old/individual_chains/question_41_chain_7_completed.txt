Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass, and the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab. Let me think about this.

Wait, the question says the light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. So the glass is moving towards us, same direction as the light beam.

I remember from my classes that when light moves through a medium, its speed changes. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index n. So normally, v_light = c/n. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But in this case, the medium (the glass) is moving, so the speed might be different.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light inside it? Or does it affect the direction because of the Doppler effect or something else? I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the speed of light in a medium is determined by the medium's properties, not its velocity. So even if the glass is moving, the speed of light inside it is still c/n. Because the speed is measured in the medium's frame, right? Or does the relative motion of the medium affect the observed speed?

Wait, but hold on. When you're in a moving train and you shine a light, the speed of light doesn't change relative to the outside observer. That's Einstein's postulate. But wait, in this case, the glass is the medium. So the light propagates through the moving glass. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider the frame of the laboratory. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the speed of the light in the lab frame would be... wait, how does relative velocity add?

I think that for objects moving at non-relativistic speeds, velocities add linearly. For example, if the glass is moving at v, and the light in the glass is moving at u (which is c/n in the glass's frame), then in the lab frame, the light's speed would be u + v, but only if u and v are in the same direction.

But wait, isn't this a relativistic question? Because the speed of light is involved, which is a constant in all inertial frames. So maybe I should think in terms of special relativity.

But wait, the refractive index comes into play. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n. But what about when the glass is moving relative to the lab frame?

Hmm, perhaps I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(c²)) where u is the speed in one frame, and u' is in the other frame moving at speed v relative to the first.

Wait, but in this case, u is the speed of light in the glass's frame, which is c/n. And v is the speed of the glass relative to the lab. So the lab would measure the speed as u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n. So u = c/n. The glass is moving at v towards the observer, so in the lab frame, the speed is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²)).

Let me plug in u = c/n. So u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So u' = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ].

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (c + n v)/n

Denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)) = (n c + v) / (n c)

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Which is [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the denominator and numerator cancel.

So u' = [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Wait, wait, let me check again.

Wait, denominator (after simplifying) is (n c + v) / (n c)

Wait, no: 1 + (v/(n c)) = [n c + v ] / (n c)

So when we take reciprocal, it's (n c) / (n c + v )

So putting it all together:

u' = ( (c + n v)/(n) ) * (n c) / (n c + v )

Wait, let's compute numerator: (c + n v) * c = c^2 + n v c.

Denominator: n*(n c + v) = n^2 c + n v.

Wait, but the numerator is (c + n v) * c, which is c^2 + n v c.

Denominator is (n c + v) * n, which is n^2 c + n v.

So u' = [c^2 + n v c ] / [n^2 c + n v ]

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: n (n c + v )

Wait, wait, no. Let me factor c from numerator: c(c + n v).

Denominator: n (n c + v )

Wait, but denominator can be written as n c (n) + v n. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can factor differently.

Wait, the denominator is n (n c + v ), and the numerator is c (c + n v )

So u' = [ c (c + n v) ] / [ n (n c + v) ]

Wait, but wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the velocities are adding in the same direction. But in our case, the speed of light in the lab frame is given by this expression.

But wait, the options are all in terms of n and v, and c is taken as 1. So let's set c=1 to simplify.

So c =1.

Then, u' = [ (1 + n v) * 1 ] / [n (n *1 + v ) ]

Which is (1 + n v) / [n (n + v ) ]

Wait, that's (1 + n v) / (n^2 + n v )

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n +v ), option B is 1, etc.

Hmm, but according to this, the speed is (1 +n v) / (n (n +v )) )

Wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the velocity addition formula. Let me think again.

In special relativity, the velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + u v / c² )

In this case, u is the velocity of light in the glass's frame, which is c/n.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the frame. Let me clarify.

The glass is moving at velocity v (towards the observer) in the lab frame. So, in the glass's rest frame, the light propagates at c/n. So to get the speed of the light in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, I should use u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²)).

So u = c/n, v is the velocity of the glass as seen from the lab. So v is positive towards the observer, same as the light's direction.

So u' = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v/(n c) )

So u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Hmm, so that's [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v ) ]

The n's cancel, so numerator becomes (c + n v) * c, denominator is (n c + v )

Wait, so u' = [ c (c + n v ) ] / (n c + v )

But since c=1, u' becomes [ (1 + n v ) * 1 ] / (n *1 + v )

Which is (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Wait, that's option A: (1 + n v)/(n +v )

Wait, but earlier when I set c=1, I thought the denominator was n^2 +n v, but that was a miscalculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, no. When c=1, the denominator in the expression [n c +v ] becomes n *1 +v = n +v. So u' = (1 +n v )/(n +v )

Yes, that's option A.

Wait, but wait. What if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light? Does this affect the direction? So when the medium moves towards the observer, does it affect the speed?

Alternatively, I've heard of the Doppler effect for light, but that's about frequency and wavelength, not speed. So the speed of light in the medium is still determined by the medium's properties, but when the medium is moving, does the observed speed change?

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light in the glass has speed v_light = c/n in the glass's frame. Then in the lab frame, the speed would be v_light' = v_light + v, but that's only in classical mechanics. But in relativity, we can't just add velocities like that; we need to use the velocity addition formula.

So perhaps that's why I used the velocity addition formula earlier.

Wait, but in our calculation, when I applied the formula, the speed turned out to be (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

But wait, that's if v is much less than c, but in relativity, the formula holds for any v as long as it's non-relativistic.

Wait, but let me think about the limit when v is very small compared to c. So n is the refractive index, which is typically greater than 1, but let's say n is about 1.5 for glass.

If v is small, then option A becomes (1 + 1.5 v)/(1.5 +v )

Approximating, for small v: numerator ~1 + 1.5 v, denominator ~1.5.

So u' ~ (1 +1.5 v ) / 1.5 = (1/1.5) + (1.5 v /1.5 ) = (2/3) + v.

But since the speed of light in the glass is c/n = 1/1.5 = 2/3. So in the lab frame, the speed would be about 2/3 +v, which is higher than the speed in the medium. That makes sense because the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light. So the lab observer would see the light moving faster.

But wait, according to the velocity addition formula, when the medium is moving towards you, the observed speed of the light should approach c, but in this case, the medium is moving, but the light's speed in the medium is less than c.

Wait, but let's test when v is zero. If the glass isn't moving, the speed of light should be c/n. So let's see option A when v=0: (1 +0)/(n +0) )=1/n, which is correct.

So in that case, option A gives the correct limit.

But another thought: could it be that the speed of light in the lab frame is simply the speed in the medium plus the medium's velocity? But that's the classical approach, which doesn't hold relativistically.

Wait, but wait the options don't have that. Option B is 1, which would be if the speed is c regardless. But that's only when the medium is moving at c, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to realize that the speed of light in the medium is always c/n, regardless of the medium's motion. But that can't be right because the lab is a different frame.

Wait, no, in relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. Wait, but that's in vacuum. When light is moving through a medium, the speed is c/n in the medium's frame. But in other frames, the speed would be different. Hmm, but how?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of it this way: in the lab frame, the medium (glass) is moving at speed v. The light inside the medium is moving at speed v_light.

In the medium's frame, v_light = c/n. But in the lab frame, which is moving at speed v relative to the medium, what is the light's speed?

So the lab is moving at -v relative to the medium. So the light's speed in the lab frame is (v_light + (-v)) / (1 + (v_light (-v))/c² )

Wait, but the light is moving in the same direction as the medium. So in the medium's frame, light is moving at c/n. So in the lab frame, which is moving at speed v relative to the medium, the light's speed would be (c/n + v)/(1 + (c v)/(n c²) )

Wait, let me compute that.

So u' = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator: 1 + v/(n c )

So,

u' = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c ) ]

Which is [ (c +n v ) / n ] * [ n c / (n c +v ) ]

The n's cancel, so:

u' = [ c(c +n v ) ] / (n c +v )

Since c=1,

u' = (1 +n v ) / (n +v )

So that's option A. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but what about when the medium approaches the observer, which would make the light speed higher than in the medium's frame. And the formula gives that. For example, when v is positive and same direction, u' would be higher than c/n.

So the conclusion is that the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The glass has a refractive index \( n \), and light travels through it at a speed \( c/n \) in the glass's rest frame. However, the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer.

In special relativity, the velocity of an object in one frame as observed in another frame is given by the velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame.
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.
- \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is taken as 1 in this problem.

Substituting \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} \cdot v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} \cdot v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c + n v}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to simplify further:

\[
u' = \frac{(c + n v) \cdot c}{n (n c + v)}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \), this reduces to:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option **A**. The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **Option B (1):** Incorrect, as the speed of light in the glass is not always \( c \) (it depends on \( n \)).
- **Option C:** Incorrect, as the denominator does not match the derived expression.
- **Option D:** Incorrect, as the numerator and denominator have the wrong signs.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Answer: A
