Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think. So the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits.

The question is about the orbital periods of these two planets. I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The shift is caused by the star moving due to the planet's gravity. So the bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, right? Or wait, no, maybe the shift depends on the planet's mass and the distance of the planet's orbit.

Wait, but both planets have the same mass, Neptune-like. So the difference in the spectral line shifts must be due to their orbital velocities. The shift is measured in milliangstroms. Planet #1 has a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 has a 7 milliangstrom shift. So Planet #2's shift is larger.

Wait, but the shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula I think is that the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. So the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_star/M_p) )^(2/3) ) )^(1/ (1 year? Or I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula. The formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * P )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (2π) ) )

But wait, I'm a bit rusty. I think another approach is better. Since both stars have the same mass (same as Sun), and the planets have the same mass, the only difference is the Doppler shift, which relates to their orbital velocities.

Wait, the Doppler shift (the measured velocity) is K, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula for K is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3)

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

But in this problem, both planets have the same M_p and same M_star, so the ratio K1/K2 would be (P2/P1)^(1/3), because K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star)^(1/3). Wait, perhaps I should re-express this.

Wait, let me think again. The observed Doppler shift (K) is related to the planet's orbital period (P) and the velocity of the star. Since the star's movement is due to the planet's orbit, the velocity amplitude K of the star is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Again, since M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So,

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

But both planets have the same M_p and same M_star, so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

In the problem, the Doppler shifts (K) are 5 and 7 milliangstroms for planets 1 and 2, respectively. So K1 = 5, K2 =7.

Since K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Wait, wait. Let's see:

If K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), then K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

But wait, in the problem, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, but wait, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so a higher K means a shorter period. Because if P is smaller, 1/P is larger, so K is larger.

So if K2 is larger than K1 (7 >5), P2 must be smaller than P1, which would make (P2/P1) <1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So P2 / P1.

Wait, but from the equation:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Taking both sides to the power of 3,

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So (5^3)/(7^3) = (125)/(343) = approximately 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.36.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So it's P2 / P1. If P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1 by that factor. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36. Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recheck.

Wait, the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * P )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2/3 )

Alternatively, another formula I've seen is:

K = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) * ( (M_star + M_p)/(M_sun) )^(-2/3) ) * (P / (year))^(-1/3)

So in this case, M_p is the same for both planets, M_star is same, so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1 = C * 1/(P1^(1/3))

K2 = C * 1/(P2^(1/3))

Taking the ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

5/7 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2 / P1

Which is 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Thus, P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So P2 is 0.364 times as long as P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 36% the period of planet #1. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 is shorter, so the factor is less than 1.

So the answer should be approximately 0.36, which is option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift caused by the star's motion due to the planet's gravitational pull. The formula for \( K \) is:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Since both planets have the same mass (\( M_p \)) and their host stars have the same mass (\( M_{\text{star}} \)), the proportionality simplifies to:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

From the proportionality, \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3} \). Cubing both sides gives:

\[
\left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \approx 0.364 \, P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's orbital period is about **36% as long** as planet #1's.

The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Since \( P_2 \) is shorter than \( P_1 \), the factor is less than 1. The closest option is:

**A) ~0.36**

Answer: A
