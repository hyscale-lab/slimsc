Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The problem gives some condition involving isospin, angular momentum, and spin. The key point is Pauli statistics requiring that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, is that the correct formula? Oh right, Pauli's exclusion principle for identical particles. So the total isospin T, spin S, and orbital angular momentum L must satisfy T = S + L + 1 mod 2. Because for bosons, the total wavefunction must be symmetric, and for fermions antisymmetric. Wait, but nucleons are fermions, so their wavefunction has to be antisymmetric.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. The 1S0 notation is in the form (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, that's (2*0+1) S 0, meaning S=0, L=0, J=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, and J=0.

They emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So after emission, the final state is NN plus X. But the question is about the possible partial waves for the emitted particle's angular momentum state. The options give the initial state (1S0) going to some final state plus a particle.

Wait, the problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. So we need to check each option and see if it violates angular momentum or parity conservation.

The given condition after emission is T(NN) = 0. Because the problem states that T(NN) is 0 in the final state. So the isospin T for the NN pair is zero. So what does that mean for the other quantum numbers?

The Pauli condition: T = S + L + 1 mod 2. Since T=0, then 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd. So S and L must be different; one even, one odd.

Wait,
