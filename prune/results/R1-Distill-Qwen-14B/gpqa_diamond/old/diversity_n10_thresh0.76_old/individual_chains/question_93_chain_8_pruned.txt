Okay, so I've got this qPCR question here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my PCR stuff, but let me think through this. The question is about a scientist making a calibration curve for qPCR. So I remember that qPCR is used to quantify the amount of DNA or RNA by amplifying it. The calibration curve, or standard curve, is made by running known concentrations and seeing how the Ct values change.

The scientist used a positive control with known copy numbers and made serial dilutions. He ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency was 100%, which I think means it's perfect—so each cycle reduces the doubling time properly. The R2 was 1, which is a perfect correlation, so the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope was -3.3. 

Wait, what's the slope in a qPCR standard curve? Oh right, the standard curve is usually a log plot of copy number vs. Ct. The slope is expected to be around -3.32 if the efficiency is 100%. Because the formula I recall is that for a 100% efficient PCR, each cycle reduces the number by half, so the relationship is y = mx + b, where m is the slope based on log copies and Ct. The standard is a slope of -3.322, so that matches here.

Now, looking at the data. For each concentration, there are three Ct values. Let me look at the numbers. For 100,000 copies, the Cts are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average would be around 34.2, right? Then 10,000 copies give 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. So each 10-fold dilution steps down by about 3.3 cycles. Let me calculate the difference between each step.

From 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10x dilution. Ct went from ~34 to ~31, which is a difference of 3.3. Then 10,000 to 1,000: Ct went from ~31 to ~27.3. That's a 3.7 difference. Hmm, wait, that's more than 3.3. Wait, but why? Because 3.3 is the expected per 10-fold change.

Wait, let me double-check. So the slope is -3.3, which is the change in Ct per log change in concentration. So a 10-fold dilution (like from 100,000 to 10,000) should decrease Ct by 3.3. Because the standard is that each 10x dilution reduces Ct by about 3.32 cycles.

So in the data:

100,000: 33.9–34.5, average 34.2
10,000: 30.6–31.2, average 30.9
1,000: 27.3–27.9, average 27.6
100: 24–24.6, average 24.3
10: 20.7–21.3, average 21.0

So the differences between each step:

From 100,000 to 10,000: 34.2 -30.9 = 3.3. That's exactly the slope. Good.

From 10,000 to 1,000: 30.9 -27.6 = 3.3. Also matches.

From 1,000 to 100: 27.6 -24.3=3.3. Okay.

From 100 to 10: 24.3 -21.0=3.3. Perfect.

Wait, but looking at the actual data, let me check each set of triplicates.

For 100,000, the Cts are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So each is about 0.3 apart. The average is 34.2. Next, 10,000: 30.6,30.9,31.2. Their average is 30.9. The difference in Ct between 100,000 and 10,000 is 34.2-30.9=3.3. So that's correct.

But wait, the question is about discrepancies. The options suggest that there's something wrong with the results.

Wait the question states that he made a calibration curve with positive controls and three technical replicates. His efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and slope is -3.3, which is correct. So why are the results showing discrepancies?

Looking at the data, each concentration's Ct's are within 0.3 of each other. Like 33.9,34.2,34.5—so max difference is 0.6. That's acceptable for technical replicates, I think. Usually, technical replicates should have a small variation, like less than 0.5 cycles.

But wait, looking at the options, option D says the deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. But in the data, the maximum deviation per triplicate is 0.6 (like 33.9 and 34.5 is 0.6 apart). So that would be more than 0.3. But wait, the question is about the discrepancies in his results, not the replicates. Or is it?

Wait, the question is which option explains the discrepancies. The data shows that the Ct values per concentration are varying by about 0.3, like in the 10,000 sample, they're 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. So the standard deviation is small. But wait, another thought: when diluting by 10-fold, the Ct should decrease by about 3.3 cycles. Let's see:

From 100,000 (34.2) to 10,000 (30.9): 3.3 difference.

10,000 (30.9) to 1,000 (27.6): 3.3.

1,000 (27.6) to 100 (24.3): 3.3.

100 (24.3) to 10 (21): 3.3.

So each step is exactly 3.3, which is correct. So the data is perfect, but the question is about discrepancies. So maybe the data is correct, and the options are about possible issues.

Wait, the options: the question is which explains the discrepancies in his results.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles.

Wait, no. A ten-fold dilution should cause a decrease of 3.3 cycles if the efficiency is 100%. So the correct behavior is a 3.3 change. So if the dilution was 10x and the Ct didn't change by 3.3, that would be a problem. But in this case, the change is exactly 3.3.

So what's the problem? The question says the slope is -3.3, which is correct. So why are the options about discrepancies?

Wait, looking again at the data. Let's check each concentration's Ct values. For example, 10,000 copies: the Cts are 30.6,30.9,31.2.
