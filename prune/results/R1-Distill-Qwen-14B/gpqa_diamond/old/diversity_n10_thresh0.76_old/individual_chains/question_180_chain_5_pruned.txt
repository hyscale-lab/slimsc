Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

So the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. Oh wait, but maybe I can just keep it as 2e for calculations because I'm dealing with ratios or something. The masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about gravitational interactions, just electric.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the setup is like this: one charge is at point P, and the other twelve are all at a distance of 2 meters away from P. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. I'm a bit confused about what "minimum energy" refers to here. Wait, in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them. Since the system is isolated, I think the minimum energy would be the potential energy of the configuration, because that's the energy stored.

So I need to calculate the electric potential energy of this system. I remember that the electric potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But when there are multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. 

Wait, but since the 13th charge is fixed, I think the twelve charges are each interacting with it. So each of the twelve charges at 2m will interact with the fixed charge at P. Also, the twelve charges might be interacting with each other, but wait, are they free to move around each other or are they fixed? The problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, but it doesn't specify their positions relative to each other. Hmm, maybe I can assume that the distance between any two of the twelve charges is negligible compared to 2m, or perhaps we can ignore their mutual interactions because they're fixed at that distance. Let me think.

If the twelve charges are fixed at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other aren't specified, it's possible that the distances between them are
