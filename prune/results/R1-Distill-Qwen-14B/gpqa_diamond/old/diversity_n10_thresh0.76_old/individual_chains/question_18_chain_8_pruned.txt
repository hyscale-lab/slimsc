Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. The question gives some elemental abundances determined using the EW method under LTE. 

The given data:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photospheric composition is provided:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → which I think means log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find (n_Si1 / n_Si2).

Hmm. I remember that the notation [X/Y] means log10(n_X/n_Y) relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y]_star = log(n_X/n_Y in star) - log(n_X/n_Y in Sun) → which is log( (n_X/n_Y)_star / (n_X/n_Y)_sun )

Let me think about each star's composition.

Starting with Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the abundance of Fe relative to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So, (n_Fe1 / n_H1) = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) → which is given as 10^(-4.5). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Sun's nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5), but in Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so their ratio is the same. So, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

But wait, I'm not so sure. Because [Fe/H] is defined as log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) → so if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then (n_Fe1/n_H1)/(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) )= 10^0 = 1 → so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → which is 10^(-4.5). So, n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun). Wait, but I don't know n_H1. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: since all H is about the same? No, the amount of H can change, but in this problem, perhaps the total H in the photosphere is considered to be the same as the Sun's? Or maybe we can relate the ratios via other elements.

Wait, but perhaps I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of the ratios and solve for the silicon abundance.

So for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which is log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) = 0.3 → n_Si1/n_Fe1 = 10^(0.3) * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun)

Wait
