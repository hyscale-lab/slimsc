Alright, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I need to recall what each symmetry entails and whether SMEFT operators must respect them.

Starting with Lorentz symmetry (option 1). I remember that SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory where the Standard Model (SM) is the leading term. Effective theories usually maintain the same symmetries as the underlying theory unless explicitly broken. The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, so I think SMEFT should as well. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant.

Then, Poincare symmetry (option 2). Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. In effective theories, operators are classified by their dimension. SMEFT uses dimension-6 operators, I believe. For a theory to respect Poincare symmetry, it needs to have a well-defined energy-momentum tensor and be invariant under translations. But wait, SMEFT is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the SM. The SM Lagrangian is Poincare invariant, right? So when you add higher-dimension terms, as long as they're local and constructed from the SM fields and derivatives, they should respect Poincare symmetry. So yes, I think SMEFT respects Poincare symmetry. So operators in SMEFT must respect that.

Next, CP symmetry (option3). Hmm. CP is Charge conjugation and Parity symmetry. The SM doesn't have a CP symmetry because of the CKM mechanism leading to CP violation. So in the SM, CP is not a symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT, which includes all SM interactions plus higher-dimension terms, doesn't need to respect CP symmetry. In fact, operators can violate CP because the SM itself does. So the operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option3 is not a must.

Lastly, CPT symmetry (option4). CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. It combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. I remember that all renormalizable theories respect CPT symmetry, and so do effective theories like SMEFT. Because SMEFT is built from local, renormalizable interactions (even though they are higher-dimension), they should respect CPT. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry.

So putting it together:

Which symmetries must be respected? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait, does Poincare include Lorentz? Because Poincare is Lorentz plus translations. So if a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected, so both 1 and 2 are correct. But wait, in SMEFT, when you have higher dimension operators, do you have to worry about Poincare symmetry? Because all operators in SMEFT are local and built from the SM fields, which are Poincare invariant. So yes, they must respect Poincare.

Wait, but wait. I think in SMEFT, the operators are invariant under the same symmetries as the SM. Since the SM respects Poincare, SMEFT must as well. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz.

But the question is which symmetries must be respected. So the answer would include both Lorentz and P
