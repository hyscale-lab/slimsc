Alright, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down step by step.

So the state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. I remember that |alpha> is a coherent state, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states, so when you combine them like this, you get a non-Gaussian state, which is why it's called a Schrödinger cat state.

The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Oh wait, that makes sense because when you have a superposition of two coherent states, the normalization depends on their overlap. The exponential term comes from the inner product of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which is exp(-|alpha|²) multiplied by some other factors.

The relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is given by delta_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember that the relative entropy of entanglement or something like that is calculated using this formula. But here, it's for non-Gaussianity, so maybe the reference state is a Gaussian state that's closest to the given state in some sense. But I'm not exactly sure about that. Alternatively, it's possible that the reference is the completely mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not certain.

But the question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity using this relative entropy. So I need to compute delta_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. Because the formula given is the difference between the entropy of rho and tau.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So that's the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau. So delta_b is the difference between the two entropies.

But the problem is about finding the non-Gaussianity, so I need to figure out what the reference Gaussian state tau is.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state that is the closest Gaussian approximation to rho. But I'm not entirely sure how that works. Alternatively, the reference could be the Gaussian state
