Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh right, the parallax formula is plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, which means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

But the question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax changes. So if I imagine looking at the sky, the number of stars you see depends on how many are at different distances. Because the distribution is uniform, that means stars are equally likely to be found in any volume, right?

So the number density of stars is uniform in space. Wait, number per unit volume. So if you have a certain volume, the number of stars is proportional to that volume. But since we're dealing with parallax, we're looking at how this translates into the parallax space.

Let me think in terms of volume as a function of distance. If I have two thin spherical shells at distances d and d + dd, the volume between them is approximately 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a shell is surface area times thickness, and surface area is 4πr².

So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to 4πd² dd. But since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant. Let's say the number density is n stars per cubic parsec. So the number of stars in the shell is n * 4πd² dd.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So let's express everything in terms of plx. Let me substitute d = 1/plx.

The volume element (in terms of d) is 4πd² dd. Let me change variables to plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, because plx = 1/d, so d plx = (-1/d²) dd. Which means dd = - plx² d plx. Hmm, but since we're looking at a small range, the negative sign just indicates direction, but when counting stars,
