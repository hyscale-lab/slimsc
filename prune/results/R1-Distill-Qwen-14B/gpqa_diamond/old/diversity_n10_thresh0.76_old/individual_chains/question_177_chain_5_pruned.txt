Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And the mass is also 1.5 times larger. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosity. Oh right, luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. Oh, right, the formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, how does that connect to the given data?

They also mention that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength. I remember Wien's Law, which says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures should be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2. Oh, that's an important point.

So both stars have the same temperature. Then, the luminosity depends on R squared times T to the fourth power. But since T is the same for both, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = (R1² / R2²) * (T1/T2)^4. But T1 and T2 are the same, so that factor is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²).

R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1 =1.5 R2. So R1 squared is (2.25) R2 squared. Therefore, L1/L2 should be 2.25. So that's option A, which is ~2.25.

Wait, but why is there another part about radial velocities? The velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Wait, but the question says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So I think the velocities part might be a red herring here. Because luminosity depends on intrinsic properties (radius and temperature), not on their velocities. Unless there's something else I'm missing.

Wait, maybe I should think about how we measure luminosity. Oh, wait, no, the problem states that they computed the luminosity using black body radiation, so the velocities don't directly affect that calculation. The velocities might be related to something else, like Doppler shift. But the peak wavelengths were determined through spectroscopy and were the same. Oh, but if the star is moving, wouldn't that affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler effect?

Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same. But according to Wien's Law, the λ_max depends on the actual temperature. So maybe the observed λ_max is λ0, but due to the Doppler effect, the actual temperature would be different
