Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's see if I can work through this.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that doesn't look like a standard metric I'm familiar with. I remember that metrics describe the geometry of spacetime, and this seems to be in two dimensions because it has dx and dy. But wait, no, actually, in general relativity, the metric tensor is for a manifold, which could be any number of dimensions. Here, it's written in terms of dx² and dy², so maybe it's a 2-dimensional spacetime? Or perhaps it's embedded in a higher dimension? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Oh, right! A pseudosphere is like a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric given might describe such a space. I remember that in 2D, the metric for a pseudosphere can be written in terms of coordinates (like x and y) and involve a function of the radial distance. 

So, looking at the metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That looks similar to the equation of a circle, but in 3D, it's a sphere. Wait, since the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), that suggests that this is a function of r² where r² = x²
