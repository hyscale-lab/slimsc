Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The options provided are the possible normalized eigenvectors, and I need to determine which one is correct.

Hmm. So, first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for a component like P (like angular momentum) along an arbitrary direction is given by the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So, the operator P_n would be P · n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n must be zero. So n_y = 0, and n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). But wait, since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. But the problem states that n lies in the x-z plane, which means n_y=0. So the operator simplifies to P_n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

Wait, but the question isn't directly asking about the operator along n, but about the eigenvector of P along n. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the eigenvector of the component operator along direction n. Oh wait, no, the problem says "the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n". So perhaps P is the total operator, and we're looking for the eigenstate along n.

But wait, perhaps the operator in question is the component of P along n. So the operator would be (P · n) = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since n_y is zero. Because in the x-z plane, the direction n can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So, the operator along direction n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. We
