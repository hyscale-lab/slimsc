Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So, when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Acids donate H+ ions, and bases donate OH- ions. The reaction between them is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the first thing I should do is figure out the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see which one is in excess.

Let me break it down. First, calculate the moles of each component.

Starting with CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely, but for this problem, I think the initial moles are all that matter because we might have a neutralization before considering its dissociation.

Molarity is moles per liter, so for CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

Next, HCl. It's a strong acid, so it completely dissociates. So the moles of H+ from HCl are 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Then Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH-.

So moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Multiply by 2 because each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, let's sum up the H+ and OH- contributions.

Total H+ from acids: CH3COOH gives 0.05 moles, HCl gives 0.08 moles. So 0.05 + 0.08 = 0.13 moles H+.

Total OH- from base: 0.18 moles.

Now, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So, subtract the moles to see what's left.

0.13 moles H+ vs 0.18 moles OH-.

OH- is in excess by 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 moles.

So, after neutralization, we have excess OH-.

Now, the total volume of the solution is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

The concentration of OH- is moles / volume = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when you mix acids and bases, sometimes the strong acid and strong base react completely, but what about the weak acid? Because acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid, does it react with the excess OH-?

Let me think again. When you mix all these, the H+ from strong acids (HCl) will first react with the OH- from the base (Ba(OH)2). Then, any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH). 

Wait, no, maybe the correct approach is to calculate all the H+ and OH- first, then see the excess, and then account for any reactions.

So, initial H+ from acids is 0.13 moles. Initial OH- is 0.18 moles.

After neutralization, the OH- is in excess by 0.05 moles. So the solution is basic. Now, the pH will depend on the concentration of OH- ions.

But wait, wait. The problem is that when you have a weak acid like CH3COOH in a solution that's already basic, you might have some dissociation, but maybe in this case, since the solution is basic, the acetic acid will be deprotonated by the OH-
