Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

Let me start by reading the question carefully. The problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

First, I'll try to break down each reaction and identify the possible compounds involved. Maybe once I know what E is, I can figure out its molecular symmetry.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, solid A reacting with gas B. What's a reaction where 8 equivalents are used? Maybe something like a combustion reaction or a metal reacting with a gas. Oh wait, 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe it's a reaction where B is something like oxygen. For example, if A is a metal, like sodium (Na), and B is O2. Wait, but sodium reacts with O2 to form Na2O or Na2O2. Let me think about the stoichiometry.

Wait, 8 equivalents suggests 8 moles of B per mole of A. So if the reaction is A + 8 B → C, then perhaps A is something that forms a compound with B in a 1:8 ratio. Or maybe it's a different type of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps B is a diatomic gas, so 8 equivalents mean 4 molecules per molecule of A. Wait, for example, if A is Fe and B is O2, Fe + O2 could form FeO, Fe3O4, etc. Wait, Fe reacting with O2 in combustion forms Fe3O4, which has a formula Fe3O4 (O is 4 per Fe3). So for each Fe3, 4 O2 molecules? I'm not sure that's matching 8 equivalents. Maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal. Let me think about a specific reaction. Another thought: perhaps A is a metal that reacts with carbon dioxide to form a carbonate. The carbonate reaction would be like 2 Mg + CO2 → 2 MgO + C. Wait, but that's 1 equivalent of CO2 per 2 Mg. Not 8. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is a metal that reacts with sulfur vapor (B is S8 perhaps). For example, copper reacting with sulfur to form Cu2S. But that's 1 S8 molecule per 2 Cu, so 8 S atoms. Wait, the formula is Cu2S, so for each Cu2, one S. So per Cu, 0.5 S. That doesn't add up for 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, maybe A is an element like sodium (Na), and B is chlorine (Cl2). Sodium reacts with Cl2 to form NaCl. The reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So for 2 Na, 1 Cl2. So for each Na, 0.5 Cl2. So if A is Na, and B is Cl2, the stoichiometry is 2 Na : 1 Cl2. So for 1 mole of Na, 0.5 mole of Cl2. That's not 8 equivalents, but perhaps I'm looking at the wrong reaction.

Alternatively, maybe A is an oxide. Wait, but solid A reacting with gas B. Maybe A is FeO and B is O2? No, that's a solid plus gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. The product C is bright red. What compounds are bright red? Maybe a metal oxide? Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not sure about bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal complex. Or perhaps a different oxide. Wait, another thought: the bright red product might be a copper compound. Copper(II) oxide is black, but maybe another form. Or maybe it's something like sulfur trioxide? Or another idea: maybe the product is a nitride? I'm
