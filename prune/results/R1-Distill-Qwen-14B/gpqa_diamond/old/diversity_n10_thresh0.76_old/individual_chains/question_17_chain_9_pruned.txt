Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember from my studies that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium pretty tightly. So the question is about a solution with 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The K for the complex is given as 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, I think the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is an equilibrium thing. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The equilibrium constant K for this reaction would be Kf, which is the formation constant. Right, Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem gave K as 5x10^10. So K is the formation constant, which is a very large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So at equilibrium, almost all the Ca²+ and EDTA will be tied up in the complex.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since the formation is 1:1 (one Ca²+ and one EDTA), the total concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA would each be 0.02 M if they weren't forming the complex. But because they do form the complex, most of them are in the complex form.

But I'm being asked about the concentration of free calcium ions. So, let's denote [Ca²+] as x. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA, the concentration of free EDTA would also be x. Wait, but wait, in the presence of excess EDTA, maybe that's not the case. Oh, but in this case, it's a stoichiometric solution, so the amount of EDTA is just enough to form the complex with Ca²+. So the initial [Ca²+] is 0.02 M, same as the EDTA, assuming they react completely. But because K is so large, the reverse reaction is negligible. So, the concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 M, and the free [Ca²+] and [EDTA] are very low.

But wait, let's model this. Let's say the complex is [
