Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

The question says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. When treated with platinum and heated, it forms another equimolar mixture Y of two liquids. This Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, I remember that bromine water decolorizes when there are double bonds, like in alkenes or alkynes. So, Y probably doesn't have any double bonds. Or wait, Y doesn't cause the bromine to decolorize, meaning bromine doesn't react with Y. So Y doesn't have any unsaturation. But wait, X does decolorize bromine, meaning X has double bonds or triple bonds. Oh, but the problem says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's molecules. Hmm, maybe they're isolated double bonds or something.

Then, when both X and Y undergo hydrogenation in presence of platinum under severe conditions, they give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. And Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's fully saturated. Also, Z is in mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. Oh, maybe Z is something like toluene or xylene? Wait, but Z is a hydrocarbon, so it's probably something like hexane or something else, but let me think.

Wait, the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let me calculate the molecular formula. Let's say Z is CnHm. The mass fraction is (mass of H)/(mass of Z) = 14.28% which is about 1/7. So (m * 1)/(12n + m) ) = 1/7.

So, 7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n. So the formula is CnH2n. So possible options are like ethane (n=1, H2), but that's too small. Or n=2→butane, H4? Wait, mass fraction: for butane, C4H10 would have mass H as (10 *1)/(4*12 +10*1) = 10/(58) ≈ 17.24%. No, that's way higher than 14.28%. Wait, maybe Z is cyclohexane? Or something with a higher ratio of carbon.

Wait, let me think again. Let's find n and m where 7m =12n +m → 6m=12n → m=2n.

So possible pairs (n=1,m=2): C H2. But that's CH2, which is not possible. n=2 → m=4: C2H4, which is ethylene. But that's a double bond, which would react with bromine. But Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated. So C2H4 isn't possible because it's unsaturated. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate the mass fraction. 14.28% is approximately 1/7. So (m * 1) / (12n + m) ) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by denominator: m = (12n + m)/7 → 7m =12n +m →6m=12n → m=2n. That's correct.

So for Z, m=2n. So possible n is 3: m=6 → C3H6. But that's still an alkene, which would react with bromine. But Z is a constituent of Y, which doesn't react with bromine. So maybe Z is cyclopropane? No, cyclopropane has three-membered ring, which is strained, but it's a hydrocarbon. Or wait, maybe Z is a branched alkane.

Wait, alternative approach: Let's think about the hydrogenation. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give the same Z. So X and Y upon hydrogenation give the same product. So, Y is hydrogenated to Z. But Y is formed from X via a disproportionation reaction.

Wait, the initial step: X is treated with platinum (a catalyst) and heated, leading to Y. It's a disproportionation. So X must be a substance that can disproportionate into two other substances under certain conditions. For example, maybe X is an alkyne, and upon heating with Pt, it undergoes some kind of isomerism or decomposition? Or perhaps more likely, X has a functional group that can split into two parts with different oxidation states.

Wait, perhaps X is a di-substituted alkene, and upon reaction with Pt and heat, it undergoes some kind of cleavage or rearrangement. Or maybe X is a allene (cumulative diene), which can undergo different reactions.

But wait, the question says that X decolorizes bromine water, which means it has double bonds—either alkenes or alkynes. But X's molecules don't have conjugated multiple bonds, so maybe isolated double bonds or triple bonds.

Wait, when you hydrogenate X, you get Z. And when you hydrogenate Y, you also get Z. So X and Y upon hydrogenation give the same Z. That suggests that X and Y are isomers that upon hydrogenation give the same product. For example, if X is an alkene and Y is a di-substituted alkene, but that doesn't quite make sense for hydrogenation. Alternatively, perhaps X and Y are different forms of the same compound, but that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps X is a di-substituted alkene, and Y is a different compound that upon hydrogenation gives the same Z. Let me think. Maybe X is an alkyne? For example, hydrogenation of an alkyne under certain conditions gives an alkene (but that's partial hydrogenation), but under severe conditions, maybe it goes all the way to the alkane.

Wait, wait, no. The problem says that both X and Y, when hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, give only Z. So X and Y must be such that their complete hydrogenation gives the same product. So what if X is an alkyne, and Y is another alkyne or a different compound that, when hydrogenated, ends up as the same Z.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an alkene and Y is a di-substituted alkene. But that might not lead to same Z upon hydrogenation.

Wait, another possibility: X is an alkyne, and Y is an alkene. Because when you hydrogenate an alkyne (under high pressure and catalyst), you get the alkane. Similarly, hydrogenating an alkene would give the same alkane. So perhaps X is an alkyne, Y is an alkene, and upon hydrogenation, both give the same alkane Z.

Wait, but the problem states that X is a mixture of two liquids, which upon treatment gives Y, a mixture of two other liquids. So maybe X is a mixture of two alkynes, and Y is a mixture of two alkenes. Then, hydrogenating all gives Z, which is the corresponding alkane.

But let's go back to the initial steps. X decolorizes bromine, so it has double bonds, but no conjugated bonds. So
