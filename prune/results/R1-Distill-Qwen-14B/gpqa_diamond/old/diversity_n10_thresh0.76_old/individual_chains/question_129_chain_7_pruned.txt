Hmm, okay, I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question involves a reaction scheme with compounds A to E, and I need to identify what E is based on the reactions and the given hints. 

Let me start by breaking down the problem. The reaction steps are as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

And there are two hints provided. Let me look at each part carefully.

First, I need to understand each reaction step.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN → B. HCN is a nucleophile, often involved in nucleophilic addition. Since HCN is a cyanide source, maybe A is a carbonyl compound. When a carbonyl reacts with HCN, it typically adds a cyanide group, forming a cyanohydrin, but wait, actually, adding HCN to a ketone usually gives a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, the addition would be similar. But wait, maybe A is a ketone. Because in the IR hint, A has a strong peak around 1750 cm-1, which is typical for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So A is likely a ketone.

So if A is a ketone, reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin. The structure of B would then have a hydroxyl group and a cyanide group attached to the same carbon where the carbonyl was in A.

Then, step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's a hydrogenation reaction. Since B has a nitrile group (from HCN addition), the reduction of nitriles typically gives amines. Wait, no, wait. Wait, H2 and Pd is for hydrogenation. So nitriles (R-C≡N) when hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would become amines (R-CH2-NH2). Or wait, sometimes it can be R-CH2-NH2, but I think that in presence of excess H2 and maybe higher pressure, nitriles can be fully reduced to amines. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation that reduces the nitrile to an amine. So, if B is a cyanohydrin, structure-wise, then after hydrogenation, the nitrile becomes a primary amine.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's say A is a cyclic ketone. When A reacts with HCN, the product B would be a cyclo compound with a hydroxyl and a cyano group on adjacent carbons. Then, when B is hydrogenated, the cyano group (nitrile) becomes an amine. So the structure after step 2 (compound C) would have an amine group.

Step 3: C reacts with HNO2
