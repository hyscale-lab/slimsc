Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Next, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to give the final product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present on product 4, with options A to D provided.

Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out what each step does and the structure of the final product.

Let me start by drawing the starting compound. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. So, the substituent is at the 7 position, which is the bridgehead, and it's a tert-butoxy group. So, the structure is a norbornene (since it's diene) with a tert-butoxy substituent on one of the bridgeheads.

Now, the first reaction is with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and in such reactions, often an elimination or substitution occurs. Wait, but the starting material has a diene structure. The other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the 5 and 6 positions on the cyclohexadiene has a dibromomethyl group.

Hmm, dibromomethyl is CH2Br2. So, each of those positions has a CH2Br2 group.

I think the reaction here might be a Diels-Alder reaction. Because the starting material is a diene, and the other molecule is a dienophile? Wait, no, the other molecule is a cyclohexadiene, which is itself a diene. Wait, but the starting material is a bicyclic diene.

Wait, maybe it's a [4+2] cycloaddition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling reaction. Oh, wait, sodium iodide is present, which is a good source of iodide ions. I remember that in some cases, dibromomethyl groups can undergo substitution with a nucleophile. For example, in a SN2 reaction, bromide could attack.

Wait, so if each of the substituents on the cyclohexadiene is CH2Br2, maybe each of those can react with a nucleophile. But wait,
