Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to think it through step by step. 

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I remember are the standard basis states for spin-1/2 particles. So, I think the first thing I need to do is normalize this state because right now it's just proportional; the actual coefficients might not have a magnitude of 1.

Wait, normalization. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), respectively. To normalize, I need to compute the norm, which is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient. 

So the square of the magnitude for (1+i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. For (2-i), it's (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalized state is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>. 

Hmm, but wait, the question says the state is proportional, so maybe I don't have to normalize it right away because the probabilities are based on the squared magnitudes. But since the question is about measuring in another basis, perhaps the operator's eigenstates are different. Let me read the question again.

The operator's matrix representation is A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, that would mean A is:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]
Wait, no, wait. Because for i≠j, A_ij = hbar/2. So in a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are 0, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

Wait, but wait: when the matrix is given, A_ij is the element in row i, column j. So for
