Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this decay probability question. Let's see... The problem says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. I need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, does that mean the next 150 minutes starting from now, so 50 +150 = 200 minutes total? Or is it 150 minutes from the start? No, I think it's 150 minutes from the current time, which is 50 minutes in.

So, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The decay probability isn't dependent on the time already passed; it's a memoryless process. Wait, does that mean that no matter how much time has gone by without decay, the remaining probability is based on the remaining time?

Let me think again. The decay probability of an atom is given by the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time. Or wait, sometimes it's given as P(t) = e^(-λt), which is the probability of not decaying. No, wait, actually P(t) is the probability of decay, so it's 1 - e^(-λt). Because e^(-λt) is the probability of not decaying.

So, given that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). Let me solve for λ.

So, rearranging that equation: e^(-λ*100) = 1 -0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural log on both sides: -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, ln(0.68) is negative, so the negatives cancel. Calculating ln(0.68) is about ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, I think ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.7) is about -0.3567. Wait, wait, let me think: ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108, ln(0.68) is somewhere in between. Let me compute it:

Alternatively, I can calculate ln(0.68):

ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566 (I think I remember that ln(0.68) is about -0.385, but maybe precise value isn't necessary right now because I can compute the exact value numerically if needed).

So, λ = (0.38566)/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

But wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute ln(0.68):

Calculating ln(0.68):

I know that ln(1)=0, ln(0.5)= -0.6931, ln(0.7)= -0.3567, ln(0.6)= -0.5108. 0.68 is between 0.6 and 0.7. Let me use a calculator approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the Taylor series or a linear approximation. Alternatively, maybe using a calculator is better. But assuming I can compute it, let's proceed.

Wait, but perhaps I don't need to calculate it numerically because I can use the same formula for both 100 minutes and the other time.

Wait, the key point is that the decay process is memoryless. So, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn
