Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but I'll take it slowly.

The question says that we have a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. So each compound is C5H7, but wait, no. Wait, C10H14 as the total for the mixture, so each is C5H7? No, wait, each is C10H14? No, no, because the mixture is 1:1, so each has to have a molecular formula that when mixed equally would give C10H14. Hmm, maybe each compound is C5H7? Wait, no. Let me think: the molecular formula of each must be such that two of them would make C10H14. So each compound is (C10H14)/2 = C5H7. But wait, that doesn't make sense because for benzene derivatives, the formula is usually CxHy where y is 6 plus the number of substituents. Wait, the molecular formula of each compound would be C10H14 divided by two molecules (since it's a 1:1 mixture). So each molecule is C5H7. But that's not possible because aromatic compounds typically have multiple substituents. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, each compound might have the same number of carbons. Let's see, the options given are all tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene. For example, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have four methyl groups attached to benzene. Benzene is C6H6, four methyl groups add 4*(CH3) = 4C and 12H. So the formula would be C6+4= C10 and H=6 + 12 =18. Wait, but the molecular formula of each compound is C10H14. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl group is CH3. So each adds one C and three H. For each methyl group, the benzene's H count decreases by one because of substitution. So adding a methyl to benzene: C6H5CH3 (toluene) is C7H8. So for each methyl, we add one C and one H (since each substitution replaces a H: benzene has 6 H, toluene has 5 H). So for n methyl groups, the formula would be C6+n H6 +2n. Because each methyl adds three H, but replaces one H. So net gain of 2 H per methyl.

Wait, let me think again. Benzene has formula C6H6. Each substitution (like adding a methyl group) replaces a H. So each substitution adds (CH3) which is 3 H, but loses 1 H from the ring. So net H added per substitution: 2. So for m substitution groups, the H is 6 + 2m.

So for example, if a benzene has 4 methyl groups, the formula would be C6 +4 = C10, H6 + 2*4 =14. So each compound is C10H14. So the molecular formula of each is C10H14, which matches the question. So each compound has four substituents on the benzene ring, all methyl groups except for option D, which includes diethyl.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, option C includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. So that would have two ethyl groups on the benzene. Let me calculate its molecular formula. Benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl is C2H5. So each ethyl substitution adds 2 C and 5 H, but replaces one H from the ring. So each ethyl adds 2 C and 4 H (5 H added, 1 lost). For two ethyl groups, it's 4 C and 8 H. So the formula is C6+4= C10, H6 +8 =14. So yes, C10H14. So each compound is C10H14.

Okay, so back to the NMR data. The 1H NMR has two signals around 6.7 ppm as singlets, each a singlet, and in 1:1 ratio. Also, three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, the aromatic region: two singlets, each at 6.7 ppm. So each of the two compounds in the mixture must have a set of equivalent aromatic protons that are split into a singlet. But wait, in a 1:1 mixture, each aromatic signal would be from each compound. But in the NMR, we're seeing two signals, each integrating as a singlet, in 1:1 ratio. So each of these two signals corresponds to each of the two compounds.

Wait, but each compound has its own set of aromatic protons. So if each compound has only one type of aromatic proton (a singlet), then in the mixture, each would contribute a singlet. But the problem states that the two signals are in a 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes one singlet, and their areas are equal, so each has the same number of protons giving rise to each singlet.

Wait, but perhaps that's not the case. Let me think: the two compounds in the mixture each have a certain number of equivalent aromatic protons, and their NMR signals are each a singlet. Because the mixture is 1:1, each singlet would have a certain area. But the question states that the two signals are in a 1:1 ratio. So each contributes equally. So each compound's aromatic region would have a singlet of
