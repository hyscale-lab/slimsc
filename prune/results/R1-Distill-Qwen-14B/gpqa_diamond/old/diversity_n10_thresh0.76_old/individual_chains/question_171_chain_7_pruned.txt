Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine in excess. We have six substances, each with a benzene ring attached to different groups, and we're supposed to arrange them based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer produced. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different order.

Hmm, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. Depending on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's meta or para directing, the product distribution changes.

So, each substituent affects the reactivity and the position where the substitution occurs. The main thing I need to determine for each substituent is whether it's activating or deactivating, and whether it directs the incoming group to ortho, meta, or para positions.

Let me list each substituent and think about their effects:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The -CH3 group is an activating group because it donates electrons through the sigma bonds. It's an ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, it will substitute more at the ortho and para positions relative to the methyl group.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: This is ethyl benzoate. The group is -COOEt, which is an ester. Esters are deactivating groups because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. They should be meta directors. So substitution occurs mainly at the meta position relative to the ester group.

3) C6H5-Cl: This is chlorobenzene. The -Cl is a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group (due to the electronegativity of Cl). However, Cl is a unique case because it's an ortho/para director even though it's deactivating. So the substitution tends to happen at ortho and para positions.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong deactivating and meta-directing group. So the substitution occurs mainly at the meta positions relative to the nitro group.

5) C6H5-C2H5: This is ethylbenzene. The -C2H5 is an activating group, similar to methyl. It donates electrons through sigma bonds, making the ring more reactive. It's an ortho/para director, so substitution occurs at those positions.

6) C6H5-COOH: This is benzoic acid. The -COOH group is a strong deactivating group because of the electron-withdrawing effects of the carboxylic acid. It's a meta-directing group. So substitution will occur at the meta position.

Wait, but when the substituent is deactivating, the ring is less reactive. So the reaction may be slower, but the directing effect still determines where substitution happens.

Now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. That is, for each compound, what percentage of the product is the para-substituted derivative?

For substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para product would be a major component, along with ortho. But for meta directors, the para product may not be as prominent.

Wait, but in some cases, like when the substituent is strongly deactivating, the ring is less reactive, so the para product might not be the main one, but in others, it could be.

Wait, but let me think: The problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So for each substance, bromine adds once. But since some substituents direct more to certain positions, the major product would be either para or meta, depending on the substituent.

Wait, no, wait. Electrophilic substitution adds a bromine. For each substituent, how much of the para isomer is formed compared to others.

Wait, the question is about the
