Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the problem is about an atomic nucleus undergoing spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. We're given some information about their masses and rest-mass energies, and we need to find the difference between the relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) kinetic energies of the more massive fragment.

Let me start by jotting down the given data.

The initial nucleus has a rest mass M, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So, E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV. I remember that E=mc², so M is 300 GeV/c².

Then, it fissions into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. Let's say the masses are m1 and m2, with m1 = 2 m2. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Wait, but wait. Because the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero too. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. That means their velocities (or momenta) are related such that their momenta cancel each other.

So, let's calculate m1 and m2 first. Since m1 = 2 m2, and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, substituting m1 gives 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = (0.99 /3) M = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 2 * 0.33 M = 0.66 M. So m1 is 0.66 M and m2 is 0.33 M.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial mass is M, but after fission, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M. So the mass deficit is 0.01 M, which is the energy released as binding energy or kinetic energy. Right.

So the total rest mass after fission is less than before, so some energy is released. That energy must go into the kinetic energy of the two fragments. Because the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. So p1 = -p2.

So, the problem is to find the kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment (m1) using relativistic mechanics and then compare it with the non-relativistic approximation. The difference between the two is what we're looking for.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since it's a two-body problem, perhaps using conservation of energy and momentum would help.

In the initial state, the nucleus is at rest, so momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.

Let's denote the velocities as v1 and v2. But since they have different masses, their velocities will be different.

Wait, but perhaps using relativistic momentum would be better. The momentum p is gamma m v. But I'm not sure
