Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem states: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, assuming ideal pH and temperature of 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (K) is very large, which means the complex is very stable. Since the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Wait, what's the formula for this kind of complex dissociation? I think the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The formation constant K would be [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, when we have the complex in solution, it dissociates into the metal ion and the EDTA. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which is the total concentration of all the species related to the complex. But wait, no, wait. Wait, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that would be the concentration of the complex itself. But since the complex is in solution, it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so the complex is Ca-EDTA, maybe as CaY²− where Y is the EDTA^4−. So the reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−

The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. So Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

Wait, but the solution is 0.02 M of the CaEDTA²− complex. So [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M
