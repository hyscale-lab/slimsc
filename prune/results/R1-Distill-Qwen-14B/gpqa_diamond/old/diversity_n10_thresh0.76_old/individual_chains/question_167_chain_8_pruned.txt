Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are those that have a Wigner function which is Gaussian, like coherent states or squeezed states, and non-Gaussian states deviate from this. The relative entropy method compares the given state's entropy to a reference Gaussian state's entropy.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. Oh wait, and N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). I need to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) which is the relative entropy del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the state and tau is the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is sometimes defined as the difference between the state's entropy and the entropy of the best Gaussian approximation. But here, the problem states that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So I think tau is chosen as the Gaussian state that is closest in some sense to rho.

But for the calculation, perhaps I can proceed as follows.

First, let's compute the density matrix rho. The state is |psi>, so rho is |psi><psi|. But maybe it's easier to compute in terms of the given state.

The state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. So when we compute rho = |psi><psi|, it'll be a mixture of these states. Let me write that out:

rho = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>] [cos(phi)<alpha| + sin(phi)<-alpha| ] / N².

Expanding that, rho is (cos² phi |alpha><alpha| + cos phi sin phi |alpha><-alpha| + sin phi cos phi |-alpha><alpha| + sin² phi |-alpha><-alpha| ) / N².

Wait, but normalizing N is sqrt(...), so N squared is 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²). So N² = 1 + sin(2phi) e^{-2 alpha²}.

But when we compute the density matrix, the cross terms are |alpha><-alpha| and
