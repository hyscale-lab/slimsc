Okay, so I have this physics problem here about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with a certain "size estimate" written next to it. The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the process and the factors in the amplitude calculation.

Wait, so each loop typically contributes a factor of 1/(16 pi^2) in four dimensions because of the integration over loop momenta. But wait, I think it might actually be (4 pi)^something. Oh wait, the loop integrals often come with factors involving 4 pi from the angular integrations. So for each loop, you might get a 1/(4 pi)^d factor, where d depends on the dimension.

Looking at the given expression, I see a 1/(4 pi)^6 term. So that's like (4 pi)^6 in the denominator. If each loop contributes a 4 pi factor, then the number of loops would be related to how many times 4 pi appears.

Wait, but isn't each loop in four dimensions contributing a 1/(16 pi^2) factor? Because the integral over d^4k would involve 1/(2 pi)^4, and when you do a loop integral like ∫d^4k/(k^2 - m^2 + iε), the result typically has a 1/(16 pi^2) factor after Wick rotation and evaluation. So for each loop, you get a 1/(16 pi^2) factor. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as 1/(4 pi)^2 per loop because 16 is (4)^2.

Wait, if each loop brings in a (1/(4 pi)^2) factor, then the denominator would be (4 pi)^{2n}, where n is the number of loops. So in the given expression, the denominator is (4 pi)^6. Let's do the math: 2n =6 → n=3. So three loops.

Let me double-check. Let's say for one loop
