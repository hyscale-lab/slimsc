Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me go through each step of the reaction scheme.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B. HCN is typically used in the formation of cyanohydrins, especially in ketones. So if A is a ketone, reacting with HCN would add a cyanide group adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, but wait—if A is a ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin, which is a vicinal cyanohydrin. That would make sense because the product would have an -OH and a -CN group next to each other.

2. Compound B is then reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C. Pd is often a catalyst for hydrogenation. So if B has a ketone group, maybe it's being reduced to a secondary alcohol. Or if B has a nitrile group, maybe it gets hydrogenated to an amine. Wait, but in the first reaction, A reacting with HCN probably forms a cyanohydrin, which would have both an alcohol and a nitrile group. So after hydrogenation, what happens? Hmm, maybe the nitrile group gets reduced. Let me think: nitrile (R-CN) upon hydrogenation (H2, Pd) becomes R-CH2-NH2. Or wait, no—maybe under different conditions. Wait, in presence of Pd and H2, nitriles can be reduced to amines. Wait, but sometimes they might be reduced to alkanes. Oh, wait, no, I think in the presence of H2 and a catalyst like palladium, a nitrile would be hydrogenated to an amine. Wait, but I've heard that nitriles can be hydrogenated to primary amines when using H2 and a catalyst. So if B has a -CN group, C would have an NH2 group attached. But wait, let me check: Alternatively, if B is a ketone, then hydrogenation would reduce it to an alcohol. Wait, but wait—no, because B is the product of A reacting with HCN. So if A is a ketone (since the IR of A shows a peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is typical for a ketone), then B would be the cyanohydrin, a diol with an adjacent nitrile group. Wait, no—cyanohydrin adds a nitrile and hydroxyl group to the carbonyl. So for example, if A is cyclohexanone, B would be 1-hydroxycyclohexyl cyanide or something like that? Or more accurately, (R2C=O) reacts with HCN to form R2C(OH)CN. So that would be compound B.

Then, when B is hydrogenated, what happens? The nitrile group (CN) would be reduced. Wait, but in the presence of H2 and Pd, the nitrile group would be hydrogenated. What's the product when CN is hydrogenated? I think nitriles can be reduced to primary amines (RCH2NH2) or, under certain conditions, to alkanes. Alternatively, maybe the -OH group gets reduced as well. Wait, no—alcohol (R-OH) is generally not reduced under hydrogenation unless under very high pressure or different catalysts. Oh wait, no, unless the catalyst is Raney nickel or something else. Wait, maybe H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the nitrile to an amine. So if B is R-C(OH)-CN, then C would be R-C(OH)-CH2NH2? Hmm, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile group is hydrogenated to a methylene group. Wait, maybe via a different pathway. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone group in A would have been converted into an alcohol in B, but then what about the hydrogenation?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. So, A is a ketone. Reacting with HCN gives a cyanohydrin. So for example, if A is (cyclopentyl)ketone, B would have an -OH and a -CN group adjacent. Then, when B is hydrogenated, perhaps the nitrile group is reduced to an amine. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in the cyanohydrin (if any) is reduced, but wait, cyanohydrin doesn't have a double bond. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin is R2C(OH)CN. So when you hydrogenate that, the nitrile group can be reduced. Let me think: HCN adds to a carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin. So for cyclopentanone, adding HCN would form (cyclopentyl) cyanohydrin, which is 1-hydroxycyclopentyl cyanide. Then, when you hydrogenate that, the nitrile (CN) group would become CH2NH2, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is hydrogenated to a methyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps under these conditions, the nitrile is reduced to an amine.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation is a catalytic hydrogenation, which typically reduces triple bonds to single bonds. But for nitriles, I think they can
