Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian given is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. Wait, I remember the Pauli matrices are used for spin-1/2 systems, like electrons.

So, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. The operator H is a dot product between σ and n, scaled by ε. Since n is a unit vector, the direction is arbitrary. But for eigenvalues, the direction shouldn't matter because the eigenvalues depend on the magnitude, right?

I think the eigenvalues of a spin operator like σ·n are related to the z-component when n is along the z-axis. So when n is (0,0,1), the Hamiltonian becomes ε σ_z. The eigenvalues of σ_z are +1 and -1 because σ_z | ↑ ⟩ = +| ↑ ⟩ and | ↓ ⟩ = -| ↓ ⟩. So H would have eigenvalues ε*(+1) and ε*(-1), which are ε and -ε. But wait, the options have some options with factors of ħ/2.

Wait a second, maybe I'm forgetting the actual form. Oh right! The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but when they're multiplied by ħ/2, like in the spin angular momentum operator S = (ħ/2) σ. So the eigenvalues of S·n would be ±ħ/2 each.

Hmm, but wait, our H is ε times σ·n, which would be like (ε) times (σ·n). So the eigenvalues would be ε times the eigenvalues of σ·n. So, σ·n has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So H would have eigenvalues ε * (+1) and ε * (-1), which are ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. But wait, wait. Did I miss a factor? Because sometimes the spin matrices are scaled. Let me think again. The Hamiltonian could be H = ε σ · n. If the Pauli matrices are being used, their eigenvalues are ±1, so H's eigenvalues would be ±
