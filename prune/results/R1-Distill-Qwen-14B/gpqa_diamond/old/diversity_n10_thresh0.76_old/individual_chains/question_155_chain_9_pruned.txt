Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue, and we're given the state vector.

Wait, let me start by recalling what the uncertainty principle says. The uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. So, what's the expectation value of P_z in this state? Oh, because the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ could be non-zero unless the state is also an eigenstate of P_z, which I don't think it is here.

Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the given state is expressed in the P_z basis. Oh right, because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state vector is already in the P_z eigenbasis.

So, the state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that down:

State vector ψ = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

Since the basis is the P_z eigenbasis, each component of ψ corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. What are the eigenvalues of P_z?

Looking at the matrix of P_z:

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the possible outcomes when measuring P_z are these values.

The state ψ is a vector in this basis, so the components are the expansion coefficients in the eigenbasis of P_z. So the first component corresponds to eigenvalue m=+ħ, the second to m=0, and the third to m=-ħ.

So, to find ⟨P_z⟩, it's the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, but ψ might not be normalized. Let me check.

The components are (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's compute the norm: (-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1. Oh, so the state is already normalized. That's good.

So the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of each component.

First component: |-1/2|^2 = 1/4. So probability for eigenvalue ħ is 1/4.
