Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem says we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. There are stability constants given for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes: beta1 is 9, beta2 is 40, beta3 is 63, and beta4 is 16. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Hmm, okay. So I think this involves the formation of complexes where Co(II) binds with thiocyanate ions (SCN^-). The different betas are the stability constants for each complex formation step. The blue dithiocyanato complex must be one of these complexes, probably the one with two SCN- ligands. Wait, but wait. The question is about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ions, right?

So let's recall that the stability constant (beta, also called formation constant) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex from its constituent ions. For each step, adding another SCN- to the complex.

So the complexes would be:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)^+ (β1 = 9)
Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2 (β2 = 40)
Co(SCN)_2 + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_3^- (β3 = 63)
Co(SCN)_3^- + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_4^2- (β4 = 16)

Wait, wait. Wait, I'm getting the charges wrong. Let me think about the charges. Co is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So:

For Co(SCN)_n^(charge), the charge would be +2 - n.

So the first complex, Co(SCN), has one SCN-, so charge is +2 -1 = +1. So β1 is for the first complex: Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)^+. K1 = β1 = 9.
