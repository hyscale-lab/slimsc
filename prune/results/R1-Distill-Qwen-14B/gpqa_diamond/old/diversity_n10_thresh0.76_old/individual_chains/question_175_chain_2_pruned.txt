Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. It radiates at a certain wavelength λ. The problem is asking about the radiated power per unit solid angle, which is a function f of λ and the angle θ. They want to find the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at θ = 30 degrees, as well as the possible form of f.

Hmm. So first, I think I need to recall what I know about radiation from oscillating charges. I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The distribution of this radiation in different directions depends on the shape of the charge distribution and how it's moving.

The setup says it's a spheroid, which is like a sphere that's been stretched or compressed along one axis, in this case the z-axis. So it's symmetric around the z-axis. That probably means the radiation pattern will have some symmetry around θ=0 and θ=180 degrees, maybe like a dipole pattern.

Wait, dipoles... Oh right, a dipole antenna has a radiation pattern that depends on the angle. For a dipole, the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the dipole's axis, so maximum at θ=90 degrees. The intensity or power radiated in a particular direction varies with the angle.

I think the general form of the power radiated per unit solid angle for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (something) times (1/(λ^something))^4. Wait, because power is related to the Poynting vector, which for radiation is proportional to the square of the electric field. And for an oscillating dipole, the electric field in the far zone (radiation zone) depends on 1/r, and the field's amplitude depends on the dipole moment and frequency, which is related to λ. So maybe the power would go as 1/λ^4?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Poynting vector S for an electromagnetic wave is (E × H), and in the far field, it's proportional to (1/r)^2. So the power per unit solid angle (intensity) would be proportional to 1/r² multiplied by
