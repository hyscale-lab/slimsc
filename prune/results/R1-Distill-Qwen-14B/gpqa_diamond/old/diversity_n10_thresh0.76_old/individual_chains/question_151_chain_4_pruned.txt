Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0. 

So, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, states are supposed to be normalized vectors, right? So I should check if this is a unit vector. Let's calculate its norm. The components are -1, 2, and 1. The square of their magnitudes: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding those up: 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, but wait, that means the state vector has a norm of sqrt(6), so it's not normalized. Hmm, but maybe I should normalize it first before proceeding. Because otherwise, the probabilities might not add up correctly.

Wait, but the problem as stated doesn't mention normalizing the state. Oh, but wait, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So the operator P must be Hermitian. Let me look at the matrix P given.

The matrix P has three rows. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Let me write this out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Wait, is this matrix Hermitian? For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all elements are real, the conjugate doesn't change anything, so the transpose of P is:

[0, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, 0]

Which is the same as P. So yes, P is Hermitian, which makes sense because observables must be Hermitian.

Now, the possible outcomes of measuring P are its eigenvalues. I need to find the eigenvalues of P to see what possible values we can get, and particularly, the probability of getting 0.

But wait, the question is about the measurement yielding 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them, and then find the eigenvector(s) associated with 0.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

So let's compute the characteristic equation:

det(P - λ I) = 0.

P - λ I would be:

[[-λ, 1/√2, 0],
 [1/√2, -λ,
