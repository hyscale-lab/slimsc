Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are different propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

The NMR data given is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

First, I need to figure out what each peak represents. Let me think about the possible structures. The options are propenyl and butenyl acetates. Acetates have an ester group, so I'm expecting some characteristic peaks, like the ester carbonyl, but that's usually in the 170 ppm region for C=O in 13C NMR, which isn't part of the data here. So I'll focus on the proton NMR.

Looking at the peaks:

At 7.0 ppm, there's a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling constant. I remember that in alkenes, coupling between vicinal protons (like in a trans double bond) can be around 16 Hz. So maybe this is a proton next to a double bond. Also, the integration is 1H, which suggests it's a single proton environment.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quartets (dq). Hmm, quartets often come from coupling with two sets of protons, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a vinyl proton, part of a double bond. Wait, 5.5 is a typical region for vinyl protons in an ester, especially if it's adjacent to an oxygen. Like in an ester group, the substituents on the double bond would be an oxygen from the ester and a CH2 or something else.

The 2.1 ppm singlet for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. In acetates, the ester group is OAc, which is O-CO-O- attached to the main chain. So the methyl group (CH3) in AcO- would be a singlet because it's attached to an oxygen and has no neighboring protons. That fits with the 2.1 ppm peak.

The 1.6 ppm doublet for 3H might be a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. Because it's a doublet, it's coupling with one proton. So perhaps a CH2CH2 group where the CH2 is next to a double bond. Wait, but that's a bit vague.

Let me sketch possible structures. The options are either propenyl or butenyl acetates, cis or trans.

Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc or CH2CH2CH-OAc, but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Alternatively, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc or CH2CH2CH2
