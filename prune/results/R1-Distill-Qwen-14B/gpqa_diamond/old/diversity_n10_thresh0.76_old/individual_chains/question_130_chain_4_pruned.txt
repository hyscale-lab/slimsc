Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, let me think. Alright, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

So the question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The clouds absorb light at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, I remember Lyman alpha is the transition in hydrogen where an electron moves from n=2 to n=1, emitting a photon in the ultraviolet range. Right, so the wavelength is around 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, 1216 is 121.6 nm, yeah.

Now, these clouds are in deep space, and they absorb the light from background quasars at this Lyman alpha wavelength. So when the quasar's light passes through the hydrogen cloud, it gets absorbed at that specific wavelength. But wait, redshift comes into play here because the cloud might be moving away at a high velocity, causing the absorbed light to shift to a longer wavelength (redshifted).

The question is about the lower limit on the redshift. I think that refers to the minimum redshift where the absorption line is still in the optical range detectable by ground-based telescopes. Because if the redshift is too high, the absorbed light might shift into the infrared, which ground-based telescopes can't see as effectively, especially if they're using optical instruments.

So ground-based optical telescopes typically observe in the range of about 400 nm (violet) to around 700-750 nm (red). Let me think. So the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), which is in the far ultraviolet. But when the cloud is at a certain redshift, the absorption line shifts into the optical. So I need to find the minimum redshift (z) such that the observed wavelength (lambda_obs) is just within the optical range, say 400 nm.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again: when the source (quasar) is at redshift z, the observed wavelength of the emission or absorption line is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z).
