Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that when charges are involved and the system is grounded, it changes the way we calculate things. Let me think.

The setup is a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a conducting sphere with radius R. The sphere is grounded, which probably means it's connected to the Earth, so any charge on it can flow in or out. Since it's a conductor, the charges will reside on the surface.

Wait, but how does the grounding affect the potential? Oh right, a grounded conductor has zero potential because it's at the Earth's potential. So the sphere's surface is at V=0.

Now, I need to find the net potential energy of the system. Potential energy in electrostatics is the work done to assemble the charges in their positions. So I should think about the work needed to bring the charge q from infinity to this point, and also any work due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but since the sphere is conducting and grounded, when I bring the charge q near it, charges will be induced. But because it's grounded, the induced charges can flow away. Oh, right! So when you have a grounded conductor and you bring a charge near it, the conductor will have induced charges opposite to the approaching charge. But because it's grounded, the conductor can lose or gain electrons. So the sphere's net charge would be zero? Or not?

Wait, no. If I bring a positive charge near the sphere, the electrons in the sphere will be attracted
