Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. This anhydride has specific NMR spectra. Then, when it reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, it yields two productsâ€”a major and a minor one. Both have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. The NOESY NMR of the major product shows a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. The question is about which resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the starting material and the reaction. The starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride. Since the alkene is cis, when it dehydrates, the geometry will influence the structure of the anhydride.

The anhydride's NMR data is given. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a region where aromatic protons usually appear, but wait, this is a di-anhydride from a diacid. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, di-anhydrides don't have aromatic protons. Hmm, 7 ppm could be something else. Maybe an aldehyde proton? But anhydrides don't typically have aldehyde groups. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton? But 7 ppm is high for vinyl protons, which are usually around 5-6 ppm. So maybe I'm thinking wrong.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the 7 ppm peak is due to a carbonyl group's adjacent protons. But no, carbonyls in anhydrides are usually deprotonated. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide or something else, but the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid, so it's more likely an anhydride.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the structure of the anhydride. The dicarboxylic acid, when dehydrated, forms a cyclic anhydride. For a cis-diacid, the dehydration would form a trans-annular structure, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is a five-membered ring, which is more common, so the structure would be a five-membered cyclic anhydride.

If the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, perhaps it's a proton that's equivalent in some way. Maybe a couple of equivalent protons from a CH2 group next to the carbonyl. Wait, but 7 ppm is a bit high for that. Alternatively, maybe it's a proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like being near carbonyl groups. But I'm not certain.

Looking at the 13C NMR data: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 165 is a carbonyl carbon
