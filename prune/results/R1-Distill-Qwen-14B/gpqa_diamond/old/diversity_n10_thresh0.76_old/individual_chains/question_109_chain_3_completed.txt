Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when particles are identical fermions, Pauli's exclusion principle applies, which affects their spin and other quantum numbers. The question mentions something about isospin, angular momentum, and spin satisfying T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Oh wait, that's probably the Pauli exclusion condition for identical particles.

The initial state is a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. So, the 1S0 notation tells me about their spin and orbital angular momentum. Let me break that down. The notation is (2S+1)LJ, right? So 1S0 would mean 2S+1=1 → S=0 because 2*0+1=1. So S=0, L is S? Wait no, L is the orbital angular momentum. Oh wait, the notation is (2S+1)LJ. So 1S0: 2S+1=1 → S=0. The L is S, which is a spectroscopic notation, so S, P, D, F... S is 0, P is 1, D is 2, etc. So for 1S0, L=0, since S is 0? Wait, no, wait. The 1S0 state: the first number is 2S+1. So 1 → S=0. The letter is S, which is the orbital angular momentum, so L=0. The last number is J, which is 0. So initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So after emission, the NN system will have some new quantum numbers. The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So isospin T is zero. And from the condition given, T = S + L +1 mod 2. Wait, let's see: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 (mod 2). So for the final state, T=0. So substituting, 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L ≡ 1 mod2.

So S and L must add up to an odd number. So S is the total spin of the NN system, L is their orbital angular momentum. So S and L must have opposite parity—if one is even, the other is odd, because their sum must be odd.

Now, the emission of particle X has to conserve angular momentum and parity. Let's think about each option.

The options are about the possible transitions when emitting X. Each option gives the initial state (1S0) and the final state as something like 7D1 + p. Wait, the options are written as 1S0 → something + X. So the emitted particle X is either p (proton), s (maybe?), but wait the note says that the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. Oh, wait no, the options are written as [something] + p, etc. So like option A is 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So the emitted particle is a proton, neutron? Wait, the question says that the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So we'll need to consider the parity of the initial and final states.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, so parity is (-1)^L, which is (-1)^0=1. Because the parity of a state is (-1)^L. So initial parity is +1.

After emission, the NN state will have some parity, and the particle X has parity -1. So the total parity should be conserved. So the initial parity is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X. Wait, no—parity is multiplicative, so the initial parity is the product of the parity of the NN system (which is +1) and the parity of X (which is -1). Wait, but wait: the initial state is the NN system plus the emitted X. Or wait, actually, the initial state is the NN system, emitting X into the final state (so the initial state is NN in 1S0; the final state is NN in some state and X in some state.)

Wait, but the parity of the initial state is the same as the parity of the final state because parity is conserved in strong interactions, I think. Or is it? Well, the problem tells us to consider conservation of parity, so perhaps the initial parity is the same as the final parity.

Wait, maybe I should think about the process: the NN pair emits a particle X. So the initial parity is (parity of NN in 1S0) * (parity of X before emission? No, because X is part of the system. Wait, perhaps the parity of the initial state (before emission) is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the parity of the entire system (NN + X) must be the same before and after the emission.

Wait, no: the initial state is the NN system (parity P_initial = (-1)^L_initial ), and X is a part of it. So when X is emitted, the NN system's parity becomes P_final_NN, and X has parity P_X.

But parity is multiplicative in the sense that the total parity is the product of the parity of each part. Wait, but parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So the initial parity is P_initial = P_NN_initial * P_X_initial. And the final parity is P_final = P_NN_final * P_X_final.

Since the process conserves parity, P_initial = P_final.

So substituting, P_NN_initial * P_X_initial = P_NN_final * P_X_final.

But wait, what's the initial state: it's just the NN system, which is in 1S0, so L=0. So the parity of the NN system is (-1)^0 = +1. The X particle, before emission, is part of the NN system? Or wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of angular momentum and parity conservation.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, which is a state with certain quantum numbers. The final state is the NN system in some state, and the emitted X.

But in terms of parity, the initial parity is the parity of the NN system, which is (−1)^L_initial = (−1)^0 = +1. The parity of X is given as -1. So the overall parity of the initial system is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X? Or is X not part of the initial system? Wait, perhaps the initial state is the NN system, and X is a product of the decay. So the initial state is just the NN system in 1S0 state. So the parity is +1.

The final state is the NN system in some state (let's say T=0) and the emitted X. So the parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN in the final state and the parity of X.

So, parity conservation requires that initial parity (1) equals final parity: P_NN_final * P_X = 1.

Since P_X is given as -1, then:

1 = P_NN_final * (-1) → P_NN_final = -1.

So the parity of the NN system in the final state must be -1.

But the parity of a state is (-1)^L, because for a two-body system, the orbital angular momentum contributes to parity. So for the NN system in the final state, L_final must be such that (-1)^L_final = P_NN_final = -1.

So (-1)^L_final = -1 → L_final is odd (1,3,5,…).

So the NN system's orbital angular momentum L must be odd in the final state.

But wait, the question also gives the condition that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Since T=0, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod2.

So S and L must be opposite in parity. Because if S is even, L must be odd, and vice versa.

Now, let's look at each option. Each option describes the transition from the initial 1S0 state to a final state, plus the emitted X.

Each option's final state is given, so for each, I need to determine the possible L and S of the NN system after emission, and whether their sum S + L is odd.

Wait, each option is written as 1S0 → [something] + [X], where [something] is the final state of the NN system. Let's parse each option.

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

So the final NN state is 7D1. Let's break that down. The term symbol is (2S+1)LJ. So 7D1: 2S+1=7→ S=3. L is D, which is 2. J is 1.

So S=3, L=2, J=1.

Wait, but wait, for the NN system, S is the total spin. So S=3, but that's for two nucleons. Wait, two nucleons can have spin 0,1, or maybe 2? Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin S is 0 or 1. Oh wait, but wait, the option says S=3? That doesn't make sense. Because two nucleons (each spin 1/2) can't have S=3. Because the maximum S is 1 (triplet states). So 2S+1=3 for S=1. Hmm, wait, this is a problem. So option A's final NN state is 7D1, which would imply S=3, which is impossible for two nucleons.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the notation. Let me think: the term symbol for a diatomic molecule (or two particles) is (2S+1)LJ. So for two spin-1/2 particles, S can be 0 or 1, so 2S+1 can be 1 or 3. So 7D1 would have 2S+1=7 → S=3, which is impossible. So this must be a typo, or perhaps it's a typo in the problem? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the 7D1 refers to the angular momentum state of the emitted particle X. Hmm, wait, the option is written as 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So 7D1 is the NN state, and p is the emitted particle.

Wait, no. Because the emitted particle is denoted by the letter, like p, s, f. Wait, the note says that the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So for example, p is l=1, s is l=0, d is l=2, f is l=3. So in option A, the emitted particle is p, which has l=1.

So in option A, the emitted X has l=1. So the parity of X is (-1)^1 = -1. Which matches the given condition that X has intrinsic parity -1.

But wait, the problem says that X has intrinsic parity -1. So for X, parity is (-1)^l. So since X has parity -1, l must be odd. Because (-1)^l = -1 ⇒ l=1,3,5,... So the angular momentum state of X must be p, f, h, etc.

So each option's X is given by the letter: p (l=1), s (l=0, but parity +1 → which contradicts, so X can't be s, because parity must be -1. So any option with X as s would have parity +1, which is not allowed. Let's see the options.

Option D: 1S0 → 3P0 + s. So X is s, which is l=0, parity +1. But X must have parity -1. So this transition is not allowed because it violates parity conservation. Wait, but the problem says that the emitted X has intrinsic parity -1. So any option where X has parity +1 is automatically invalid. So looking at the options:

Option A: p → l=1 → parity -1. Valid.

Option B: 3S1 + p. X is p → parity -1. Valid.

Option C: 3D3 + f. X is f → l=3. Parity (-1)^3 = -1. Valid.

Option D: X is s → l=0. Parity +1. Invalid.

So option D is already invalid because X's parity is +1, which doesn't match the given -1. So option D can't be a correct transition, but the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted.

But wait, the question is about which partial wave is not permitted, considering both parity and angular momentum conservation, as well as Pauli's statistics.

So perhaps I should eliminate options where X's parity isn't -1. So any option where X's parity is +1 is invalid. That would be option D, since X is s (l=0, parity +1), which is not allowed. So option D is not permitted, but wait, the question asks which is not permitted because of Pauli statistics and conservation laws.

Wait, but the question says that the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So any option where X's parity isn't -1 is invalid because it would violate parity conservation.

So all options except D have X with parity -1. So option D is invalid, but the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps the answer is option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The correct approach is to consider each option, compute the parity and the angular momentum conservation, and see which option violates the conditions.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

Wait, the final NN state is 7D1. As I thought earlier, 2S+1=7 → S=3. Which is impossible for two nucleons, since their combined spin can only be 0 or 1. So this option is not physically possible. Thus, this transition is impossible because the final state's spin is impossible.

But the problem states that the options are possible, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, perhaps the 7D1 refers to the angular momentum of the emitted X. No, the notation in the options is 1S0 → [NN state] + [X]. So the first part is the final NN state, and the second part is the emitted particle.

Wait, in option A, the final NN state is 7D1. Let me parse that. 7D1: (2S+1)=7 → S=3, which is impossible for two spin-1/2 particles. So this can't be a valid state. So this transition is impossible regardless of other factors. So option A is invalid.

But wait, the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted, considering all the conservation laws. So perhaps another option also has a problem.

Let me check the other options.

Option B: 1S0 → 3S1 + p.

Final NN state: 3S1. So 2S+1=3 → S=1. L is S, which is 0? Wait, the term is (2S+1)LJ. So 3S1: 3 is 2S+1=3 → S=1. The letter is S, which is L=0. J is 1.

So S=1, L=0.

Now, from earlier, we have T=0. The condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So 0 = 1 + 0 +1 mod2 → 0 = 0 mod2 → yes, it's satisfied. So the isospin condition is okay.

Now, the parity of the final NN state: (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. But earlier we determined that P_NN_final must be -1 because the initial parity was 1 and P_X is -1. So 1 = P_NN_final * (-1) → P_NN_final = -1. But in this case, P_NN_final is +1. So this would violate parity conservation. So option B is invalid.

Wait, but wait, the initial parity is 1. X has parity -1. So the final parity should be P_NN_final * (-1) = 1 → P_NN_final is -1. But in option B, P_NN_final is +1, so this is not allowed. So option B violates parity conservation.

That's a problem. So option B is invalid.

Option C: 1S0 → 3D3 + f.

Final NN state: 3D3. So 2S+1=3 → S=1. The letter is D → L=2. J=3.

So S=1, L=2.

Check the isospin condition: T=0 = S + L +1 mod2 → 0 =1 + 2 +1 mod2 → 0 =4 mod2 → 0=0. Okay, condition satisfied.

Parity of the final NN state: (-1)^L = (-1)^2 = +1. So P_NN_final is +1. But from earlier, the parity equation says P_NN_final must be -1. So 1 = (+1)*(-1) → 1 = -1 → No, this violates parity conservation. So option C is invalid.

Wait a minute, that can't be. Let me check that again.

The initial parity is 1 (from the NN system), and X has parity -1. So the final parity is P_NN_final * P_X. So 1 = P_NN_final * (-1). So P_NN_final must be -1.

In option C, P_NN_final is +1, so 1 = (+1)*(-1) → 1= -1 → which is false. So option C also violates parity conservation.

So option C is invalid.

Option D: 1S0 → 3P0 + s.

Final NN state: 3P0. 2S+1=3 → S=1. Letter P → L=1. J=0.

So S=1, L=1.

Isospin condition: T=0 = S + L +1 mod2 → 0 = (1 +1) +1 mod2 → 0 =3 mod2 → 0=1 → which is false. So condition not satisfied. So this violates the Pauli condition, thus option D is invalid.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. T= S + L +1 mod2.

In option D, S=1, L=1. So 1 +1 =2 → 2 mod2=0. Then 0 +1=1. So 0 ≡1 mod2 → which is false. So condition not met. So option D is invalid.

But wait, another problem with option D is that the emitted X is 's', which has l=0, so parity (+1). Since X must have parity -1, this option is invalid because X's parity is wrong.

So, putting it all together:

Option A: Final state's spin is 3, which is impossible for two nucleons. So invalid.

Option B: violates parity because P_NN_final is +1, which requires X's parity to be -1, but 1 = (+1)*(-1) → yes? Wait, no, the equation is 1 = P_NN_final * (-1), so P_NN_final must be -1. So option B's P_NN_final is +1 → 1 = (+1)*(-1) → 1 = -1 → which is wrong. So option B is invalid.

Option C: P_NN_final is +1 → same issue as B. So invalid.

Option D: X's parity is +1, which is invalid, and also the Pauli condition is violated. So option D is invalid.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps the correct approach is to find which option fails the Pauli condition (T= S + L +1 mod2), parity conservation (P_NN_final =-1, so L must be odd), and X's parity is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express each option's quantum numbers and see.

Let me re-express each option.

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

But 7D1 implies S=3 for NN, which is impossible. So this is invalid. So this transition is not allowed.

But the problem states that the options are possible, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the 7D1 is the state of the emitted X? No, because the options are written as [NN state] + [X].

Hmm, maybe I should re-express each option based on the emitted X's angular momentum and the final NN state's L.

The process is emission, so the total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state has J=0 (1S0). The final state has the NN system's J plus X's l (since J is the sum of L and S, but emission is a form of orbital angular momentum transfer). Wait, no. The total angular momentum must be conserved, but the emitted particle's angular momentum is part of the process.

Wait, perhaps the total angular momentum J must be same before and after. The initial J is 0. So after emission, the sum of the NN's J and X's l (but considering their orbital angular momentum) must be zero.

Wait, but angular momentum is conserved vectorially. So the initial J is 0, so the sum of the final J's (NN and X) must also be zero. So the NN's J plus X's l must be zero vectorially.

Wait, but more accurately, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted X (L_x) and the NN's orbital angular momentum (L_NN) must sum to the initial orbital angular momentum, which is 0 (since 1S0 has L=0). So L_NN + L_X = 0.

So L_NN = - L_X. But since angular momentum is quantized in integer values, L_NN must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. But since L is a non-negative integer, the only possibility is L_NN = L_X and their directions opposite, so their sum is zero. Wait, no. If L_NN and L_X are the same magnitude, but opposite in direction, their sum would be zero. But in quantum numbers, the sum is in terms of magnitude and direction, but since we're dealing with quantum numbers, the total must be zero.

Wait, but in terms of quantum numbers, the possible way this can happen is that the orbital angular momentum of the NN system (L_NN) plus the orbital angular momentum of X (L_X) must be zero. So L_NN = L_X, and their directions are opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, the only way for their sum to be zero is if both have L=0. Because any other L would require another L to cancel it, but in this case, the initial L is 0. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is involved in the emission. The emission would carry away some orbital angular momentum. So the initial orbital angular momentum is 0. So the sum of the orbital angular momentum of the NN system and the emitted X must be zero. So L_NN + L_X must be zero. Therefore, L_NN = L_X, and their directions must be opposite. But since L is a magnitude, L_NN must equal L_X. But for two non-zero L's to add to zero, they must have the same magnitude and opposite directions. But since their sum is zero, the only possibility is L_NN = L_X = 0. Because any other value would require another value to cancel it, which isn't possible unless L_NN and L_X are zero. So, the only way for L_NN + L_X =0 is if both L_NN and L_X are zero. So that would mean the emitted X has L_X=0, which would be s-wave (l=0). But in the problem, X has parity -1, which requires L_X to be odd (l=1,3,...). So this would be a contradiction unless I'm missing something.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing up the orbital angular momentum and the intrinsic spin. No, X is a boson or fermion, but its intrinsic parity depends on its orbital angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think that the total angular momentum is conserved. The initial state has J=0. So the sum of the final J's (NN and X) must also be 0. So J_NN + J_X =0. But J is a vector, so they must be opposite in direction and equal in magnitude. But since J is a non-negative integer, this is only possible if both J_NN and J_X are zero. But X has l=1 (p), so J_X would be at least l=1. So that can't be. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum is the sum of the orbital angular momentum and the spin. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently.

Each option has the initial state as 1S0 (J=0). The final state is [NN state] + [X]. So the total angular momentum of the final state must be zero. So J_NN + J_X =0. But J_NN and J_X are vectors, so their sum must be zero. So J_NN = - J_X. But since J is a non-negative integer, the only possibility is that J_NN = J_X =0. But X has l=1 (p), which means its minimum J is 1 (if spin is zero, J=l). So J_X ≥1. But then J_NN would have to be ≥1 to cancel it, which can't because J_NN is a state of the NN system, and in the options, some have J=0 (like option D: J=0).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the orbital angular momentum conservation. The initial state has L=0. So after emission, the sum of the orbital angular momentum of the NN system (L_NN) and the orbital angular momentum of X (L_X) must be zero. So L_NN = L_X.

Wait, no, because orbital angular momentum is a vector. So L_initial = 0. So L_NN + L_X =0. So L_NN = - L_X. But since L is an integer, the only way this can happen is if L_NN = L_X =0. Because any other value would require the same magnitude but opposite directions, which isn't possible unless they're both zero. So L_NN and L_X must both be zero. But X has parity -1, which implies that X has l=1 (p), which would require L_X=1, which contradicts. So this would only be possible if X has l=0, which has parity +1, which isn't allowed in the problem.

This suggests that no transition is possible, which can't be right because the question expects an answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that the orbital angular momentum must cancel. Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is not involved because the emission is a contact interaction, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to consider that the orbital angular momentum of the emitted X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN system is L. Then, the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so L + l =0, which implies L = l. But since L and l are non-negative integers, the only possibility is L = l =0. But X has l=1, which would require L=1, conflicting with L=0. So this suggests that there's a problem.

Wait, but in the options, the final NN state has various L values. For example, option A has L=2 (D), option B L=0 (S), etc. So perhaps the orbital angular momentum isn't conserved in this way. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing orbital angular momentum with the angular momentum carried by the emitted particle.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider each option and see if it satisfies the Pauli condition, parity conservation, and angular momentum conservation.

Let me make a table:

Option | Final NN State | S | L | J | X | X's l | X's parity | NN's parity (must be -1) | S + L parity | Pauli condition (T=0) | L conservation (L_NN + l_X =0?)

A |7D1| S=3 (impossible)| L=2 | J=1 | p | l=1 | parity -1 → correct | NN's parity = (-1)^2 = +1 → needs to be -1 → violates parity | S=3 impossible → invalid.

B |3S1| S=1| L=0| J=1| p | l=1| parity -1 → correct | NN's parity = (-1)^0 = +1 → needs to be -1 → violates parity. | S+L=1+0=1 → 1 mod2. T=0=1+1 mod2 → 0=0? No, 0= (1+0+1)=2 mod2=0 → condition met. But parity violation.

C |3D3| S=1| L=2| J=3| f | l=3| parity -1 → correct | NN's parity = (-1)^2=+1 → needs to be -1 → violation. | S+L=3 →1 mod2. T=0=1+1 → 0= (1 +2 +1) mod2 = (4 mod2)=0 → condition met. But parity violation.

D |3P0| S=1| L=1| J=0| s | l=0| parity +1 → violates X's parity. | NN's parity = (-1)^1 =-1 → correct. | S+L=2 → 0 mod2. T=0= (1 +1 +1)=3 mod2=1 → 0≠1 → condition violated. Also, X's parity is +1 → invalid.

So, looking at each option:

A: Impossible because S=3 for two nucleons.

B: Parity violation.

C: Parity violation.

D: X's parity is wrong and Pauli condition not met.

So, all options except perhaps some have issues. But the options are given as valid, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod2. So for each option:

Option B: S=1, L=0 → 1+0 +1=2 → 0 mod2 → T=0 → condition met.

But parity is wrong.

Option C: S=1, L=2 → 1+2+1=4 → 0 mod2 → condition met. But parity wrong.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → 1+1+1=3 →1 mod2 → T=1, but given T=0 → condition not met. Also, X's parity is wrong.

So the only options that meet the Pauli condition are B, C, and A (but A is impossible).

Now, considering parity:

Only option D has X's parity correct? No, because D's X is s, l=0 → parity +1. Which is wrong. So all options except perhaps none have all conditions met.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find which option doesn't satisfy either Pauli condition or parity.

Looking back, the question asks which partial wave is not permitted.

Option D's X is s, which has parity +1, which is invalid. So this is not permitted.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze each option based on the given conditions: conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle condition \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). Additionally, the emitted particle \( X \) has intrinsic parity \(-1\), which implies \( l_X \) (its orbital angular momentum quantum number) must be odd (\( l_X = 1, 3, 5, \dots \)).

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial State**: The system starts in the \( 1S_0 \) state, with \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = (+1) \).
2. **Final State**: After emission, the NN system must satisfy:
   - \( T(NN) = 0 \),
   - \( S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \),
   - The parity of the NN system must be \( (-1)^{L(NN)} = -1 \), implying \( L(NN) \) is odd.
3. **Parity Conservation**: The total parity before and after emission must match. Since the initial parity is \( +1 \) and \( X \) has parity \( -1 \), the parity of the NN system after emission must satisfy:
   \[
   P_{\text{NN, final}} \cdot P_X = P_{\text{initial}} \implies P_{\text{NN, final}} = -1.
   \]
   This requires \( (-1)^{L(NN)} = -1 \), so \( L(NN) \) must be odd.

- Final NN state: \( 7D_1 \). From the term symbol \( (2S+1)LJ \), \( 2S+1 = 7 \implies S = 3 \), which is impossible for two nucleons (maximum \( S = 1 \)).
- **Conclusion**: Invalid due to impossible spin state.

#### **Option B: \( 1S_0 \to 3S_1 + p \)**
- Final NN state: \( 3S_1 \). From \( 2S+1 = 3 \), \( S = 1 \). \( L = 0 \) (S-state).
- **Pauli Condition**: \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). Substituting \( S = 1 \), \( L = 0 \):
  \[
  T = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2), \quad \text{satisfied}.
  \]
- **Parity**: \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \), which contradicts the requirement \( P_{\text{NN, final}} = -1 \).
- **Conclusion**: Invalid due to parity violation.

#### **Option C: \( 1S_0 \to 3D_3 + f \)**
- Final NN state: \( 3D_3 \). From \( 2S+1 = 3 \), \( S = 1 \). \( L = 2 \) (D-state).
- **Pauli Condition**: \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). Substituting \( S = 1 \), \( L = 2 \):
  \[
  T = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2), \quad \text{satisfied}.
  \]
- **Parity**: \( (-1)^L = (-1)^2 = +1 \), which contradicts the requirement \( P_{\text{NN, final}} = -1 \).
- **Conclusion**: Invalid due to parity violation.

#### **Option D: \( 1S_0 \to 3P_0 + s \)**
- Final NN state: \( 3P_0 \). From \( 2S+1 = 3 \), \( S = 1 \). \( L = 1 \) (P-state).
- **Pauli Condition**: \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). Substituting \( S = 1 \), \( L = 1 \):
  \[
  T = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2), \quad \text{not satisfied}.
  \]
- **Parity**: \( (-1)^L = (-1)^1 = -1 \), which satisfies the requirement \( P_{\text{NN, final}} = -1 \).
- **X Parity**: The emitted particle \( X \) is \( s \), which corresponds to \( l_X = 0 \). The parity of \( X \) is \( (-1)^{l_X} = (+1) \), which contradicts the requirement \( P_X = -1 \).
- **Conclusion**: Invalid due to both Pauli condition violation and incorrect parity of \( X \).

### Final Answer:
The only option that is explicitly invalid due to the parity of \( X \) being \( +1 \) (instead of \( -1 \)) is **Option D**.
