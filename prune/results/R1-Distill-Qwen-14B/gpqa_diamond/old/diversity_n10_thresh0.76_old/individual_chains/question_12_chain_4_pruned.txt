Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and their kinetic energy after a decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that a Pi(+) meson is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino, I guess. The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they are almost massless, right? So I think the neutrino's rest mass is considered zero in these kinds of problems.

So the question is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A, B, C, D with two numbers each, probably the kinetic energies of mu and nu. Hmm, I need to find the kinetic energies for each.

I remember that in such decay processes, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the Pi is initially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the mu and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since one is a vector and the other is opposite, their magnitudes are equal.

Let me think about energy conservation. The initial energy is just the rest energy of the Pi, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energies are the sum of the energies of mu and the neutrino. The mu has rest mass, so its energy is sqrt(p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4). The neutrino is massless, so its energy is just |p| c.

Wait, but since momentum is conserved, the momenta are equal and opposite. So the magnitude of p_mu equals that of p_nu. Let's denote p as the magnitude of the mu's momentum (since neutrino's is the same, but opposite).

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu.

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, wait. Units might be confusing here. Let me think in terms of MeV.

Wait, in particle physics, masses
