Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Let's take it step by step. The question describes a series of reactions starting with compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane, but more likely propene since it's a common alkene. 

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh wait, that's a classic addition reaction. Propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add bromine (Br2) to form 1,2-dibromopropane, which is compound B. So compound B is probably 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So that's likely an elimination reaction. When a dibromide reacts with a strong base, it usually forms an alkene. So we'd lose two equivalents of HBr. So from 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating HBr would give back propene, but wait, if the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane, which is adjacent dihalide, the elimination would form propene (CH2=CH2CH3) again, but maybe in a different configuration? Wait, or perhaps it's more about which positions are eliminated. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane upon elimination would lose Br from each adjacent C, so removing HBr from each adjacent, leading to double bond between C1 and C2. So compound C would be propene again? But wait, the question says compound C is formed when B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Wait, but wait, is there another possibility?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the base causes a dehydrohalogenation. Oh wait, 1,2-dibromopropane could eliminate twice. Wait, but wait, the reaction of 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH would actually eliminate both Br atoms, but in an E2 mechanism, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the first elimination forms a bromide with one Br, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, 1,2-dibromopropane has Br on adjacent carbons. When treated with alcoholic KOH, one Br leaves as Br- (but wait, in E2, the base abstracts a beta proton,
