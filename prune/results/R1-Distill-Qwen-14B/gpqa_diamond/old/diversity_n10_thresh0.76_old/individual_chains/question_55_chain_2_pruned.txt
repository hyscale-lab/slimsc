Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR problem. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are different types of propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

First, I remember that in NMR, the splitting patterns and chemical shifts can tell us a lot about the structure. Let's look at the data given:

The peaks are at:
7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz)
5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets)
2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

So, let's break this down. The singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably the acetate group (OAc) because the methyl group in acetate is usually around 2.1 ppm as a singlet because the three equivalent protons don't split each other.

The other peaks are more interesting. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a large coupling constant J=16.0 Hz. That's a big coupling, so maybe it's a trans coupling between two vinyl protons. Like in an alkene, where two protons are on opposite sides and couple each other. Wait, but wait, maybe it's a substituent on the double bond.

The peak at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, so that means this proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons. Wait, a doublet of quartets usually comes from two coupling partners. For example, a proton adjacent to two different environments. Or perhaps it's a proton that's part of a coupling with two different protons.

Let me think about the structures of the options. The options are all acetates, so they have an ester group (OAc). The substituents are either propenyl or butenyl, with cis or trans double bonds.

So, for acetates, the general structure is R-O-CO-O-R', but wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait: acetate esters are of the form R-O-CO-CH3, right? Or wait, no, acetate is the ester where the R is attached to the oxygen. So, for example, ethyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH3. So in our case, the R group is a propenyl or butenyl group.

Let me think about the structure. The ester would be something like CH2=CH-CH2-O-Ac for propenyl acetate, but wait, the position of the double bond matters.

Wait, the options are:
A) Cis-butenyl acetate
B) Trans-propenyl acetate
C) Cis-propenyl acetate
D) Trans-butenyl acetate

So butenyl is four carbons, propenyl is three. So, the structure would be:

For propenyl: CH2=CHCH2-O-Ac (but the double bond could be between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3). Wait, propenyl is usually CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propenyl is
