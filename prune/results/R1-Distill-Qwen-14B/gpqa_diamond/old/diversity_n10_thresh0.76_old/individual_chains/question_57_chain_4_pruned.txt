Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude is related to the differential cross-section, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, the problem gives me phase shifts for different l values. The phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh right, phase shifts are part of the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude. Each l value corresponds to a different phase shift δ_l.

The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is a sum over all l of (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} [something with Legendre polynomials], but wait, I think the imaginary part might have a simpler expression when considering the direction along the beam, which is θ=0 degrees. Oh right, because at θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ) becomes P_l(1), which is 1 for even l and 0 for odd l. Wait, no, P_l(1) is always 1, but for even and odd l, the behavior of P_l(x) as x approaches 1 is different. But wait, actually, P_l(1)=1 for all l. Because that's the value when the argument is 1, which happens when θ=0.

Wait, but when I'm calculating the imaginary part of the amplitude at θ=0, maybe some terms are zero. Let me think again. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^{∞} (2l +1) [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )/(2ik) ] P_l(cosθ)

Wait no, I think the general form is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ] P_l(cosθ)

Wait, no, I'm mixing up different parts. Another approach: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is related to the total cross-section. Because the differential cross-section dσ/dΩ is proportional to |f(θ)|², but the real and imaginary parts of f contribute to different parts of the cross-section.

Wait, another formula I remember: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is (1/(2k)) times the sum over l of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l). Because when θ=0, P_l(1)=1 for all l. So the expression for Im f(0) is:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)

Oh wait, but wait, let me think. The scattering amplitude f can be written as f = f_real + i f_imaginary
