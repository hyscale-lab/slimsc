Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Wait, meson resonances decay, right? The mean decay distance would depend on how long the meson lives before decaying. The longer it lives, the farther it can travel before breaking apart. So decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle.

I remember that the lifetime (mean lifetime) τ is related to the width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, no, I think it's τ = ħ_bar divided by the width. Wait, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime through the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So Γ is the energy uncertainty, and τ is the lifetime uncertainty, so Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, actually, I think the relationship is τ = ħ / Γ. So yes, that makes sense. So once I have τ, the mean lifetime, I can find how far it travels before decaying.

But wait, another thing: the meson's speed. The decay distance is speed multiplied by lifetime. So distance L = v * τ.

But what's the speed of the meson X? Since it's produced with energy E_X, which is higher than its rest mass energy. So I can find the velocity using relativistic mechanics.

The energy E is related to the rest mass by E = gamma * m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). Once gamma is known, I can find the velocity beta (v/c) from gamma.

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Alternatively, beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2). Hmm.

Wait, let's compute gamma first. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E = 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. Gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

So gamma is about 6.6667. Then beta is sqrt(1 - (1/ gamma²)).

Plugging in gamma = 6.6667, gamma squared is 44.4444. So 1/gamma² is 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta is
