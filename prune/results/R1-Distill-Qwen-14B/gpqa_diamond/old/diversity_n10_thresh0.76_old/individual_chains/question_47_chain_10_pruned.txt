Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's see.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The strong bands are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretching. Since there are two bands, maybe it's a secondary amine or an amide. Secondary amines typically have one N-H, but sometimes the peaks can be split or there might be other factors. Alternatively, the two peaks could be from an amide's two N-H groups, but wait, amides usually have a single peak around 3300 cm-1. Or wait, maybe it's an amine with two different hydrogen environments, like in a substituted amine. Another possibility is that one of the bands is from an O-H stretch, but the problem says 'medium to strong intensity bands' which might not fit an O-H. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic amine, which often shows broad N-H peaks.

Then, there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a key region for carbonyl groups. So we're probably looking at either an ester, amide, ketone, or maybe an aldehyde. The 1720 is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl for an ester or amide. Wait, esters usually have around 1725-1740, and amides a bit lower, maybe 1650-1700. So 1720 could fit either. Hmm, need to think about that.

Now, let's look at the 1H NMR. The signals are as follows:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: That sounds like a methyl group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ethyl group. The triplet suggests two neighboring protons, so ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to something. So maybe an ethyl ester or an ethoxy group.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H: Broad singlet for two protons. Could be an N-CH2 group, maybe in an amide. Or perhaps an OCH2 group, but the broadness might suggest something like an N-H or exchange, but perhaps it's an N-CH2.

- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H: Quartet with 2H. So, another ethyl group? Wait, quartet usually has 4 peaks, which would come from coupling with two neighboring protons. So for a quartet with 2H, perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group where the CH2 is next to another CH2. So maybe CH2CH2. Wait, like in an ethyl ester: OCH2CH3. The quartet in NMR for ethyl esters is usually around 4.1-4.3, as a quartet (the -OCH2- group). Wait, but here it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N.

Wait, but let me think about the options. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide is PhCONH2, but with an ethoxy substituent. So in that case, the N would be part of the amide. The IR would have the amide N-H around 3300, and the carbonyl around 1680 or so. But the IR here has 1720, which is higher than amide. So maybe that's not right.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That's formamide, which is HCONHR. So the structure would be O=CONH-(Ph-OCH2CH3). The carbonyl in formamide is around 1700, but maybe higher. The IR at 1720 could fit. The N-H would be around 3300, maybe two peaks if it's a formamide, but formamide has one NH. Wait, but the IR shows two peaks in the N-H region. Hmm, maybe that's related to something else.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be PhNH2 with a propionyl group. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be PhNH2-CO-OCH2CH3? Or perhaps it's PhNH2-CO-CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So it's an amide? Or a propionamide? Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be an ester where the acid is propionic acid and the alcohol is 4-aminophenol. So the structure would be PhNH2CO-OCH2CH3. Wait, but that would be an amide. Hmm, but the NMR seems to have a quartet and a triplet. Wait, let me think. If it's an ester, the ethyl group would show up as a triplet at around 1.2 ppm (the CH3O) and a quartet around 4.1 ppm (OCH2). But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher. Hmm.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure would be PhNH2COOCH2CH3. So the benzoate is the ester, with an ethyl group. In this case, the carbonyl would be an ester, so IR around 1720 makes sense. The NMR would have the ethyl ester group: the CH3 would be triplet around 1.2, and the OCH2 would be quartet around 4.1-4.3. But in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher. Hmm, maybe that's a problem. Or perhaps the coupling is different. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.

Wait, the NMR signals: at 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H), and at 4.5 ppm quartet (2H). Let's think about the structure. If it's an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would give a quartet around 4.1-4.3, and a triplet at 1.2. So the triplet is present. So the 1.20 ppm (t) is the CH3. The quartet is the OCH2. But in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher than usual for an ethyl group. Maybe that's because of some deshielding effect. So maybe the OCH2 is attached to something else, like an amide?

Alternatively, what about the 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H). Broad suggests exchange, like NH or OH. But in this case, maybe it's an N-CH2 group. For example, in a secondary amide, the N would have two CH2 groups. Or perhaps it's an N-CH2 connected to something else.

Wait, the given formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees: maybe a benzene ring (which is 4), plus a double bond or ring. So, the structure likely contains a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking back at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Benzamide (so benzene plus amide, which is a carbonyl and NH). So that's 4 (benzene) + 1 (amide C=O) + 1 (NH) = 6? Wait, no, each double bond or ring is a degree. So benzene is 3 (three double bonds), amide has a C=O (1), and an NH is a single bond. So total would be 4 (benzene) +1 (C=O) =5. So that fits. So 3-ethoxybenzamide would have substituents: ethoxy and amide on the benzene.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide
