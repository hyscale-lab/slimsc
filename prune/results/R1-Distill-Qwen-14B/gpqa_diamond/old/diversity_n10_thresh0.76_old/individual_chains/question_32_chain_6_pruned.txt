Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm. Let me start by figuring out what the nucleus is.

The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium has an atomic number of 3. So Li-6 because 3 protons +3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A =6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The energy of a particle depends on its rest mass and velocity. The formula I remember for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me calculate that.

So v = 0.96c. Plugging into gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) 

Calculating (0.96)^2: 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Take the square root of 0.0784. Let's see, sqrt(0.0784) is approximately 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, correct. But wait, 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857... So gamma is about 3.5714.

But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, 0.0784, let me think sqrt(0.0784). Hmm.

Wait, another approach: 0.0784 is 784e-4. The square root is 28e-2, which is 0.28, so yes, that's correct. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me compute 0.96^2 accurately. 0.96 * 0.96: 96 *96 is 9216, so 0.96^2 is 0.9216.

Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So 1/0.28 is 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately
