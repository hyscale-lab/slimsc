Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. From what I remember, luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits. I think the formula for luminosity when considering blackbody radiation is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, R is the radius and T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, the problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Both stars have their masses larger by the same factor, but wait, mass might not directly affect luminosity unless it's related to temperature somehow. Hmm, but in this case, the problem gives me the wavelengths at which they appear brightest, and those are the same. Oh, wait, the peak wavelength where a blackbody emits most intensely is given by Wien's law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same, right? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. Because their λ_max are equal.

Wait, but wait. The problem says through spectroscopy, the astronomers found that they are the same in terms of the wavelengths at which they appear brightest. So same peak wavelength implies same temperature. So T1 = T2.

But wait, there's another part. The radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Radial velocity is the speed at which a star is moving towards or away from us. So that affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, right! The Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength isn't the same as the actual emitted wavelength if the star is moving.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So they observed the same λ_max for both. But the real λ_max (emitted) could be different because of the Doppler shift. So I need to adjust for that.

So, the observed wavelength λ_obs is related to
