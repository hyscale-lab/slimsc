Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, I remember that nucleophilicity depends on the solvent and the basicity of the nucleophile. Since the question specifies aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent, the strength of the base might play a role here. In polar protic solvents, stronger bases are less nucleophilic because they get solvated more, right?

The nucleophiles given are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide ion (OH⁻)
3. Propionate ion (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate ion (HS⁻)

Wait, methanol is a neutral molecule, so it's a weaker nucleophile than the deprotonated ones. The other four are all negatively charged, except maybe I should check each.

But in aqueous solution, the solvation effect is significant. Stronger bases (like OH⁻ and HS⁻) are more stabilized by solvation, which can make them less nucleophilic in polar protic solvents. But wait, HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻ because sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so the thiolate is a weaker base than hydroxide? No, wait. Actually, the conjugate acid of HS⁻ is H2S, which is weaker acid than water (pKa around 7 for H2S vs. around 15.7 for water). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, H2S is a weaker acid than water. So the conjugate base of H2S (HS⁻) is a stronger base than OH⁻. Wait, because if a weak acid has a strong conjugate base. So H2S is weaker acid than H2O (since H2O has a higher pKa), so HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻. But wait, that's not correct because in aqueous solution, the strength of the base can be affected by the solvent as well.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The strength of the base in a solvent depends on how well it can stabilize the conjugate acid. In water, OH⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻ because H2O is a weaker acid than H2S? Wait, no, because H2O has a higher pKa (~15.7) than H2S (~7). Wait, that's not right. Wait, H2S has a pKa1 around 7, and H2O has a pKa around 15.7. So H2S is a stronger acid than H2O. So the conjugate base of H2S is weaker than the conjugate base of H2O. Wait, no. Because if HA is a stronger acid, A⁻ is a weaker base. So since H2S is stronger acid (lower pKa) than H2O, then HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So OH⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because thiolates are known to be stronger bases than hydroxide in some contexts. Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, maybe I should compare their conjugate acids. The conjugate acid of HS⁻ is H2S, and of OH⁻ is H2O. H2S is a stronger acid than H2O, so HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. Because a stronger acid (H2S) means its conjugate base (HS⁻) is weaker. So OH⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻.

Wait, but I've heard that HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻. Maybe because in polar aprotic solvents, the order is different. Wait, no, in water, which is the solvent here, I think OH⁻ is a stronger base. Because the conjugate acid of OH⁻ is H2O, which is weaker acid than H2S, so OH⁻ is a stronger base.

So for nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, the order is more about the strength as a nucleophile considering solvation. The more the nucleophile is stabilized by solvation, the less reactive it is.

So in polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity is inversely related to their basicity because stronger bases are more solvated.

Wait, but wait, in a polar protic solvent, the more polarizable the nucleophile is, the better it is. So for example, in water, the order of nucleophilicity for some common ions is I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻. Because F⁻ is the strongest base and gets more solvated, making it less reactive.

So applying that to the given nucleophiles:

The given nucleophiles are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is a strong base, an alkoxide ion. But its structure is bulky, which might affect its reactivity.

2. Hydroxide ion (OH⁻): Strong base, highly charged, so in water, it's highly solvated. So lower nucleophilicity compared to less basic species.

3. Propionate ion (CH₂CH₂COO⁻): This is a conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a weaker base than OH⁻ because propionic acid is weaker than water (pKa ~4.88 for propionic acid), so the propionate ion is a weaker base than OH⁻.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): Neutral molecule, so much less nucleophilic in water than the deprotonated ones. It's a poor nucleophile.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): The conjugate base of ethanethiol, which is a stronger acid than water? Wait, no. The pKa of H2S is about 7, and water is about 15.7. Wait, H2S is a stronger acid than water. So HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So in terms of basicity, OH⁻ is stronger than HS⁻.

Wait, but I thought in some solvents, thiolates are better nucleophiles than hydroxide. For example, in polar aprotic solvents, thiolates are better nucleophiles because they're less solvated. But in polar protic solvents, like aqueous solution, the more basic the ion, the more it's solvated, so the less nucleophilic it is.

So among the ions, the order of basicity is:

OH⁻ > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (since it's an alkoxide, but wait, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is an alkoxide, so it's a strong base, perhaps stronger than OH⁻? Wait, no. Wait, the cyclohexoxide is an alkoxide, so it's a strong base, but perhaps in solution, its basicity is similar to OH⁻? Or is it less? I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the steric hindrance makes it a weaker base than OH⁻. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky base. Bulky bases are weaker because they're less able to stabilize the negative charge due to poor approach of the proton. So perhaps in solution, the cyclohexoxide is a weaker base than OH⁻. Or maybe the same strength as other alkoxides.

Alternatively, the strength of the base might be compared via their conjugate acids. The conjugate acid of 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is 4-methylcyclohexanol. The pKa of cyclohexanol is around 16-18, which is weaker acid than water (pKa ~15.7). So the conjugate base (the cyclohexoxide ion) is a stronger base than OH⁻, because the weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base. Wait, if 4-methylcyclohexanol is weaker acid than water, then its conjugate base (the cyclohexoxide) is a stronger base than OH⁻. So this would mean the cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than OH⁻.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact pKa values. Let me think. Water has a pKa of ~15.7. Tertiary alcohols like tert-butanol have pKa around 19-20, so their conjugate bases (tert-butoxide) are stronger bases than OH⁻. So I think the cyclohexanol, which is a secondary alcohol, maybe has a pKa around 18-20? Wait, no, cyclohexanol is a secondary alcohol. Let me think: primary alcohols have pKa around 19-20, secondary around 18-20, tertiary around 19-21. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps the pKa of cyclohexanol is around 16. So if that's the case, then the cyclohexoxide would be a stronger base than OH⁻ because cyclohexanol is weaker acid than water (if its pKa is higher than 15.7). So then cyclohexoxide would be a stronger base than OH⁻.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's proceed with what I think: the order of basicity in aqueous solution is OH⁻ < 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate < Ethanethiolate (HS⁻). Or wait, maybe I should re-examine the pKa values.

Wait, H2S has a pKa of about 7, so HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻ because H2S is a stronger acid than H2O. So in terms of basicity: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > OH⁻ > Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) ?

Wait, no. Because H2S is stronger acid than H2O. So HS⁻ is weaker base than OH⁻. So the order of basicity from strongest to weakest would be:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (if its conjugate acid has higher pKa than water) → OH⁻ → HS⁻ → propionate (since propionic acid has pKa ~4.88, so propionate is weaker base than OH⁻ and HS⁻).

Wait, but propionate is weaker than both OH⁻ and HS⁻. So in order of basicity (strongest to weakest):

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (if its conjugate acid pKa is higher than 15.7)
2. OH⁻
3. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)
4. Propionate ion (CH2CH2COO⁻)
5. Methanol (neutral, so least basic)

Wait, no. Because if the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, then it's the strongest. Otherwise, if the cyclohexanol's pKa is lower than water's, the cyclohexanolate is a weaker base than OH⁻.

Wait, another approach: the order of nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents (like water) is typically inversely related to their basicity because strong bases are more solvated and less reactive.

So, the stronger the base, the less nucleophilic it is in polar protic solvents. Because the solvent stabilizes them through solvation, making them less reactive.

So, the order of nucleophilicity would be: weaker base → stronger nucleophile.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the general trend. For example, in water, the order of nucleophilicity among halides is I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻. Because F⁻ is the strongest base (of these), so it's the least nucleophilic in polar protic solvents.

So applying that, the weaker the base, the better the nucleophile in aqueous solution.

So, the order of nucleophilicity would be from weakest to strongest base:

Methanol (weakest base, neutral) → Propionate → Ethanethiolate → Hydroxide → 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base, but maybe poor nucleophile because of solvation).

Wait, no, wait. Because if 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a stronger base than OH⁻, then it would be more solvated, making it a worse nucleophile than OH⁻. But that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Wait, let me find the pKa of 4-methylcyclohexanol. I think cyclohexanol has a pKa around 16, which is higher than water's (15.7). So the conjugate base (cyclohexanolate) would be a stronger base than OH⁻. So in terms of strength of base: cyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ (since H2S has pKa 7, lower than 15.7, so HS⁻ is weaker base than OH⁻).

So in terms of basicity:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base)
2. OH⁻
3. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)
4. Propionate
5. Methanol (weakest)

But wait, propionate's conjugate acid (propionic acid) has pKa ~4.88, which is much lower than 15.7, so propionate is a weaker base than ethanethiolate and OH⁻. So the order is as above.

Now, considering nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent:

The more basic a nucleophile, the less reactive it is in such solvents because they're more solvated. So the order of nucleophilicity would be the reverse of their basicity.

So, the weakest base is the best nucleophile in aqueous solution.

So, from weakest to strongest base:

Methanol (prop base) < Propionate (pKa 4.88) < Ethanethiolate (pKa ~7) < Hydroxide (pKa ~15.7) < 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (pKa ~16-18).

Wait, no. Wait, the lower the pKa of the conjugate acid, the weaker the base. So the higher the pKa of the conjugate acid, the stronger the base.

So for 4-methylcyclohexanol, pKa ~16 → stronger base than OH⁻ (pKa ~15.7 of H2O). So 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻. So the order of basicity is:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. OH⁻
3. Ethanethiolate (since H2S pKa 7 < 15.7, so HS⁻ is weaker base than OH⁻)
Wait, no. Because H2S (pKa 7) is a stronger acid than H2O (pKa 15.7), so HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So the order becomes:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. OH⁻
3. Ethanethiolate
4. Propionate
5. Methanol

So in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (polar protic), the order is the reverse. The weakest base is the best nucleophile.

So the order of nucleophilicity should be:

Methanol < Propionate < Ethanethiolate < OH⁻ < 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate

Wait, but that can’t be right because OH⁻ is more basic than Ethanethiolate. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

If the basicity is:

4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > Ethanethiolate > Propionate > Methanol.

Then the nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (polar protic) would be the opposite:

Methanol (least basic) > Propionate > Ethanethiolate > OH⁻ > 4-methylcyclohexanolate (most basic, least nucleophilic in aqueous).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because methanol is a neutral molecule, which is a poor nucleophile compared to deprotonated species. So this approach must be wrong.

I think I'm mixing up the concepts. Another approach: in aqueous solution, the deprotonated species are better nucleophiles than the protonated ones. But in polar protic solvents, the more the ion is stabilized (i.e., more solvated), the less reactive it is.

So the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is determined by how well the nucleophile is stabilized by solvation. The stronger the base, the more it's stabilized (solvated), so the less reactive.

So the order should be from least solvated (weakest base) to most solvated (strongest base).

But I'm getting stuck. Let me perhaps list the given nucleophiles and their expected nucleophilicity in aqueous solution.

The nucleophiles are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: strong base, highly solvated → poor nucleophile.

2. OH⁻: strong base, very solvated → poor nucleophile.

3. Propionate: weaker base than OH⁻ and HS⁻ → less solvated, better nucleophile.

4. Methanol: neutral, poor nucleophile.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): weaker base than OH⁻ → less solvated than OH⁻, so better nucleophile than OH⁻.

Wait, wait. Let's think about HS⁻ versus OH⁻. Since H2S is a stronger acid (lower pKa) than H2O, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So HS⁻ is less solvated than OH⁻. Thus, in aqueous solution, HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

So putting it together, the order of nucleophilicity from best to worst in aqueous solution would be:

Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) > OH⁻ > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate? Or wait, no.

Wait, the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it's more solvated. So it's a worse nucleophile than OH⁻. Wait, but wait, the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so in a polar protic solvent, the cyclohexanolate is less nucleophilic than OH⁻.

Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to arrange the nucleophiles from best to worst nucleophilicity in aqueous solution.

- Methanol is neutral; it's a poor nucleophile.
- Propionate is a weaker base than both OH⁻ and HS⁻, so it's a better nucleophile than them? No, wait. Wait, no, wait. In polar protic solvents, the stronger the base, the worse the nucleophile. So the weakest base would be the best nucleophile.

So the order of basicity (strongest to weakest):

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base) > OH⁻ > Ethanethiolate > Propionate > Methanol (weakest base).

So the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (weakest base first, because they're less solvated):

Methanol (worst) < Propionate < Ethanethiolate < OH⁻ < 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (best nucleophilicity? No, wait, no. Wait, no, because in aqueous solution, stronger bases are worse nucleophiles because they're more solvated. So the weakest base has the best nucleophilicity.

So the order of nucleophilicity (best to worst) should be:

Methanol (weakest base) < Propionate < Ethanethiolate < OH⁻ < 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate.

Wait, but that can't be right because 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is the strongest base, so the worst nucleophile.

Wait, I'm getting myself in a loop. Let me try to find an alternative approach. Another way is to compare the nucleophilicity of the same type of ions in aqueous solution.

In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for similar anions is: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ because the larger ions are less solvated than the smaller, more basic F⁻.

Similarly, for other ions:

- Thiols (RS⁻) are better nucleophiles in polar aprotic solvents, but in polar protic solvents, the more basic the ion, the less nucleophilic.

So, comparing the given ions:

Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) is less basic than OH⁻, so in aqueous solution, it's a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

Wait, but I thought earlier that HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻ because H2S is a stronger acid. So in that case, HS⁻ is a weaker base, so less solvated, making it a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in aqueous solution.

So among the given ions:

The nucleophilicity order in aqueous solution would be: 

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → better nucleophile than OH⁻ because it's less basic.

Then comes 2. OH⁻.

Then comes 1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate? No, wait, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it's more solvated and less nucleophilic than OH⁻. So that can't be.

Wait, if 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a stronger base than OH⁻, then in aqueous solution, it's a worse nucleophile than OH⁻. So the order of nucleophilicity would be: 5 (HS⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) > 3 (propionate) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) ?

Wait, no, because propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻ and OH⁻, so it's a better nucleophile than them.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting some of the orders wrong.

Let me list the given nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strong base)
2. OH⁻ (strong base)
3. Propionate (weaker base)
4. Methanol (neutral)
5. Ethanethiolate (weaker base than OH⁻)

So in terms of basicity:

1 > 2 >5 >3 >4.

In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is opposite of basicity because stronger bases are more solvated. So stronger base → worse nucleophile.

So nucleophilicity order would be:

4 < 3 <5 < 2 <1 (but wait, no: 4 is methanol, a neutral molecule. So the order would be: 4 is the worst nucleophile, followed by 3, then 5, then 2, then 1? No, wait, because 5 is less basic than 2, so it's a better nucleophile than 2.

Wait, so the order from best to worst nucleophilicity in aqueous would be:

5 (Ethanethiolate) > 2 (OH⁻) > 3 (Propionate) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) >4 (Methanol).

Wait, that can't be right because 1 is the strongest base, so it's the worst nucleophile. So the correct order would be:

Ethanethiolate (5) > OH⁻ (2) > Propionate (3) > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) > Methanol (4).

Wait, but wait, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it's more solvated and worse in nucleophilicity. So in order, it's worse than OH⁻.

So the order would be: 5 > 2 > 3 > 1 >4.

But looking at the options:

Option D is 5,2,1,3,4. So the order would be 5 >2 >1>3>4, which doesn't match what I just thought.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake about the cyclohexanolate's nucleophilicity.

Wait, considering that the cyclohexanolate is bulky. Steric hindrance can affect nucleophilicity. So even though it's a strong base, the bulky structure might make it a poor nucleophile in SN2 reactions, for example.

So between the cyclohexanolate and, say, OH⁻, which is a better nucleophile in aqueous solution?

I think that in terms of basicity, cyclohexanolate is stronger than OH⁻, so in aqueous solution, it's more solvated and less nucleophilic. So OH⁻ is a better nucleophile than cyclohexanolate.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base, so it's a worse nucleophile in aqueous solution.

So the order would be:

5 (HS⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) > 3 (propionate) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) >4 (methanol).

But looking at the options:

Option A: 5,2,3,1,4 → which would be 5 >2 >3 >1 >4. But in our tentative order, 3 comes after 2 but before 1. So that would be 5>2>3>1>4.

Looking at the options, option D is 5,2,1,3,4. So our tentative order is 5>2>3>1>4, but looking at the options, option D is 5,2,1,3,4. That would mean 3 comes after 1, which contradicts our order.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the order of 3 and 1.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual nucleophilicity of these ions in aqueous solution. I remember that for example, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻, but in polar aprotic it's F⁻ > Cl⁻ > Br⁻ > I⁻.

But for other ions, like the thiolates, in aqueous solution, the order is different. Thiols are less basic than hydroxide, so in aqueous solution, they are better nucleophiles. So HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in water.

So among the given ions:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) > 2. OH⁻ > 3. Propionate > 1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate >4. Methanol.

Wait, but why is propionate better than the cyclohexanolate? Because the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base, so more solvated, making it a worse nucleophile than propionate.

So in the order:

5 > 2 > 3 > 1 >4.

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option A is 5,2,3,1,4. So option A is the sequence 5 >2>3>1>4.

So the order would be:

5 (ethanethiolate) is the most reactive, followed by 2 (OH⁻), then 3 (propionate), then 1 (cyclohexanolate), and the least reactive is 4 (methanol).

Looking at the options:

Option A) 5,2,3,1,4.

So the correct order is 5 >2 >3 >1>4.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the cyclohexanolate is less nucleophilic than propionate because it's a stronger base and more solvated.

Yes, that makes sense. So in that case, the order is 5 >2 >3 >1 >4.

Looking at the options, option A says 5,2,3,1,4.

So the answer would be option A.


To determine the order of nucleophilicity of the given nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we consider their basicity and solvation effects. In polar protic solvents like water, stronger bases are more solvated, which reduces their nucleophilicity. Thus, the nucleophilicity order is inversely related to basicity. The given nucleophiles are:

1. **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: A strong base (alkoxide ion) but highly solvated in water, making it a poor nucleophile. Additionally, steric hindrance due to its bulky structure further reduces its nucleophilicity.

2. **Hydroxide ion (OH⁻)**: A strong base and a good nucleophile in aqueous solution, but less nucleophilic than weaker bases due to solvation.

3. **Propionate ion (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: A weaker base than OH⁻ and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, making it less solvated and more nucleophilic than these stronger bases.

4. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: A neutral molecule, making it the poorest nucleophile among the given options.

5. **Ethanethiolate ion (HS⁻)**: A weaker base than OH⁻ because H₂S is a stronger acid than H₂O. This makes HS⁻ less solvated and a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in aqueous solution.

### Order of Nucleophilicity in Aqueous Solution
From best to worst nucleophilicity:
1. **Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)**: Least basic and least solvated, making it the best nucleophile.
2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: More basic and more solvated than ethanethiolate, making it the second-best nucleophile.
3. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: Less basic than OH⁻ and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, making it a better nucleophile than the latter.
4. **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: A strong base but highly solvated and bulky, making it a poor nucleophile.
5. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: Neutral and the poorest nucleophile.

### Correct Option
The correct order of nucleophilicity is **5 > 2 > 3 > 1 > 4**, which matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
