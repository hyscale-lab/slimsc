Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me start by carefully analyzing the given data.

First, the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch or maybe an N-H. But given the context of the reaction, which involves HI and red phosphorus, I'm thinking it might be an O-H stretch. Then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The peaks around 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are probably from aromatic C=C stretches, so the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is often a phenolic -OH proton. But wait, if it's a carbonyl, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But sometimes, if it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid, it could be around 10-12, but that's usually a broad peak. But in this case, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's a phenolic O-H.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical aromatic protons. The doublets suggest coupling between two sets of equivalent protons. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene, like two protons next to a substituent on the para position. For example, if there's a substituent on the benzene ring, like a methyl or another group, the adjacent protons would split into doublets.

The next peaks are 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's break these down.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) might be a CH group adjacent to another CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group perhaps connected to another CH2. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is likely a methyl group attached to something, like a CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal CH3, like from an ethyl group. So putting this together, maybe it's something like a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Or perhaps a branching like a butyl group.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure. The aromatic ring part: if it's para-substituted, the substituent would be on positions 1 and 4. Let's say there's a substituent on carbon 4. The substituent could be a
