Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, I should probably figure out what the initial concentration of the acetic acid solution is after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution.

So the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

To find the new concentration, I can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. Here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, and V2 is 40 cm³.

So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) / 40 = 0.025 M. Wait, wait, 0.05 *20 = 1, then divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, during the titration with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid (a weak acid). The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Let me find out how much of each is present.

Wait, but first, how many moles of acetic acid do we have initially in the diluted solution? The volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) and concentration is 0.025 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

Wait, 0.025 is 25 mmol per liter, so 0.04 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol. Right.

So when we titrate, the moles of NaOH added at 25% would be 25% of 0.001 mol. Wait, no, because the stoichiometry is 1:1. So at 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

So the reaction will proceed as follows: the NaOH will react with the acetic acid.

Initially, we have:
CH3COOH: 0.001 mol
NaOH added: 0.00025 mol (0.25 of the total needed for equivalence)

So, the reaction will consume 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH and produce 0.00025 mol of CH3COO^-.

So the moles after reaction:
CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol
CH3COO^-: 0 + 0.00025 = 0.00025 mol

Wait, but the total volume of the solution will increase as we add NaOH. Hmm, but how much? Because we're adding NaOH in a certain volume, but I don't know the exact volume at 25% titration. Alternatively, perhaps the volumes can be considered additive, but maybe it's easier to calculate concentrations based on moles and the total volume.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the total volume at 25% titration. Let me think: the initial solution is 40 cm³. Then, when we add 25% of the required NaOH volume, what's that?

Wait, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. So the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 M = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Ah, so 25% titration means adding 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So the total volume at 25% is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So now, the concentrations of CH3COOH and CH3COO^- can be found.

CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L = let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but wait, another approach: in a buffer solution (since we have both the acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given as the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = approx 4.74 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733, which is about 4.74).

So, in this case, [A^-] is 0.00025 mol, and [HA] is 0.00075 mol. So the ratio is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3.

So log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.74 + (-0.477) = 4.263. So approximately 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. So that's a possible answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the total volume doesn't matter for the Henderson equation because it's a ratio. Because both [A^-] and [HA] are divided by the same volume, so the ratio remains the same.

So yes, the ratio is 1/3, so the pH is 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263, which rounds to 4.26. So that's the pH at 25% titration.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized, so all of it becomes acetate ions. But wait, then the solution is just the sodium acetate in water, which is a basic solution because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

So the concentration of acetate would be the moles of acetate (0.001 mol) divided by the total volume. Let's figure out the total volume at equivalence.

The initial volume is 40 cm³, and we added 10 cm³ (from earlier), so total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, to find the pH, we can calculate the Kb of acetate. Since Ka * Kb = Kw = 1e-14 at 25°C.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M.

Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C). Let's compute that.

sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

Then, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98, so pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options given. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the Kb calculation.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

The square root is sqrt(1.081e-11) = about 3.288e-6 M. So [OH^-] is ~3.288e-6.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.48 (since log(3.288)=0.517, so 6 -0.517=5.483).

pH = 14 -5.483 = 8.517. So approximately 8.52.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says pH 4.26 and 8.52. So that's possible.

Wait, but wait, the options for the equivalence point in the options are A:8.52, D:6.92, etc.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's redo the acetate ion concentration and Kb.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. At equivalence, all of it becomes acetate. The volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's right.

Kb is correct. So [OH^-] would be sqrt(0.02 * 5.405e-10) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 3.288e-6.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6) = 5.48, so pH is 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is 8.52.

Wait, but this doesn't match any of the options given correctly. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) 4.26; 8.52 → So at 25%, pH is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. That's what I calculated.

But wait, another thought: when I'm at equivalence, perhaps the solution isn't just the acetate. Let me think: when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, at equivalence, you've formed the conjugate base (acetate) which will hydrolyze in water to form OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

So my calculation of pH around 8.52 seems correct, which would correspond to option A.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D says 4.57;6.92. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Adding 20 cm³ of water makes it 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) /40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Correct.

So at 25% titration, 25% of the 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted. So 0.00025 moles of NaOH added. So CH3COOH is 0.00075 mol, acetate is 0.00025 mol.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log (acetate/acid) → pKa is 4.74, ratio is 0.00025/0.00075 = 1/3 → log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263 → pH 4.26, which matches option A's first value.

Equivalence point pH is 8.52, which is the second value in option A. So that makes option A the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, in my initial calculation for the equivalence point, I think I miscalculated the Kb. Let me recheck.

Wait, acetic acid's Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb for acetate is Kw/(Ka) = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct.

At equivalence, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M. So Kb = 5.405e-10.

So the expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is [OH^-], then:

x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → Let me calculate that accurately.

3.288e-6 → log(3.288) is about 0.517, so 6 - 0.517 = 5.483. So pOH is 5.483, pH is 14 -5.483 =8.517, which is ~8.52.

So yes, equivalence point is about 8.52. So option A's second value is correct.

Wait, but what about the options: option A says first value 4.26 and second 8.52.

So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, looking at the other options, for example, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using the formula for the pH of a salt solution.

The formula for the pH of a salt (conjugate base) in water is:

pH = (pKa + pKw - pKb)/2 ?

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to calculate it correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me compute it precisely.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405405e-10.

Concentration of acetate: 0.02 M.

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assume that x is the [OH^-], then [CH3COOH] is x. So:

5.405405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x).

Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Then, x² = 5.405405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081081e-11) = approx 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517.

So the pH is approximately 8.52, which matches option A.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A: 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or something else, but I think for an introductory problem, that's beyond the scope. So I'll stick with my calculations.


To solve the problem, we first determine the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = M_2 \cdot V_2 = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.25 \cdot 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After the reaction:
- Remaining moles of acetic acid: \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \),
- Moles of acetate formed: \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).

The total volume of the solution is the initial volume (40.00 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (2.50 cm³, calculated as 25% of 10 cm³, the volume required for equivalence). Thus, the total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 + 2.50 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.74 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.74 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.74 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

### At the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The moles of acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at equivalence is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.0200 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base, and its \( K_b \) is calculated using:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Substituting \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.0200 \, \text{M} \):

\[
[OH^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.0200 = 1.08 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values correspond to **Option A**.

Answer: A
