Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's take it step by step. The question is about the formation of cobalt complexes with thiocyanate ions and determining the percentage of a specific blue complex among all cobalt species.

Alright, let's see. The problem states that the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit odd because normally the β values increase with the formation of more stable complexes, but here β4 is lower than β3. Hmm, maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Oh well, I'll proceed as given.

The goal is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I'm assuming "blue dithiocyanato" refers to the Co(SCN)_2 complex, which would be the Co(II) with two SCN- ligands. Wait, or maybe it's a different one. Let me think. The options ask for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex—dithiocyanato meaning two SCN- groups attached. So, that would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is probably the β2 case. But wait, the β values go up to β4. So the complexes are Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4, each with their respective β values.

Wait a minute, the stability constants β1, β2, β3, β4 correspond to the log of the formation constants for adding each SCN- ion. So β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)2, and so on. So the formation of each successive complex is governed by these β values. So the overall formation constant for each complex is the product of the previous β and the current one.

Wait, no. The way stability constants work is that each step has a β. So for a complex that has
