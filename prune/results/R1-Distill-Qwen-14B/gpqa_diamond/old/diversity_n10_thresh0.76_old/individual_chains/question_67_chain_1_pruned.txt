Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about electrons in p orbitals. Let me read the question again and take it step by step.

The question says that there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. l is the total angular momentum quantum number, and m is the z-component of that total.

The question asks: if we measure the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z, what's the joint probability of getting both eigenvalues as -ħ?

Hmm. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum L. Each L has components like L1z and L2z. For a p orbital, the angular momentum quantum number l is 1, so each Li has eigenvalues -ħ, 0, +ħ. Because the eigenvalues are mħ, and m can be -1, 0, +1 for l=1. So m here is the z-component.

So the state is |1,1,2,-1>. Let me unpack that. Each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The total angular momentum is l=2, and its z-component is m=-1.

Wait, but how does the coupled state relate to the individual states? I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, you need to combine their states. The total angular momentum state is a combination of the individual states.

The problem is about measuring L1z and L2z. So we're dealing with the individual z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum.

The state given is a coupled state, which is a combination of the product states of the individual angular momenta. So to find the probability of a particular outcome for L1z and L2z, I think we need to express this coupled state in terms of the product basis states, specifically the ones where L1z and L2z are known.

Let me think about the product basis. Each electron's state can be represented in terms of |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>. So the product state would be |m1, m2>. The coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> is a linear combination of these |m1, m2> states.

So our given state is |1,1,2,-1>. The possible m1 and m2 values that can contribute to this state would be combinations where m1 + m2 = m_total = -1. Because the total m is m1 + m2.

Wait, but l1 and l2 are both 1, so m1 and m2 can each be -1, 0, +1. So their sum m1 + m2 can range from -2 to +2. The coupled state has m=-1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1 are (-1,0), (0,-1), and (-2, +1) is not possible because m can't be lower than -1 for each electron. Wait, no, m1 and m2 can be -1,0,1. So possible pairs for m1 + m2 =-1 are:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum -1

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum -1

m1=-2? No, because l=1, so m can't be lower than -1.

Wait, maybe I should think of all possible combinations that sum to -1:

m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

So m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible combinations:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum -1.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum -1.

m1 = +1, m2 = -2 → but m2 can't be -2
