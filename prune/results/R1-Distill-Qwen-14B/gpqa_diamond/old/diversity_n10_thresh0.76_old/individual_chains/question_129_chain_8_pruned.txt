Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions. Let me break down each step and see what I can figure out.

First, the reaction scheme:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are two hints provided.

Hint a) says that compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting a ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So compound A must be a carbonyl compound (like an aldehyde or ketone) because that's what reacts in Wittig reactions.

The product from the Wittig here is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to visualize that structure. The main ring is cyclopentane. At position 4, there's a substituent which is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is a methylene group attached to a propane where the substituents are on the second carbon. So it would look like a CH2-C(CH3)2 group attached as a double bond? Wait, no, the ylide would add to the carbonyl group. Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. Then, position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is (CH2)2C=, so when that's attached via a double bond, maybe it's a cyclopentene ring? I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclopentane where at position 4, there's a substituent that's a propenyl group (like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the ylide could be adding to a carbonyl group of compound A, which would form an alkene. So if the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, then the original compound A probably had a carbonyl group adjacent to the cyclopentane.

Wait, perhaps compound A is a cyclopentanone with substituents.
