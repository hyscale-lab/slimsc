Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to work through it. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

Firstly, I'll try to visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene numbering can be tricky. Let me think: the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, the substituents are in the ortho and meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, but wait, the numbering might be different. Let me sketch it out. Let's assign the positions as follows: the ethoxy group is at position 1, the nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. Because the numbering starts with the first substituent, so we need to arrange them in a way that gives the correct positions.

Wait, no, wait. The IUPAC name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has ethoxy, 2 has tert-butyl, and 3 has nitro. So the substituents are at adjacent positions. So, ethoxy-OCH2CH3 at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, the substituents are in the ortho and meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, but how does that arrangement come about in synthesis steps? Let me think about the directing effects of the substituents.

Benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution. The substituents can be introduced in a specific order considering their activating or deactivating nature and their directing effects.

Let me list the substituents again: ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (a bulky alkyl group), and nitro (NO2). 

Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an electron
