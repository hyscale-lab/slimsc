Okay, so I have this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The setup is that a scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and ran it on serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The qPCR efficiency was 100%, which makes sense because that's perfect efficiency—so each cycle doubles the target. The R² is 1, meaning the data fits the curve perfectly, so the calibration should be spot on. The slope is -3.3. Wait, I remember that the slope in a qPCR calibration curve relates to the efficiency. The formula I think is something like y = mx + b, where m is the slope. Oh right, the slope for a 100% efficient PCR should be -3.32, approximately. So here it's -3.3, which is really close. So that lines up with 100% efficiency. So that's not the issue.

Looking at the results: the Ct values are given for each concentration. Let's list them out.

At 100,000 copies/μl, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So average around 34.2.

At 10,000: 30.6,30.9,31.2. Average about 31.

At 1000: 27.3,27.6,27.9 → ~27.6.

At 100: 24, 24.3,24.6 → ~24.3.

At 10: 20.7,21,21.3 → ~21.

Wait, so each time the concentration is ten-fold diluted. So 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10x dilution, each step a tenth of the previous. So looking at the Ct values, each step should increase by about 3.3 cycles, right? Because with 100% efficiency, each ten-fold dilution would require 3.32 cycles more to reach the same Ct.

Let me check. The difference between 100,000 and 10,000: Ct goes from 34.2 to 31.2. That's a difference of about 3 cycles. Wait, 34.2 minus 31.2 is 3.0. Similarly, from 10,000 to 1000: 31.2 to 27.6 → 3.6. Wait, that's a bit more than 3.3. Hmm.

Wait no, I should think in terms of the data. Let me calculate the actual differences. Let's see:

At 100,000: 34.2 (average)
At 10,000: 31.2 (average) → difference is 34.2 -31.2=3.0

At 10,000: 31.2
At 1000: 27.6 → difference 3.6

At 1000: 27.6
At 100: 24.3 → difference 3.3

At 100: 24.3
At 10: 21 → difference 3.3

Wait, but the expected difference for a 10-fold dilution at 100% efficiency (slope=-3.32) is about 3.3 cycles. So each step should be around a 3.3 Ct difference.

So let's compute the differences between consecutive concentrations. Let's take the averages:

100,000 →10,000: 34.2 -31.2=3.0 → a bit less than expected.

10,000 →1000: 31.2-27.6=3.6 → higher than expected.

1000 →100: 27.6-24.3=3.3 → exactly.

100 →10:24.3-21=3.3.

So the first step (highest concentration to next) is a 3.0 difference, which is 0.3 less than expected. Then the next is 3.6, which is 0.3 higher. Then two steps that are exactly 3.3.

So the question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options are looking for why there are discrepancies.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Ten-fold
