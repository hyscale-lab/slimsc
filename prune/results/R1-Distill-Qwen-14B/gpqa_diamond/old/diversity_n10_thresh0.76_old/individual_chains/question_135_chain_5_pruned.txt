Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let's try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question gives me the Lagrangian for the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is:

L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, wait. Let me parse that. It looks like X interacts with fermions because it's in the term with the fermion fields. The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order.

So, the first thing I remember is that for a boson to decay into fermions, the energy (or mass) of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because, in particle physics, when a particle decays, the rest mass of the parent must be greater than or equal to the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. So, X can decay into a pair of fermions only if 2m_fermion ≤ m_X.

What's the mass of X? 6 GeV. So each fermion in the decay products must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Because 2m ≤6 → m ≤3 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the fermions and their masses. The known elementary particles' masses: electrons, muons, taus, quarks (u, d, s, c, b, t), and neutrinos. Let me list their masses:

Electron (e-): ~0.511 MeV → negligible, about 0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ-): ~105.7 MeV → ~0.1057 GeV
Tau (τ-): ~1.78 GeV
Neutrinos: very light, maybe around 0.0000001 GeV or less, so negligible.

Quarks: Up (u): ~2 MeV → 0.002 GeV
Down (d): ~4 MeV → 0.004 GeV
Strange (s): ~95 MeV → ~0.095 GeV
Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
Top (t): ~173 GeV → Way too heavy, since 2*173 is 346 GeV, way larger than X's mass.

So, the fermions that X can decay into are those with mass ≤ 3 GeV. Let's see which fermion pairs are possible.

Looking at the options, the possible decay products include pairs like b bbar, c cbar, s sbar, etc. But wait, the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, so 2m_b would be 9 GeV, which is larger than X's mass (6 GeV). So X cannot decay into b bbar. So any option that includes b bbar
