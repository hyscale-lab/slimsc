Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think. So, the setup is that there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they're sending a spacecraft to Earth. The spacecraft is super fast, moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options are A to D.

Wait, right, the question is about time experienced by the astronaut. So, we're dealing with special relativity here, specifically time dilation. Time dilation occurs because when you're moving at speeds close to the speed of light, time slows down for you relative to a stationary observer.

But wait, I need to figure out the proper time, which is the time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the shortest time measured in the moving frame, which in this case is the spacecraft's frame.

So, the first thing I should probably do is find out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, how far away is the Large Magellanic Cloud? I think it's one of our neighboring galaxies. I remember that the distance is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let me check that in my memory. Oh, right, I think the approximate distance is about 163,000 light-years. So, let's say roughly 160,000 light-years.

Wait, but wait, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. That's really close to the speed of light. So, from the Earth's frame, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. But since the astronaut's time is different due to time dilation, I need to calculate the proper time.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, time dilation formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But that's from the perspective of a stationary observer. But the astronaut experiences their own proper time, which is less.

So, the proper time τ is equal to t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth's frame. Or wait, maybe I should think of it as the Earth's frame is the one that's seeing the spacecraft moving, so the distance is D, the spacecraft's speed is v, so the time in
