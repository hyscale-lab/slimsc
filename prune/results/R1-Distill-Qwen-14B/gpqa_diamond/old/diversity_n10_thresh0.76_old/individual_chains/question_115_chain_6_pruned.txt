Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate each other, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one in the upper-right and the other in the lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions. The options given are A) 74, B) 172, C) 138, D) 96.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what I remember from my studies. When particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. Since they're matter and antimatter, their annihilation converts their mass into energy, which is carried away by the photons.

First, I should probably figure out the momenta of the electron and positron before the collision. Because in a collision like this, momentum is conserved. So the total momentum of the system before the collision must equal the total momentum after. Since they annihilate into photons, the photons' momenta must add up to the initial total momentum.

Wait, but photons have momentum equal to E/c, and their direction matters too. Since momentum is a vector, I have to consider direction. Oh, right, the problem says the electron is moving from the left, so its velocity is to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left. So their initial momenta are in opposite directions.

Let me think about the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So gamma is higher when v is closer to c. For the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, it's 2.

Wait, but I might not need the exact velocities. Because in terms of momentum, for a relativistic particle, the momentum p is gamma*m*v. But wait, wait, no—actually, the correct relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v, but more accurately, since in relativity, the momentum is also expressed as p = gamma m v where m is the rest mass. Wait, no—I think I might be confusing that. Let me get that straight.

Actually, the relativistic momentum is p = gamma * m_0 * v, where m_0 is the rest mass. So for each particle, I can compute their momentum.

Wait, but electrons and positrons have the same mass, right? So m_e for both is the same. So for the electron moving to the right (let's say the positive x-direction), its momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly, the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p, but since it's to the left, I'll consider it as negative in the x-direction.

But wait, maybe I can compute their momenta in terms of gamma and m_e. Alternatively, since I don't know v, maybe I can express everything in terms
