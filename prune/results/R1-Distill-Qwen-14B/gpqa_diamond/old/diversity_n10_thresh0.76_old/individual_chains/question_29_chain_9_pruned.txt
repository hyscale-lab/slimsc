Okay, so I've got this question about genetics and plant breeding. Hmm. Let's try to break it down. So the situation is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for making this compound, which has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate this compound, probably by mutating the gene so it doesn't function anymore.

They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants. Then they sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon area. The question is which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so changes in exons could affect the protein product. But wait, the first exon is at the beginning, so maybe it's near the start codon.

Looking at the options, I need to see what each mutant does. Each mutant's sequence is given, and I need to compare them to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. So the beginning is ATG, which is the start codon.

Let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Compare to intact. Let me see the changes. The intact starts with ATGTTTCTC... The mutant is ATGTTCTACGCTG... Wait, looking at the first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, the first change is at position where the intact has TTT and the mutant has TTC. Oh, because the fourth base is T vs C? Let me count. The intact is ATG TTT CT... so the fourth nucleotide is T (third position is G, fourth is T). So in mutant 1, the fourth is C? Wait, no, wait. Let me index the sequences.

Wait, the entire sequences are longer, but let's focus on the beginning.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So the first 10 bases: Intact is ATGTTTCTCG, Mutant1 is ATGTTCTACG.

Let me line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So the first three nucleotides are the same (ATG). Then in the next three, Intact has TTT, mutant has TTC. So the fourth base in the gene (the first T after ATG) is a T in intact, but in mutant 1, it's a C. So the third codon is TTT in intact (which is Phe), but in mutant1 it's TTC (also Phe, since the third base can vary in some codons). Wait, no, no, because the third base is C in mutant1. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's clarify. The first codon is ATG (start, Met). The next codon in the intact is TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), etc.

In Mutant 1: The second codon is TTC (also Phe), third is TAC (Tyr), fourth is GCT (Ala). So the sequence begins with ATG TTC TAC GCT...

So the first codon remains Met, the second is Phe again, so no change in amino acid.
