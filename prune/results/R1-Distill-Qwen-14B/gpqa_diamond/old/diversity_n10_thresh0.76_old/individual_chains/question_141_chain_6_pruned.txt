Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of possible products when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, it's known for inducing elimination, maybe like a dehydrohalogenation or something. Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. I'm not exactly sure what 'd' stands for here. Oh, right, sometimes in nomenclature, the suffix 'd' might indicate a deuterium, but wait, no, in this context, maybe it's a typo or abbreviation. Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-d something else... Wait, maybe it's 1-bromobenzene-2-ol? No, no, the question doesn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe 'd' is a placeholder for something else. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as 1-bromobenzene-2-dichloride? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a typo and the compound is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? Or maybe it's a misprint, and the structure is 1-bromo-2,2-dichlorobenzene? Alternatively, perhaps 'd' stands for a different substituent. Wait, perhaps it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Maybe the 'd' is a mistake and the compound is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, or toluene with a bromo group at the para position? Or maybe it's 1-bromobenzene-2-dimethylamino, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps 'd' is a typo, and the structure is 1-bromobenzene-2-dichloromethyl or something else. Wait, maybe I should just focus on the reaction conditions and see what's possible regardless of the substituent.

Wait, perhaps 'd' stands for 'deutero', like a deuterium. So maybe the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-deut
