Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about measuring observables P and Q on a quantum state. Right, observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. The state is a column vector, and when you measure an observable, the state collapses into one of the eigenstates of that operator.

So the state at time t is given as (-1, 2, 1) as a column matrix. Wait, I think I should write that as a vector: |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, right? So the sum of the squares of the amplitudes should be 1. Let me check: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so this vector isn't normalized. That's a problem because probabilities are based on squared magnitudes. So maybe I need to normalize it first. Or perhaps the question is set up in a way that doesn't require normalization? Hmm, probably, I should normalize it. So the normalized vector would be each component divided by sqrt(6).

Wait, but when we make a measurement, the probability is the squared modulus of the inner product between the state and the eigenstate. So perhaps I should proceed by finding the eigenstates of P and Q.

Let me first look at the operator for Q. The matrix for Q is diagonal: [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,-1]]. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, and -1. The eigenvectors are along the basis vectors. For eigenvalue 1, the eigenvector is (1,0,0)^T. For 0, it's (0,1,0)^T. For -1, it's (0,0,1)^T.

Now, the operator P is given. Let me write out its matrix:

P:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, I should check if this is a Hermitian matrix because observables are Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of P's matrix: since all elements are real, it's just the transpose. So P's transpose is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Which matches P, so yes, it's Hermitian. Good.

So now, for P, I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Hmm, let's see. The eigenvalues are solutions to det(P - λI) = 0.

But solving a 3x3 determinant might be a bit tedious. Let me try it.

The matrix P - λI is
