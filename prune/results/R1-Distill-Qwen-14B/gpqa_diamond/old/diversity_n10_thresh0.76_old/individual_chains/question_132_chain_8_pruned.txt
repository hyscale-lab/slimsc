Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which two compounds are in the mixture. Hmm, let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that the mixture is 1:1 of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four, each with two different compounds.

Wait, so the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation calculation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. Four degrees, which could be a benzene ring (which is 3) plus one double bond or ring. But wait, the molecular formula for each compound is C10H14. That's 10 carbons and 14 hydrogens. So each compound is a substituted benzene with some methyl groups or something else.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Both are four methyl groups attached to benzene. Their formula would be C10H14 because benzene is C6H6, and four methyl groups add 4*(CH3) so 4*3=12 H added, but benzene loses 6 H, so total H would be 6 + 12 -6*1 (since each methyl replaces a H)? Wait, wait, no. Let me think: benzene has six H. Each CH3 group replaces a H. So for each methyl group, you lose one H and add three. So each methyl adds 2 H. So four methyl groups would add 4*2=8 H. So benzene is C6H6. 4 methyl groups: C6 +4C= C10. H: 6 +8=14. So yes, each is C10H14.
