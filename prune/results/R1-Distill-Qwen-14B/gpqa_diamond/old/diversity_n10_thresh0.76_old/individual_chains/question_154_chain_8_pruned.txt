Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The chemist found a white solid, and they've got some spectral data to help identify it. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound. My job is to use the given data to pick the correct structure.

Let's break down the information provided.

First, the mass spectrum: the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%). Then there's a peak at m/z 158 which is 32%. Hmm, the molecular ion is the highest point, so the molecular weight is 156. But there's a peak at 158, which is two units higher. That might suggest something like a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has an atomic weight around 35, but some Cl isotopes are around 37. So if the molecule has a Cl, the molecular ion would be at 156 (assuming the common 35Cl), and the 37Cl would give a peak at 158. Let me check the options for Cl presence.

Looking at the options: A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That has a Cl. B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, also Cl. C is phenyl chloroformate, which I think is something like OCl-CO-O-phenyl? Or wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-, maybe attached to a benzene ring. D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid, also Cl. So all options except maybe C have Cl? Or wait, C is phenyl chloroformate. Let me see the molecular formula.

Wait, the molecular ion is 156. Let's calculate the molecular weights.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl would make it C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: carbon is 12*7=84, H is 5*1=5, Cl is about 35, O is 16*2=32. So 84+5=89 +35=124 +32=156. Oh, that matches.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid would have the same molecular formula as B, just the Cl is in a different position. So same molecular weight, 156. So either B or D would have same weight.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding Cl and OH: C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as B and D. So molecular weight would be same 156.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-. So the structure is ClCOO-C6H5. So the formula would be C6H5COClO? Wait, no. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as the others. So molecular weight same as 156. So all options except maybe C have same molecular formula. Wait, maybe not. Let's compute.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Benzoic acid with Cl would be C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight 12*7=84 +5=89 +35=124 +16*2=32 â†’ 84+5=89, 89+35=124, 124+32=156. So for B, D, and A, it's same as 156.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is O=C(O-C6H5)Cl. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as the others. So why would the molecular ion be at 156? Because all options have the same molecular formula. Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, molecular weight of phenyl chloroformate: C6H5O2Cl. Let me compute. C=12*7=84 (since C6H5 is 6 carbons, plus COCl-O-C6H5? Wait, no, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So formula is C7 H5 Cl O2. So same as the others. So all options have molecular weight 156. So why the mass spec has 156
