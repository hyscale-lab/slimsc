Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the mouse model. Let's break down the problem. 

The setup is that the researcher is using a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of GADD45G. They introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. The construct was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine, and they're selecting for antibiotic resistance. But the protein isn't overexpressing as expected.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to see if there's anything wrong that would prevent the expression of the protein.

First, I'll scan the sequence to find the start and stop codons. The start codon is AUG, which is at the very beginning (5' ATG...). The end of the coding sequence should be a stop codon, which is usually TAG, TGA, or TAA.

Let me look through the sequence. The sequence given is the plus strand, so the coding strand. So the sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Now I need to find where it stops.

I'll go through the sequence looking for the stop codons. Let's see:

... [Looking through the sequence] ...

Hmm, the sequence continues for a while. Let me check the last part. It ends with ...GGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, at the very end, there's GAG TGA. Let's see: looking at the last part:

...GCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Breaking that down into triplets (codons):

GCT G TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC C GAG CGT TAA CGA TGG TGC CCT CAG CAT CAC CCT CCC CGA GTGA (Wait, wait, the last part is GAG TGA? Let me look again.

No, the sequence ends with ...CGAGTGA3'. Wait, 3' end. So the last part is CGAG TGA. Wait, but in the coding sequence, the stop codon is at the end. So looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking at the end:

The last few nucleotides are ...GCTGCGGCGCCGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, perhaps I should index it better. Let me look for the stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the sequence ends with ...GAGTGA. So in the coding strand, the stop codon would be the triplet TGA, which is the complementary of GAT on the template. So let's look for TGA in the coding sequence.

Looking again: Let's see, the last part is: ...GTT TTG C GAG GAG AGC C GAG CGT TAA CGA TGG TGC CCT CAG CAT CAC CCT CCC CGA GTG A. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the reading frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct ends with ...TGA. Let me scan the sequence for TGA.

Looking for TGA in the sequence:
