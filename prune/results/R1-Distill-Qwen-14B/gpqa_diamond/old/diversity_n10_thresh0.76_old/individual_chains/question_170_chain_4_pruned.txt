Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, Sy, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4). Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as vectors, often 2-component vectors for spin-1/2 particles like electrons.

Wait, the state is written as (3i, 4), right? So that must be a column vector. So the vector is [3i; 4], or in components, χ = [3i, 4]^T. Right, so the first component is 3i and the second is 4. 

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product: ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Oh right, S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction. I think the Pauli matrices are involved here. Oh, the note says that σ_y is a matrix:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

And for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y, right? So Sy = (ħ/2) * σ_y. That's important because the expectation value will involve this factor.

So the steps I need to take: first, compute the expectation value using the given vector and the σ_y matrix. Then multiply by ħ/2 to get the final answer.

Let me write down the steps. Let me denote the state vector as χ = [a, b]^T, where a=3i and b=4. The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y, which is ⟨σ_y⟩ = (a* b' ) where the matrix is multiplied. Wait, no, the expectation value is χ† σ_y χ.

Wait, σ_y is a 2x2 matrix. So the calculation would be:

⟨σ_y⟩ = χ† σ_y χ

So let's compute that. Let me write out χ and σ_y:

χ = [3i, 4]^T

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So χ† is the conjugate transpose, so [ -3, 4* ] since 3i becomes -3i (since the conjugate of 3i is -3i). Wait, no. Wait, the state is [3i, 4]. So the conjugate transpose (bra) would be [ -3i, 4* ]? Wait, no, 4 is real, so 4* is 4. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So χ† σ_y is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by σ_y matrix. Let's compute that matrix multiplication.

The first element is ( -3i * 0 ) + (4 * i ) = 4i. The second element is ( -3i * (-i) ) + (4 * 0 )= (-3i)(-i) = 3i^2. Oh wait, i squared is -1. So 3i^2 is 3*(-1) = -3. So χ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now, multiply this by χ, which is [3i; 4]. So the product is (4i)*(3i) + (-3)*(4). Let's compute each term:

First term: 4i *3i = 12 i². i² is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: (-3)*4 = -12.

Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the expectation value of σ_y is -24. Now, multiply by ħ/2 to get ⟨S_y⟩.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

Wait, but let me double-check the matrix multiplication steps because I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate χ† σ_y.

Wait, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ]

σ_y is:

[ 0   -i ]

[i    0 ]

So when I multiply χ† (1x2) by σ_y (2x2), the result is a 1x2 vector.

First element: (-3i)*0 + 4*i = 0 + 4i =4i.

Second element: (-3i)* (-i) +4*0 = ( (-3i)(-i) )= 3i²
