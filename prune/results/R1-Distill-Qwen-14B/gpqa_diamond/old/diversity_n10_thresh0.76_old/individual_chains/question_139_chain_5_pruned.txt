Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about two compounds, A and B, which when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce two different diketones. I need to find out which starting materials A and B are correct from the given options.

Hmm. The reactions produce diketones. Wait, what kind of reactions involve HCl, NaNO2, and water? Oh right, I think that's the treatment for the formation of diketones from diols. Or maybe it's related to oxidation? Or perhaps it's a diazotization reaction? No, wait, diazotization usually involves aromatic amines and nitrous acid. But we're dealing with ketones here.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing this with the Stephen reduction or some kind of enolate formation. Alternatively, maybe it's the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's more about ketones forming lactones or ketones with more oxygen.

Wait another thought: Could it be a pinacol rearrangement? Oh wait, pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol (vicinal diol) is treated with a strong acid, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So when a diol (like pinacol) is treated with H2SO4, it rearranges to form a ketone. But in this case, the treatment is with HCl, NaNO2, and water. Wait, but NaNO2 is often used in the production of nitrous acid, which is a mild oxidizing agent.

Wait, another approach: The products are diketones, so maybe each starting material is a diol, and the reaction converts the diol into a diketone. But wait, how?

Wait, let me think about the reagents: HCl, sodium nitrite, and water. Sodium nitrite and HCl would form nitrous acid (HNO2). Nitrous acid is a mild oxidizing agent. So maybe the starting materials are secondary alcohols, and the reaction is an oxidation.

Wait, but secondary alcohols oxidize to ketones. So if A and B are secondary alcohols, treating them with an oxidizing agent would form ketones. But the products are diketones, which have two ketone
