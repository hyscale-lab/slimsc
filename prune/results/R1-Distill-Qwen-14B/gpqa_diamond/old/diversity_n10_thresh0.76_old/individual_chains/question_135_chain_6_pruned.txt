Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The Lagrangian interaction is given, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to determine which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm, I remember that when a particle decays, the mass of the boson must be at least equal to the sum of the masses of the decay products. So for each possible decay channel, I should check if the boson's mass is greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermion involved. Because, for a boson decaying into a fermion-antifermion pair, each particle has mass m, so the total energy needed is 2m. If X's mass is 6 GeV, then any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

Wait, but let me think about the fermions and their masses. The known fermions and their approximate masses are:

- electron (e): negligible, around 0.0005 GeV
- muon (μ): about 0.105 GeV
- tau (τ): around 1.777 GeV
- up (u) and down (d) quarks: very light, like a few MeV each, so their masses are negligible
- strange (s): about 100 MeV, which is 0.1 GeV
- charm (c): around 1.5 GeV
- bottom (b): around 4.7 GeV
- top (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV

So, for each possible decay product pair, I need to ensure that 2 * m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV.

Looking at the options, the possible decay channels listed include pairs like b bbar, c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, and various leptons.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-
The b quark is about 4.7 GeV. So 2m(b) = ~9.4 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So decay into b bbar is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
c quark is about 1.5 GeV. 2m(c) = 3 GeV, which is okay. tau is ~1.777 GeV, 2*1.777 ≈3.55 GeV. So 6 GeV is more than enough. Muon is 0.1 GeV, so 2*0.1=0.2 GeV. All these are allowed. So option B seems possible.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
t quark mass is about 173 GeV. 2*173 is way above 6 GeV, so this decay is impossible. So option C is out.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
Again, the b quark is too heavy. So decay into b and bbar isn't allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. I just thought about the quark masses. The up and down quarks are so light. So their decay products would require almost no energy. So X can decay into u ubar, d dbar. Similarly,
