Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to determine how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene catalyst, typically used for ring-closing metathesis, ring-opening metathesis, and cross metathesis. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. So, what exactly happens when Grubbs is applied to an alkene?

So, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, noâ€”wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, pentene has five carbons. So, positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. So, structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Let me think. Pentane has five carbons. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me count again.

Pentane is CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3. So, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Now, 3-methyl would be a methyl branch on the third carbon of the pentene. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, but wait, let me count. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So, the double bond is between 1 and 2, then the third carbon (C3) has a methyl group attached. So, the structure is CH2=
