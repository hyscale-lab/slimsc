Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. Hmm. The question is about finding the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in a solution. I'm a bit rusty on stability constants, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. They're asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, blue dithiocyanato... I think that's the [Co(SCN)2]²+ complex. Or wait, maybe the blue one is a different one. Oh, I remember that [Co(SCN)4]^2- is blue, but wait, the problem says dithiocyanato, which would be two SCN- ions. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

Wait, the problem says "blue dithiocyanato". Oh, wait, I think [Co(SCN)2]^+ is blue, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) complexes have different colors, but I'm not certain. Maybe this detail isn't crucial for the calculation. The key is to find the percentage, so perhaps I can proceed with the math regardless.

So, the problem is about the distribution of Co(II) species in solution, considering the different complexes they can form with SCN-. The stability constants (β) are given for each complex. Stability constants determine the extent to which a metal forms complexes with ligands.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and then sum up the fractions for the desired species.

Let me list the possible complexes. The metal is Co²+ and the ligand is SCN⁻. The possible complexes would be:

1. Co²+ (free ion)
2. Co(SCN)²+ (formed by adding two SCN⁻ to Co²+)
3. Co(SCN)₂⁴+ (adding four SCN⁻)
4. Co(SCN)₃^6+ (adding six SCN⁻)
Wait, but the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's four β values. Hmm, the number of possible complexes depends on the coordination number. Cobalt often has a coordination number of 6, but sometimes 4 or 5. Wait, but the stability constants provided go up to β4. Maybe the complexes are [Co(SCN)]²+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)₂]^4+ (n=2?), wait I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)]²+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)₂]²+ (n=2), [Co(SCN)3]^0 (n=3), and [Co(SCN)4]^2- (n=4). Because the charge on the complex would be 2+ for Co²+ plus 4 SCN⁻ (each -1) gives 2+ + 4*(-1) = -2. So, the charge on [Co(SCN)4]^2- is -2. Hmm, but in the problem, the β4 is 16, so perhaps the four complexes are:

n=1: Co(SCN)²+ → charge: 2+ + 1*(-1) = +1? Wait, no, because each SCN- is a monodentate ligand. Wait, maybe I should think about the formula as [Co(SCN)_m]^{2-m} because each SCN- contributes a -1 charge. So, for m=1: [Co(SCN)]^{+1} (since Co²+ has charge +2, subtract 1 for the SCN- → +1?), m=2: [Co(SCN)₂]^0 (since 2*(-1) subtracted from +2 gives 0), m=3: [Co(SCN)3]^(-1), m=4: [Co(SCN)4]^(-2). Hmm, that makes sense.

But the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, I'm guessing βn is the stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So each βn is the formation constant K for the nth complex.

Wait, the formation constant K for a complex is defined as [ML^n]/([M][L]^n). So for [Co(SCN)]²+, which would be n=1, β1=9. For [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β2=40, and so on.

But wait, the total concentration of all Co species is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M, but the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. So, we need to calculate the fraction of each complex, then find the percentage for the blue one, which I'm assuming is the dithiocyanato, which would be the n=2 complex, [Co(SCN)₂]^0.

Wait, but the problem says "dithiocyanato" which implies two SCN- ligands, so that's the n=2 complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^0. So, the question is, what's the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^0 in the solution?

So, to find the fraction of each complex, we can use the stability constants and the formula:

The fraction of each species is [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co_total] = (β_n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1[SCN] + β2[SCN]^2 + β3[SCN]^3 + β4[SCN]^4 )

Because the free Co²+ and all complexes are considered, and their contributions are weighted by their respective terms.

Wait, but wait, the general approach is that the fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is given by (β_n [L]^n) / (sum from k=0 to 4 of β_k [L]^k ), where [L] is the free ligand concentration, here SCN- is 0.1 M.

Wait, but wait, the free Co²+ is when n=0, and the term is β_0 = 1, because
