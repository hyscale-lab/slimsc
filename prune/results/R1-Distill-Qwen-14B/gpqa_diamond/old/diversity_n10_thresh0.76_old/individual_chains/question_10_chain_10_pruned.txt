Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. The options are a to d, each describing different conditions.

Let me remember what I know about planetary density. Density is mass divided by volume, right? So, if two planets have the same mass, the one with a smaller volume has a higher density. But how does mass and radius (or volume) relate here?

Wait, each option gives different parameters. Let's break them down one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, Earth's density is known—about 5.5 g/cm³. So this one has standard Earth density.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but density is given, so that's already 5.5. So this planet has double the mass of Earth but same density. Since density is mass/volume, if mass doubles but density stays same, volume must have doubled. Because 2M / V = 5.5, so V must be (2M)/(5.5). Wait, but Earth's volume is (M)/(5.5). So if mass doubles, volume doubles. So radius would be larger. Because volume scales with radius cubed. So if the volume doubles, radius would be cube root of 2, which is about 1.26 times Earth's radius.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. So same density as Earth (5.5). Because composition affects density—if same composition, same density. So mass is 5M, so volume would be 5M / 5.5, which is same as Earth's volume scaled by 5. So the radius would be cube root of 5, which is about 1.7 times Earth's radius.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. So same density again. So mass is 0.5M, so volume is (0.5M)/5.5. Volume is 0.5 times Earth's volume. So radius would be cube root of 0.5, which is about 0.79 Earth radii.

Wait, but the question is about which has the highest density. So if all the options a, c, d have the same density as Earth, which is 5.5, but option b also has 5.5?
