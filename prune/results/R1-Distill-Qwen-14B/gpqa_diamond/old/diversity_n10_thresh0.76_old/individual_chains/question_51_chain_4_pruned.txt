Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

So the setup is: a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. The question is asking for the net potential energy of this system. Oh wait, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together or something like that.

Wait, I remember that when you have a charge near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges on the sphere can flow to or from the Earth. Oh right, the sphere's a conductor, so the charges will reside on its surface. But since it's grounded, any potential on the sphere would be zero, right? Because the Earth is at zero potential.

When you have a charge q outside a grounded sphere, the sphere acts as if all its induced charges are concentrated at its center. I think that's due to the method of images. So the sphere's induced charge would be -q, but wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, no, the sphere is neutral to begin with, right? Or is it?

Wait, the problem says it's a grounded conducting sphere. So the sphere is neutral? Or does it have some charge? The problem doesn't specify, so I guess it's neutral, so the induced charge would be -q and +q somewhere? Hmm, no, maybe not. Wait, when you have a charge outside a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to the external charge. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface will have an induced charge equal to the inner charge's magnitude but opposite in sign. Or wait, no, the sphere is neutral, so the total induced charge is zero. So the inner surface has a charge of -q (if the external charge is +q), and the outer surface has +q to balance it, but since it's grounded, wait, maybe not.

Oh wait, if the sphere is grounded, the charges can flow. So the induced charges on the sphere would be such that the net charge on the sphere is zero because it was neutral and the ground has infinite capacity. So when an external charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere's inner surface would have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface
