Okay, so I need to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, I think I might have read that wrong. Stability constants usually increase as the complex gets more stable. Oh wait, maybe the order is different. So β1 is the first ionization, β2 the second, etc.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. So I think the blue ones are the ones with two SCN^- ligands because I remember that Co(SCN)_2^2+ is blue. So we're looking for the fraction that's [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

I remember that the distribution of metal complexes can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations. The general approach involves calculating the formation of each complex step by step.

Let me list the possible complexes. Co^2+ can form several complexes with SCN^-:

- Co^2+ (no SCN)
- Co(SCN)^+ (one SCN)
- Co(SCN)_2^2+ (two SCN)
- Co(SCN)_3^3+ (three SCN)
- Co(SCN)_4^4+ (four SCN)

Wait, wait, but the stability constants given are for each step. So β1 is the formation of the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. Or is it that each β represents the overall formation from the previous step? I'm a bit confused about how the stability constants are defined here.

Stability constants (formation constants) usually represent the equilibrium between the metal and the ligand and the complex. For each step, you have:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+ with β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])

Then the next step:

CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^{2+} with β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-])

Similarly for β3 and β4. So the overall formation of Co(SCN)_n^{2-n} would be the product of the β's up to that step.

Wait, no, because each β is for each successive addition of SCN. So the overall β for the third complex would be β1 * β2 * β3, and for the fourth, β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is the step-wise formation constant. So to get the overall β for each complex, I have to multiply up to that step.

So for each complex, the overall β is the product of β1 to βn, where n is the number of SCN ligands minus one. Because each step adds one SCN.

So the overall formation constant K for each complex is:

K1 = β1 =9 (for [CoSCN]^+)
K2 = β1 * β2 =9 *40=360 (for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+})
K3= β1 * β2 * β3=9*40*63=22680 (for [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+})
K4= β1 * β2 * β3 * β4= 9*40*63*16= 362880 (for [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+})

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, some references might define βn as
