Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of a compound based on the given spectral data. Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means the ring has two substituents attached to it. The ring itself is six-membered and aromatic, so probably a benzene ring. Di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns, but the NMR data might give a clue about that.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a characteristic carbonyl absorption around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So the compound has an ester functional group somewhere.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals in total. Let's categorize them:
1. Two aromatic H signals. Since it's a benzene ring with two substituents, the number of aromatic protons depends on their substitution pattern. If they are meta to each other, there would be two sets of equivalent H's, each giving a single signal. Or if they are para, then maybe more symmetry. Wait, but di-substituted benzene could be in ortho, meta, or para positions. Let me think about how that affects the NMR.

For a para-substituted ring, the substituents are opposite each other. In that case, the ring's Hs would be in two sets: the two Hs adjacent to one substituent would be equivalent, and the other two adjacent to the other substituent would be another set. But wait, no, para substitution would lead to a symmetrical structure. So maybe the Hs are all equivalent in some cases. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for aromatic Hs. So that suggests that the substituents are causing two distinct environments for the Hs. So if the substituents are para, the ring would have two equivalent Hs adjacent to each substituent, but wait, maybe it's para but the substituents are different. No, wait, the substituents are the same? Because the problem says di-substituted, but doesn't specify if they're the same groups. Wait, but the ester group is one substituent, perhaps another is something else
