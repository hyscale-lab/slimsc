Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism happens when a molecule has chiral centers or some kind of stereogenic elements, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's see the question again.

The question lists four moieties, and I need to figure out which ones exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each combining some of the four compounds.

Let's go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
Wait, that's a mouthful. So it's a biphenyl structure, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' for the dicarboxylate groups and 6,6' for the dinitro groups. Also, it's a dimethyl ester, so each of those carboxylate groups is esterified with a methyl group.

Biphenyl compounds can have different types of isomerism. Specifically, when the substituents are in certain positions, they can exhibit either constitutional isomerism or stereoisomerism. Oh wait, but for optical isomerism, it's about the spatial arrangement leading to a chiral center or a planar chirality.

Wait, the substituents are on the benzene rings, but are there any chiral centers here? The ester groups are O-linked, but the biphenyl itself can be a chiral element if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral. But wait, [1,1'-biphenyl] would have the two benzene rings connected via a single bond, which allows for rotation. If the substituents are symmetric, the molecule might not be chiral. But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2' (which are ortho to the connecting bond) and at 6 and 6' (which are para on their respective rings). Wait, but for a biphenyl, if the substituents on each ring are mirrored, the molecule might not be chiral because it could have a plane of symmetry. But wait, maybe in this case, the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl system has a plane of symmetry. Wait, if the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6', that's in a symmetric position. The 2 and 2' are on each ring, with the same positions relative to the connecting bond. So perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the central bond, making it achiral. But wait, if the substituents are in such a way that they are not mirror images, then maybe there's chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers but has a planar chirality. Wait, planar chirality is when a planar group has different substituents on each side, making the whole molecule chiral. For biphenyl, a necessary condition for being chiral is that the two rings have non-superimposable mirror images.

Wait, in biphenyl, if you have two substituents on each ring that are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can become chiral. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, then it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking at compound 1, the substituents are at positions 2 and 2' for the dicarboxylate (so each ring has a COOCH3 group at the ortho position relative to the connecting bond), and at 6 and 6' for the nitro groups (which are para to the connecting bond on each ring). Wait, but 6 is the position that's opposite to the connecting bond in each ring. So each ring has, at position 2, a COOCH3, and at position 6, a nitro group.

So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. But wait, for each ring, substituents at 2 and 6 would be on adjacent carbons? No, wait, in a benzene ring, the positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6. So if the connecting bond is at 1, then position 2 is adjacent, position 6 is the next adjacent on the other side. So each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a nitro at 6. That would make each ring have two substituents in the ortho and para positions relative to the connecting atom?

Wait, perhaps. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize. If the central connecting bond is between C1 of each benzene ring, then for each ring, substituents are at C2 (ortho) and C6 (which is also ortho but on the opposite side). So each ring has substituents at positions ortho to the central bond, and also another substituent para to that. Wait, no. Because the central bond is between C1 of each ring. Then, substituents on ring A at C2 and C6 (which is adjacent to C1 and C5, perhaps). Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are symmetrically placed on each ring, then the molecule would be achiral. But if they aren't, it could be chiral. For example, if the substituents on the left ring are arranged differently than on the right ring, then it's
