Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Feynman diagrams and loop counts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that a colleague has a new quantum field theory and is looking at higher-order loop diagrams. There's a scribbled note with some terms, and I need to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on that. The note has: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

Wait, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the expansion in terms of perturbation theory. Each loop adds a certain factor to the amplitude calculation.

So, how do these factors relate to the number of loops? I remember that each loop introduces a factor of the coupling constant, but more importantly, each loop brings in a factor of (1/(4π))^{d/2} or something like that. Wait, no, perhaps more specifically, each loop contributes a factor of (1/(4π)^{n}), where n is the number of loops? Or maybe each loop brings in an (i/(4π))^{d/2} where d is the spacetime dimension. But the space-time here is four-dimensional, so d=4. Oh wait, maybe the denominator is (4π)^L, where L is the number of loops.

Looking at the given expression: 1/(4pi)^6. So that's (4π)^-6. If each loop contributes a factor of (4π)^-something, then perhaps the exponent corresponds to the number of loops multiplied by a certain factor.

Wait, another thought: the typical loop integral in a Feynman diagram often involves integrating over four-momentum, and when you regularize it (like dimensional regularization), you get factors involving (4π)^{epsilon/2}, where epsilon is (4-d), but I'm not sure that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps each loop brings a factor of (1/(4π))^{something}. Let's think about the structure of Feynman diagrams and their contributions. For example, a one-loop diagram would have a factor of (1/(4π))^{(d/2-2)}}, but I'm not certain. Maybe
