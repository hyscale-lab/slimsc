Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about measuring observables P and Q on a quantum state. I've studied a bit about this, but I need to think carefully.

So, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that's the state vector, right? But wait, quantum states are typically represented as unit vectors. Let me check: the length of this vector is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) which is sqrt(1 +4 +1)=sqrt(6). So it's not normalized yet. Oh, right, because the state should be a unit vector. So I should probably normalize it first before proceeding.

What's the matrix for operator P? Let me write it down. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm. And operator Q has a matrix where the first row is (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first and then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no, the measurements are P first, then Q? Or the other way around? Wait, the question says, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the order is P first, then Q.

But wait, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So measuring P first will collapse the system into an eigenstate of P. Then, Q is measured on that new state.

Wait, but I need to find the probability that P is measured as 0 and Q is measured as -1. Hmm, but I think I might have misunderstood. Wait, perhaps the measurements are done in sequence, but the outcome is that the first measurement is of P (resulting in 0), and then measuring Q (resulting in -1). So the combined probability is the probability to get 0 in P, then given that, get -1 in Q.

Alternatively, perhaps P and Q are measured together, but the question says they are measured in sequence. So I think it's a conditional probability: P is measured first, then Q. So the overall probability is the product of the probability of P=0 and then Q=-1 given that P=0.

Wait, but maybe they are independent? No, because the state collapses after each measurement. So the first measurement affects the second.

So, first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q, because when P is measured, the state collapses to an eigenvector of P, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of that eigenvector in the state.

Wait, but perhaps I should find the eigenvalues of P and see which one gives 0. Let's think about operator P.

Operator P's matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, maybe it's easier to write this matrix. Let me see if I can find its eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that P is a Hermitian matrix (since it's an observable), so its eigenvalues are real.

Wait, looking at the structure, maybe it's a Pauli-like matrix but in 3x3 dimensions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tensor product or something else. Alternatively, maybe I can guess the eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the matrix for P has a certain structure. Let's see:

The matrix P looks like it has non-zero elements in certain positions. Let me write it out:

0       1/√2     0
1/√2    0       1/√2
0       1/√2     0

Hmm, maybe I can compute its trace. The trace is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix can be diagonalized. Let me think of the possible eigenvalues. Maybe 1, -1, and 0? Because when I look at the structure, some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the determinant can help. The determinant of P is the product of eigenvalues. Hmm, but calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess that one of the eigenvalues is zero. Let me check if the matrix is singular, which would imply zero is an eigenvalue.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, a, 0 where a=1/sqrt(2)
Row 2: a, 0, a
Row 3: 0, a, 0

So the determinant is 0*(0*0 - a*a) - a*(a*0 - a*0) + 0*(a*a - 0*0). Wait, that's 0 - a*(0) + 0 = 0. So determinant is zero. So zero is an eigenvalue. So P has eigenvalues 1, -1, 0?

Wait, because P is a 3x3 matrix, so three eigenvalues. Since the trace is zero and determinant is zero, perhaps the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0.

Wait, let me think about the eigenvectors. Suppose the eigenvalue is 1. Let me set up (P - I) v = 0.

So:

(-1)  a      0
a     -I     a
0      a    -I

Wait, perhaps it's easier to try to find eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P has a structure that can be represented as a tensor product or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that P is a spin-1 operator in the x or y direction. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that P is a 3x3 matrix with off-diagonal elements, and it's symmetric, so it's diagonalizable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvectors by assuming some symmetry. Let's consider a vector (x, y, x), due to the symmetry of the matrix. Let me see if this works.

Let me suppose that the eigenvector is (x, y, x). Let's apply P to this vector.

P * [x; y; x] = ?

First component: 0*x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0*x = y / sqrt(2)
Second component: (1/sqrt(2)) x + 0*y + (1/sqrt(2)) x = (2x) / sqrt(2) = x * sqrt(2)
Third component: 0*x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0*x = y / sqrt(2)

So the result is [y/sqrt(2), x*sqrt(2), y/sqrt(2)].

If this is an eigenvector, then the result should be λ times [x; y; x].

So:

y/sqrt(2) = λ x
x*sqrt(2) = λ y
y/sqrt(2) = λ x

From the first and third equations, we have y/sqrt(2) = λ x and same for third, which is consistent. From the second equation: x*sqrt(2) = λ y. Let me substitute λ from the first equation: λ = y/(sqrt(2) x).

Substituting into the second equation: x sqrt(2) = (y/(sqrt(2) x)) * y
Multiply both sides by sqrt(2) x:
x^2 * 2 = y^2
So 2 x^2 = y^2
Which implies y = ± sqrt(2) x

Let me take y = sqrt(2) x. Then λ = (sqrt(2) x) / (sqrt(2) x) )= 1.

So the eigenvalue λ = 1, and the eigenvector is proportional to (x, sqrt(2) x, x). So any scalar multiple. Let's take x=1/sqrt(3) to normalize the vector. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(3), sqrt(2)/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3)).

Wait, let's compute the norm: (1/sqrt(3))^2 + (sqrt(2)/sqrt(3))^2 + (1/sqrt(3))^2 = (1 + 2 +1)/3 = 4/3. Oh wait, that's not 1. So I must have made a mistake. Hmm. Let me recalculate.

Wait, sqrt(2) squared is 2. So (1/sqrt(3))² is 1/3, (sqrt(2)/sqrt(3))² is 2/3, and another 1/3. Sum is (1 + 2 +1)/3 = 4/3. So the vector's length is sqrt(4/3) = 2/sqrt(3). So to normalize, I should divide by 2/sqrt(3). So each component is multiplied by sqrt(3)/2.

So the normalized eigenvector for λ=1 is (sqrt(3)/2 * 1/sqrt(3)), sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(3), sqrt(3)/2 * 1/sqrt(3) )

Simplify each component:

First component: (sqrt(3)/2) * (1/sqrt(3)) ) = 1/2.

Second: (sqrt(3)/2) * (sqrt(2)/sqrt(3)) ) = sqrt(2)/2.

Third: 1/2.

So the eigenvector is (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2).

Wait, but let's check if this works. Let's compute P multiplied by this vector.

P * [1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2 ]^T.

First element: 0*(1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (sqrt(2)/2) + 0*(1/2) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (sqrt(2)/2) ) = (1 * 1/2) )= 1/2. So first component is 1/2.

Second element: (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/2) + 0 * (sqrt(2)/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/2) = (1/(2 sqrt(2)) ) + 0 + (1/(2 sqrt(2)) ) = (2/(2 sqrt(2)) ))= 1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2.

Third element: 0*(1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (sqrt(2)/2) + 0*(1/2) )= same as first element: 1/2.

So the result is [1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2], which is the same as the original vector. So yes, this is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

Similarly, perhaps another eigenvalue is -1. Let me try.

Suppose the eigenvector is (x, y, x). Let's apply P and see.

We have:

y/sqrt(2) = λ x
x sqrt(2) = λ y
y/sqrt(2) = λ x

Same as before. So if I assume λ = -1, then from first equation, y = -sqrt(2) x.

Substituting into second equation: x sqrt(2) = (-1) y = (-1)(-sqrt(2) x) )= sqrt(2) x. So equation holds.

So the eigenvector would be (x, -sqrt(2) x, x). Let's normalize it.

The vector is (1, -sqrt(2), 1) multiplied by x. Let's compute the norm squared: 1^2 + (sqrt(2))^2 +1^2 = 1 + 2 +1 =4. So norm is 2. So x should be 1/2 to make the vector unit length.

So the normalized eigenvector for λ=-1 is (1/2, -sqrt(2)/2, 1/2).

Wait, let's check that. [1/2, -sqrt(2)/2, 1/2].

Compute P multiplied by this vector.

First component: 0*(1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (-sqrt(2)/2) + 0*(1/2) )= ( -1/2 ), which is λ * (1/2) → (-1)(1/2) = -1/2. Correct.

Second component: (1/sqrt(2))(1/2) + 0 + (1/sqrt(2))(1/2) )= (1/(2 sqrt(2)) ) + (1/(2 sqrt(2)) ) = 1/sqrt(2) )= sqrt(2)/2. But the second component of the vector is -sqrt(2)/2. So λ * ( -sqrt(2)/2 ) = (-1)(-sqrt(2)/2 )= sqrt(2)/2. Which matches. So correct.

Third component: same as first, (1/sqrt(2)) * (-sqrt(2)/2) )= -1/2, which is λ*(1/2) → (-1)(1/2)= -1/2. Correct.

So yes, this is an eigenvector for eigenvalue -1.

Now, the third eigenvalue must be zero because the trace is zero. So the third eigenvector is orthogonal to the first two.

What's the third eigenvector? Let me think. Let's assume it's of the form (a, b, c). Since the sum of eigenvalues is zero, and we have 1 and -1, the third eigenvalue is 0.

So the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 must satisfy P |v> = 0.

So, let's set up the equations:

0*a + (1/sqrt(2)) * b +0*c =0 → (1/sqrt(2)) b =0 → b=0.

Second equation: (1/sqrt(2)) a + 0*b + (1/sqrt(2)) c =0 → a + c =0.

Third equation: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0*c =0 → same as first equation, so b=0.

So, b=0, and a= -c.

So the vector is (a, 0, -a). Let's choose a=1, so the vector is (1,0,-1). Let's normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the three eigenvectors of P are:

- For λ=1: (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2)
- For λ=-1: (1/2, -sqrt(2)/2, 1/2)
- For λ=0: (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the third eigenvector. So it's (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)), which is correct.

Now, the initial state is given as (-1,2,1). But it's not normalized. Its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

So, when measuring P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P: 1, -1, 0. The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 in the state.

Wait, the eigenvector for λ=0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So let me compute the inner product between the state and this eigenvector.

The inner product is:

(-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) )

Which is [ (-1)/(sqrt(6) sqrt(2)) ) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(6) sqrt(2)) ) ] = [ -2/(sqrt(12)) ) ] = [ -2/(2 sqrt(3)) ) ] = -1/sqrt(3).

The amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), so the probability is [ (-1/sqrt(3))^2 ] = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, which is (1/sqrt(2),0,-1/sqrt(2)).

Now, we measure Q. The operator Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The state after P=0 is |v> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So, the matrix for Q is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1. So the eigenstates are |1> = (1,0,0), |0> = (0,1,0), and |-1> = (0,0,1).

So, to find the probability of measuring Q=-1, we take the inner product between |v> and |-1> squared.

The inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*0 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = -1/sqrt(2).

The square of the absolute value is (1/2).

Wait, but wait, the eigenstate for Q=-1 is (0,0,1), right? So the inner product is the third component of |v>, which is -1/sqrt(2). The absolute value squared is 1/2.

So the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

But wait, the initial state after P=0 is |v>=(1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)). So when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. The probabilities are:

For Q=1: |<1|v>|^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

For Q=0: |<0|v>|^2 = 0.

For Q=-1: |<-1|v>|^2 = ( -1/sqrt(2) )^2 = 1/2.

Wait, that can't be right, because probabilities should sum to 1. Oh wait, no, because the state after P=0 is in the eigenstate of P, which is not an eigenstate of Q. So when measuring Q, the state is projected onto the eigenstates of Q. So the probabilities are as above.

So the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

Wait, but the options are only 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/6.

So the combined probability is (probability P=0) multiplied by (probability Q=-1 given P=0).

So that's (1/3) * (1/2) ) = 1/6.

But wait, the options have D) 1/6.

But wait, let me double-check. Because I think I made a mistake in the state after measurement.

Wait, after measuring P=0, the state is the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0. That vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, when measuring Q, which has eigenstates |1>, |0>, |-1>. The state |v> is written as:

|v> = (1/sqrt(2)) |1> + 0 |0> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |-1>.

So the coefficient for |-1> is -1/sqrt(2), so the probability is ( -1/sqrt(2) )^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the overall probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the eigenvectors or the projection.

Wait, another approach: since the initial state is normalized to 1/sqrt(6) times (-1,2,1), and after measuring P=0, the state is the eigenvector for P=0, which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The probability for P=0 was 1/3, as calculated earlier.

Upon measuring P=0, the state collapses. Then, measuring Q, the probability of -1 is the square of the coefficient of |-1> in the Q basis.

In |v>, which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)), the third component is -1/sqrt(2). So the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So overall, 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6, which is D.

So the correct answer should be D) 1/6.


To solve the problem, we analyze the quantum system described by the given state vector and operators. The state vector is initially given as \( (-1, 2, 1) \), which is not normalized. Its norm is calculated as:

\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4 + 1} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined to be \( 1, -1, 0 \) based on symmetry and the trace of the matrix (which is zero). The corresponding eigenvectors are:

- For \( \lambda = 1 \): \( \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \),
- For \( \lambda = -1 \): \( \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -\sqrt{2} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \),
- For \( \lambda = 0 \): \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

### Step 2: Probability of Measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) in the initial state. The eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The inner product between the initial state and this eigenvector is:

\[
\left\langle \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \bigg| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (-1)(1) + 2(0) + 1(-1) \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude:

\[
\left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

### Step 3: State After Measuring \( P = 0 \)
After measuring \( P = 0 \), the system collapses into the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \), which is:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of Measuring \( Q = -1 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal with eigenvalues \( 1, 0, -1 \), and its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors:

\[
|1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad |0\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad |-1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( |-1\rangle \) in the state after \( P = 0 \). The third component of the state \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \) is \( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). The probability is:

\[
\left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Combined Probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
\text{Probability} = \text{Probability of } P = 0 \times \text{Probability of } Q = -1 \, \text{given } P = 0 = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
