Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, let's see. The question says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And they're saying the system is isolated, so I don't have to worry about external fields or anything like that.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the setup is like, the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are arranged in a sphere around it, each 2 meters away from P. Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. I remember that the potential energy in a system of charges is related to their arrangement. For minimum energy, I think the charges would arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the potential energy. But wait, for point charges, the potential energy depends on their positions. 

Wait, all the twelve charges are identical, so each has the same charge. So each of the twelve is 2e, and the 13th is also 2e. So all 13 are positive, right? Because 2e is positive since e is positive. So like charges repel each other. So if I have twelve charges arranged around the central one, each at 2 meters, what's the potential energy of each pair
