Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Hmm, let me think through it. The question is about a peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. They have similar shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. So, the integration suggests that it's the same proton in different environments, but why two peaks?

Wait, the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling. So it's not like one proton is coupling with another, like a neighboring H. Then what else could cause two peaks for the same proton? Maybe something to do with the structure itself.

Looking at the options, option B is enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in NMR, they would look the same because the environment is mirrored. But wait, in that case, wouldn't the NMR show only one peak because the two enantiomers are identical in solution? Or do they cause splitting? No, I think for NMR, if you have a racemic mixture, the same proton would appear as a single peak because the environments are identical in each enantiomer. Or maybe not, because each enantiomer has the same structureâ€”so their alpha protons would have the same shift. So maybe that's not it.

Option D is diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. But in the NMR, the shifts are similar and integrals add to 1H. So if there are two diastereomers, each would contribute a peak, but their shifts would be different enough to be separate. But the question says the shifts are similar. Hmm, maybe that's possible but not the most likely.

Option C is 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. Wait, I'm not too familiar with that term. Maybe it refers to when two different diastereomers are formed because of the way the amide bond forms. Like, during the reaction, the amide could form in two different configurations, leading to different diastereomers. But in that case, would the NMR show two peaks for the same proton in each diastereomer?

Option A is contamination with a precursor. If there's a precursor, its NMR would show different peaks, possibly with a different integration. But the integration here adds up to 1H, which suggests it's the same proton but split. Plus, the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. Wait, if the precursor is present, the mass would be different, right? Because the precursor would have a higher mass. But the question says the LC-MS peaks have the same mass as the expected product. So that probably rules out option A.

Let me go back. The LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with same mass. So it's not a different compound like a diastereomer or enantiomer because the mass would be the same, which fits with the product. Wait, but enantiomers have the same mass. So in the LC-MS, if the compound is a racemic mixture, would the LC detect them as two separate peaks? No, because enantiomers are not separated by normal LC columns. They would appear as a single peak because the
