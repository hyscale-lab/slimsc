Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see. The question involves several reactions and spectroscopy data, so I'll need to go through each step carefully.

First, let me read the problem again. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's heated with excess KOH, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data for product 1 are provided. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Alright, let's start with the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I know that when adamantane derivatives react with KOH, elimination can occur because KOH is a strong base. So, with two bromine atoms, maybe an elimination reaction happens. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, I think it will lose two equivalents of HBr, leading to a diene. Wait, but what kind of diene?

Wait, more accurately, each Br is on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. So when KOH is added, probably dehydrohalogenation occurs. For each Br, the adjacent H is abstracted, leading to the formation of double bonds. Since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two double bonds form, making a conjugated diene.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. If KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen from each, then each elimination will form a double bond. So, for each Br, elimination would produce a double bond between C1 and C2 and another between C3 and C4. But in the adamantane structure, the positions are such that adjacent carbons are part of rings, so maybe the double bonds are conjugated in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diene. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a single double bond, but I think with
