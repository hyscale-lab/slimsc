Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me jot down my thoughts as I go.

The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The data given includes mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR. And then I have to choose between four options: A, B, C, D.

First, let's look at the mass spec. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%, and there's another peak at 158 (32%). Hmm, I remember that molecular ion peaks can sometimes indicate the molecular formula. So the molecular weight is around 156. Also, the peak at 158 is close, maybe it's the M+2 peak, which often comes from chlorine because Cl has an atomic weight of about 35.5. So the M+2 would be 156 +2 = 158. That suggests the molecule has a Cl atom.

So looking at the options, all of them except option C have Cl in their names. Option C is phenyl chloroformate. Wait, phenyl chloroformate would be something like OCl-CO-O-phenyl? Or maybe Cl-CO-O-phenyl? I'm not entirely sure, but I think chloroformate would have a Cl attached to a carbonyl group.

Next, the IR data shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. But wait, the peak is broad, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid because their O-H stretches are very broad. Alternatively, an aldehyde's O-H would be a sharp peak, but wait, aldehydes don't have O-H. Oh wait, wait. Let me clarify: a broad peak in IR around 3500-2700 cm^-1 is more likely from an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids usually have C=O around 1700 cm^-1, but it can vary. Alternatively, esters or acids might show a peak around there. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, which fits the IR.

Now, the 1H NMR data: There's a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is a strong indication of an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Because in D2O, the OH would exchange, but in NMR, a singlet around 11 ppm is typical for a carboxylic acid's -OH. Also, the other peaks: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest coupling between two sets of aromatic protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and each couple with two neighboring protons, but in the NMR, they might appear as doublets. Wait, no, for para substitution, each H would have two neighboring Hs in the ortho positions, but if it's a di-substituted ring, maybe each H is a doublet. Alternatively, if the substituents are in the para positions, then the two Hs on each side would be equivalent.

Wait, let me think. For a para-substituted benzene ring, like para-substituted with two groups, but wait in the NMR, the two doublets each have 2H. So maybe the molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents. For example, in phthalic acid, which is 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, but that would have more protons. Alternatively, if the substituents are at the para positions, like in benzoic acid where the COOH is para to another group. Or maybe a substitution in such a way that the remaining aromatic protons are two sets of doublets.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Structure would be Cl in position 3, OH in position 2, and aldehyde in position 1 (assuming the numbering starts from the aldehyde). So the aldehyde is at position 1, OH at 2, Cl at 3. So the aromatic ring would have substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, which would make the remaining Hs at positions 4,5,6. Wait, but that might complicate the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has substituents in such a way that two doublets are present.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: Structure is COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4. So the aromatic ring would have two substituents, para to each other. The Hs on the ring would be at positions 2,3,5,6. But wait, in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, Cl is at position 4, so the ring would have substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The remaining Hs would be at 2,3,5,6. But in that case, the ring would have some symmetry. The protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So the NMR would show two doublets: one for the protons ortho to COOH and Cl, and another for the para positions? Wait, maybe the ring protons would be split into two sets. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4. So the Hs at position 2 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH, and their chemical shifts would be downfield. The Hs at 3 and 5 would be next to Cl. So in NMR, perhaps we'd see two doublets: one around 8.0 ppm and another around 7.7, each integrating to 2H. That matches the data given: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That seems to fit.

Option C) Phenyl chloroformate: Structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the chloroformate group is O-CO-OCl? Or perhaps Cl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, chloroformate is O=C(OCl)-Ph? No, wait, chloroformate is an acyl chloride. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So in this structure, the aromatic ring is attached to an ester group where the other ester oxygen is attached to Cl. So the structure would have a benzene ring connected to an ester group, O-CO-O-Cl. Or maybe O-CO-Cl with an O-Ph group? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, phenyl chloroformate might be Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the structure would have a benzene ring connected via an ester to a Cl and a carbonyl. In that case, the IR would have a strong C=O peak (like around 1720 cm^-1, which matches the data). But would there be an -OH in the molecule? Probably not. So in the IR, the broad peak around 3500-2700 cm^-1 would be from an -OH, but if the molecule is an ester or acyl chloride, that might not have an -OH. Wait, but phenyl chloroformate is an acyl chloride. Wait, no, chloroformate is O=C(OCl)OR, but in the case of phenyl chloroformate, perhaps it's Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the IR would show a C=O (which it does), but if there's no -OH, why is there a broad peak in IR? Maybe it's not an -OH. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes have sharp peaks around 2800-2700 cm^-1. Wait, the broad peak is from 3500-2700. That's a wide range, which could include both O-H and C-H stretches. Alternatively, maybe it's an aliphatic C-O-C stretch? I'm a bit confused here.

Option D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Structure is COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 2. So the substituents are adjacent. In the NMR, the aromatic protons would be more deshielded. Let me think, for benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1. So 2-chlorobenzoic acid would have Cl at position 2. The aromatic protons would be in positions 3,4,5,6. The Hs at 3 and 5 would be meta to Cl and adjacent to COOH, perhaps. I'm not sure how the NMR would split, but the substituents are meta and para.

Looking back at the NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). That's a singlet, which fits with a carboxylic acid's -OH proton. Also, the two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the molecule is a para-substituted benzoic acid with Cl at the para position. That would be option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let me think about the NMR for benzoic acid derivatives.

In benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1. The ring protons are at 2,3,4,5,6. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the Cl is at position 4. So the ring substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The Hs at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and their chemical shifts would be around 8.0 ppm. The Hs at 3 and 5 would be meta to Cl and para to COOH, so maybe around 7.7 ppm. Each would have two neighboring Hs, so each would split into a doublet. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the data given: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So that fits.

What about the molecular weight? If the molecular ion is at 156, let's calculate the molecular weight of each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Its formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's compute: C=12*7=84, H=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Total: 84+5=89; 89 +35.5=124.5; 124.5 +32=156.5. So molecular weight is about 156.5. The molecular ion is at 156, which makes sense. The M+2 peak at 158 would be due to the Cl isotope (Cl has about 35% abundance for the 35Cl isotope and about 65% for 37Cl). Wait, but wait: M is 156, so M+2 is 158. The Cl contributes to M+2 because it's a doublet of peaks. So the molecular ion would be the 35Cl contributing to 156, and 37Cl would make it 158. So the 37Cl peak would be at 158, which is about 32% relative to 100% for 35Cl. That fits with the data given (32% at 158). So that makes sense.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the formula would be C8H7ClO2. Let me compute: C:8*12=96; H:7; Cl:35.5; O:32. Total: 96+7=103; +35.5=138.5; +32=170.5. So molecular weight would be around 170.5. But the molecular ion is at 156, so this doesn't fit. So option C is not the answer.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option B but Cl is at position 2. Molecular weight would be same as B: 156.5. So the same as B. But the NMR would differ. Let's think: in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The aromatic Hs would be at positions 3,4,5,6. The Hs at positions 3 and 6 would be adjacent to Cl and COOH. How would their shifts look? Let me think about typical shifts in such structures. In o-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are adjacent, so the ring would have less symmetry than para. The NMR would likely show more splitting, maybe more than two peaks. Alternatively, perhaps the Hs would be in different positions. For example, the Hs adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 6) might be more downfield than the Hs at positions 4 and 5. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact shifts. However, the given NMR data shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a symmetrical situation, which would be more likely in a para-substituted compound.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would have OH at position 2, Cl at 3, and aldehyde at position 1. So the ring substituents are at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). So the aromatic Hs would be at positions 4,5,6. Wait, but that leaves three Hs, which might not fit the NMR data. Alternatively, perhaps only two Hs are present in a certain pattern. Also, the NMR would have a triplet or something else. Additionally, the aldehyde proton (CHO) would show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But in the given NMR data, we have a peak at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), which is more like a carboxylic acid's -OH than an aldehyde proton. So option A seems less likely.

Wait, but wait. The given NMR has a singlet at 11.0 ppm. If the molecule was a benzaldehyde with an -OH group, then the -OH would be more acidic, but the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm. So if the 11 ppm is an -OH, then the molecule is more likely a carboxylic acid. So that would support option B or D.

Putting it all together:

Mass spec: molecular ion 156, M+2 158 (Cl present). IR: broad peak (OH), strong C=O (carboxylic acid or ester). NMR: -OH at 11 ppm (singlet), two doublets for aromatic Hs, each 2H.

So based on this, option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) fits. It has Cl at para to COOH, giving the two doublets in NMR. The IR has a broad OH and a strong C=O. Mass matches. Option D, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, would have different NMR shifts, and the pattern wouldn't be two doublets but maybe more split peaks because of the ortho substitution.

Wait, another thing: the molecular ion for B is 156.5, which is about 156. The mass spec has a peak at 156 (100%). The M+2 is at 158 (32%), which aligns with the presence of Cl (35Cl and 37Cl would contribute to M and M+2, respectively. The relative abundance is about 35% for 35Cl, and 65% for 37Cl. So the M peak is 100% (for 35Cl), and M+2 would be about 65% of the 37Cl? Wait, but the data says 32%. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula includes more Cl? No, option B has one Cl.

Wait, molecular weight for B is 156.5. The 35Cl would contribute to 156 and 37Cl to 158. The abundance of 35Cl is about 75% (actually, chlorine has two main isotopes: Cl-35 at ~75% and Cl-37 at ~25%). So the M peak would be 35Cl at 156 (75%), and M+2 (37Cl) at 158 (25%), but wait the data says 32% at 158. Hmm, that's close. So the peak at 158 is 37Cl, which is about 25% of Cl's natural abundance. So the data says 32%, which is close enough considering maybe I'm miscalculating the exact percentages.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the molecular ion (M) is 156, but for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the exact mass would be 156.5. The mass spec detects the molecular ion as 156, which is the nominal mass. So that's acceptable.

So, putting everything together, the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, option B.


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** (100%) and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) suggest a molecular weight of approximately 156 and the presence of chlorine (Cl), as the M+2 peak is consistent with the isotope 37Cl. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak between **3500-2700 cm⁻¹**, indicative of an -OH group, and a strong sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹**, characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group, likely from a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR data includes a singlet at **11.0 ppm (1H)**, which corresponds to the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid, and two doublets at **8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)**, consistent with aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This structure includes an aldehyde group, which would show a peak around 9-10 ppm in the 1H NMR for the aldehyde proton. However, the given NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid -OH proton. Additionally, the aromatic proton pattern does not match the data, as this structure would result in a different splitting pattern.  
   **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This structure has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom para to it on the benzene ring. The IR spectrum matches, as the broad peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the -OH group, and the strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O group. The 1H NMR data fits well: the singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the -OH proton, and the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons ortho and meta to the carboxylic acid group, respectively. The molecular weight of 156.5 aligns with the molecular ion peak at m/z = 156, and the M+2 peak at m/z = 158 is consistent with the presence of chlorine.  
   **Matches all data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   This structure contains a chloroformate group (Cl-CO-O-Ph) and lacks an -OH group. However, the IR spectrum shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹, which indicates the presence of an -OH group, ruling out this option. Additionally, the molecular weight of phenyl chloroformate (C8H7ClO2) is approximately 170.5, which does not match the molecular ion peak at m/z = 156.  
   **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This structure has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom ortho to it on the benzene ring. While the molecular weight matches, the 1H NMR data does not fit. In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic proton pattern would be more complex due to the ortho substitution, resulting in more than two distinct signals. The given NMR data shows only two doublets, which is more consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.  
   **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular ion peak, IR absorption, and 1H NMR signals, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. This structure matches the molecular weight, the presence of a carboxylic acid group, and the aromatic proton pattern in the NMR.

**Answer: B**
