Okay, so I need to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar. The question is about gene mutations in the first exon. 

The intact gene has a specific sequence, and each mutant shows some changes in the beginning of the sequence in the first exon. I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so any mutation here could affect the protein structure. The goal is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, thereby stopping the production of the anti-nutritional compound.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The sequence changes from ...CTCGCTGGTAC... to ...CTACGCTGGTAC... So, in the intact gene, it's CTCGCTGGTACT. Mutant 1 has CTCGCT replaced with CTAC? Wait, let me see. Wait, the first part is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... So in the initial gene, the segment is CTCGCTGGTACT. Looking at Mutant 1, it's CTACGCTGGTACT. So the sixth and seventh nucleotides are changed. So the original is CTCGCTGGTA; in Mutant 1, it's CTACGCTGGTA. So that's a change from CTCG to CTAC at the beginning. Hmm, but wait, that's a point mutation? Or maybe multiple changes.

Wait, another way: Let me compare the sequences.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So looking at the start: Intact is ATG TTT CT CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT... 

Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TTC TGT...

So the first part is ATG followed by TTT in the intact, but in Mutant 1, it's TCT. Wait, no: Let me split it correctly.

Intact gene starts as ATGTTTCT
