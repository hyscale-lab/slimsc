Okay, so I've got this question about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question has three parts, each with a different starting material and conditions. I need to figure out the products A, B, and C, and then match them with the options given.

First, the question says that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the terminal pi bond migrating into the sigma bond. Examples given are Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I remember are both [3,3] sigmatropic shifts. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored, which I think means they proceed via a cyclic transition state.

Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

1. **Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ + Heat â†’ A**

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the structure of the starting materials. Let me draw them out.

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine: So, the structure would be CH3-O-CH2-NH2? Wait, no, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. But with two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So the structure is CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Wait, no. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CHNH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is NH2CH2CH3. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two OMe groups on the first carbon. So the structure is NH2-C(OCH3)2, but that's not possible because an amine can't have two methoxy groups on the same carbon. Wait, maybe it's (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2? Wait, perhaps it's more like (CH2(OCH3)2-CH2NH2)? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe it's ethan-1-amine where the first carbon (the one attached to NH2) has two methoxy groups. So the structure would be (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2? Hmm, but that might be a bit strained,
