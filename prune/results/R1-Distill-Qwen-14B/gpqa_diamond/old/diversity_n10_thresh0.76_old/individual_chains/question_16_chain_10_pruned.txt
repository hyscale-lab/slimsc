Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a compound has chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let me go through each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-C(Cl)-CH3? Or wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. Wait, no: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-C(=CH2)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-? Wait, no, but wait, perhaps I should draw this.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would replace one H on C1. So it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 2-methyl would be a methyl on C2. So substituting: 1
