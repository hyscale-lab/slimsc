Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions. Each reaction used a different reducing agent on an unknown compound. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, wait—the products are given as one enantiomer each. Let me check again. Oh, wait, no. The first reaction gives (R)-4-ethyl..., and the second gives (S)-4-ethyl... So each reaction uses a different starting material and a different reagent.

The options are for what A and B are. The options are all different combinations of (S) and (R) configurations for 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Hmm. So I think this has to do with the stereochemistry of the reduction process. I remember that when you reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol, the stereochemistry depends on the reagents and the starting material.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are both borohydride reducing agents, but I think LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent. Or wait, no, maybe they're used under different conditions. Oh, wait, BH3 is typically used in the form of a complex, like BH3·THF or something else. But both are used for ketone reductions.

Wait, but when reducing ketones, the borohydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the hydride comes from the boron. The mechanism is a two-step process: the boron attaches to the carbonyl oxygen, then the hydride shifts, leading to the formation of an alkoxide which is protonated.

Wait, but the configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on
