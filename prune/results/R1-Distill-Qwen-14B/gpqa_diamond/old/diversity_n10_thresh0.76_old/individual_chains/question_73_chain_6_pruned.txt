Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them normally like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's see, the question gives the two velocities as 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. I think the formula is something like (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²), but wait, wait—does that apply when both are moving in the same direction? Or is there a different consideration?

Wait, no. The formula I remember is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²). But wait, actually, when you have two objects moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the sum. So for example, if one is moving at u and the other at v in the same direction, from the perspective of the first, the second would be moving at (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait no, I think I might have that mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it as from the perspective of the astronaut moving at 0.6c, what's the speed of the other astronaut?

Wait, the problem is about the relative speed between the two astronauts. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's speed? Or wait, maybe it's from the perspective of the rest frame where both are moving, so the relative speed would be as seen from one of them. Hmm, but maybe I should just apply the velocity addition formula correctly.

Let me get the formula right. The relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction (say, B is moving at v, and A is moving at u, both in the same direction in an inertial frame) would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, wait, no. Because in the rest frame, A is moving at u and B is moving at v. From A's frame, B's velocity v' would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). So in this case, if u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c, then v' would be (0.5c - 0.
