Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let's see, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are different types of propenyl and butenyl acetatesâ€”cis and trans versions. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting patterns and coupling constants give information about the structure.

The NMR data given is:
7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
2.1 ppm (3H, s)
1.6 ppm (3H, d)

So I need to figure out what each of these signals corresponds to.

First, looking at the 2.1 ppm singlet (3H). That's probably an acetyl group (OAc), since the singlet suggests no neighboring hydrogens. So the compound is an acetate ester, which makes sense as the options are all acetates.

Next, the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H, d). A doublet with 3H usually indicates a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 or a CH group. Since it's an acetate, perhaps this is the CH2CH3 group attached to the oxygen? Wait, wait, another thought. Acetate esters have the structure R-O-CO-R', where R' is the acetyl part. So in this case, maybe the R group is a propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, let's think about the other signals. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. A doublet with a large coupling constant like 16 Hz usually suggests a trans coupling between two vinylic protons. So maybe this is part of an alkene.

Then, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets (dq). That's a bit more complex. So the proton is coupling with two different sets of protons. Maybe it's a vinyl proton adjacent to a CH2 group or something else.

Let me think about the structure. The options are propenyl and butenyl acetates. Let's consider propenyl first. Propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, depends on the substitution.

Wait, wait, for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc.
