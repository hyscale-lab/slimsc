Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state chemistry, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm.

First, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance (d-spacing) is calculated using the formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. For a general crystal structure, the formula I recall is something like d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk cos α)/(a²) + ... ) Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, for a cubic crystal, the formula is simpler because all angles are 90 degrees, but this is a rhombohedral structure, so the angles are all 30 degrees.

Wait, in a rhombohedral (or trigonal) crystal system, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all equal. So in this case, a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and each angle is 30 degrees.

The formula for the interplanar distance in a general hexagonal or rhombohedral crystal is a bit more complicated. I think the formula is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) )

Wait, no. Wait,
