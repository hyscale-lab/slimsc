Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I need to find the probability of measuring the observable P and getting 0. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). And the operator P is a 3x3 matrix with specific elements.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is related to the eigenvectors.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. How do I approach this? Oh right, I think the first step is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix P. Because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probability is determined by the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue in the state vector.

So, I need to diagonalize P. Let me write down matrix P.

P is:
Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Hmm, this looks like a symmetric matrix. Since it's symmetric, it should be diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

I think I should set up the characteristic equation: det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me compute the determinant of (P - λI):

| -λ    1/√2    0   |
|1/√2  -λ     1/√2|
| 0     1/√2  -λ   |

Wait, that's a 3x3 determinant. Let me write it out.

The determinant should be:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * something.

Wait, perhaps expanding along the first row.

So,

det = -λ [ ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - (1/√2 * 1/√2) ) ] 
      - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]
      + 0 [ ... ]

So, simplifying each part.

First term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] 

Second term: - (1/√2) [ ( -λ / √2 ) ] → because (1/√2)(-λ) is (-λ/√2), and the other term is zero.

So, the second term becomes - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2 ) = ( λ ) / 2.

Third term is zero.

So putting it all together:

det = -λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 

Expanding: -λ^3 + (λ/2) + λ/2 

Wait, because (-λ)(λ^2 - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (1/2) λ.

So, det = (-λ^3 + (1/2)λ ) + (λ/2 )

So combining like terms: -λ^3 + (1/2 + 1/2) λ → -λ^3 + λ.

So the characteristic equation is: -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ)(1 + λ) )=0.

So the eigenvalues are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

Wait, so the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1. Interesting.

Now, the problem asks for the probability of getting 0. So we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, and then compute the overlap with the given state vector.

Wait, but the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1) as a column vector. Let me denote this as |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ].

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. I should check if this is the case here.

The norm would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so the state is not normalized. But when calculating probabilities, the state must be normalized because probabilities are relative. So perhaps I should normalize it first.

Wait, when calculating probabilities, the state is assumed to be normalized. So let me check: if |ψ> is not normalized, then I should normalize it before proceeding. Because in quantum mechanics, probabilities are given by |<v|ψ>|² where v is the eigenvector, but ψ must be a unit vector.

So, let's compute the norm of |ψ>:

||ψ|| = sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4+1) = sqrt(6).

So the normalized state would be |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Wait, but let's see: when calculating the probability, perhaps it's easier to compute the square of the amplitude, but I need to take into account the normalization.

Alternatively, since the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), perhaps it's already normalized, but that's not the case here. So maybe the initial step is to normalize the state vector.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, find the eigenvectors for P with eigenvalue 0.

The eigenvector equation is (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So, writing out the equations:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0 * v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) )=0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v3 = -v1.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → which again gives v2=0, same as row 1.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 must satisfy v2=0, and v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. We can choose v1 =1 for simplicity; then the eigenvector is [1; 0; -1]^T.

But wait, that's a solution, but I should check if it's correct by plugging back into P.

Let me calculate P * [1;0;-1].

First row: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 +0*(-1)=0.

Second row: (1/√2)*1 +0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1)= (1 -1)/√2 =0.

Third row: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 +0*(-1)=0.

Yes, so [1;0;-1] is indeed an eigenvector for λ=0.

But wait, are there other eigenvectors for λ=0? Let me think. Since P is a 3x3 matrix, and the algebraic multiplicity of λ=0 is one (since the characteristic equation has three roots 0, 1, -1), so the eigenspace is one-dimensional. So any scalar multiple of [1;0;-1] is the eigenvector.

Now, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of this eigenvector in the state |ψ>.

But wait, |ψ> is the given state, which is not normalized. So I should normalize it first.

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Compute the normalization factor: 1/sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = 1/sqrt(6).

So the normalized state is |ψ_n> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Now, the eigenvector for λ=0 is |v> = [1;0;-1]. But wait, we need to normalize this eigenvector as well. Because when calculating the inner product, both vectors should be normalized.

Wait, but for probability, the eigenvectors should be orthonormal. So the eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal, and each eigenvector is normalized to 1.

So let me normalize the eigenvector |v> for λ=0.

|v> is [1;0;-1]. Its norm is sqrt(1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2).

So the normalized eigenvector is |v_n> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1;0;-1].

Now, the probability P is |<v_n | ψ_n>|^2.

So compute the inner product <v_n | ψ_n>.

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [1 0 -1] multiplied by (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ]

So,

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) * [ (1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) ) ]

= (1/ sqrt(12)) [ -1 + 0 -1 ]

= (1/ (2 * sqrt(3))) ) * (-2 )

= (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) → -1/sqrt(3).

The square of the modulus is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Wait, but wait a second. The inner product is -1/sqrt(3), but when we take the modulus squared, the negative sign doesn't matter. So the probability is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3.

So looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

Wait, but wait another thing. The eigenvector I found for λ=0 is [1;0;-1]. The given state is [-1;2;1]. Let me check if they are orthogonal.

The inner product is (1)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)(1) = -1 +0 -1 = -2. So they are not orthogonal. But the probability is still the square of the inner product divided by the normalization.

Wait, but the state is not normalized, so I had to normalize both vectors before calculating.

But I think the approach is correct. So the probability is 1/3.


To calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the value \( 0 \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). Expanding the determinant:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda \left( \lambda^2 - \frac{1}{2} \right) + \frac{\lambda}{2} = -\lambda^3 + \lambda.
\]

Setting \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \), we find the eigenvalues:

\[
\lambda^3 - \lambda = 0 \implies \lambda (\lambda^2 - 1) = 0 \implies \lambda = 0, \pm 1.
\]

Thus, the possible outcomes of the measurement are \( 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector satisfies \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). Solving \( P |v\rangle = 0 \), we find the eigenvector:

\[
|v\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
-1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector is not normalized, so we normalize it:

\[
|v_n\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
-1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: State Vector
The state of the system is given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This state is not normalized. Its norm is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state is:

\[
|\psi_n\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of Measuring \( 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is given by:

\[
P(0) = |\langle v_n | \psi_n \rangle|^2.
\]

Compute the inner product \( \langle v_n | \psi_n \rangle \):

\[
\langle v_n | \psi_n \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left( -1 + 0 - 1 \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The square of the modulus is:

\[
P(0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
