Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step. I need to figure out the major products of two reactions, A and B, and then match them with the options provided.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, using t-BuOK as the base. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so maybe it's involved in some kind of elimination or addition reaction.

Starting with reaction A. The starting material is a cyclohexanone derivative. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me visualize that. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone group at position 1. Then, position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group attached. Position 6 has another methyl group. Wait, wait, no: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl would mean that the 2 position has both an ethyl and a methyl substituent, and the 6 position has a methyl. So the ring has substituents at 2, 6, and the 1 is the ketone.

When I have a ketone and ethyl acrylate (which is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester), I'm thinking this might be a conjugate addition or perhaps a Michael addition. Wait, noâ€”Michael addition is when a nucleophile attacks an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. But in this case, the starting material is a ketone, and ethyl acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Alternatively, it might be a Diels-Alder reaction? Or maybe an aldol addition? Hmm.

But wait, the presence of t-BuOK suggests a strong base. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack scenario. Let me think about the structure. The cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When ethyl acrylate reacts with a ketone, maybe it's a crossed Claisen or some
