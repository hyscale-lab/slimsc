Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and uncertainty. Hmm, I remember from my classes that this has something to do with Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Let me think.

The question says an electron is moving along the x-direction with speed v = 2*10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp). The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, right? So Δp is at least ħ/(2Δx). But since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I can probably ignore the ½ and just use Δp ≈ ħ/Δx.

Momentum p is mass times velocity, but here we have an uncertainty in momentum. So Δp would be the uncertainty in momentum, and that relates to the uncertainty in energy. Oh, because energy is related to momentum via kinetic energy. For non-relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy E = p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be (Δp)²/(2m).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the exact approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the uncertainty in momentum leading to an uncertainty in energy. But I'm not entirely confident about that.

Let me outline the steps I think I should take:

1. Calculate Δp using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.
2. Then find the uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE using the momentum uncertainty.

Wait, but kinetic energy depends on the square of momentum. So maybe ΔE is approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). But I'm not sure if that's the right way to approach it. Alternatively, since the electron is moving at a certain speed, perhaps I can approximate the momentum and then find the uncertainty from Δp.

Wait, but the question is about the uncertainty in energy, which would be the uncertainty in the kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m). So the uncertainty in E would relate to the uncertainty in p.

But how exactly? Let me think about differentials. If E = p²/(2m), then dE = (2p/(2m)) dp = p/(m) dp. So the uncertainty in E (ΔE) would be approximately (
