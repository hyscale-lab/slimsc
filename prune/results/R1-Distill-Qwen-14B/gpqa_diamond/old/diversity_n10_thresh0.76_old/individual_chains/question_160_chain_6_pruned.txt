Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction. Hmm, let's see what it says. The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is coming along the z-axis and hits the aperture. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. Oh, right, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. So I think this is a circular aperture problem.

Wait, but the question specifies that the apothems are all the same. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side in a regular polygon. So for a regular polygon, all apothems are the same, which makes sense. So when N approaches infinity, the shape is a circle with radius equal to the apothem 'a' in the limit. Because in a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a circle, the radius would be the same as the apothem, so I think that's correct.

Wait, no. Wait, in a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is related to the radius 'R' (distance from center to a vertex) by the formula a = R * cos(π/N). So as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a approaches R. So for a circle, the apothem a would be the same as the radius R. So the aperture becomes a circle of radius 'a'.

Now, the problem is about the diffraction pattern. When you have a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern (Fraunhofer diffraction) has a central bright spot surrounded by dark rings. The minima occur at specific angles. But wait, for a circular aperture, the first minima (the first dark ring) occurs at an angle θ given by the formula a sinθ = λ, right? Because the first minimum is when the path difference is λ, due to the circumference of the circle.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. For single-slit diffraction, the minima are at a sinθ = mλ, where m is 1, 2, etc. But wait, no, wait—no, wait
