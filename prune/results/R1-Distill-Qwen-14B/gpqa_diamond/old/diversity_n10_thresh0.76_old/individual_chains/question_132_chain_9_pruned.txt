Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So the problem says that there's a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options given are four different tetramethylbenzenes and another with diethyl groups.

Hmm, okay. First, let me think about the molecular formula. C10H14. If it's an aromatic compound, let's subtract the benzene ring (C6H6) from that. So C10H14 minus C6H6 gives C4H8. Wait, benzene is C6H6, so adding four substituents would contribute C4H8. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that the total is C4H8.

Wait, for each substituent, like methyl groups, each is CH3. So four methyl groups would be C4H12. But the formula of the molecule is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6, so 6+4=10 carbons, and H:6 (benzene) + 12 (from four methyl groups) would be 18 H. But the formula is C10H14, which has 14 H. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Each substituent on the benzene will replace a hydrogen. So the benzene has six H. If we have four substituents, each substituent replaces one H. So the total H would be 6 - 4 + sum of H from substituents.

Wait, but substituents can vary. For example, if each substituent is a CH3, then each contributes 3 H. Four substituents would contribute 4*3=12 H. Subtract the four H from benzene, so 6-4=2, plus 12 gives 14 H. Oh, that matches. So the molecule is a benzene ring with four methyl groups. Because
