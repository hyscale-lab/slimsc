Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

So the setup is that an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The problem says that one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest-masses. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. Interesting.

Wait, wait. So the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. When the nucleus splits, the total rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of M. That means the remaining 1% must account for the energy released, right? So that 1% is converted into kinetic energy and other forms like binding energy or radiation, but the problem says to ignore electrons, so probably just kinetic energy.

Now, the more massive fragment has a kinetic energy T1. The question is asking for the difference between the correct T1 (using relativistic calculations) and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation of T1.

Hmm. So I need to find T1 relativistically and then compare it to the non-relativistic value.

Let's think about the steps involved.

First, let's figure out the masses of the two fragments. The initial nucleus has rest mass M. After fission, the two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2. Given that m1 = 2*m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99*M.

Wait, because the sum is 99% of M, so m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Since m1 is twice m2, then m1 = 2 m2. So substituting, 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99 M â†’ m2 = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M. So m1 is 0.66 M.

Wait, because 0.33 times 3 is 0.99. Yep.

But wait, M's rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M is the rest mass, so the energy is 300 Ge
