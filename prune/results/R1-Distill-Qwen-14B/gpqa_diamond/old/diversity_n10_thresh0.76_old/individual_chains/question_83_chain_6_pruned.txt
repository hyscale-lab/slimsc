Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then it's titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Wait, first, I should probably figure out the initial concentrations after dilution because the volume changes. Oh right, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes inversely with volume. So the initial solution is 0.05 M in 20 cm³. When you add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that. 0.05 *20 is 1 mmol, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me compute the moles of acetic acid initially. Moles = concentration * volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 mol. So initially, 0.001 mol of CH3COOH.

But wait, after dilution, the volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration is 0.025 M as I found. So when titrating, the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence would be moles / concentration. Moles of NaOH needed is same as moles of CH3COOH, which is 0.001 mol. NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, so volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

The question asks about 25% titration. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added, how much has reacted?

Wait, let's understand the titration process. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

At 25% titration, that's 25% of the way to equivalence. So moles of NaOH added would be 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol. That means 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH has been neutralized, forming CH3COO^- and Na+.

So in solution, what's left? The remaining CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the amount of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed is 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³. So the concentrations would be [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Hmm, so this looks like a buffer solution situation. Because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by the Ka, which is 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is approximately 4.733.

So plugging into the equation: pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Wait, so around 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. Option D is 4.57;6.92. So first value around 4.26.

But wait, did I calculate the concentrations correctly? Let me double-check the moles. Initial moles of CH3COOH after dilution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. NaOH added is 2.5 cm³, which is 0.0025 L. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So yes, correct.

So the pH at 25% is about 4.26. So option A's first value is 4.26. Let's look at the options. Option A is 4.26;8.52.

Wait, but wait, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ion. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

So the concentration of acetate ion at equivalence. Total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ (since equivalence is 10 cm³ of NaOH) = 50 cm³. Moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M. So let's set up the expression. For Kb:

B = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, which is small, so x is much less than 0.02. So Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02. So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.
