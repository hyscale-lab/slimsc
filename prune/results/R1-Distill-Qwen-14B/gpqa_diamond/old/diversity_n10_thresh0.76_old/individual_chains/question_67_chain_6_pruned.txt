Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says we have two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum, so I guess the focus is just on their orbital angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l₁ and l₂ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron, l is the total angular momentum quantum number, and m is the z-component of that total.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z for both electrons. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements yield -ħ.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum L, and since they're in a p orbital, each l₁ and l₂ is 1. So each has possible m values of -1, 0, +1.

But wait, the state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the m is -1.

So the state is a coupled state, which means it's an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared (L²) and its z-component (Lz). The individual electrons' angular momenta are coupled: L = L₁ + L₂.

I remember that when you have two angular momenta coupled, the state can be expressed as a combination of the product states of the individual m's. So the coupled state |l₁, l₂, l, m> can be written in terms of |l₁, m₁> |l₂, m₂> states where m₁ + m₂ = m.

In this case, m is -1. So m₁ + m₂ = -1. Since each m can be -1, 0, or +1, the possible pairs (m₁, m₂) that add up to -1 are: (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1 + something?) Wait, wait, let's think. Let me list all possible (m₁, m₂) where m₁ + m₂ = -1.

Possible pairs:

- m₁ = -1, m₂ = 0 → sum is -1.

- m₁ = 0, m₂ = -1 → sum is -1.

- m₁ = -1, m₂ = 0 → same as the first case.

Wait, no, another possibility: m₁ = -1, m₂ = 0 → sum -1.

Or m₁ = 0, m₂ = -1 → sum -1.

Wait, but can m₁ and m₂ be any combination that sums to m = -1?

Wait, but in this coupled state, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific combination that's an eigenstate of L² and Lz.

So the state is a linear combination of the product states |1, m₁> |1, m₂> with m₁ + m₂ = -1.

Wait, but the total m is -1, so m₁ + m₂ = -1.

So the possible (m₁, m₂) pairs are (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1 + 0? No, wait, 1 + (-2) would be -1, but m can't be more than l, which is 1 for each electron. So m can't be -2 because l is 1. So m₁ can be -1, 0, +1. So the only possible (m₁, m₂) pairs that sum to -1 are (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1) because (-1) + (-1) is -2, which is not equal to -1,
