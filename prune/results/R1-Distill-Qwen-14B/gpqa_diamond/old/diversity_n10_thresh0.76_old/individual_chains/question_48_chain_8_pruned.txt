Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4 after all these reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember cyclohexanone has a six-membered ring with a ketone group. So its structure is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group attached.

The first step is treating cyclohexanone with bromine. Wait, bromine usually adds to double bonds. But cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh, wait, but maybe it's a dienophile in some reaction? No, wait. Oh, wait, maybe it's an addition of Br2 in an enol form. Or perhaps it's a bromination via the enol mechanism. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening? No, cyclohexanone is a ketone, not an epoxide or something else.

Wait, another thought: Could this be an example of the Hellâ€“Valliant reaction? No, that's for epoxides. Or perhaps it's a Michael addition? Not sure. Alternatively, when ketones react with bromine, sometimes they form enol bromides. Oh right, cyclohexanone can undergo bromination via the enolate. So the first step is probably the formation of a dibromide.

Wait, no. Bromine adds across the carbonyl group, but wait, bromine (Br2) in a non-polar solvent like CCl4 might lead to the formation of a bromohydrin. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a ketone. When ketones react with Br2, it could add across the carbonyl but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via the enol.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Reactions of ketones with Br2 could involve the formation of an enol bromide. So, in the presence of a base, the carbonyl oxygen becomes deprotonated, forming an enolate, which can then react with Br2. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromonium ion formation. Hmm.

Wait, I think another possibility is that Br2 adds to the carbonyl group, making a bromide. But that would require the ketone to have a double bond, which it does (the carbonyl is a double bond). So maybe
