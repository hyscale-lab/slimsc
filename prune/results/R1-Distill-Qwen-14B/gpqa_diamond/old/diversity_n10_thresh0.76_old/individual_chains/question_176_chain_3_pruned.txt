Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what the question is asking. So, we have a system in a certain state, and we're measuring two observables, P and Q, one after the other. The question is about finding the probability of getting specific outcomes: 0 for P and -1 for Q.

First, I need to understand the setup. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused about that. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the state vector is usually a column vector, so this must be the state vector |ψ> before any measurements.

The operators P and Q are given as matrices. So, operator P has a matrix with elements in the first row as 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row is 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit symmetric. Let me write it out:

P = [
 [0, 1/√2, 0],
 [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
 [0, 1/√2, 0]
]

And operator Q is a diagonal matrix:

Q = [
 [1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, -1]
]

So, the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1. The diagonals make it easy because it's already diagonal—the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors, I think.

But wait, the order matters. The first diagonal element is 1, so the |1> state corresponds to eigenvalue 1. The middle is 0, so |2> is eigenvalue 0. The third is -1, so |3> corresponds to -1.

The measurement order is important: first measure P, then Q. The question is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no—wait, the problem says "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?" So, first measure P, get 0, then measure Q, get -1. So, the joint probability is the
