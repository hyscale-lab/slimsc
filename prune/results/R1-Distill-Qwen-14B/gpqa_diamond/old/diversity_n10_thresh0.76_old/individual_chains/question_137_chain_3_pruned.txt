Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that a synchrocyclotron is a type of particle accelerator, similar to a cyclotron but it uses a different approach to accelerate particles. Cyclotrons use a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate charged particles in a circular path.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is almost zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. Wait, but the question is about how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. Synchrocyclotrons are designed so that the frequency of the electric field matches the circular motion of the particle as it gains energy. Because as the particle's speed increases, its orbit radius increases, and the cyclotron frequency would normally change, but in a synchrocyclotron, you adjust the frequency so that it remains synchronized.

In a cyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage is the cyclotron frequency, which is (qB)/(2πm). But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency is adjusted to keep it synchronized as the particles accelerate.

Wait, but the problem gives U(t) as a function of time, which is a cosine wave. So the voltage alternates with a certain frequency ν(α). But wait, the problem says ν(α) — I'm not sure about the α part. Maybe α refers to some parameter that affects the frequency, like the angle or something else. Hmm, not entirely sure, but perhaps it's the same as the revolution frequency.

Let me think about how the number of revolutions is determined. The proton starts from rest and is accelerated each time it goes around the synchrocyclotron. Each time it completes a revolution, it gains some energy from the electric field. Since the voltage is applied at a certain frequency, the number of revolutions relates to the time it takes to reach the target energy.

Wait, the kinetic energy is given as 950 MeV. A proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², so
