Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with NMR and IR spectroscopy, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that's like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester group peaks, which makes me think there's an ester group in the molecule because esters have specific absorption bands, especially the carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So the compound must have an ester group attached to the aromatic ring.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break them down.

First, two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents will determine the NMR signals. If the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons would be two sets: the two ortho to each substituent and the two meta, or maybe it's more like two sets due to symmetry. Wait, wait, no. A para-substituted di-substituted benzene might have two equivalent H's on each substituent, but wait, no, that's for when substituents are the same. Oh wait, wait, no. If the two substituents are different, then the ring might have two different types of aromatic protons. But wait, wait, the di-substituted ring here is the starting point, so depending on where the substituents are, the aromatic Hs will split into different signals.

But wait, the problem says two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. So maybe the substituents are in positions that create two distinct sets of aromatic protons. Like, if the substituents are in the para positions relative to each other, but the substituents themselves are different. Wait, but if the substituents are in the para position, then the aromatic Hs would have two sets: two Hs in one position and two in another? No, wait, for a para-disubstituted benzene with two identical substituents, the aromatic Hs would be equivalent, leading to a single peak. But if the substituents are different, then the ring would have two sets of Hs. Like,
