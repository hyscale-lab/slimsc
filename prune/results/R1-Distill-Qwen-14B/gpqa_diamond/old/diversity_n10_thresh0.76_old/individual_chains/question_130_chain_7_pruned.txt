Okay, so I have this question about quasars and neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, but sometimes other objects like clouds can absorb some of that light. The question specifically mentions the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, isn't the Lyman alpha line in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum? Because I think hydrogen emits or absorbs at that wavelength when electrons transition between specific energy levels.

So the setup is that these clouds of neutral hydrogen are absorbing the Lyman alpha light from background quasars. The question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Oh right, redshift determines how much the wavelength is stretched due to the expansion of the universe. 

Ground-based optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because Earth's atmosphere blocks it. So if the Lyman alpha emission is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud, the absorption line would shift into a wavelength that optical telescopes can detect. That means the redshifted wavelength needs to be in the optical range.

Wait, the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nanometers, right? That's in the far ultraviolet. So when it's redshifted, the wavelength becomes longer. For it to be visible in optical (which is longer than about 400 nm, I think), the redshift z must be such that 1216 * (1+z) is above 400 nm.

Wait, let me think. The observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_emit * (1 + z). So we need lambda_obs >= 400 nm because optical light starts around there. But wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. No, wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms because 400 *10 =4000. Yeah.

So the equation is 1216 * (1 + z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

Let me solve for (1+z). So divide both sides by 1216:

1 + z >= 4000 / 1216.

Let me compute that. 4000 divided by 1200 is approximately 3.333. But let me get more precise. 1216 times 3 is 3648. 1216 *3.3 is 3648 + 364.8 = 4012.8. Oh, because 1216 *3.3 is 4012.8, which is just a bit above 4000. So 3.3 would mean 4012.8, which is a bit over. So 4000/1216 is about 3.29. So 1 + z >= 3.29, so z >= 2.29.

Wait, so the minimal redshift is about 2.29. Now looking at the options: A is 3, B is 1.2, C is 2.4, D is 1.9. So the lower limit is 2.29, so the minimal z would be just above that. So the options given, the closest is C) 2.4. But wait, let me check if I'm correct.

Wait another thing: the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z where the Lyman alpha is just entering the optical range. So any z above that would allow detection. So the lower limit is z_min = (4000/1216) -1.

Calculating 4000/1216: Let me compute 1216 * 3 = 3648, 4000 - 3648=352. 352 /1216 = about 0.289. So total is 3.289. So z is approximately 2.289. So z must be at least about 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. Option D is 1.9, which is lower. So the lower limit is 2.29, so any z higher than that can be detected. So the minimal possible redshift is approximately 2.3. But the question is about the lower limit. So the minimal z is about 2.29, so the options give 2.4 as the next possible.
