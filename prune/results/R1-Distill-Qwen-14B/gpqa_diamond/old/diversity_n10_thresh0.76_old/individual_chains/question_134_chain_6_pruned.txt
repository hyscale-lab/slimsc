Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. But wait, some of these might be strong or weak acids or bases, but I think enthalpy of neutralization is often standardized, like for strong acids and bases.

Let me look at the problem again. They mix 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change for this reaction.

Wait, but I think when calculating enthalpy of neutralization, you have to find the moles of H+ and OH- ions reacting. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be? Or wait, in solution, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely in two steps. But for the neutralization reaction, each H+ from the acid will react with OH- from the base.

Wait a second, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba
