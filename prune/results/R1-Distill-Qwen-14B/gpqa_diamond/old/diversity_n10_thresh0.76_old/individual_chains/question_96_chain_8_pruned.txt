Okay, so I have this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that black holes have entropy, which is related to their area. Oh right, the formula for the entropy of a black hole is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So I need to find the area first.

The question gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon and the distance d. The galaxy is at a distance of 10^10 parsecs. The angular size is θ = 1e-17 degrees. Oh wait, I should convert that angle into radians because the formula probably uses radians. Right, to convert degrees to radians, multiply by π/180. So θ in radians is 1e-17 * π/180. Let me calculate that: approximately 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, angular size θ is related to the actual size (radius) of the event horizon. The formula for θ is approximately s/d, where s is the size (like the diameter) and d is the distance. Wait, more accurately, θ ≈ s / d, but I think if θ is small, which it is here (like 1e-17 degrees), then this approximation holds. So s is roughly θ*d.

Wait, the event horizon of a black hole is a sphere, so the radius is r = (2 G M) / c². But maybe I don't need the mass directly. Instead, the area A of the event horizon is 4 π r². So if I can find the radius, I can compute A.

But perhaps a better approach is to find the radius from the angular size. Since θ = s / d, and s is the diameter of the event horizon, s = 2r. So θ ≈ 2r / d → r ≈ (d θ) / 2.

Let me compute that. Let's plug in the numbers. d = 1e10 parsecs. Wait, I need to convert parsecs into meters because the standard units are in meters, kilograms, seconds.

1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 pc = 3.086e26 meters.

θ is
