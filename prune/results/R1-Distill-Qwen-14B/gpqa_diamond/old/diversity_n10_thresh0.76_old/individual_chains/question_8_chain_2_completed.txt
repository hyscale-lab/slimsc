Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to think through it carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've done some experiments with knockout mutants and double mutants to figure out how these genes G1, G2, and G3 are interacting.

So first, what do I know? They've created three knockout mutants: g1, g2, g3. They've also made double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. The resistance levels are given for each mutant. The higher the percentage, the more resistant the plant is.

The data given:
- g1: 75% resistance (so less than wild-type which is 100%, but not as bad as others)
- g2: 0% (so completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (so half the resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

And the question is about the interactions between these genes. Also, it's given that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors are usually regulators, so they turn on other genes. So if a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes won't be expressed.

Now, I need to figure out what the data says about the relationships between the genes. Let's look at the results.

Looking at single mutants:
- g1: 75% → less resistance than wild type but not super bad. So maybe G1 is involved but not the only one. Or perhaps it's a downstream gene?
- g2: 0% → So when G2 is knocked out, the plant can't resist the disease at all. That suggests G2 is critical. Maybe it's a transcription factor since it's upstream.
- g3: 50% → So knocking out G3 reduces resistance by half.

Now the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% → So both G1 and G2 are knocked out leads to 0% resistance. Wait, if g2 alone is 0%, why does knocking out both lead to the same? Hmm. Maybe the function of G1 is redundant in the presence of G2? Or perhaps G2 is upstream of G1. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, then the absence of G2 would mean G1 isn't expressed either. But wait, in g1 mutant, there's still some resistance. Wait, no. Wait, in the g1 mutant, it's 75% which is less than wild type but not zero. So if in g1g2, it's 0%, perhaps G2 is upstream of G1. Because if G2 is a TF that activates G1, then knocking out G2 would mean G1 isn't expressed either, so the double mutant would be as bad as the g2 single mutant. But in our data, g2 single is 0% and g1g2 is also 0%, which makes sense.

Similarly, g1g3 is 10% → which is lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. Because combining them leads to additive effects.

g2g3: 0% → So here, both G2 and G3 are knocked out. If G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it's activating G3 as well. So without G2, G3 isn't expressed. But in the g3 single mutant, it's only 50%, so when G3 is not present, perhaps G2 is still active. Wait, but in the g2g3 double mutant, resistance is 0%. So perhaps G2 is upstream of G3. So without G2, G3 can't function either. Therefore, knocking out G2 and G3 would not make it worse than either single; but in this case, the double is 0%, same as g2 single. So maybe G3 isn't expressed without G2. Because if G2 is the TF for G3, then in g3 mutant, G3 is knocked out, so G2 is still there, but since G3 is not expressed, the plant's resistance is lower. But wait, in the g3 single mutant, it's 50%, which suggests that G3 alone contributes half the resistance. 

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out (g2), resistance is 0%. So perhaps G2 is required for G3 to function. So G2 is upstream, activating G3. So without G2, G3 can't be expressed, so the plant can't resist the disease. But in the g3 mutant, G2 is still present, so G3 is knocked out, but G2 is active, which probably activates other genes as well. So in the g3 mutant, since G2 is still there, perhaps it's activating another gene, leading to 50% resistance. Or maybe G3 is a downstream gene of G2, and another gene is also downstream of G2, giving partial resistance when G3 is missing.

Wait, but looking at the double mutants:

g1g3: 10% → so 10% is much lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, the double mutant would be as bad as the worst single, but here it's even worse. So their effects are additive.

But wait, 75% (G1) + 50% (G3) isn't 10%, so maybe that's not the right way to think. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both part of a redundant system. For example, if either is present, the plant has some resistance, but when both are missing, the resistance drops more.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each providing some resistance, the double mutant would have additive effects. So 75% +50% would be 125%, but obviously, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the effect is multiplicative: 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375, which is 37.5%. But the observed is 10%, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the function of G1 is redundant with another gene. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Looking at the double mutant g2g3: 0% resistance. But in the g3 single mutant, resistance is 50%. So why is the double mutant worse? Because in the absence of G2 (g2), G3's function can't be expressed. So perhaps G2 is required for G3's expression. So in g3, G3 is knocked out, so without G2, G3 can't be expressed. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in g3, G3 is already knocked out. Wait, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates G3. So if G2 is absent, G3 isn't expressed. So in the double mutant g2g3, perhaps the G3 isn't expressed because G2 is absent, but the g3 mutant already has G3 knocked out. So either way, G3 isn't there. But why is the resistance in g2g3 the same as g2 (both are 0%)? Because in g3, without G2, even if G3 is present, it's not expressed. But in g3, G3 is knocked out, so without G2, it's even worse? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is required for G3's expression. So without G2, G3 isn't expressed. So in the g3 mutant, G3 is not there, but maybe G2 is still functional. So in the g3 single mutant, G2 can activate other genes, possibly giving some resistance (50%). But in the g2g3 double mutant, G2 is not there, so the other genes (maybe activated by G2) are not expressed either. So in the double mutant, resistance is 0% because both G2's own genes and G3's are not expressed.

Wait, but in the g2 single mutant, resistance is 0%. So if in the double mutant, it's also 0%, that suggests that G2's absence is the main factor.

So, combining this, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes, including G1 and G3. Because in the g2 mutant, the resistance is 0%, which suggests that without G2, the downstream genes (maybe G1 and G3) aren't expressed, leading to no resistance.

Wait, but in the g1 mutant, resistance is 75%, which is less than wild type but not zero. So perhaps G1 is expressed even without G2. Hmm, that would contradict the earlier idea.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is not downstream of G2. Let me think about the double mutants.

Looking at g1g2: 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is 0%. But in the single mutants, g1 is 75%, g2 is 0%. So when you knock out both, the resistance is worse than either. But in this case, it's the same as the g2 mutant. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps G2 is upstream of G1. So without G2, G1 isn't expressed. But in the g1 mutant, G1 is knocked out, but G2 is still there. So the resistance in g1 is 75%, which suggests that G2's function is still sufficient for 75% resistance. So maybe G1 is part of a pathway that adds to the resistance provided by G2. So without G1, G2 alone gives 75% resistance. But without G2, the resistance is 0%, because G1 isn't expressed either. So that would mean G2 is upstream of G1. Because without G2, G1 can't be expressed, perhaps. But wait, in the g1 mutant, G2 is present but G1 is absent. So why is the resistance 75%? That suggests that G1 is contributing to the resistance, but not as crucial as G2.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1. So without G2, G1 isn't expressed. But in the g1 mutant, G1 is knocked out, but G2 is present. So why does g1 have 75% resistance? Maybe because G2 can activate other genes as well. So G2's role is broader. So when G2 is present, it activates G1 and maybe other genes, giving full resistance (100%). When G1 is knocked out (g1), G2 is still active, so it can activate other genes, giving 75% resistance. But when both G1 and G2 are knocked out (g1g2), then G2's other genes aren't expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, but in the g2 mutant, resistance is 0%, but in g1g2, it's also 0%. So according to this model, when G2 is absent, all downstream genes, including G1, are not expressed. So in the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G1 isn't knocked out, but perhaps the plant can still have 75% resistance because G2 is active and activating other genes.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to sketch a possible pathway.

Possibility 1:
G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. So in the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. In the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed, but G1 is not. So perhaps G3 provides 75% resistance, but when combined with G1, it's 100%. Hmm, but that doesn't match the data. Because in g1, resistance is 75%, which would imply that G1 is not needed. Or perhaps G2 activates other genes beyond G1 and G3.

Wait, maybe G2 is a master regulator. So when G2 is knocked out, all downstream resistance genes are inactive. So the plant can't resist, hence 0% resistance. In the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so it's active. But G1 is knocked out, so perhaps G1 is part of a redundant pathway. So resistance is lower but not gone. Like, if G1 is part of a secondary pathway that contributes to resistance.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2, but G3 is not. Or perhaps the other way around.

Let's look at the double mutants again:

g1g3: 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops much lower than either alone. So perhaps G1 and G3 work in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So their combined loss leads to a much lower resistance. So 75% (G1 loss) + 50% (G3 loss) isn't additive, maybe multiplicative, but 75% * 50% is 37.5%, which is higher than observed 10%. So perhaps they're in the same pathway and their effects are additive in a linear way.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same gene pathway, and their combined loss makes it much worse. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%. So maybe G1 and G3 are both necessary for a certain process. Or perhaps they are redundant.

Wait, redundancy would mean that if either is present, the function is fine. But when both are knocked out, the function is lost. So for example, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then in the single mutants, you lose some function, but in the double, you lose all. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is lower than wild type, and g3 is 50%. So if they're redundant, the single mutants would have reduced resistance but not as bad as the double. Let's see: if in g1, the plant has 75% resistance (so 25% loss), and in g3, 50% (so 50% loss), then the double would have more loss, like 75 + 50 = 125%? No, that can't be. Alternatively, the effect might be multiplicative. 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375, 37.5% → but the observed is 10%, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe they are in the same pathway but additive. So each contributes a portion. So 75% (G1) and 50% (G3). So when both are knocked out, the resistance is 75 + 50 - 100% = 25% (but that's not right). Or perhaps the effect is the sum. 75 +50 =125 → which can't be. Alternatively, perhaps each contributes 25% and 25%, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps G3's function is downstream of G1. So in the g1 mutant, G3 isn't expressed, leading to lower resistance. But that doesn't fit because in the g3 mutant, it's 50%, which is higher than g1's 75% (which is lower). Wait, no, higher numbers mean more resistance.

Wait, let me think again. Wild type is 100% resistant. So g1 has 75% → less than wild type. g3 has 50% → even worse. So when both are knocked out, g1g3 is 10% → which is worse than either. So maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to the resistance. So without either, the resistance is additive. But 75 +50 is 125, which is more than 100, but the double mutant is 10% → which is way lower. So that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is downstream of G1. So in g1 mutant, G3 isn't expressed, leading to lower resistance. But in the data, g3 is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So if G3 is downstream of G1, then in g1, G3 would not be expressed, so the plant's resistance would be the same as the g3 mutant, but that's not the case. So that might not fit.

Another approach: looking at the double mutants to see which genes are epistatic to others. Epistasis refers to a situation where the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. For example, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of the double mutant A and B is the same as the single mutant A.

In the double mutant g2g3, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So the phenotype of g2g3 is the same as g2. That suggests that G3 is epistatic to G2, or vice versa. Wait, no. Wait, when you have two mutations, if the combined phenotype is the same as one of the mutations, that suggests that one gene is epistatic to the other. So if the double mutant g2g3 looks like g2, that suggests that G2 is epistatic to G3. Because the presence of the g2 mutation determines the phenotype, regardless of G3's mutation.

Epistasis can be thought of as one gene being downstream of another. So if G2 is upstream of G3, then the mutation in G2 would prevent G3 from being expressed. So the double mutant would show the same as G2's mutation because G3 isn't expressed anyway. So the presence of the G2 mutation masks the effect of G3.

Similarly, looking at the double mutant g1g2: 0%, same as g2. So the phenotype is the same as g2, suggesting that G2 is epistatic to G1. So the mutation in G2 is masking the effect of G1's mutation.

So putting this together: G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. That suggests that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because if G2 is not functioning, then G1 and G3 can't function either.

Wait, but in the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75% which is less than wild type but not zero. So if G2 is upstream of G1, then in the g2 mutant, G1 wouldn't be expressed, but in the g1 mutant, G2 is present and could be activating other genes. So that could explain why the g1 mutant still has 75% resistance.

So perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out (g2), neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But when G1 is knocked out (g1), G2 is still active, so G3 is expressed, and the plant has 75% resistance. Wait, but in the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75%, which is more than the g3 mutant's 50%. So that would suggest that G3 alone provides 50% resistance, and with G1 (if present), G1 contributes another 25%, making it 75% when G1 is present. Or perhaps G3 is responsible for 50% and G1 adds another 25%, so in the wild type, it's 100% (G1 and G3 both active). But then when G1 is knocked out, G3 is active, giving 50% → but in our data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So that would not fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think differently. If G2 is a transcription factor for both G1 and G3, then:

- In the wild type: G2 → G1 and G3 are expressed. So 100% resistance.
- In g1 mutant: G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. Let's say G3 provides 75% resistance. Then why is g1 75%? Or perhaps G1's function is redundant with another gene, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates G3, and G3 is a TF that activates G1. So G2 → G3 → G1. So in the g2 mutant, G3 and G1 are not expressed. So resistance is 0%. In the g3 mutant, G1 is not expressed, so the resistance would be lower than wild type. But in the data, g3 is 50%, which is lower than wild type but not 0%. So perhaps G3 is not required for G1. Alternatively, if G3 is a TF for G1, then in the g3 mutant, G1 wouldn't be expressed. So in the g3 mutant, G1 is not expressed, but G2 is present, so perhaps G2 activates other genes, leading to 50% resistance. Hmm, but then in the g1 mutant, G1 is not present, but G2 is. So G3 is expressed (since only G1 is knocked out in g1), so the resistance would be same as g3's 50%, but in data g1 is 75% → so that doesn't fit.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to make a table of all the mutants and their resistance:

Mutant | Resistance
g1 | 75%
g2 | 0%
g3 | 50%
g1g2 | 0%
g1g3 | 10%
g2g3 | 0%

Looking at g2g3: 0% same as g2. So G3's mutation doesn't add anything beyond G2's. So G2 is epistatic to G3. So G2 is upstream.

Similarly, in g1g2: 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 as well.

So both G1 and G3 are downstream of G2. So G2's mutation masks the effect of G1 and G3. So G2 is the master regulator.

Now, what about the g1g3 double mutant: 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%. But without G1, resistance is 75%, and without G3, 50%. So why is the double mutant worse than either? Because perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to the resistance. So knocking out both leads to additive reduction. But 75 +50 is 125%, which isn't right. Alternatively, their contributions are additive in a way that 75% (G1) and 50% (G3) are in parallel, so the combined effect is more than either. But in the double mutant, they're both knocked out, so the resistance is even lower than the worst single, which is 0% in g2.

Wait, that's not possible. The worst single is g2 with 0%. So in the double mutants, the resistance can't be lower than that. But in g1g3, it's 10%, which is lower than g3's 50% but higher than g2's 0%? No, 10% is lower than 50% but higher than 0%? Wait, no, 10% is lower than 50% and higher than 0%? No, 0% is lower, 10% is higher than 0%. So perhaps the g1g3 double mutant is worse than either single, but not as bad as g2.

Hmm, perhaps G1 and G3 are both required for a particular function, so their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype. But how does their relationship work?

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2 but function in separate pathways. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. So in the absence of G2, resistance is 0%, but when G2 is present, the absence of both G1 and G3 leads to lower resistance than either alone.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is present because it's only g1 and g3 knocked out. So in this case, perhaps G2 is functioning, but without G1 and G3, the resistance drops to 10%.

So if G2 is a TF activating G1 and G3, and they each contribute to resistance, perhaps each contributes a portion. So G1 contributes 25% (g1 is 75%, so 100% -75% =25% loss) and G3 contributes 50% (g3 is 50%, so 50% loss). So when both are knocked out, the loss is 25% +50% =75%, but that's not matching the 10% observed.

Alternatively, maybe the effects are multiplicative: 0.75 (g1) * 0.5 (g3) = 0.375 → 37.5% resistance. But observed is 10%, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway. So knocking them both out leads to a much worse effect. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the data suggests that G2 is the transcription factor. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. So in g2, resistance is 0%, meaning without G2, the downstream genes (G1 and G3) can't contribute to resistance, leading to no resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. So G3 contributes 50% resistance. But wait, the data says g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So perhaps G1 is not downstream of G2.

Wait, maybe G1 is not downstream. Let's think differently.

If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G3, and G3 is upstream of G1. So G2 → G3 → G1. Then:

- In g2 mutant: G3 and G1 not expressed → 0% resistance.
- In g3 mutant: G1 is not expressed → so the resistance would be same as if G1 is not expressed. But in data, g3 is 50%, so perhaps G2 activates another gene (say G4) which contributes 50% resistance. So without G3, G1 isn't expressed, but G4 is still expressed, giving 50% resistance.
- In g1 mutant: G1 is not expressed, but G2 and G3 are expressed, so G4 is expressed, giving 50% resistance. But wait, the data says g1 is 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, getting more confused.

Let me look at the options provided.

Options:
A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1
B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1
C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3
D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3

Hmm, looking for which option fits the data.

Option A says G1 is TF. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is more than 0%, while g2 is 0% → if G2 is a TF, that might make sense.

Option B says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so same regulation?), but I'm not sure about that.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (pleiotropy meaning a single gene affecting multiple traits), and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have gene redundancy (so they can compensate for each other), and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So from our earlier analysis, G2 is a TF, and it's epistatic to G1 and G3, so G2 is upstream.

Looking at the options, options B, C, and D have G2 as TF. So probably, the correct answer is among these.

Now, what about G1 and G3?

In the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10%. So their combined effect is worse than either alone. So perhaps they are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. Or perhaps they are redundant.

But in the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75%, and in g3, 50%. So if they were redundant, the single mutants should have similar or the same resistance, but they don't.

Alternatively, perhaps they are not redundant but in separate pathways. So knocking out both leads to additive loss.

But I'm not sure.

Looking at the epistatic relationships:

In the double mutant g2g3: 0% same as g2 → so G2 is epistatic to G3.

In g1g2: 0% same as g2 → G2 is epistatic to G1.

So G2 is epistatic to both.

Now, looking at g1g3: 10% → which is worse than both. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in a pathway that is downstream of G2.

Wait, but in the presence of G2, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. So perhaps G2 is active, but without G1 and G3, the resistance is low.

So perhaps G1 and G3 are both required for a certain function, but in the presence of G2, this function contributes 10% to resistance.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a separate pathway that only contributes a small part of the resistance.

But I'm not too sure.

Looking back at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which would mean that when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single. But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So gene redundancy would predict that the double mutant is as bad as the worse single (50%), but here it's 10%, which is worse than both. So gene redundancy doesn't fit.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here.

Option B says they have the same promoter. If G1 and G3 have the same promoter, they would be co-regulated. So knocking out G1 wouldn't affect G3. But the data shows that knocking both out leads to worse resistance than either alone. So perhaps they're co-regulated by another factor, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2, neither is expressed. But in the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed, giving 50% resistance (as in g3). But in the data, g1 is 75% → which is higher than g3's 50%. So that might not fit unless G1 is part of another pathway.

Wait, perhaps G2 activates G3, and G3 activates G1. So G2 → G3 → G1. Then:

- g2: 0% → no G3 or G1.
- g3: G1 is not expressed → resistance depends on other factors, say 50%.
- g1: G3 is expressed (since G2 is present), so G3 is active, contributing 75% resistance.

But then the double mutant g1g3 would have 0% G3 and G1, but G2 is present. So perhaps G2 activates another gene, but that's getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but in separate pathways. So G2 leads to G1 and G3, which each contribute to resistance.

In that case, the single mutants would have some resistance, and the double would have more severe resistance.

But in the data:

g1 is 75% (so loss of G1 leads to 25% loss)
g3 is 50% (loss of G3 leads to 50% loss)
g1g3 is 10% (so loss of both leads to 90% loss)

That would suggest that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So their combined loss leads to almost no resistance.

But how does that fit with the epistatic relationships.

Wait, but in the presence of G2, if G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, then knocking out both would lead to additive effects, but they can't go below zero. Oh, but in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is higher than 0% but lower than either single.

Hmm, perhaps G2 is the only one providing resistance, but no, in the g1 mutant, G2 is present, but resistance is 75%, which is less than wild type.

Wait, perhaps the following model:

G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. Each contributes to resistance. G1 contributes 25% (so without G1, resistance is 75% → 100-25=75), G3 contributes 50% (without G3, 50% → 100-50=50). So the combined loss of G1 and G3 would be 25 +50 =75% loss → resistance of 25%, but in the data, g1g3 is 10%. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, each contributing less. Or perhaps G2 is the only one contributing, but that's not the case.

I'm really stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other. So in the double mutant, the resistance would be the same as the more severe single. But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So the double is worse than both, so redundancy doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But if G1 is TF, then in the g1 mutant, the downstream genes (maybe G2 and G3) wouldn't be expressed. But in the data, g1 is 75%, so G2 and G3 are expressed. So that can't be.

So the only option left is D or C.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter. So their expression is co-regulated. If their promoters are the same, then knocking out G1 would not affect G3. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is much worse than either single. So perhaps they have the same promoter, meaning their expression is dependent on the same TF. But if G2 is the TF, then in the g2 mutant, both are not expressed. But in the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed (since same promoter). So in g1, G3 is expressed, providing 50% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 have the same promoter, then their expression is co-regulated. So in g1, G3 is also knocked out because they're on the same promoter. But that would mean that in the g1 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to the same as the g3 mutant (50% resistance). But in the data, g1 is 75%, so that can't be.

So option B might not be correct.

Looking back, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Hmm.

Wait, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So if both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single. But in the data, the double is 10%, which is worse than both. So that would fit.

But wait, redundancy implies that each can compensate for the other. So the single mutants would have the same phenotype as the double. But in the data, the single mutants are worse than the double in some cases. Wait, no, the double is worse than either. So if the double is worse, then they're not redundant.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a synthetic lethal relationship. But that's probably not one of the options.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about the phenotypes.

The key points:

- G2 is a TF because at least one is. From the data, g2 is 0% → so without G2, the plant can't resist. So G2 is likely a TF.

- G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because in the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is same as g2.

- So G2 is upstream.

Now, looking at the single mutants:

g1:75% → some resistance remains.

g3:50% → less resistance than wild type.

In g1g3: 10% → worst.

So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops further.

So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and both contribute to resistance. So without both, the resistance is much lower.

But since G2 is upstream, in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is present, so the plant can still produce G2's products, but without G1 and G3, the resistance is low.

So how does that fit into the options.

Looking at the options again.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But gene redundancy would mean that the double mutant would have the same as the worst single. But in the data, it's worse than both.

So perhaps it's not redundancy.

Alternatively, option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that relates here.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, so G1 is epistatic to G3. If G1 is upstream, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would be the same as the G1 mutant. But in the data, the double mutant is worse than G1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not in the same pathway, and their combined loss leads to additive effects. So they are in separate pathways.

But then what about the options.

The only option that says G2 is a TF is options B, C, D.

Looking at option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. If that were true, the double mutant would have the same as the worse single, but here it's worse. So D is not correct.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. That doesn't seem to fit.

Option B: G1 and G3 have the same promoter. So their expression is co-regulated. If G2 is the TF, then in the presence of G2, both G1 and G3 are expressed. In the g1 mutant, G3 is also not expressed (since same promoter). But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So that can't fit.

Hmm.

Another approach: looking at the epistatic relationships.

In the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. So the phenotype is not the same as either single mutant. So neither gene is epistatic to the other. So perhaps they're in separate pathways, with G2 upstream of both.

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate downstream pathways contributing to resistance. Thus, their combined loss leads to lower resistance.

Looking at the options, which option implies that G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But as discussed, the data doesn't fit redundancy.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure.

Hmm. Another thought: G2 is a TF, G1 is another TF, and G3 is a downstream gene. So G2 activates G3, and G1 may not be downstream of G2.

In this case, the g1 mutant would have G2 and G3 active, giving 75% resistance. G3 alone would give 50%. So perhaps G1 contributes an additional 25% to resistance when active.

But then in g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, so resistance would be 100% -25% -50% =25%, but the data says 10% → doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G3 is downstream of G1, which is downstream of G2. So G2 → G1 → G3.

In that case, in g2, G1 and G3 are not expressed → 0% resistance.

In g1, G3 is not expressed → resistance depends on G2 and other factors, maybe 75%.

In g3, G1 is expressed (since G2 is present), so G3 is not, leading to 50% resistance.

But in the double mutant g1g3, G3 is not expressed (due to g3), and G1 is not expressed (due to g1), so G3 isn't expressed, and G1 isn't either. But how much resistance is that? Maybe 0%, but data says 10%.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So when both are knocked out, resistance is worse than either, which matches the data. So D could be correct, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps 'gene redundancy' isn't the right term, and it's 'gene complementation' but that's not an option.

Wait, the term 'gene redundancy' refers to when two genes can compensate for each other. So if one is knocked out, the other can take over. So the single mutants would have the same phenotype as the double mutant. But in our data, the single mutants have worse resistance than the double mutant. So that would suggest they are not redundant.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, let's think about the epistatic relationships again.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the phenotype of g1g3 double mutant would be the same as the g1 mutant. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that's not the case.

So perhaps G3 is epistatic towards G1. So the phenotype of g1g3 would be same as g3, which is 50%. But data says 10%, which is worse. So that's not matching.

Wait, unless neither is epistatic, and their combined effect is additive.

In that case, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. So their combined loss leads to additive resistance loss.

But I'm not sure how that would fit into the options.

Given all the confusion, I think the correct answer is D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it might be C.

Wait, another thought: if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the double mutant would have the same phenotype as G1's mutant. But in the data, the double mutant is worse than either, so that can't be.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct.

Wait, option B says G1 and G3 have the same promoter. So if their promoters are the same, then in the g1 mutant, G3 is also not expressed. So in the g1 mutant, G3 is knocked out, leading to 50% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher. So that can't be.

Therefore, the only option that makes some sense is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the double mutant would have the same as G1. But in the data, the double is worse, so that doesn't fit.

I'm stuck. Let me think of the correct answer as option D, but I might be wrong.

Wait, looking back, in the data, when G2 is present, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. So the presence of G2 allows for some minimal resistance. So perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, and their combined loss leads to almost no resistance from that pathway, but another pathway (regulated by G2) contributes 10%.

But I'm not sure.

In the end, I think the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and their combined loss leads to additive effects. So looking at the options, none directly state this, but option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: the data shows that the double mutant g1g3 has lower resistance than either single, so they are not in the same pathway and their effects are additive. So they are in separate pathways. So G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are in separate downstream pathways.

Thus, the answer would be that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So which option fits that?

Looking at the options:

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. No.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. No.

Option B says G1 and G3 have same promoter. No.

Hmm. None of the options directly say that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the options don't have an option that says G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So perhaps the correct answer is option D.

No, I'm not convinced. Another approach: looking for the correct epistatic relationships.

Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, that suggests that G2 is upstream, so G2 must be a transcription factor.

Now, in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, worse than either. So this suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate, additive pathways.

So perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 are in separate downstream pathways, and their effects are additive. So looking for an option that says this.

But the given options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the possible answer in terms of the options. The options are:

A) G1 is TF, G2 and G3 pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1.

B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 epistatic to G3.

D) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

Given that G2 is a TF, options B, C, D are possible.

In the data, G1 is 75%, which is higher than G3's 50%. So perhaps G1 is not in the same pathway as G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, their combined loss would be worse than either. So the data supports that.

But redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other, but in the data, the double mutant is worse than either, so that contradicts redundancy.

So perhaps option D is not correct.

Another thought: epistasis between G1 and G3. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the double mutant would have the same as G1. But in the data, it's worse than G1. So that can't be.

Hmm, I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess here.

Based on the data:

- G2 is a TF, as it's epistatic to others.

- G1 and G3 are downstream of G2.

- G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, as their combined knockout leads to more severe resistance.

So the correct option would be option D, but the redundancy part doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are perfect, but D is the closest.

Wait, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which they don't. So that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, the correct answer is option D.

After much thought, I think the answer is D.


The question involves determining the interactions between three genes (G1, G2, and G3) in white lupine that contribute to resistance against the fungal disease anthracnose. The experiment provides resistance data for single and double mutants, and the goal is to infer gene function and interactions.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (less than wild-type but not as severe as others).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible, suggesting G2 is critical).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (moderate reduction in resistance).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2, indicating G2 is epistatic to G1).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant, suggesting additive effects or separate pathways).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2, indicating G2 is epistatic to G3).

3. **Epistatic Relationships**:
   - G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, as the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have the same resistance as g2.
   - The resistance of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, suggesting G1 and G3 contribute to resistance through separate or additive pathways.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States G1 is a transcription factor (TF), G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1. This is inconsistent with the data, as G2, not G1, is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 is not shown to be a TF.

- **Option B**: States G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic to G1. If G1 and G3 shared the same promoter, knocking out G1 would also knock out G3, leading to the same resistance as g3. However, g1 has 75% resistance, which is higher than g3's 50%, so this does not fit.

- **Option C**: States G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. Pleiotropy implies a single gene affects multiple traits, which is not evident here. Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant g1g3 has worse resistance than g1.

- **Option D**: States G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. Gene redundancy implies that either gene can compensate for the other, but the data shows the double mutant g1g3 has worse resistance than either single mutant, contradicting redundancy. However, this option aligns most closely with the observed epistatic relationships and the role of G2 as a TF.

### Conclusion:
While none of the options perfectly fit the data, **Option D** is the most consistent with the observation that G2 is a TF and epistatic to both G1 and G3. The mention of gene redundancy, though not fully supported by the data, is the closest fit among the provided options.
