Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question says we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So we're supposed to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, right. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. That means the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should be 1.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh, but that's a complex function. The absolute square would be the square of the magnitude. Let me think: for a complex number z = p + qi, the magnitude squared is p² + q².

So the wave function ψ(x) is [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

So the absolute square is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because (0.5i)^2 is (0.25)(-1), but wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, the absolute square is |ψ|² = (Reψ)² + (Imψ)². So yes, [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2.

So the integral of |ψ|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

So the integral becomes ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

But wait, that's the integral of (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25. So we can split the integral into two parts: a² ∫(1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 plus 0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part.

First part: a² ∫(1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second part: 0.25 times the integral of 1 dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So equation: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, what's ln(2) numerically? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202. Then take square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So I think the answer is B.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I calculate correctly? Let me double-check.

The integral of ψ*(x) ψ(x) from 1 to
