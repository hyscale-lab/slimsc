Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. The question is about the para-isomer yield for six different substances. Hmm, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the substituents on the benzene ring can activate or deactivate the ring and also direct the incoming electrophile to certain positionsâ€”either ortho, meta, or para.

The problem gives six substituents attached to a benzene ring:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzoyloxy ethyl group)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, no, wait. The substituents are each on a benzene ring. So each compound is a benzene derivative with a specific substituent.

The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer when each undergoes bromination in excess. We need to arrange them from least to most para-isomer yield.

Wait, in electrophilic substitution, the substituent directs the incoming group. For example, activating groups like -OH (but that's not here) or -NH2 are strong activating, and they are ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups, like -NO2, are meta directors. Also, some substituents are deactivating but still direct ortho/para (like -Cl, which is deactivating but ortho/para directing).

So each substituent will influence where the bromine adds. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So, for each compound, what's the major position of bromine addition, and how much is para?

But wait, the problem states that each reaction forms only one monobromo derivative. So each will give a single major product. So the question is, which substituent leads to the bromine adding in the para position the most, and which the least.

Wait, but wait, when a substituent is present, the bromine can add in different positions. But if the substituent is a strong director, perhaps the para position is favored
