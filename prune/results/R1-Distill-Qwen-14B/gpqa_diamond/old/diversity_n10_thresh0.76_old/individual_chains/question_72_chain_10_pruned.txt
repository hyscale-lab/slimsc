Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it one reaction at a time.

So, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, that's a norbornene derivative, I think. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound with two double bonds, right? The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7.

The first reaction is with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. I remember that when you have a diene and something with di bromo groups, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction. Oh wait, the diene here is cyclohexa-1,3-diene, but the substituent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl). So each of those positions has a CH2Br2 group, perhaps?

Wait, no. The structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl). So each of the 5 and 6 positions on the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has a CH2Br group. So each of those has two bromines attached to the same carbon, making it a dibromomethyl group. So each substituent is CH2Br2? No, wait, no. Dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2, but wait, wait. No, let me think. "bis(dibromomethyl)" means that each of the two positions (5 and 6) has a dibromomethyl group. So each substituent is a CH2Br2 group attached to the cyclohexene?

Wait, no. Dibromomethyl would be (CH2Br)2, but that would be a geminal dihalide, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is a CH2Br group, and the di bromo refers to each of them. Wait, maybe each substituent is a CH2Br group, and the molecule has two of them. But the molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), so maybe each substituent is a CH2Br2 group? Or perhaps each substituent is CH2Br
