Okay, so I have this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity conditions. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation describes the current-voltage behavior in a semiconductor device under space-charge-limited conditions. Let me think about what that means.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V² / L³). I think ε is the dielectric constant, μ is the carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. So the equation relates current density J to the square of the voltage V.

Wait, the question is about the validity conditions. From what I remember, the Mott-Gurney equation is applicable when the current is limited by the space charge, meaning that the electric field is so strong that the charge in the region creates a space-charge which dominates. This is typically in the case where the device is under high voltage, so that the space charge effects are significant.

Now, the options are about what conditions the equation holds true. Let's look at each option.

Option A: The equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, trap-free makes sense because traps would introduce more complex behavior. Ohmic contact implies that the contact doesn't create a barrier for carriers, so that the current flows easily without injection barriers. But what about drift vs diffusion? Oh, in this case, if it's space-charge-limited, the current is mainly due to the electric field, so drift is the main component. But how about the equation itself. The derivation, I think, assumes that the current is due to drift, so if drift current is negligible, that might not be the case. Or wait, maybe the equation is for when the current is limited by space charge, which usually occurs when the electric field is strong, leading to drift current being dominant. Hmm.

Option B: It's valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. No carrier injection barrier makes sense because that's Ohmic contact, I think. So if there's no barrier, the carriers can move easily. And negligible diffusion current—wait, in SCLC, I think the current is primarily due to drift, so diffusion is less important. So if diffusion current is negligible, that fits.
