Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the details about enthalpy of formation and bond energies. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy of formation of this compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me write it down to visualize it better. Wait, actually, maybe I should count the number of carbons and bonds first.

Wait, the formula of the compound: it's a hydrocarbon with a bunch of branches. Let me see, each (CH3)2 group is attached to a central carbon, and there are some double bonds. Oh, wait, maybe I should look for the structure. But maybe that's complicating things. The problem gives me some bond energies, so maybe I don't need the structure exactly.

I remember that the enthalpy of formation is calculated using bond energies. The formula is something like: the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products, but wait no, wait. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation of a molecule is the change when the molecule is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, using bond energies, the approach is to calculate the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants (the elements) and subtract the energy released when the bonds in the product are formed.

Wait, but for enthalpy of formation, it's the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. The standard states for carbon and hydrogen are graphite and H2 gas, respectively.

So, for the compound, each molecule is made from C and H. The formula is probably CnHm; I need to figure out how many C and H atoms are in the molecule.

Let me count the carbons and hydrogens. The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Maybe it's easier to break it down.

Each (CH3)2 group is attached to a central carbon. Let's see:

Looking at each part:

- (CH3)2C=CH: So that's a group where a central carbon (C) is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to a CH group. Wait, no: (CH3)2C=CH-: So the structure is probably ((CH3)2C-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2), but wait, no, the formula as given is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of each substituent.

Wait, perhaps I should just figure out the molecular formula. Let's count:

Each (CH3)2 group has two CH3 groups. So each contributes 2*(3 hydrogens) =6 H per C. But wait, wait. Let's approach it step by step.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me split it into parts:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: So, each end is (CH3)2C-CH2... Wait, maybe better to count each part.

Alternatively, perhaps I can count the number of carbons and hydrogens:

Each (CH3)2C=CH group: that's 3 carbons in the (CH3)2C part, but wait, (CH3)2C is a central carbon connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond. So, the group is (CH3)2C=CH-: so this part has 3 carbons (the central C plus two from the CH3 groups), and then another CH- attached via a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the entire formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should count each unit:

The molecule is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2
