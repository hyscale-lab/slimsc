Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these four.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it's constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. These operators are organized by their dimension, and they have to respect certain symmetries.

Let me think about each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The Standard Model, and thus SMEFT, must respect Lorentz symmetry because it's part of the framework of relativity. Operators in SMEFT are Lorentz-invariant. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The SMEFT is a field theory, so it must respect Poincare symmetry. Operators are constructed to be Poincare-invariant. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well.

Wait, but wait. Lorentz and Poincare are related. Poincare includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it also respects Lorentz. But the question is which symmetries must be respected. So both 1 and 2 are required.

3. CP symmetry: I'm a bit confused here. I think that operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. Because the Standard Model itself doesn't respect CP in all cases, like in the CKM matrix leading to CP violation. So SMEFT allows for CP violation in operators, meaning the operators don't have to be CP-symmetric. So if the question is about symmetries that must be respected, then CP might not be required. So 3 might not be a must.

4. CPT symmetry: I remember that in quantum field theory, the CPT theorem states that a Lorentz-invariant theory must be CPT-symmetric. So for any operator in a Lorentz-invariant theory (which SMEFT is), they must also respect CPT symmetry. So 4 must be respected.

So putting it together. The symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1 yes), Poincare (2 yes), and CPT (4 yes). But wait, the options don't have all four. Let me check the options.

Wait, the choices are:

Option C: 1,2,4 → So that's Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but wait, the first part: do all SMEFT operators respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations (momentum conservation), but in effective theories, we often work in a certain frame, like the center of mass frame. But I think the operators are still required to be Poincare-invariant. So both 1 and 2 must be respected.

Then, for 3, CP isn't required because SMEFT can include terms that violate CP. Like, for example, including operators that lead to new sources of CP violation beyond the SM.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because some sources say that SMEFT is built respecting the symmetries of the SM. The SM has CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP.

So the operators must be CPT invariant because the theory is Lorentz invariant, which requires CPT symmetry. So yes, 4 is a must.

So the necessary symmetries are 1,2,4. So the correct option is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an effective field theory, meaning it must respect certain fundamental symmetries. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, let us analyze each option:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic theory, and all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a foundational requirement for any relativistic quantum field theory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry, as operators are constructed to be Poincaré-invariant. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is also a requirement.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not necessarily required for all operators in SMEFT. The Standard Model already allows for CP violation (e.g., through the CKM matrix), and SMEFT can include operators that explicitly violate CP. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a strict requirement.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant theory must be CPT-symmetric. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry. Thus, CPT symmetry is a requirement.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is **C**.

Answer: C
