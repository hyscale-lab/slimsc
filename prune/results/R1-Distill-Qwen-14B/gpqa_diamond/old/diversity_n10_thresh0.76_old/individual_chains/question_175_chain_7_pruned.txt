Okay, so I've got this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see what I can remember.

The question says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the possible form of f.

The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a λ dependence.

I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroidal and symmetric along z, maybe the radiation pattern has some angular dependence related to that.

Wait, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator (θ=90 degrees) and decreases towards the poles. The radiation is weakest along the axis. Oh wait, no, wait—wait, no, wait. Wait, I think the dipole's radiation pattern is maximum at θ=90 degrees (transverse), and the intensity falls off as cos^2θ towards the ends. So the pattern is like a donut shape around the axis.

Wait, but in this problem, the charge distribution is spheroidal. Maybe it's a dipole-type oscillation, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an electric quadrupole or something else. But regardless, the form of the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) depends on the multipole expansion.

Wait, when you have an oscillating dipole, the far field (radiation) is given by the dipole approximation. The power radiated per unit solid angle for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2. Wait, that's for electric dipole radiation. Yes. So the radiation pattern is maximum at θ=90 degrees, and zero at θ=0 and 180 degrees.

Wait, the power per unit solid angle (intensity) for an oscillating dipole is given by I ∝ (d^2E/dt^2)^2 * (sinθ)^2. Or something like that. So the maximum intensity occurs at θ=90 degrees, which is the equator, and the intensity falls to zero at the poles.

But wait, in this question, the maximum power is A. So the function f(θ, λ) must have a maximum at some θ. But since the distribution is spheroidal, maybe the maximum is at θ=90 degrees, similar to a dipole.

Wait, the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at θ=30 degrees. So, if the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees, then the intensity at θ=30 would be (sin30)^2 times the maximum intensity. Since sin30 is 0.5, (0.5)^2 is 0.25, so 1/4 of the maximum power. So the fraction is 1/4.

But wait, that's only if the function f is proportional to (sinθ)^something. Wait, for a dipole, the radiation pattern is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So, if the maximum is at θ=90 degrees, and the dipole pattern is sin^2θ, then at θ=30 degrees, it's (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the maximum. So the fraction would be 1/4.

But looking at the options, option B and C have 1/4 as the fraction. So the fraction is 1/4.

Now, what about the functional form of f? The function f is power per unit solid angle. How does that depend on λ?

Power (or intensity) is related to the square of the electric field, which in turn depends on the frequency of oscillation. For an oscillating dipole, the radiation intensity is proportional to (ω^4) (d^2/dt^2)^2, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact dependencies.

Wait, I think the radiated power for an oscillating dipole is proportional to ω^4 E_0^2, where E_0 is the amplitude of the oscillation. But we're looking at the power per unit solid angle, which I think would have the same ω dependence because the angular terms (like sinθ) are separate.

Alternatively, maybe the power per unit solid angle has a dependence on 1/λ^4. Because λ is inversely proportional to ω (since λ = c/ω for electromagnetic waves), so ω is proportional to 1/λ. If the intensity is proportional to ω^4, then substituting ω = 2π c / λ, we have (1/λ)^4. So f would be proportional to 1/λ^4.

Looking at the options: option A says 1/2 and λ^-4. Option C says 1/4 and λ^-4. Option B has λ^-3. So if the fraction is 1/4, and the λ dependence is λ^-4, that would be option C.

Wait but wait, what about the function f—does it have any other dependencies? The radiation power per unit solid angle in the far field for an oscillating dipole is given by:

P(θ, φ) = ( ( μ_0 μ_0 ) / (4π) ) * ( (d^2E/dt^2)^2 ) / (c^4 r^2) ) * sin²θ

Wait, no, perhaps more precisely, the intensity (power per unit area) for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2 * (ω^4). Because the dipole moment oscillates with angular frequency ω, so the higher the frequency, the more intense the radiation.

So, since ω is related to λ via ω = 2π c / λ, then ω^4 is proportional to 1/λ^4. So the intensity as a function of θ and λ would be f(θ, λ) proportional to sin²θ * (1/λ^4). So the function f would have a λ^-4 dependence.

Putting it all together: the fraction at θ=30 degrees is (sin30)^2 = (½)^2 = ¼ of the maximum. The maximum is when θ=90, sin90=
