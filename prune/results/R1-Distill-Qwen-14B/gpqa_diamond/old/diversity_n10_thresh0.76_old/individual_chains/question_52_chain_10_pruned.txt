Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, when looking at the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), the ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes—so when there are no spots, the ratio is higher than when spots are present.

Wait, the ratio decreases when there are spots. So the ratio (n1/n2) is higher when there are no spots. I need to find the factor, which would be (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), so I can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Since the ratio they're looking at is n1/n2, it would be the reciprocal. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ).

But wait, actually, let me get the formula right. The Boltzmann distribution is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So in this case, if E2 > E1, then E2 - E1 = ΔE. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) ). Because the exponent is positive when n1 is higher than n2.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall T_eff decreases. So when there are spots, the Teff is 5500 K instead of 6000 K. But wait, how does this affect the photosphere's temperature? Are the spots cooler regions, so the overall average temperature is lower.

But in LTE, each region emits based on its local temperature. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, are those spots at a lower temperature, and the rest at 6000 K? Or does the entire photosphere's temperature drop to 5500 K? Hmm, the question says that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the entire star's photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K when spots are present. But wait, no, that might not be accurate because the spots are cooler regions.
