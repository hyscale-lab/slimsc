Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the product formed when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. 

First, I need to determine what compound X is based on the given IR and NMR data. Then, I can figure out what kind of reaction occurs when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. 

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretch. But since the compound is reacting with HI and red phosphorus, which is a common setup for the hydroboration-oxidation reaction, but wait, red phosphorus is used in the formation of HI in such reactions... Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, right! Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroboration reaction as a way to generate BH3·HI, which is a reagent for hydroboration-oxidation. So maybe compound X is an alkene because that reaction typically adds boron across the double bond.

Looking at the IR data, another peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe there's a ketone or carboxylic acid group. But wait, the IR also has 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So this suggests that the compound has an aromatic ring.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The peaks are:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) — that's a broad signal, possibly an aldehyde proton? But wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or perhaps it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid? But wait, the IR doesn't show a broad O-H stretch around 3000 cm-1, which carboxylic acids usually have. Hmm, maybe it's an enol form or something else. Alternatively, could it be an aldehyde proton? But aldehydes often show up around 9-10 as a singlet or maybe a triplet if coupled with something else. But the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde, but wait, the IR doesn't show the aldehyde C-H stretch which is around 2800-2700 cm-1 as a strong absorption. Oh, wait, the IR does have 3400–2500, which could include aldehyde C-H stretch, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe that 10.5 ppm is an acidic proton, like an alpha proton to a carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a phenolic OH, but again, the IR didn't show a broad peak around 3000 which is typical for -OH. So maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but I'm a bit confused.

Moving on. The next peak is at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).
