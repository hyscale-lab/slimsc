Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Michael reaction, which I remember involves nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question has three parts, each a Michael addition reaction, and I need to find the products for each. Then I have to match them with the options A, B, C, D which have different product combinations.

First, let's break down each reaction.

Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol).

Hmm, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a strong electron source. It's a diester, so the enolate can form easily. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So, the Michael reaction here would involve the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacking the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, wait. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When deprotonated, the enolate would have a negative charge on the alpha carbon. The acrylate is the acceptor, so the enolate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. The structure of the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, the compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So, 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, let me draw it out.

Wait, the structure of methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait: acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be in the position of the alpha to the carbonyl. Oh wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So in the compound, the substituent is at the 3-position, meaning the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent (p-tolyl) is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, wait. The numbering might be different. Let me think: acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So, if it's 3-(p-tolyl), the substituent is on the third carbon. But wait, in that structure, the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or is it CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, probably the former.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Wait, that's but-3-enoate, maybe. No, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. The correct IUPAC name is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So 'acrylate' refers to the CH2=CHCOO- group. So the substituent is on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH
