Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think through each part carefully.

The problem is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options given are four different compounds, each with a specific structure. So, I need to analyze the given mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR data to determine which structure fits.

First, let me look at the mass spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%, and there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, that's interesting. The molecular ion peak is usually the molecular weight of the compound. So, the molecular weight is 156. The other peak might be a fragment or a possible isotope. Wait, the difference between 156 and 158 is 2 mass units. That often suggests the presence of a chlorine atom because chlorine has two main isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37. So, the molecular formula likely includes Cl. Let me think about how that would affect the molecular weight.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols, phenols, or maybe carboxylic acids. Oh wait, but waitâ€”carboxylic acids have a broad peak due to the -OH group. However, if the peak is very broad and around that region, another possibility is an aldehyde's O-H stretch, but I'm not sure. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a high wavenumber, which I think corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). The sharpness suggests maybe an ester or a ketone or a carboxylic acid? Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H and C=O. Let me think about their IR characteristics. Carboxylic acids usually show a very strong, broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm^-1, and a strong C=O around 1700 cm^-1. But wait, phenyl chloroformate is another possibility. Chloroformate has an ester group, which also shows a C=O peak around 1720-1750 cm^-1. So 1720 would fit an ester. But let me not get ahead of myself.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are:

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H)
- 8.02 ppm (d, 2H)
- 7.72 ppm (d, 2H)

So, 11 ppm is a singlet. That's really high. What gives a singlet around 11 ppm? Probably an aldehyde proton (RCHO), which usually appears around 9-10
