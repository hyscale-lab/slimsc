Okay, so I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance in this region. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Wait, but sometimes it's written with a constant factor, like plx = (some constant)/distance. But for the sake of this problem, maybe I can ignore the constant because I'm dealing with proportions here.

The problem states that the number of stars, let's call it N, varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, I can substitute plx with 1/d or something like that. Let's see: plx = k/d, where k is a constant. But when I'm dealing with proportionalities, constants can be ignored because we're only looking for how N scales with d.

So substituting plx with 1/d, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Simplifying that, the denominator becomes (1/d)^5 which is 1/(d^5). So taking reciprocal, it's d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the substitution.

Alternatively, let me think using substitution step by step. N = C * (1 / plx^5), where C is the
