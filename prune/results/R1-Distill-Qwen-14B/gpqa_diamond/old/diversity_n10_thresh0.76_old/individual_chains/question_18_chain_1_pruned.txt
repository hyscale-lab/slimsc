Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about stellar abundances. Hmm, let's see. The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with given masses and their elemental abundances. I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

Wait, the problem gives me some abundance ratios: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh, and the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7. 

I remember that the notation [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundance relative to the Sun. 

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So I think it's [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let's break it down. For each star, I can express the abundance of silicon in terms of other elements, using the given ratios.

Starting with Star_1. The [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means log(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = log_Sun(n_Si/n_Fe) + 0.3. But wait, wait. Wait, no. The [X/Y] notation is [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, so log(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 0.3 + log_Sun(n_Si/n_Fe).

But I don't know the Sun's [Si/Fe], but maybe I can get it from other data. Alternatively, maybe I can express everything relative to hydrogen, since the problem provides [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for the stars.

Right, let's look at the data again.

For the Sun:
12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = approx 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but I think the notation is [X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X/n_H)_sun. Wait no, the Sun's values are given as 12 + log(n_X/nH) equals some number. So wait, for the Sun, [X/H]_sun is zero because it's the base. So when the problem says [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means n_Fe/n_H in Star_1 is same as in the Sun. Oh wait, no, no. Wait, no: [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log_Sun(n_Fe/n_H). So if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log_Sun(n_Fe/n_H). So n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun. So in Star_1, the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Star_2's Mg/H is same as Sun.

So for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = 0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = 10^0 =1. Wait, but no. Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero by definition. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1) - log_Sun(n_Fe/n_H) =0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun. So in the same proportion as the Sun.

Wait, but the Sun's data is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5. So nFe/nH for Sun is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Star_1, [Fe/H]1=0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1)
