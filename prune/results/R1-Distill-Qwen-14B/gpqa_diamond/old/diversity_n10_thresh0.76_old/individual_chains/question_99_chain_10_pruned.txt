Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it one piece at a time.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to have a similar base structure but with varying substituents.

First, let's break down the given data.

FTIR Data:
- Very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Since this is an organic compound, O-H is more likely. The broadness suggests it's an -OH group, maybe in a carboxylic acid because those tend to have broad O-H stretches.
- Strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700, so this supports that idea.

1H NMR Data:
- No peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So, no double bonds or aromatic hydrogens. That narrows it down because all the options don't have any double bonds, so that's consistent.
- Two specific signals:
   - One is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let's think about splitting. How does that happen? It must be adjacent to multiple sets of neighboring protons. A quartet suggests splitting into four, maybe from coupling with three neighboring protons on a neighboring carbon. But then it's a triplet of quartets... I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's a CH group next to two different environments? Or perhaps a more complex coupling scenario, like being next to two different sets of protons. Let me thinkâ€”maybe it's a carbon that's attached to two different groups, each with their own sets of neighboring protons.
   - Another signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's even more complex. Maybe this proton is next to two different sets of neighboring protons, each causing their own splitting. Like if the proton is on a carbon that's adjacent to two different CH2 groups or something like that.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Breaking it down: The structure is probably something like a central CH connected to two ethyl groups and a CH2COOH group. Wait, no, let's see. Wait, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So, each CH is connected to an ethyl group and another CH which is connected to another ethyl group, then a CH2-COOH. So, the structure is maybe like (CH3)CH-C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH? No, wait, maybe it's more like two CH groups each attached to ethyl groups and another CH2 group leading to the COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
This would have a CH2CH3 group attached to a CH which is connected to a C2H5, then another CH connected to another C2H5, and then a COOH. Wait, so the structure is more like CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH? That would make it a four-carbon chain with a branch on each of the middle carbons.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
So, each CH is connected to a methyl group. So, maybe the structure is (CH3)2C-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the formula is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH. So each of the middle carbons has two methyl groups attached, perhaps? Or maybe each has a methyl and a CH group. Hmm, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3
