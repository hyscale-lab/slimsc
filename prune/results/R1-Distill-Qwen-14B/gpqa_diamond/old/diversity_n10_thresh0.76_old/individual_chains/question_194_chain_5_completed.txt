Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. So each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The partition function Z is what we're looking for. 

Wait, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? β is 1/(kT), so higher E gives lower weight. But in this problem, E is negative when the spins are aligned. Because J is probably positive, so when the product of spins is +1, that term contributes positively to E being negative. So lower energy when more pairs are aligned.

So each spin has two possible states, +1 or -1. Since there are three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. So I'll probably need to list all possible combinations or find a smarter way to compute the sum.

Hmm, but enumerating all 8 states might be manageable. Let's think about each possible state. Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3), each being +1 or -1.

Let me list all the possible states and compute the energy for each.

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ) ] = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ) ] = -J [1 -1 -1] = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) ) ] = -J [ (-1) +1 -1 ] = -J*(-1) = J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ) ] = -J [ (-1) + (-1) + 1 ] = -J*(-1) = J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) ) ] = -J [ (-1) -1 +1 ] = -J*(-1) = J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ) ] = -J [ (-1) +1 -1 ] = -J*(-1) = J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) ) ] = -J [1 -1 -1 ] = -J*(-1) = J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ) ] = -J [1 +1 +1] = -3J.

Wait, so looking at all the states, two of them have E = -3J, and the other six have E = J. 

Wait, that's interesting. So each of the two all-aligned states (all +1 or all -1) gives energy -3J. The other 6 states have two spins aligned and one opposite? Or wait, no, in each of those 6 states, how many pairs are aligned?

Wait, each triplet where at least two are aligned? Hmm, maybe that's another way to look at it. But looking at the energies, they all have E = J except when all three are aligned.

Wait, no. Let me recount the energies:

For state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Compute S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.

So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Multiply by -J: E = J*(-1) * (-1? Wait, wait, no. Wait the formula is E = - J (sum). So for state 2: sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Yes, correct.

So for each of the 6 states where not all spins are aligned, E is J. And for the two states where all are aligned, E is -3J.

So to compute the partition function Z, we sum exp(-βE) for each state.

Each state contributes a term of exp(β J) if E=J, or exp(3 β J) if E = -3J.

Wait, because E is -3J for two states, so exp(-β E) = exp(3β J).

And for the other six states, exp(-β E) = exp(-β (J)) = exp(-β J).

So Z = 2 * exp(3β J) + 6 * exp(-β J).

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 2 e^{-3Jβ} + 6 e^{Jβ}, which would be if E is +3J for two states. But wait, our E for all aligned is -3J, so exp(-β*(-3J)) = e^{3β J}.

So option A has 2 e^{-3Jβ}, which would be if E were 3J. But in our case, E is -3J for those two states.

So looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → No, because the first term should be e^{3Jβ}

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, that's what we have.

Wait, let me look again.

Yes, because two states contribute e^{3β J}, and six contribute e^{-β J}.

So Z=2 e^{3β J} +6 e^{-β J}, which is option B.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine the possible states and their energies**:  
   Each spin has two possible states, so there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) total states. For each state, the energy \( E \) is calculated using the given formula. The results are:
   - States where all spins are aligned (\( +1, +1, +1 \) or \( -1, -1, -1 \)): \( E = -3J \).
   - States where not all spins are aligned: \( E = J \).

   Thus, there are 2 states with \( E = -3J \) and 6 states with \( E = J \).

2. **Partition function definition**:  
   The partition function is \( Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E} \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Substituting the energies:
   - For the 2 states with \( E = -3J \): \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{3\beta J} \).
   - For the 6 states with \( E = J \): \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-\beta J} \).

   Therefore, \( Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J} \).

3. **Match with the options**:  
   Comparing \( Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J} \) with the given options:
   - **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as the first term has the wrong exponent.
   - **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) — Correct, matches the derived expression.
   - **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are wrong.
   - **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as the coefficients and exponents are wrong.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.
