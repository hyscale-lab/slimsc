Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. They’re in orbital resonance and have periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Wait, so the periods are in a specific proportion. 

The main thing asked is the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so albedo shouldn't affect the ratio. Oh right, albedo is the reflectivity; same value means it doesn't change the calculation between them.

Equilibrium temperature... I think the formula for equilibrium temperature of a planet is based on the inverse square law. The formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Oh right, equilibrium temperature is when the absorbed energy equals the emitted energy. So the formula is T = T_star * (L / (16πσ a² (1 - a)))^0.25, but when albedo a is the same for both planets, the a cancels out in the ratio. So perhaps it's easier to model it as T proportional to (1/a)^0.5, because the star's luminosity and other factors are the same for both.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) ). But since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - a) term is the same for both, so it cancels out in the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures would depend on sqrt( R/(2a) ). But wait, R is the star's radius, which is the same for both planets, so R/(2a) is proportional to 1/a. So T is proportional to sqrt(1/a), which is 1/sqrt(a). So the ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt(a2/a4). Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt
