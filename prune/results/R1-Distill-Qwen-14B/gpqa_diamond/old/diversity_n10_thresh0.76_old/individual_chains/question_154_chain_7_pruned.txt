Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The options given are four different organic compounds, and I need to match the spectral information provided to one of them.

First, let's go through each piece of data step by step.

The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's another peak at m/z 158, which is 32%. Hmm, I remember that molecular ion peaks can sometimes be accompanied by isotopic peaks. Chlorine has a significant isotopic abundance, right? So if there's a Cl in the molecule, we might see a molecular ion peak and then a peak around 2-3 m/z higher because Cl has an atomic weight of about 35. So the molecular ion is at 156, and the next peak is 158. That suggests a Cl in the molecule because Cl has two main isotopes: about 75% at 35 and 25% at 37. So the molecular formula probably includes a Cl atom.

Wait, let me calculate. The molecular weight is 156. If the molecular formula is C8H5ClO3, let's see: C is 12*8=96, H is 5 (so 5), Cl is 35.5, O is 16*3=48. Adding up: 96+5=101, plus 35.5 is 136.5, plus 48 is 184.5. That's too high. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the formula has a Cl and some other atoms.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula is C7H5ClO3. Let's see: 7*12=84, 5 H=5, Cl=35.5, O=3*16=48. Total is 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +48=172.5. Still not matching. Hmm, perhaps the formula is something else. Or perhaps I'm not looking in the right direction.

Wait, the molecular ion is 156. Let's see the options:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The formula for benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl, it becomes C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5 (Cl), 2*16=32. So total is 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. Oh, wait, but in the molecular ion, it's at 156. So maybe it's 156.5, but in the molecular ion, it's rounded or perhaps the exact formula is C7H6ClO2? Let me see, 7*12=84, 6 H=6, Cl=35.5, O=2*16=32. Sum is 84+6=90 +35.5=125.5 +32=157.5. Hmm, doesn't match. So perhaps the molecular formula for option B is C7H6ClO2, with a molecular weight of approximately 157.5. But the molecular ion is 156. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D. Let me check each one.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The formula would be C7H6ClO2. Let's calculate: 7*12
