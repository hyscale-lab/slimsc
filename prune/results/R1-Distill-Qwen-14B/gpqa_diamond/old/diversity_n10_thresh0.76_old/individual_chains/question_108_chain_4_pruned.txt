Alright, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, okay, I need to think through this step by step.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. Oh wait, m is the magnetic quantum number, right? So m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, but wait, no, for s orbitals, m is 0, p has m up to ±1, d up to ±2, etc. But the problem says small values of m, so maybe m=0 or m=±1.

The question is to compare the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the Hamiltonian term due to the magnetic field, with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition has a wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm. That's the Balmer series, I think. Because 0.486 micrometers is about 486 nm, which is the Balmer-alpha line, the transition from n=2 to n=1, but wait, wait, no: wait, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. Oh wait, the Balmer-alpha line is from n=3 to n=2, right? Wait, wait. Let me think. The Balmer series is when an electron transitions to the n=2 level. The wavelengths are given by 1/λ = R*(1/(2²) - 1/n²), where n>2. So the Balmer-alpha is n=3 to n=2, giving λ ≈ 656 nm. Wait, but the given λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 486 nm. That's the Balmer-beta line, which is n=4 to n=2, giving a wavelength around 486 nm. So ΔE is the energy difference for that transition.

So first, I need to find the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ and compare it with ΔE.

Paramagnetic coupling term usually refers to the Zeeman effect, where an atom is placed in a magnetic field, causing the splitting of energy levels due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external field. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, μ = -gμ_B m_s * something? Wait, the magnetic moment is given by μ = (e/(2m)) * (L + 2S) or something like that. Hmm, for orbital magnetic quantum number m, perhaps the interaction is H = μ_B m B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, the orbital Zeeman term is H = -μ_B m B, but wait, no—since the magnetic dipole moment μ for orbital angular momentum L is μ = (e/(2m)) L, so H = -μ · B. Since B is along Oz, μ · B = μ_z * B = (e/(2m)) (m) B, because L_z = mħ. So H = -(e/(2
