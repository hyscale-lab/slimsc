Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, it's a conjugate addition.

Looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate are the reactants, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can enolize easily. The other compound is the alpha-beta unsaturated esterâ€”so it's the Michael acceptor.

In the Michael addition, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) will attack the beta position of the acceptor. The acceptor here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of that is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, wait. No, wait, the structure is more like CH2-C(O)OCH3 attached to a p-tolyl group. Let me draw this out.

Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(O)OCH3 with the E configuration, but the substituents would be on the same side or opposite? No, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3? No, wait: (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO2R. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO2Me, but with the double bond between the first and second carbons. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, which is the same as the carbonyl carbon. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C-O-Me, but with a p-tolyl group on the CH2 or CH part. Oh, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCO2Me? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the CH2. Wait, no, the substituent is on the acrylate part. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't fit.
