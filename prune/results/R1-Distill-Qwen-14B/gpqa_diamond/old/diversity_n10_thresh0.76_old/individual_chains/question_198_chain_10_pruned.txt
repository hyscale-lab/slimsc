Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1, β2, β3, β4 are 9, 40, 63, 16 respectively. The options are percentages, so I need to find which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the complexes with higher β will dominate.

The problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands attached. But wait, which complex is that? The complexes are Co(SCN)n^2- where n can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the blue one is probably the one with two SCN ligands, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's another n value. Wait, I should probably clarify.

Wait, from what I remember, Co(II) thiocyanate complexes have different colors. The [Co(SCN)]^− is pink, [Co(SCN)₂]^2− is blue, [Co(SCN)₃]^3− is green, and [Co(SCN)₄]^4− is brown. So the blue one is the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^2−. So that's the one we need to find the percentage of.

So the question is, what fraction of all cobalt species is the [Co(SCN)₂]^2− complex?

To find this, I think I need to calculate the concentrations of each possible complex, find which one is the second one (the dithiocyanato), and then sum them all to get the total cobalt, then take the ratio.

Wait, but how do stability constants work here. Oh right, each β is the formation constant for the complex with that number of ligands. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^−, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2−, β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]^3−, and β4 for [Co(SCN)₄]^4−.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex in the solution. The total concentration of Co(II) is given as 1e-2 M, but since the solution is in equilibrium with the thiocyanate, I think we can model this using the formation constants.

Wait, but when dealing with multiple complexes, I think the distribution of species can be found by considering the fraction of each complex relative to the others. So, perhaps I can use the conditional formation constants or the method of successive approximations.

Alternatively, I think the problem can be approached by considering the formation of each complex in
