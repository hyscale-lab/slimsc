Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the resolution needed in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed in the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are all different lengths, so I think it's about the minimum distance the particles have to travel so that we can detect the decay.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. Oh right, so the actual lifetime τ observed in the lab frame (where the particle is moving) is longer than τ₀. The formula for time dilation is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = E/(m c²). Since E is the total energy, and here it's given as 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV.

So first, I should calculate γ. Let me note down the variables:

Energy E = 27 GeV
Mass m = 3.41 GeV

So γ = E / (m c²). Wait, but since E and m are in GeV and GeV/c² respectively, perhaps I don't need to worry about the actual c² because the units are already accounted for in the energy and mass. So γ = E / m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917. Let me double-check that: 3.41 *7 =23.87, 3.41*7.9=27.01, yes, so approximately 7.917.

So γ is roughly 7.917. So the lifetime τ is γ * τ₀ = 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.917 *8 is around 63.336, so τ ≈63.336e-16 s, which is 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Now, the next part is about the decay and the distance the particles travel. The distance L that the particles travel before decaying is L = v * τ. But wait, I don't have v directly. I can find v in terms of γ and beta (β), since β = v/c. And we know that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Alternatively, since γ is known, perhaps I can find β.

Alternatively, I remember that for high-energy particles, the relation between energy, mass, and momentum
