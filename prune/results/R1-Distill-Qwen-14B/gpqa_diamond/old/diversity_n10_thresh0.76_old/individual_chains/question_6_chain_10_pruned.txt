Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the energy spectrum of a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially for central potentials, it's often helpful to separate the problem into radial and angular parts. So maybe I should try to express this potential in terms that separate r and θ. Let me see.

The given potential has two terms. The first is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator term because it's proportional to r squared. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Oh, I know that cos²θ can be rewritten using a double-angle identity. Cos squared theta equals (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So let me substitute that in.

So the second term becomes (3/2)kr² * (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Let me calculate that: (3/2)*(1/2) is 3/4. So that term is (3/4)kr² (1 + cos(2θ)). 

Wait, but that would mean the potential now splits into two parts: the first term is (1/2)kr², and the second part is (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos(2θ). So V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos(2θ). 

Wait, let me compute the constants. 1/2 plus 3/4 is (2/4 + 3/4) = 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos(2θ). Hmm, but maybe I should factor out kr². So V(r,θ) = kr² [ (5/4) + (3/4) cos(2θ) ].

Wait, but perhaps that's complicating things. Another approach: perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of a shifted harmonic oscillator plus an angular-dependent term. Alternatively, maybe it's a product of functions in r and θ, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe
