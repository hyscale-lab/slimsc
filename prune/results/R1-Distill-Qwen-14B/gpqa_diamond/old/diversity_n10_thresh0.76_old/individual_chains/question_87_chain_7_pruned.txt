Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says: I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, let's break this down. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, so it has two substituents. The total carbons are 8, so the benzene ring contributes 6 carbons. That leaves 2 more carbons from substituents. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the benzene is 6 carbons, but the substituents add up to 2 more. So each substituent might be one carbon? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and another is none? Wait, no, di-substituted means two substituents. Oh, but wait, di-substituted benzene has two substituents attached. So the substituents must account for 2 carbons in total. Because 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8. So each substituent is probably a single carbon, but maybe one is more than one carbon. Let me think.

Wait, no, maybe each substituent is a single atom or a group that has one carbon. For example, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like -CO-) and another is a halogen, like -Cl. Because the FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, so that's Cl attached to the ring.

Wait, but wait. The substituents: the ring is 6 carbons. The substituents must account for 2 more carbons because 6 + 2 = 8. So each substituent must contribute one carbon each, or perhaps one substituent is a two-carbon group and the other is nothing. But no, di-substituted implies two substituents.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Wait, but a carbonyl group is O=C-, which is a substituent attached to the ring, which would take one carbon. The halogen (like Cl
