Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

Alright, let's read the question carefully. There are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, effective temperature 6300 K. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. They detected the planets using transit and radial velocity methods. 

The question is about the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. The options are A to D.

I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. The formula, I think, is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4), but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play. So the equilibrium temperature is determined by the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo.

But wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo. So that factor will cancel out when taking the ratio. Good, that simplifies things.

So first, I need to find the equilibrium temperature for each planet. The formula I think is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( (R_star) / (2a) ) * ( (L_star)/(4πσ a²) )^(1/4) )? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the star's luminosity. The star's luminosity is given by L = 4πR_star²σ T_star^4. So the flux at the planet's location is L/(4πa²) = σ T_star^4 (R_star²/a²). So the planet absorbs that, and then re-radiates as a blackbody, so:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The incident flux is L/(4πa²) = σ T_eff^4 (R_star^2 / a^2). The planet's cross-section is π R_planet², and it's blackbody emission is σ Te^4. The energy balance is:

Incoming flux * cross-section * (1 - albedo) = outgoing flux * surface area.

So:

(L/(4πa²)) * (π R_p²) * (1 - A) = 4π R_p² σ Te^4

Simplify: (L/(4πa²)) * (1 - A) = 4 σ Te^4

But L is 4π R_star² σ T_star^4. So substituting:

(4π R_star² σ T_star^4)/(4π a²) * (1 - A) = 4 σ Te^4

Simplify:

(R_star² T_star^4 σ) / a² * (1 - A) = 4 σ Te^4

Cancel σ on both sides:

(R_star² T_star^4) (1 - A) / a² = 4 Te^4

Take the fourth root:

Te = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

But wait, both planets have the same albedo, so (1 - A) is the same for both. So when taking the ratio, that factor cancels out. That's good.

So the ratio of Te1 to Te2 is sqrt( (R1/(2a1)) / (R2/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( (R1 a2)/(R2 a1) )

Wait, because Te is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a) ). Oh wait, no, R_star is the star's radius, which is the same for both planets. So R_star cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio of Te1 to Te2 is sqrt( (1/(2a1)) / (1/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, because (1/(2a1)) divided by (1/(2a2)) is (a2/a1). So sqrt(a2/a1) is the ratio.

So the ratio Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So now I need to find a1 and a2, the semi-major axes of the two planets.

But how do I find a1 and a2? The question gives some data about the Doppler shifts. Oh, right, the radial velocity method gives the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The RV shift is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period and the star's mass.

Hmm, the problem states that Planet1 induces a shift up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, and Planet2 induces a shift up to 0.04 Å. Oh, wait, I think the RV method measures the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star.

The Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, approximately. But in terms of velocity, v = (c) * (delta_lambda / lambda). But wait, delta lambda is the change in wavelength. So v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda)

But wait, I think the actual formula for radial velocity is v = (lambda_observed - lambda_rest)/lambda_rest * c, but I might have this backwards. Wait, no: when the star moves towards us, the wavelength is blueshifted (smaller wavelength). So delta_lambda is (observed - rest) divided by rest, multiplied by c.

Wait, but the formula is v = (delta_lambda) / lambda * c, but I might have to be careful about the sign. Since the star is moving towards us, the shift is negative; but the magnitude is what's important
