Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle detectors and Lorentz factors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds, with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters.

Wait, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead of one third. So I need to find the new gamma (Lorentz factor) that changes the fraction from 1/3 to 2/3.

I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The time it takes for the particles to reach the detector's walls depends on their speed and the distance they need to travel. Since they're moving at such high speeds, their lifetime is longer, allowing more of them to reach the walls before decaying.

The original scenario has a Lorentz factor of gamma1 = 20. The fraction reaching the walls is 1/3. Let's denote gamma2 as the new Lorentz factor we're looking for, which should give a fraction of 2/3.

I think the fraction that reach the walls is related to the ratio of the proper lifetime (tau) to the dilated lifetime (gamma*tau). Wait, but actually, the time the particles have before decaying is gamma multiplied by their proper lifetime. The time they take to reach the detector walls is the distance divided by their velocity. Since they're moving at near light speed, v is approximately c.

Let me try to model this. The proper lifetime is tau. The lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma * tau.

The time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is t = R / v, where R is the radius of the detector (30 m) and v is the particle's speed. Since v is near c, we can approximate v ≈ c. So t ≈ R / c.

The number of particles that reach the wall is the fraction that decay after time t. So the fraction is the probability that the lifetime T is greater than t. Since the decay follows an exponential distribution, the probability is exp(-t/(gamma * tau)).

Wait, but wait. The decay probability is P = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). But in the problem, the fraction that reaches the wall is the fraction that hasn't decayed by time t. So that's exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

In the original case, one third of the particles reach the walls. So exp(-t/(gamma1 tau)) = 1/3.

In the new case, we want exp(-t/(gamma2 tau)) = 2/3.

Hmm, so let's write the equations.

Case 1:
exp(-t/(gamma1 tau)) = 1/3
Taking natural log on both sides:
-t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(1/3)
Which is:
t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(3)
So tau = t/(gamma1 ln(3))

Case 2:
exp(-t/(gamma2 tau)) = 2/3
Take ln:
-t/(gamma2 tau) = ln(2/3)
Multiply both sides by -1:
t/(gamma2 tau) = -ln(2/3) = ln(3/2)
Because ln(1/x) = -ln x.

So from case 1, tau = t/(gamma1 ln(3)). Substitute this into the equation for case 2:

t/(gamma2 * [t/(gamma1 ln(3)) ]) ) = ln(3/2)
Simplify numerator and denominator:
The t's cancel. So (1)/(gamma2 * [1/(gamma1 ln3)]) ) = ln(3/2)
Which is (gamma1 ln3) / gamma2 = ln(3/2)

So rearranging:

gamma2 = gamma1 * (ln3) / (ln(3/2))

Let me compute ln3 and ln(3/2).

ln3 is about 1.0986.

ln(3/2) is ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055.

So gamma2 ≈ 20 * (1.0986) / 0.4055.

Let me compute that. 1.0986 / 0.4055 is approximately 2.708.

20 multiplied by 2.708 is about 54.16.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the logic. The fraction that reach is exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So with a
