Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound X, which has the formula C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to figure out what X was. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, wait. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent. Oh right, it's used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Epoxidation is the process of forming an epoxide. So compound X probably has a double bond that's being epoxidized. So X is an alkene, and the product is an epoxide.

Let me think about the reaction. Sharpless epoxidation forms an epoxide from an allylic alcohol, but wait, no. Wait, actually, the Sharpless epoxidation typically targets an epoxide formation from a diene. Or wait, no. Sharpless is for epoxidizing epoxides from epoxide formation from dienes. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually part of the conditions for the Prilezhaev oxidation? Or maybe it's for the epoxidation using other reagents. Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the product's NMR.

Let me look at the NMR data given for the product.

1H NMR:
δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, there are two singlets for 3H each. These are probably methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split them. Maybe they're attached to carbonyls or something else that doesn't cause splitting. Alternatively, maybe they're on a benzene ring as para substituents, but then they would typically be as multiple of a certain coupling. But since they're singlets, perhaps they're attached to something else.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.75 is a doublet (1H), 7.08 is a doublet of 2H, then 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, perhaps two doublets in the aromatic region. This suggests a para-substituted benzene, because the coupling between the two sets of doublets would be consistent with that. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted styrene or something similar.

Wait, the 13C NMR data:

δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Hmm, the carbons here. Let's see. The 197.7 is a carbonyl, probably an epoxide. Because epoxide carbons are usually around 140-160, but wait, wait, no, the epoxide oxygen is connected to two carbons. Oh, wait, maybe the 197 is a carbonyl group, like a ketone. But wait, the product is from epoxidation, so the epoxide would have two new carbons. Hmm, maybe I should think about the position of the epoxide.

Wait, in epoxide, each oxygen is connected to two carbons. So in the 13C NMR, we should see two carbons that are part of the epoxide, each probably around 60-70 ppm, but I might be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the 197 is a carbonyl from another group, but then I'm confused.

Wait, another thought. The 197.7 is a very high chemical shift. That's more typical of a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. But in an epoxide, the carbons are usually around 50-70. So wait, the product is an epoxide, right? Because the reagent is for epoxidation. So why is there a carbonyl? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the reaction isn't epoxidation. Or perhaps I'm misremembering the reagent. Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane used for? Oh, right! It's used in the Sharpless epoxidation, which forms epoxides from epoxide precursors, typically vicinal diols. Wait, no, the Sharpless epoxidation forms epoxides from epoxides, but wait, no. Oh, wait, no, the Sharpless epoxidation is for epoxidizing double bonds. Oh, right! So the starting material has a double bond, and the reagent helps form an epoxide.

So the
