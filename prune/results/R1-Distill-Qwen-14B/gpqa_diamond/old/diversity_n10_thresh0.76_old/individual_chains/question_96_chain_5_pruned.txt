Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 1e-17 degrees. The distance is d = 1e10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, with various exponents of 10.

First, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Oh right, so I need to find the area A.

The event horizon is a sphere, so the area is 4πr², where r is the Schwarzschild radius. The Schwarzschild radius R_s is (2 G M)/c². But wait, maybe I don't need to find the mass directly. Alternatively, the area A can be related to the angular size θ and the distance d.

Wait, the angular size θ is given, which is the apparent size as seen from Earth. θ is small, so I can approximate θ in radians as approximately equal to the ratio of the size of the object (which is 2R, the diameter of the event horizon) over the distance d. So θ ≈ (2 R_s) / d.

Wait, R_s is (2 G M)/(c²), so the diameter is 2 R_s = (4 G M)/(c²). So substituting into θ, we get θ ≈ (4 G M)/(c² d).

Alternatively, maybe I can express the radius R_s in terms of θ and d. Since θ is in radians, R_s ≈ (θ * d)/2. Because the angular size θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size divided by the distance. So for a sphere, the radius R is half of the diameter, so maybe R_s ≈ (θ * d) / 2.

Wait, let me think again. The angular diameter θ is given, which for small angles is equal to the diameter divided by the distance. So θ ≈ (2 R_s) / d.

So rearranging, R_s = (θ d) / 2. Wait, is that right? Because 2 R_s is the diameter, so θ ≈ (2 R_s)/d. So solving for R_s, R_s = (θ d) / 2. Yeah, that makes sense.

So R_s = (θ d) / 2.

But wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. θ is in degrees, and d is in parsecs. I need to convert θ to radians. Because the small angle approximation in radians is θ ≈ opposite / adjacent. But if θ is given in degrees, I should convert it to radians first.

So θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). Let me calculate that.

θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees.

θ_rad =
