Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. Let me read it again.

The particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. Oh wait, I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. The operator we're interested in is 10σz +5σx. We need to find the expectation value of this operator, up to one decimal place.

Hmm, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. The formula for expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the state vector.

So, I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩. Let's break this down into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ and 5⟨σx⟩.

Wait, the operator is a sum, so the expectation is the sum of the expectations. So I can compute each expectation separately and then add them multiplied by their coefficients.

First, I'll find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, it should be easy. The state is a linear combination, so when I calculate ⟨σz⟩, it's the sum of the probabilities times their respective eigenvalues.

Let me compute the coefficients first. The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me make sure these are normalized. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1. So (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So yes, the state is normalized, which is good.

So for σz, the eigenvalues for |↑⟩ is +1, and for |↓⟩ is -1. So ⟨σz⟩ is (0.5)^2 *1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that.

(0.5)^2 is 0.25, times 1 is 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4), times -1 is -3/4, which is -0.75. So 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Then, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. Oh wait, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But since our state is expressed in the σz basis, I need to compute the expectation value ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.
