Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says we have two planets orbiting a star. Both detection methods, transit and RV, found them. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Wait, but the effective temperature is probably for the star itself, not the planets. Ok, so the star's Teff is 6300 K, but the planets' temperatures are what we're after.

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. Interesting, so maybe the orbital periods can be found from the RV data.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. I remember the equilibrium temperature formula. It's something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25 / ( (1 + e)^(0.5) ) ), but since e is zero (they are circular orbits), that part goes away. Oh wait, so it's T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. And since both have the same albedo, A cancels out in the ratio.

So the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ), which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1). Because R_star cancels, 2 cancels too, so sqrt(a2/a1) is the ratio.

Wait, but how do I find the semi-major axes a1 and a2? Oh, because the RV method gives the mass and the semi-major axis. Wait, no, RV gives the mass function, which depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination, and the semi-major axis. But since both planets are detected via RV, perhaps I can find their semi-major axes from the Doppler shifts.

Wait, the problem gives the Doppler shift for each planet. For Planet1, a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 0.04 Å. The forbidden line is at 6300 Å, so the shift is in the wavelength of this line.

I think the RV shift (Doppler shift) is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us. But I'm a bit hazy on the exact formula.

Wait, another approach. The RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term is 1. Also, M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ (2π G/(P))^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But I don't know the periods P. Hmm, but maybe I can relate it to the semi-major axis. From Kepler's third law, P² = (4π²/(G(M_star + M_p)) ) a³. Again, M_p is negligible, so P² = (4π²/(G M_star)) a³.

So substituting P into K's formula: K ≈ (2π G/( (4π²/(G M_star)) a³ )^(1/2) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)/(M_star^(2/3)) )

Wait, let me re-calculate:

P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star) → P = (4 π² a³/(G M_star))^(1/2) )

Then, plug into K:

K = (2π G / P
