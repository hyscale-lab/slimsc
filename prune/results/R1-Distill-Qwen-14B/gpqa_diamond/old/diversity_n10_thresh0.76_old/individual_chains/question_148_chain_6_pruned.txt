Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's see what we've got here. The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five of them. The problem describes several substances A1 to A5 and their reactions, and I need to find the molecular weight range of A4. Hmm, this might take a while, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let's list out what each substance does.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the degree of fluorination, maybe) of A2 is 31.96%. So A2 has about 31.96% fluorine by mass. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. That suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, probably in a high oxidation state.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is probably the most common or initial fluoride of Y. Maybe something like YF₂ or YF₃, depending on Y's valency.

When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

Wait, let me think about the elements here. Fluorine is involved, so Y is another element forming binary compounds with F. We have five such compounds, so Y could be something that forms multiple fluorides. Common elements that form several fluorides include oxygen (but that's not a binary compound with fluorine), maybe chlorine? No, that's a halogen. Alternatively, perhaps sulfur or maybe another element.

Wait, wait. Let me think of elements that form multiple fluorides. Let's think about the possibilities. For example, lead forms several fluorides: PbF2, PbF4. Or maybe something like tin, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an element with multiple oxidation states, like vanadium, but I'm not sure if vanadium forms five fluorides.

Wait, maybe Y is oxygen? Because oxygen forms OF2 and O2F2, but that might not reach five. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Y is chlorine? But chlorine's fluorides are CF4, but that's only one or two, I think. Not enough.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is a non-metal that forms multiple fluorides, such as sulfur. Sulfur can form SF4, SF6, maybe others? But how many? Let me think: SF2, SF4, SF6, maybe others. But that's three. Not five. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is an element that can form various polyatomic fluorides. Alternatively, perhaps it's an element that forms multiple binary ionic fluorides. For example, sodium forms NaF, but that's only one. Wait, maybe transition metals. For example, molybdenum? Or perhaps it's an element like iodine, which can form IF5, IF7, but again, not five.

Wait, another possibility is that Y is a noble gas.
