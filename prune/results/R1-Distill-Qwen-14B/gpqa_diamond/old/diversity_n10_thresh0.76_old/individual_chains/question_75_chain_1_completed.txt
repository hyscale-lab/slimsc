Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and transgenic mice. Let me try to think through it step by step.

So the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They modified the gene to include a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with the plasmid using Lipofectamine and are selecting antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they start testing, they can't overexpress the protein as expected. They look at the plus strand sequence and find an issue.

The options are about different possible reasons why the protein isn't being expressed. Let me think about each option.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. HA is a short peptide, so a mutation could cause the tag not to work. But if the problem is in the HA sequence, perhaps the purification won't work, but maybe the gene is expressed but the protein isn't detectable. But the problem here is overexpression isn't happening, so maybe it's more about expression than detection. Hmm.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. If the coding sequence has a stop codon earlier, the ribosome might terminate before making the full protein. Looking at the sequence, I should check for in-frame stop codons.

Option C: No linker, so proteolysis. If the HA tag is directly fused without a linker, maybe the protease in the cell is cleaving it. But I'm not sure if that would prevent expression entirely. Maybe the protein is getting cut, but perhaps it's expressed but not detected. Alternatively, if the HA tag is missing, the purification wouldn't work. But the question is about being unable to overexpress, not about detection.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Mouse cells have all standard tRNAs, I think. UAA is a stop codon, but if there's a UAA in the coding sequence, the ribosome would stop. Wait, but in the given sequence, is there a UAA?

Wait, the sequence they provided is the plus strand. So it's the coding (sense) strand. Let me look for any in-frame stop codons. The coding sequence starts with ATG (which is the start). Let me scan through the sequence.

Looking at the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... etc.

Wait, the first codon is ATG, which is methionine, start. Then TAC is tyrosine. Then CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine again. GAT is aspartate, G is next. Let's see, I'll go through some more codons.

Wait, looking for any stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA). Let's see:

Looking through the sequence:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGC...

Wait, at some point, looking for TGA or TAA or TAG.

Looking at the end, wait: after the HA tag, the start should be the GADD45G coding sequence. Wait, but wait, the beginning is the HA tag. So the first part is the HA sequence. Let me think about that.

Wait, the construct is modified to include the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the sequence starts with the HA coding sequence, followed by GADD45G.

Wait, perhaps I should check the end of the HA sequence. Let me look for the end of the HA tag. HA is a small peptide, maybe about 11 amino acids, so the coding sequence would be about 33 nucleotides.

Looking at the beginning:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... so HA's coding sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G..., which is the start. So the first 30 or so nucleotides are the HA.

Now, after that, the GADD45G coding sequence begins. So let's look for any stop codons in the HA part or in the rest.

Wait, looking at the HA coding sequence:

The first codon is ATG (start), then TAC (tyr), CCA (pro), TAC (tyr), GAT (asp), GTA (val), TCC (ser), AGA (arg), TCG (ser), CGG (arg), etc. Wait, wait. Let me write out the first few codons:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TCG CGG CCA GGAC...

Wait, looking for any TGA or TAA or TAG.

Wait, the 9th codon is AGA (which is arginine), next is TCG (serine), then CGG (arginine), then CCA (proline). Not seeing any stop codons in the HA region.

But wait, looking at the entire sequence, perhaps there's a TGA somewhere. Let me scan for TGA.

Looking through the sequence:

Looking for T G A in the same triplet.

Looking at the sequence:

...CTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGC...

Wait, in the middle, I see 'GGA', 'AGA', 'GTC', 'CGG', etc. Hmm, not seeing a TGA right away. Let me check further.

Wait, what about the end? The sequence ends with ...GAGAGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, the last few codons before the end:

...CAG CAG CGG GCG GAC CTT GCA CTG CAT CCT CAT TTC GAA CCC CAA CGA GGC CCG GCT TGG AGA AGC TCA GC CAG CGT TAA CGA CTT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA CCCC CCG AG TGA

Wait, the last part: ...TGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh! So the entire construct ends with TGA. Which would cause the ribosome to stop right there.

So the problem is that the last codon is a TGA, which is a stop. Therefore, the construct is ending with TGA, which is a stop codon, so the ribosome terminates early.

Wait, but that's in the plus strand. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure.

Wait, the plus strand is the coding (sense) strand. So the sequence given is the same as the mRNA would be, except that mRNA is complementary.

Wait, no. The plasmid's plus strand is the same as the coding strand. So the mRNA is synthesized from the template (negative) strand, which would be complementary to the plus strand. So in the plus strand, the sequence is 5' to 3' as given.

So if the plus strand ends with ...AG TGA, then the mRNA would have ...AGA UAA, because the mRNA is synthesized as complementary. Wait, no. Wait, the coding sequence is in the plus strand, so when the mRNA is made, it's a copy of the template (negative) strand, which is complementary to the plus.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the plus strand is the same as the mRNA sequence, except that mRNA is synthesized from the template (negative) strand. So the plus strand's sequence is the same as the mRNA, except that the mRNA is in the same direction as the plus strand but in RNA form. Wait, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that the construct's coding sequence is in the same direction as the plus strand. So the plus strand has the ATG start and the coding sequence. So any TGA in the plus strand's coding sequence would be a TGA codon in the mRNA, leading to a stop.

Wait, the mRNA is complementary to the template (negative) strand. So the plus strand's sequence is the same as the mRNA, except that RNA is U instead of T.

Wait, no. Let's clarify.

The plus strand is the same as the mRNA's sequence, except for T vs U. So if the plus strand has a TGA, then the mRNA would have UAG, which is a stop codon.

Wait, no. Wait, the mRNA is synthesized from the template (negative) strand, which is complementary to the plus strand. So if the plus strand has TGA, the template would have CAT (since DNA is double-stranded: plus is TGA, minus is CAT). So the mRNA is complementary to the template, which would be UAG (since mRNA is synthesized as a copy of the template, but RNA uses U instead of T).

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again: the construct's coding sequence is in the plus strand. So the DNA has the coding strand as plus. To transcribe mRNA, the RNA polymerase goes along the template (minus) strand, which is complementary to the plus. So the mRNA is a copy of the minus strand, but in RNA, so the mRNA sequence is the same as the plus strand but with T replaced by U.

Wait, no. Let me take an example: plus strand is ATG, the minus is CAT. The mRNA would be AUG, because it's complementary to the minus.

Wait, if plus is ATG, minus is CAT. mRNA is AUG, which is the start codon.

So, in the plus strand, if there's a TGA, the mRNA would be UAG, which is a stop codon.

So in the provided sequence, I see that it ends with ...GAGTGA3'. So the last part is ...GAG TGA, meaning the last codon is TGA in the plus strand. So the mRNA would have ...AGA UAG, which is a stop. So the construct has a stop codon at the end.

Wait, but why is that a problem? Well, the construct is supposed to have the HA tag followed by GADD45G. If the last codon is a TGA, then the mRNA would have a stop codon before the end, causing the ribosome to terminate prematurely. Wait, but the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the HA is followed by GADD45G. So if the HA is correctly placed, the GADD45G coding sequence should follow, ending with the proper stop codon.

Wait, but looking at the provided sequence, it ends with TGA, which is a stop. So the actual coding sequence for the protein would have HA followed by GADD45G, but if the mRNA ends with TGA, the ribosome would stop right there, making a truncated protein. Or perhaps the entire protein is not made because the early stop is before the end.

Wait, but how does the mRNA know where to stop? The ribosome reads from the start codon until the first stop codon. So if the construct ends with TGA in the coding sequence, that would be a stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early, not producing the full-length protein.

So in the given plus strand, the coding sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So the mRNA will have a UAG, leading to termination.

But wait, why is the TGA there? Because the construct was created with the HA tag, followed by GADD45G. So perhaps the HA tag was inserted without considering the reading frame, or the HA tag's sequence inadvertently introduced a stop codon.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide. Let me recall, HA is from the influenza virus. The coding sequence for HA is usually around 30 nucleotides. So in the given sequence, the first 30 or so nucleotides are the HA tag. Then the rest should be GADD45G. But if the last codon of the entire construct is TGA, that would introduce a premature stop.

So in the provided plus strand, the last codon is TGA. So the mRNA would have a UAG, which is a stop codon. Hence, the ribosome would stop at that point, meaning the GADD45G gene isn't fully expressed. So the construct is faulty because it introduces a premature stop codon.

Looking at the options, option B says "The ribosome terminated the translation early." If the mRNA has a stop codon in the middle, that's exactly what would happen. So the protein isn't overexpressed because it's not being made in full; perhaps the HA tag is okay, but the rest is cut short.

Another possibility is option D: the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. But UAA is another stop codon. However, the stop codon here is TGA, which doesn't require a specific tRNA because stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. So option D is probably not the issue.

So the main issue seems to be the presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate early. That's option B.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, fused to an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag, fails to overexpress the protein. The provided plus strand sequence of the construct is analyzed to determine the issue.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   A missense mutation in the HA tag could prevent proper detection or purification of the protein. However, the issue here is the lack of overexpression, not detection. This option does not explain why the protein is not being expressed at all.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   Upon examining the sequence, the last codon is **TGA**, which is a stop codon. This would cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing the full-length protein (HA tag + GADD45G) from being synthesized. This aligns with the observation of failed overexpression.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   While a linker sequence might prevent proteolysis, this would not completely prevent protein expression. The issue here is that the protein is not being expressed at all, which points to a problem upstream, such as a premature stop codon.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   Stop codons like TGA, TAA, and TAG are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. Therefore, the absence of a tRNA for UAA is irrelevant to this situation.

### Conclusion:
The presence of the stop codon **TGA** at the end of the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing the full-length protein from being synthesized. This explains the failure to overexpress the protein.

**Answer: B**
