Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying compound D based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are several steps, so I'll take it one at a time.

First, let's look at compound A. The proton NMR data shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet means each is next to three.

So for the triplet at 0.9 ppm, that's usually indicative of a methyl group adjacent to another CH2. Like, maybe a (CH2CH3) group? Or perhaps two methyl groups attached to a CH2. Wait, the integral is 6H, which is two sets of three H. Maybe two ethyl groups? Let me think: ethyl groups have a triplet for the CH2 next to the CH3. Wait, no, the CH3 would be a triplet, and the CH2 would be a quartet. Oh wait, but in our case, the triplet is for 6H. So two CH3 groups each as triplets? Or maybe each CH3 is part of a larger structure.

Wait, if we have two ethyl groups (each CH2CH3), each CH2 would be a quartet. But the given quartet is 4H, which would align with two CH2 groups. Oh, that makes sense! So the triplet (6H) is two sets of CH3, each attached to a CH2. The quartet (4H) would be two CH2 groups. So the structure is likely (CH2CH3)2 something. What's the something? Maybe connected via an oxygen? Like diethyl ether? But diethyl ether's structure is CH2CH2OCH2CH3, but wait that's not possible because oxygen can only have two substituents. Oh wait, diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. Let me think about the structure.

In diethyl ether, each ethyl group is attached to an oxygen. So the structure is CH2CH2-O-CH
