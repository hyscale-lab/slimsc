Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these synthesis problems can get tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts with the compound 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo structures are like bridged bicyclic compounds. The [2.2.1] part means there are three bridgeheads—each bridge has 2, 2, and 1 carbons. So, the structure is norbornene, right? The substituent is tert-butoxy at the 7 position. So, the starting material is a norbornene derivative with an oxygen substituent.

Next, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Hmm, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and when combined with, say, dibromides, perhaps it's an elimination or substitution reaction. Wait, but there's also 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups on carbons 5 and 6.

Wait, when you have two equivalents, maybe it's a diels-alder reaction? Because norbornene is a diene. Oh wait, norbornene is a diene, but here the other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,4-diene reacting in a conjugate addition or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the starting norbornene is undergoing some kind of ring-opening or addition. But wait, sodium iodide is a source of iodide ions, which are good nucleophiles. The molecule with two dibromomethyl groups—each Br is a leaving group, so perhaps the iodide substitutes them.

Wait, more specifically, the molecule 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two Br groups on each of the 5 and 6 positions, attached to methyl groups. So each position has two Br atoms on the same carbon. So each of those carbons is a CBr2CH2- group attached to the cyclohexadiene.

So, when treated with NaI, perhaps SN2 substitution occurs, replacing Br with I, but wait, why would the NaI be added here? Alternatively, perhaps elimination. Or maybe it's a ring-opening. Wait, the starting material is a bicyclic compound—norbornene. When norbornene reacts with a dienophile, it does a Diels-Alder. Oh, wait, norbornene is a diene, so the other molecule is a dienophile?

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene as well. So perhaps this is a diene and a dienophile reacting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cycloaddition.

Wait, but wait, the starting reagent is norbornene (diene) and the other is a dienophile. Wait, but norborn
