Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are a new type that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20 on average. Now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls.

Hmm, okay, so I think the key here is understanding how the Lorentz factor affects the distance the particles travel before decaying. Since they're ultra-relativistic, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame would be longer due to time dilation. But wait, the decay is fast, so maybe the lifetime is determined by their proper time, and the lab frame sees it longer.

So the particles are produced at the center of the sphere and move outward. The ones that reach the inner walls must do so before they decay. The radius is 30 meters, so the distance each particle needs to travel is 30 meters.

I remember that the proper time τ is related to the lab frame time t by the Lorentz factor γ. So t = γ τ. Since the particles are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, their speed v is approximately c (since ultra-relativistic implies v ≈ c). So the distance they travel is v * t, but if v is roughly c, then it's c * t.

But wait, the distance they can travel before decaying is v multiplied by the time until decay. For each particle, the time until decay in the lab frame is γ τ. So the maximum distance D they can travel is D = v * γ τ. Because if they decay before reaching the detector's wall, they won't make it.

The problem states that at a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third (1/3) of the particles reach the inner wall. So I guess that at γ =20, the maximum distance they can travel (D_max) is equal to 30 meters, but only 1/3 make it. Wait, maybe I'm
