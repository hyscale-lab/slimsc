Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass scaled by the same factor. I'm not sure how mass plays into this, but I'll keep that in mind.

The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature. Wait, I think it's Wien's Law. Yes, Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, they must have the same temperature. That's a key point.

The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, meaning it's either not moving towards or away from us, or perhaps moving in a way that's perpendicular. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But wait, how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, this is about the Doppler effect. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; moving away, it's redshifted. But the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, does that mean that any Doppler shift is accounted for? Or does the radial velocity affect the observed temperature?

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Because if Star_2 is moving, its observed wavelength would be shifted. But the question states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So, maybe the Doppler effect doesn't affect the temperature? Or wait, perhaps the question is considering the rest frame, not the observed frame. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the radial velocity affects the flux or the observed luminosity, but the peak emission is in the same frame.

Wait, the problem says that the stars' peak wavelengths are the same. So in their rest frames, their temperatures must be the same. Because if one is moving, the observed peak wavelength would change due to Doppler. But the
