Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that the potential is V(r) = (1/2)mω²r², which is Hooke's law kind of thing. So the particle is moving in this potential, and the question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. 

Wait, I need to get my thoughts straight. First, I should recall what the energy levels are for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. Oh right, in three dimensions, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. But wait, since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions. So the energy levels can be expressed in terms of the sum of the quantum numbers. 

I think the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers. Or wait, no, maybe each direction contributes something. Oh, right, each direction is a 1D harmonic oscillator. So each quantum number (n_x, n_y, n_z) is non-negative integers. So the total energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. 

Wait, but sometimes I've seen it written in terms of a principal quantum number. Oh right, sometimes people use n = n_x + n_y + n_z, and then the energy becomes E = (n + 3/2) ħω. So the energy depends on the sum n. 

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Hmm, wait, what defines the excited states here? The ground state is the lowest energy, which is when n=0, right? Because n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. Then the first excited state would be when n=1, the second when n=2, third when n=3. So the third excited state is n=3. 

So the energy for n=3 would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the first part of the answer. So looking at the options, I can look for (9/2) ħ
