Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. They're asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be extended due to their velocity relative to the observer. The formula I think is τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy, right? So γ = E / (m c²), but since the units are in GeV and everything, maybe the c² will cancel out. Let me think about that.

Wait, energy E is given as 27 GeV. The rest mass m is 3.41 GeV. So γ would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.91. So around 7.91 times longer.

But wait, in natural units where c=1, E is in GeV, mass m is in GeV, so E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²). Wait, no, because in natural units, c=1 and E in GeV, m in GeV/c². So E = γ m. So yeah, γ = E/m = 27 /3.41 ≈ 7.91.

So the lifetime of the particle as observed is τ = γ τ₀ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let's compute that. 7.91 *8 is about 63.28, so 63.28e-16 seconds. That's 6.328e-15 seconds.

Now, the particle's lifetime is longer because it's moving at a high speed. So the distance it travels before decaying is v * τ. The minimum for observation is when at least 30% of the particles decay within the resolution. I think the number of particles that decay is given by 1 - e^(-t/τ), where t is the time the chamber can observe. Wait, but actually, the time t is the time the particle is moving through the chamber. So the proper decay length is v * τ₀, and the observed length is v * τ = v γ τ₀.

Wait, but the problem is about the resolution. To observe a decay, the decay must happen within the length that the bubble chamber can detect. So the question is, what is the minimum resolution (distance) needed so that at least 30% of the decays are observed.

So, for each particle, the probability that it decays within a certain length L is the probability that the decay occurs before it moves a distance L. The probability P is 1 - e^(-L/(
