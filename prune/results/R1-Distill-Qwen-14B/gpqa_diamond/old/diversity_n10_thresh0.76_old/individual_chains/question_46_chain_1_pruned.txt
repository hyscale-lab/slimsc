Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. It says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. The question is, how many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. It typically breaks and reforms double bonds, right?

So first, I need to figure out what the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene looks like. Let me draw that out. Pent-1-ene means there's a double bond starting at the first carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2... Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. So Carbon 1 is double bonded to Carbon 2. Carbon 3 has a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the chain is five carbons long, with a double bond starting at C1. The substituents on C3 would be a methyl group.

Wait, let me count:

Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: CH-
Wait, no, wait. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl group on carbon 3. So it's CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene. 

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Now, 3-methyl would add a methyl group on the third carbon. So, the third carbon in pent-1-ene is the third carbon from the double bond. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, that's four carbons. Oh wait, no. Let's number the chain properly
