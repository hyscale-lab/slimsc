Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum showing two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the number of signals gives information about the environment of the protons. The triplet and quartet suggest splitting due to neighboring protons.

Let me think: 6H as a triplet. That's a common pattern. Maybe it's two equivalent CH3 groups next to something. Like, perhaps they're adjacent to a CH2 group. The triplet for 6H could be two CH3 groups attached to a CH2. Because a triplet implies two neighboring protons. So each CH3 is next to a CH2 with two protons. Wait, but 6H as a triplet—so maybe two sets of CH3 groups each with 3H, but both in an environment where they're split into a triplet.

The quartet for 4H. A quartet means each of those protons is next to a CH2 group with three protons? Or maybe each is next to another group with two protons. Wait, quartet splitting usually comes from coupling with a CH2 group. Because each proton in the quartet is next to a CH2 group. Wait, no—coupling to a CH2 would give a triplet. Oh wait, no, the number of splits is n+1, where n is the number of neighboring protons. So a quartet would come from coupling to 3 protons. Or wait, no: If a proton is next to a CH2, which has two protons, it would split into a triplet (2+1=3). So quartet would come from coupling with a CH3, which has three protons (3+1=4).

Wait, so the quartet at 1.3 ppm is 4H. Maybe that's a CH2 group adjacent to a CH2CH3? Let me think. So if we have two CH2CH3 groups attached to a CH2, the middle CH2 would have four protons (each CH2 has two Hs) and perhaps they're next
