Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about an annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide to produce two positive and two negative particles, labeled A. The mass of A is given as 300 MeV, and they want to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D with various fractions of the speed of light.

Wait, okay, I need to think about conservation laws here. Annihilation processes usually involve the conversion of mass into energy, but in this case, maybe it's more about the conservation of momentum and energy.

So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can consider its momentum to be negligible compared to the proton's momentum? Or wait, no. The problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving", so perhaps its velocity is much less than the speed of light, implying that maybe we can approximate its momentum as non-relativistic? Or perhaps not, because the resulting particles might be moving at relativistic speeds.

Wait, but the initial state is a proton and an antiproton. I think in terms of momentum, since it's a collision, the total initial momentum should equal the total final momentum. But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the initial momentum is just from the proton? Or perhaps the antiproton is moving in the opposite direction. Hmm, the problem statement isn't entirely clear on that.

Wait, the initial particles are p and pÌ„. But if they're colliding, then their momenta would be in opposite directions, but what's their relative velocity? Hmm, perhaps the question is assuming that the initial system has the proton at rest and the antiproton moving towards it? Or maybe the other way around. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial setup is such that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with some velocity. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the collision is head-on, and the initial momenta are such that the total initial momentum is zero. Wait, that can't be right unless they're moving towards each other with equal and opposite momentum. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. Alternatively, maybe both are moving towards
