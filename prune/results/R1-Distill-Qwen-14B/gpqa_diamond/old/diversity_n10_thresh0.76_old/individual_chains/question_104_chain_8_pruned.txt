Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's being asked.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. The planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both have circular orbits. The stars have masses similar to our Sun, so I can probably treat them as solar-type stars.

The problem gives me the periodic shifts in the spectral lines for each star due to their respective planets. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects velocity shifts in the star's spectrum because the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The velocity semi-amplitude K is what's measured here. K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us.

Wait, the formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 day in seconds)) )) ) ... but maybe I'm mixing up some parts. Oh wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the simplified version.

I think the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

But since the eccentricity e is probably small and the planets are in circular orbits (given), we can ignore the (1-e²) term.

Also, since the planets have similar masses to Neptune, which I think is about 17 Earth masses, but maybe in this problem, their masses are the same. Oh wait, the problem says both have masses similar to Neptune, so M_planet for both is the same.

But wait, wait: the problem states that both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so their masses (M_p) are the same. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2.

The host stars have the same mass, M_star. So M_star1 = M_star2. And since M_planet is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is much less than Sun mass), M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So we can approximate the denominator as M_star^(2/3), but since both stars have the same M, maybe that cancels out when we take the ratio.

So perhaps the formula simplifies to K being proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(1/3))) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ), because I think the formula involves P in the denominator to some power. Wait, let me get the exact formula right.

The correct formula for K is:

K = [ (G * P )/(2π) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) /
