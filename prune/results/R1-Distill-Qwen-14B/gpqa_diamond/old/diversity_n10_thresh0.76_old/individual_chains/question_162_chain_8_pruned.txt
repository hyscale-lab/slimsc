Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a line element in two dimensions. So the metric is conformally flat, right? Because it's a scalar function multiplied by the flat metric (dx² + dy²). So the conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Now, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... I remember that in general relativity, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But in 2D, a pseudosphere could be a hyperbolic space. Or maybe it's a 2-dimensional surface embedded in 3D, but I think for this problem, it's a 2D space.

Wait, but here the metric is written in terms of x and y. So maybe it's a coordinate system on a 2D manifold. The question is asking about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, but pseudospheres in 2D are a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe the given metric is representing a pseudosphere, which is a surface with constant negative curvature.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a space with a certain curvature, and the question is to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2 in that space. Or maybe the pseudosphere is an
