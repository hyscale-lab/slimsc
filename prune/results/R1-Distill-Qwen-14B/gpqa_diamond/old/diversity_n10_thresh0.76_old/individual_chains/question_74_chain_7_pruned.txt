Okay, so I have this problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me think. The question says that a certain atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, they're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but wait, 150 minutes after what? Oh, I think it's the next 150 minutes from now, so the total time after the initial 100 minutes? Or maybe 150 minutes from the start? Wait, no, the way the question is phrased: "So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?" So, next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. That makes the total time 200 minutes? Or wait, wait, maybe not. Because the initial 100 minutes was the time frame for the 32% probability.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with the decay formula. Radioactive decay is typically exponential, right? So the general formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. But the probability of decay is 1 - e^(-λt), which is the cumulative probability up to time t.

Wait, the problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that
