Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetics. I need to figure out why the eGFP isn't showing up when they looked under the confocal microscope. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the setup: They're studying a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. So, the ligand is probably a secreted protein since it's a coiled-coil, which often relates to signaling molecules. But I'm not sure yet.

They used a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, so they're expressing two proteins from one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the vector probably has two genes: ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, often used for expression in various tissues. The receptor is after an IRES element, which allows for internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation. IRES elements can drive the expression of a second gene in the same mRNA, so that's how they're getting both proteins from one vector.

Now, the stop cassettes. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, there's lox2272-stop-lox2272. I remember that loxP is a recombination site, and Cre can excise the DNA between them. Lox2272 is a variant that doesn't recombine with loxP, so they might be using different recombination sites.

Wait, but in this setup, when the vector is transfected into cells, the cassettes are there. So in primary astrocytes, they transfected the plasmid and then did Western blot. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and saw a signal proportional to actin, which is a loading control. So the proteins are being expressed, at least in the transfected cells. So the vector is working in vitro.

But when they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wild-type background, and crossed it to SOX10-Cre mice, the offspring didn't show a green signal (eGFP). SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So I'm guessing that the Cre is under the SOX10 promoter, meaning it's active in neural crest-derived cells.

The problem is that the eGFP isn't showing up. So, why isn't the receptor-eGFP being expressed in the mice?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cell or not. If they're paracrine, the ligand would be secreted and act on neighboring cells. But the vector is bicistronic, so both ligand and receptor should be expressed in the same cells. Not sure yet.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If it's stuck, then it wouldn't get to the cell surface, so no fluorescent signal. But why would it be stuck? Maybe a stop codon or a mutation? But if it was expressed in the transfected cells, maybe it's trafficking normally. But in the mouse model, perhaps some other factor is affecting it.

Option C: Enhancer for expression is missing. Wait, the promoters are CBA for ligand and IRES for receptor. CBA is a strong promoter. The vector is designed to drive expression of both, so maybe the enhancer is missing in the construct. But why would they see expression in the transfected cells then? Because in the plasmid, the promoters are present.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, right, when you do a fusion protein, you have to ensure that the coding sequences are in frame. If the stop is between the receptor ORF and eGFP, but the stop is within a lox2272 cassette. Wait, the construct is: Receptor ORF followed by stop in lox2272 cassette, then eGFP? Or is the stop before the eGFP? Let me think.

The vector is ligand (CBA promoter) with mCherry, then a stop in loxP cassette. Then the IRES, then receptor with eGFP, with a stop in lox2272. So, the expression would be: ligand-mCherry (if loxP is not recombined), and then the receptor-eGFP... but only if the IRES is active.

Wait, but the lox cassettes are between the ORFs and the fluorescent proteins. So in the initial construct, without Cre, the ligand is under CBA, then the stop, so mCherry wouldn't be expressed because of the stop. Wait, no: the ligand ORF is followed by mCherry, but there's a stop in a loxP cassette. So in the absence of Cre, the stop is present, so mCherry is not expressed. But when Cre is present, it would cut the loxP, remove the stop, allowing mCherry
