Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says there are two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Wait, but the question says they have the same masses. Oh, but their orbital periods are different. Planet 1 has a period that's three times shorter than Planet 2's. So, Planet 1's period is P1, Planet 2's is P2, and P1 = P2/3.

Both planets have circular orbits, so that might simplify things since eccentricity isn't a factor here.

The host stars have different masses but the same radii. Planet 1's star is twice as massive as Planet 2's. Wait, but same radii. Interesting. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The formula for the probability involves the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size.

The transit probability for a planet is given by R_star / a_planet, where a_planet is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, because the RV method gives us the mass and the period, we can find the semi-major axis using Kepler's third law.

Oh right, Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star + M_planet)/(4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So, a^3 = (G * M_star * P^2) / (4π²). But solving for a, it's proportional to (M_star)^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

Wait, but I think the transit probability formula is (R_star / a) squared, or maybe (R_star / a). Wait, no. Let me recall: the probability is the ratio of the areas where the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough for the transit to occur. So, the probability is roughly (R_star / a_planet) × something. Wait, I think the probability is approximately (R_*/a)^2, but I'm not super sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) × (1/(1-e^2))^(something), but since e is zero here because the orbits are circular, maybe it simplifies to (R_star / a).

Wait, no, another thought. The probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, when viewed edge-on, would pass in front of the star from our perspective. The formula I'm recalling is that the probability is (R_star / a) × [ (something) ].

Wait, maybe more accurately, the transit probability P is given by P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, we can approximate it as R_star / a. But wait, I'm not sure if it's multiplied by a factor. Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the probability is (R_star / a)^2, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. Hmm, but I can't actually look things up right now. Let me think. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that from Earth's perspective, the planet passes directly in front of the star. The probability of this alignment is determined by the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the planet's orbit. But more precisely, the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by 1/(something else?), perhaps related to the star's size relative to the planet's orbit.

Wait, another approach. The probability of a transit is given by P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 - (R_star/a)^2))^0.5, but since R_star/a is small (for exoplanets), this term would be close to 1. So maybe it's approximately R_star / a.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up some factors. Let me try a different angle. The transit probability is the ratio of the area where the line of sight intersects the star's disk to the area of the orbit. Wait, that might not be right either.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is (R_star / a) × (1 / sin i), where i is the inclination of the orbit. But no, wait, that's not right because i is the inclination angle, and for a random distribution of inclinations, the probability that i is such that the planet transits is when sin i is greater than R_star/a. So the probability is the solid angle where sin i > R_star/(a), but since the distribution of i is uniform in cos i, the probability is the proportion of possible i where sin i >= R_star/a.

Wait, maybe that's the way to go. So for a random distribution of inclinations, the probability of a transit is equal to (R_star / a) divided by (1 + (R_star/a)^2 )^(1/2), but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's simply (R_star / a) multiplied by something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula more carefully. The probability of transit P is the area of the circle where the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that the transit occurs, divided by the entire possible area. Or perhaps it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the probability is:

P = (R_star) / (a) × (1 + (R_planet / R_star))²

But again, R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so this term is approximately 1. So, P ≈ R_star / a.

Alternatively, I've read before that the probability is P = (R_star / a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - (R_star/a)^2))) ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the condition for a transit. For a transit to occur, the planet's orbit must be aligned such that the apparent position of the planet relative to the star, from Earth's point of view, passes in front. The minimum condition is that the planet's orbital plane's inclination i must be such that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight. The probability of this is (R_star / a) / (1 - (R_star/a)^2)^0.5. Wait, no, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / a

But since R_planet << R_star, approximates to R_star/a. So, P ≈ R_star / a.

Wait, but I remember that the transit probability is about the chance that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough. So the probability is 2R_star / (a * sqrt(a^2 - R_star^2)) ), but that might be for a specific scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the understanding that the probability is R_star divided by the semi-major axis a. Because when the semi-major axis is larger, the probability is smaller, which makes sense because the planet is further out, making transits less likely.

So, now, the problem is to compute the transit probability for each planet and see which is higher.

To compute the transit probability for each planet, we need to find R_star / a for each, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

But to find a, we can use Kepler's third law. So, a = [ (G M_star P^2 ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

But since both planets orbit their respective stars, we can relate a1 and a2.

Given that both have the same mass (same minimum mass as per RV method), but their periods are different.

Wait, but the RV method gives the minimum mass because the inclination is unknown. But in this problem, since the goal is to compute the transit probability, the inclination is a factor. But wait, for the transit to happen, the orbit must be edge-on, which is what we're trying to calculate the probability of. So, perhaps the RV method's data is already used, but I'm not sure. Maybe the RV method gives the mass, but the inclination is still unknown, so the actual mass could be higher if the planet is more edge-on.

But in this problem, the RV method has already given us the minimum masses, but the actual masses could be higher. However, for the purpose of this question, perhaps we can proceed with the given minimum masses, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the RV method provides us with the exact mass if the inclination is known, but I think it gives the minimum mass because the inclination is unknown.

Wait, but the question states that both have the same masses. So, maybe M1 = M2, so their masses are the same.

But given that, their semi-major axes depend on their host stars and orbital periods.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Compute a1 and a2 for each planet using Kepler's law.

2. Compute R_star / a for each.

3. The planet with the higher (R_star / a) will have a higher transit probability, since P ~ R/a.

Wait, but the higher R/a implies higher probability—since, for example, a planet with a smaller a (closer to the star) will have a larger R/a, hence higher probability.

So, let's compute a1 and a2.

Given:

- M1 = 2 * M2. Let me denote M2 as M. So M1 = 2M.

- P1 = P2 /3.

Because P1 is three times shorter than P2. So if P2 is, say, 10 days, P1 is about 3.33 days.

But wait, Kepler's law relates a to (M_star * P^2)^(1/3).

So, a is proportional to (M_star)^(1/3) * P^(2/3)

Thus, a1 ∝ (M1)^(1/3) * (P1)^(2/3)

Similarly, a2 ∝ (M2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3)

But since P1 = P2/3, let's substitute:

a1 ∝ (2M)^(1/3) * (P2/3)^(2/3) 

= (2)^(1/3) * M^(1/3) * (P2^(2/3)) * (1/3)^(2/3)

Similarly, a2 ∝ M^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3)

So, the ratio a1 / a2 is:

[ (2)^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) ) ] 

= [ 2^(1/3) * 3^(-2/3) ) ]

= [ (2)/(3^2) ) ]^(1/3) 

= (2 /9 )^(1/3)

Which is approximately (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6.

So, a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

But wait, let's compute it more accurately.

2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 3^(2/3) is about 2.08. So (1/3)^(2/3) is 1/(3^(2/3)) ≈ 0.4807.

So 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26, 1.26 * 0.4807 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

So, a1 is smaller than a2. Because P1 is shorter, but the star is more massive, so the planet is closer.

Now, the transit probability P is proportional to R_star / a.

But the host stars have the same radius. The problem says both host stars have the same radii, R1 = R2.

So for each planet, P1 and P2:

P1 = R / a1

P2 = R / a2

So, the ratio P2/P1 is (R/a2) / (R/a1) ) = a1 / a2 = 0.606

So P2 is about 0.606 times P1, which means P1 is higher than P2.

Wait, no. Wait, if a1 is smaller than a2, then R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So P1 (transit probability) is higher than P2.

Wait, but according to our calculation, a1 is about 0.606 of a2. So a1 is smaller. So R/a1 is about 1.65 times R/a2.

So, P1 = R/a1 = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 * (R/a2) = 1.65 P2.

So, the transit probability of Planet 1 is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet 2.

Wait, but which planet is preferred? The one with higher probability, so Planet 1 is preferred. Because higher probability means it's more likely to transit, so easier to detect.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check:

Compute a1/a2 ratio again.

a1 ∝ (M1)^(1/3) * (P1)^(2/3) 

M1=2M, P1 = P2/3.

a1 = (2M)^(1/3) * (P2/3)^(2/3) = 2^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) * (M^(1/3) P2^(2/3)) )

a2 = M^(1/3) P2^(2/3)

So a1/a2 = 2^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) = (2 * (1/3)^2 )^(1/3) ) = (2/(9))^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

Then, R/a1 = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 * (R/a2)

So, P1 = 1.65 P2.

So, P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

So, the researchers should prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. That's correct.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. The semi-major axis \( a \) can be derived from Kepler's third law:

\[
a \propto \left( M_{\text{star}} \right)^{1/3} \left( P \right)^{2/3}.
\]

### Given Data:
1. **Planet 1**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (three times shorter than Planet 2's period).
   - Host star mass: \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (twice the mass of Planet 2's host star).
   - Host star radius: \( R_1 = R_2 \) (same radius as Planet 2's host star).

2. **Planet 2**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_2 \).
   - Host star mass: \( M_2 \).
   - Host star radius: \( R_2 = R_1 \).

### Step 1: Compute the ratio of semi-major axes
Using Kepler's law, the semi-major axis is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \left( M_{\text{star}} \right)^{1/3} \left( P \right)^{2/3}.
\]

For Planet 1:
\[
a_1 \propto \left( 2M_2 \right)^{1/3} \left( \frac{P_2}{3} \right)^{2/3}.
\]

For Planet 2:
\[
a_2 \propto \left( M_2 \right)^{1/3} \left( P_2 \right)^{2/3}.
\]

Taking the ratio \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \):
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{\left( 2M_2 \right)^{1/3} \left( \frac{P_2}{3} \right)^{2/3}}{\left( M_2 \right)^{1/3} \left( P_2 \right)^{2/3}} = \left( 2 \right)^{1/3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{2/3}.
\]

Simplify:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \, a_2 \).

### Step 2: Compute the transit probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}.
\]

Substitute \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 0.606 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

Thus, Planet 1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet 2.

### Conclusion:
Planet 1 is preferred for observation because it has a higher probability of transiting (~1.65 times that of Planet 2).
