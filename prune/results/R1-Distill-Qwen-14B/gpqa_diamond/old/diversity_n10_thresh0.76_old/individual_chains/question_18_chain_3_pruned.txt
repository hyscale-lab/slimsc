Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about the elemental abundances in two stars. Hmm, let's see. I remember that elemental abundances are often expressed using logarithmic scales, like the ones given here. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, the problem gives me some values. Let's list them out. Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0. Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. The photospheric composition of the Sun is provided too: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and similarly for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7.

I think I need to find [Si/Fe] for both stars and then use that to find the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in each, then find the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, no, wait. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, so [Si/H] for each star, then take the ratio of those two.

Wait, but I might need to relate this to the Sun's composition. Let me think.

First, let's recall that [X/Y]_star = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, no. The notation [X/Y] is defined as log10(n_X/n_Y / (n_X/n_Y)_sun ), which is the same as log10( (n_X/n_Y)_star / (n_X/n_Y)_sun ). So [X/Y] is the logarithmic difference relative to the Sun.

So for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

And [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun *10^0 = same as the Sun.

Wait, but the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. Wait, what's that mean? Let me parse that.

The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7, so log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12= -5. So nMg/nH_sun = 10^-5.

But wait, the [X/H] notation is log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX/nH)_sun. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The standard definition is [X/H] = log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX/nH)_sun. So if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then that means (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun. Same for [Mg/H]_2 =0, so (nMg/nH)_2 = same as Sun.

So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0. So (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe
