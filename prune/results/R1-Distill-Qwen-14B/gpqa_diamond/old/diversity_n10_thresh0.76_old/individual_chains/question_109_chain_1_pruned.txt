Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about the Pauli exclusion principle and some quantum numbers in a nuclear reaction. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here.

Alright, the problem says: We have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh right, Pauli's exclusion principle applies to identical fermions. Since nucleons are fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The wavefunction includes spin, spatial, and any other quantum numbers. So, for identical particles, when you swap them, the overall wavefunction should change sign.

The initial state is 1S0. The notation is (2S+1)L(J), where S is spin, L orbital angular momentum, and J total angular momentum. So 1S0 implies S=0 (since 2S+1=1 ⇒ S=0), L=0 (S is spectroscopic notation, right? So S0 is L=0?), and J=0. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L (J). So for 1S0, 2S+1=1 → S=0, L is S, which is 0, and J is 0. So the initial state has T=0? Because the NN are in a state with T=0 (since the problem says the final state has T=0, but initial... Wait, the initial state is a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state, but the problem says that the final state has T(NN)=0. So the initial state's T could be different? Or is it the same? Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

The problem says: the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So the initial state's isospin must be considered. Wait, the initial state is a bound NN, but whether it's in a T=0 or T=1 state depends on the reaction. Oh wait, the initial state is a two-nucleon system, which can have T=0 or T=1. But the problem says that after emitting particle X, the NN state has T=0. So the initial state's T must be either 0 or 1, but the final is T=0.

But the question is about the possible partial waves for the emitted particle X. The options are various transitions, each involving a particular angular momentum state for X.

The question says to use conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So I need to consider both.

Let me think about the steps I need to take.

1. Determine the initial and final angular momentum and spin states.
2. Use conservation of angular momentum: the total angular momentum before and after should be the same.
3. Use conservation of parity: the parity of the initial state times the parity of the emitted particle should equal the parity of the final state.

Wait, but since the system is emitting a
