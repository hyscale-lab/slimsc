Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember from my studies that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are described by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but mixed states are statistical mixtures of these.

The question gives me a specific density matrix:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)

I need to find its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are A to D, each giving a different point in 3D space.

Wait, qubits are two-level systems, so their state can be represented as vectors in a two-dimensional space. But density matrices are 2x2 matrices, right? So how does this relate to geometrical positions in 3D space?

Oh, right! I think when people talk about the geometrical position in the qubit space, they're referring to the Bloch sphere representation. Qubit states can be visualized on a Bloch sphere, where each pure state corresponds to a point on the surface of a sphere. But wait, the density matrix given here isn't a pure state. It's a mixed state because it's a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩.

So, for a density matrix ρ, the corresponding point in the Bloch sphere is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The formula is something like r = (⟨X⟩, ⟨Y⟩, ⟨Z⟩), where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices. Alternatively, for a density matrix ρ, the vector r is given by 2*(ρ - I/2), where I is the identity matrix. Because for a pure state |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, this would give r=2(|ψ⟩⟨ψ| - I/2), which simplifies to |ψ⟩⟨ψ| minus the identity over two, multiplied by two.

Wait, let me think again. The general formula for the Bloch vector r is:

r = [ ⟨σ_x⟩ , ⟨σ_y⟩ , ⟨σ_z⟩ ]

where σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices. Alternatively, for a density matrix ρ, since σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]], the expectation value is Tr(ρ σ_i) for each i.

So, calculating each component:

First, let's compute each expectation value.

Given ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)

Let me write this out in matrix form. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Then, ρ is (1/2) I.

So ρ = (1/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]]

Now, let's compute each component:

⟨σ_x⟩ = Tr(ρ σ_x) = (1/2) Tr( [[1,0],[0,1]] [[0,1],[1,0]] )

Multiplying those matrices:

[[1*0 + 0*0, 1*1 +0*0], [0*0 +1*0, 0*1 +1*1]] → Wait, maybe it's easier to compute each term.

Wait, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ρ σ_x is (1/2) multiplied by [[1,0],[0,1]] * [[0,1],[1,0]].

The product [[1,0],[0,1]] * [[0,1],[1,0]] is [[1*0+0*1, 1*1 +0*0], [0*0 +1*1, 0*1 +1*0]] → [[0,1], [1,0]]

So Tr(ρ σ_x) = Tr( (1/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] ) = (1/2)(0 + 0) )= 0.

Similarly, for σ_y: same approach.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So ρ σ_y is (1/2) [[1,0],[0,1]] * [[0,-i],[i, 0]]

Matrix multiplication gives [[1*0 +0*i, 1*(-i) +0*0], [0*0 +1*i, 0*(-i) +1*0]]

Which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The trace is (0 + 0) = 0. So Tr(ρ σ_y) = 0.

Now σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So ρ σ_z is (1/2) [[1,0],[0,1]] * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

The product is [[1*1 +0*0, ...], [..., 0*(-1) +1*0]] → [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Tr(ρ σ_z) = (1/2)(1 + (-1)) = (1/2)(0) = 0.

Wait, wait. Wait, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. So for ρ σ_z, it's (1/2) times the matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the trace is (1/2)(1 + (-1)) )= 0.

So all the components are zero. So the vector r is (0,0,0). So the point is at the origin.

But wait, in the Bloch sphere representation, the origin corresponds to the completely mixed state. Because when you have equal probabilities of 0 and 1, the state is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is the maximally mixed state. And in the Bloch sphere, that's the center, which is (0,0,0).

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This describes a mixed state, specifically the maximally mixed state for a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the geometrical position of a quantum state is determined by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \( \sigma_x \), \( \sigma_y \), and \( \sigma_z \). The corresponding vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is given by:

\[
\mathbf{r} = \left( \langle \sigma_x \rangle, \langle \sigma_y \rangle, \langle \sigma_z \rangle \right),
\]

where \( \langle \sigma_i \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_i) \) for \( i = x, y, z \).

### Step 1: Matrix representation of \( \rho \)
The matrix representation of \( \rho \) is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix.

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix is:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The product \( \rho \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\rho \sigma_x = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The trace of \( \rho \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x) = \frac{1}{2} (0 + 0) = 0.
\]

Thus, \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 0 \).

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle \sigma_y \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_y \) matrix is:

\[
\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The product \( \rho \sigma_y \) is:

\[
\rho \sigma_y = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The trace of \( \rho \sigma_y \) is:

\[
\text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y) = \frac{1}{2} (0 + 0) = 0.
\]

Thus, \( \langle \sigma_y \rangle = 0 \).

### Step 4: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_z \) matrix is:

\[
\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The product \( \rho \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\rho \sigma_z = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The trace of \( \rho \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z) = \frac{1}{2} (1 + (-1)) = 0.
\]

Thus, \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0 \).

### Step 5: Determine the geometrical position
The vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is:

\[
\mathbf{r} = \left( \langle \sigma_x \rangle, \langle \sigma_y \rangle, \langle \sigma_z \rangle \right) = (0, 0, 0).
\]

This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \)**.

Answer: C
