Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and particle decay. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required in the Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy of the particle is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, so the proper lifetime is τ₀, which is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber's frame) would be longer due to time dilation. Right, because of special relativity.

Time dilation formula is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. So I need to calculate γ first.

Lorentz factor γ is equal to E / m, because E = γ m c². But wait, since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², the c² factors would cancel out. Let me confirm: E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²) * c²? Wait, no, let's see. The units are a bit tricky. The energy E is in GeV, and mass m is in GeV/c². So when I take E divided by m, the units become GeV / (GeV/c²) ) = c². So γ would be (E)/(m c²) )? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, the energy E of the particle is the total energy, including rest mass and kinetic. So E = γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). But wait, when E is given as 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV/c², then E/(m c²) would be (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918. So γ is approximately 7.918.

Wait, no, let me compute that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87. 3.41 * 8 = 27.28. So 27 is a bit less than 8 times 3.41. So 27 /3.41 ≈ 7.918. So γ is about 7.918.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 s. So τ = 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that: 7.918 *8 is about 63.344. So τ ≈ 63.344e-16 s, which is 6.3344e-15 s.

Wait, but why are we considering the lifetime here? Because the decay length depends on how far the particle travels before decaying. The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying, which is c multiplied by τ. Because the particle is moving at a speed close to c.

So the average decay length L is c * τ. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the particle moves further.

But wait, we want to observe at least 30% of the decays. So the fraction of particles that decay within a certain length is given by the decay probability. The decay follows an exponential law, so the probability that a particle decays within a certain time is 1 - e^(-t/τ). But here, we're more concerned with the distance rather than time. So the probability of decay within a certain distance x is 1 - e^(-x/(c τ)).

Wait, let me think. The proper lifetime is τ₀, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is τ = γ τ₀. So the average path length is c τ, which is c γ τ₀.

But we're to find the minimum resolution (like, the minimum distance the detector can resolve) such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So we need to find the distance x where the probability of decay is at least 30%, which is 0.3. So 1 - e^(-x/(c τ)) >= 0.3.

Wait, no. The probability that a particle decays before traveling a distance x is P = 1 - e^(-x/(c τ)}.

Wait, because the proper time is τ₀, the time in the lab frame is t = x / c (since x is the distance the particle travels at speed c). So the probability of decay is P = 1 - e^(-t/τ₀) = 1 - e^(-x/(c τ₀)}. But previously, I thought that τ = γ τ₀, so x = c τ = c γ τ₀. Hmm, maybe I should re-express everything correctly.

Alternatively, the average lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. So the average distance L is c τ = c γ τ₀. So the decay length is L = c γ τ₀.

But the question is about the minimum resolution needed, which I think refers to the minimum distance the detector can measure. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum path length that a particle must have to allow the detector to observe the decay. Because if the decay happens too close to the production point, the detector can't resolve it. So the minimum resolution is the minimum distance the detector can distinguish, such that 30% of the decays are observed.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The resolution of the detector determines the smallest distance it can detect. So if the decay occurs within a certain range, the detector can only observe it if the decay length is above a certain threshold.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. The Bubble Chamber has a certain resolution, meaning the smallest length it can measure. To observe a decay, the particle must travel a distance that the detector can measure. So if the particle decays too close (i.e., very small decay length), the detector can't resolve it. So the minimum resolution needed would be such that the detector can observe the decay if the decay length is larger than that. So we're looking for the minimum decay length x such that the probability of decay beyond x is 30%.

Wait, no, the problem says "at least 30% of the decays". So we want to find the x where 30% of the decays happen beyond that point, meaning that the detector can capture those. Alternatively, maybe it's the x where 30% of the decays are within x, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as the decay probability. The decay probability P is the fraction of particles that decay beyond a certain point. So we want P >= 0.3. So 1 - e^(-x/(c τ)) >=0.3.

Wait, no. Let me get the equation right. The probability that a particle decays after traveling a distance x is P(x) = e^(-x/(c τ₀)}. Wait, no, because the proper lifetime is τ₀, so the time in the particle's frame is t' = t / γ. Hmm, perhaps I should be more precise.

The decay probability is given by 1 - e^(-t/τ₀}, where t is the time in the lab frame. The particle's speed is v ≈ c, so the distance x is v t ≈ c t. So t = x/(c). So the probability is 1 - e^(-x/(c τ₀)}.

Wait, but τ₀ is the proper lifetime. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by γ. So the average lifetime in the lab is τ = γ τ₀. So the average decay length is c τ = c γ τ₀.

But for the probability, the proper equation is P(x) = 1 - e^(-x/(c τ)}, because τ is the lifetime in the lab frame. Because t = x/c, so t/ τ = x/(c τ). So the probability that the particle decays before x is 1 - e^(-x/(c τ)}.

Wait, no, it's the other way around. The probability that the particle has decayed by distance x is P(x) = 1 - e^(-x/(c τ)}, as τ is the average lifetime in the lab frame. So the probability that the decay occurs at a position beyond x is e^(-x/(c τ)}.

Wait, no, I think I got it backwards. Let me think: the probability that the particle decays after traveling x is the same as the probability that it hasn't decayed by x. So that's e^(-x/(c τ)}. So if we want at least 30% of the decays to be observed, we need the probability of decaying beyond x to be 30%, so e^(-x/(c τ)} = 0.3. Or wait, no. Because the problem says "at least 30% of the decays are observed". So the detector can only see a decay if the particle travels a certain distance x. So the probability that the decay occurs beyond x is what determines whether the detector can see it. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's model this correctly. The decay happens when the particle's lifetime in its own frame is over. But in the lab frame, we see it moving and the lifetime is longer. So the particle will decay after traveling a certain distance, which depends on the speed and the proper lifetime.

The probability that a particle decays beyond a certain distance x is the same as the probability that it hasn't decayed before x. Which is e^(-x/(c τ)}, since τ is the lab lifetime.

If the detector's resolution is such that it can only observe decays that occur beyond x, then the fraction of decays observed is P_observed = e^(-x/(c τ)}. We need at least 30% of the decays to be observed, so P_observed >= 0.3.

Wait, no, because if the detector has a minimum resolution of x, then it can only see decays that happen beyond x. So the probability that a decay occurs beyond x is e^(-x/(c τ)}. We want this to be at least 0.3.

So, e^(-x/(c τ)} >= 0.3.

Taking the natural log on both sides: -x/(c τ) >= ln(0.3).

Multiply both sides by -1 (and reverse inequality):

x/(c τ) <= -ln(0.3).

Compute ln(0.3) is approximately -1.20397. So -ln(0.3) is about 1.20397.

So x >= (c τ) * 1.20397.

Wait, no, the inequality would be x/(c τ) <= 1.20397, which implies x <= c τ * 1.20397. Wait, but that can't be because if x is larger, the exponent becomes more negative, e^(-x/(c τ)} is smaller. So if you want e^(-x/(c tau)) >= 0.3, you can rearrange to x <= c tau * ln(1/0.3) ≈ c tau * 1.20397.

Wait, but this implies that for the detector to observe at least 30% of the decays, the decay length x must be less than or equal to c tau * ln(1/0.3), which is approximately c tau *1.20397. Because if x is smaller than that, then the probability of the decay happening beyond x is higher than 0.3, meaning more decays are observed? Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Let me think about it this way. The detector will only see the decay if the particle has traveled enough distance so that the decay occurs within the detector's resolution. Alternatively, perhaps the resolution refers to the detector's ability to measure the decay position. So if the decay occurs within a very small distance, the detector might not resolve it. So the minimum resolution required is the distance x such that 30% of the decays happen beyond x. Because if the detector can't measure anything shorter than x, then it can only observe 30% of the decays (those that happen beyond x). So for 30% of the decays to be observed, the required x is such that the probability of decaying beyond x is 30%.

Wait, so P = e^(-x/(c τ)} >= 0.3.

So, e^(-x/(c τ)} = 0.3.

Take the natural log of both sides:

-x/(c τ) = ln(0.3) ≈ -1.20397.

Multiply both sides by -1: x/(c τ) = 1.20397.

So x = c τ * 1.20397.

Wait, but that can't be right, because τ is the lifetime in the lab frame, which is longer, so the decay length would be longer. Hmm.

Wait, no, let's compute x correctly.

So, x = c τ * ln(1/0.3) = c τ * 1.20397.

But τ is the lab lifetime, which is gamma * tau_0.

So, tau = gamma * tau_0.

Gamma is E/(m c^2), but when E and m are in GeV, the units might require some care. Wait, E is given as 27 GeV, m as 3.41 GeV/c².

So gamma = E/(m c^2) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 27/(3.41) ≈7.918.

So, gamma is approximately 7.918.

So tau = gamma * tau_0 = 7.918 * 8e-16 s = 63.344e-16 s = 6.3344e-15 seconds.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So decay length L is c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 6.3344e-15 s = 1.90032e-6 meters.

Wait, but earlier we had x = c tau * 1.20397. So let's compute that.

x = (3e8 m/s) * (6.3344e-15 s) * 1.20397.

Wait, 3e8 * 6.3344e-15 is 1.90032e-6 meters. Multiply by 1.20397 gives:

1.90032e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.29e-6 m.

Wait, but that's the x where the probability is 30% to decay beyond x. So the detector's resolution needs to be at least x, so that it can observe these decays. Because if the resolution is smaller than x, the detector can't measure decays that happen beyond x. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the direction here.

Alternatively, perhaps the detector's resolution is the minimum distance it can measure. So, the minimum x that the detector can distinguish is such that any decay beyond x is observed. So for the detector to observe at least 30% of the decays, the minimum x (the resolution) must be such that 30% of the decays occur beyond x.

Wait, but I think the approach is correct in that x is the distance beyond which 30% of the decays happen. So the detector must have a resolution (minimum detectable length) of x. So the minimum resolution is x, which is 2.29e-6 meters.

But looking at the answer options: option A is 2.08e-6 m, B is 2.08e-9 m, C is 2.08e-1 m, D is 2.08e-3 m.

Hmm, but my calculation gave approximately 2.29e-6 m. But none of the options exactly match that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, let's compute gamma more accurately.

E = 27 GeV, m =3.41 GeV/c².

gamma = E/(m c²) in natural units (where c=1, but when using SI units, E is in J, m in kg). Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma correctly.

Wait, perhaps the formula is gamma = E/(m c²), but when E and m are in units where c=1 (like GeV and GeV/c²), then E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²) * (c²/c²) )? No, perhaps it's better to think in terms of units.

Alternatively, in natural units (c=1), E (in GeV) = gamma m (in GeV/c²) * c². So gamma = E/(m), because m is in GeV/c². So E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) * c² → gamma = E/(m) [since c² cancels out].

Wait, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c². So, E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²). But since 1 GeV/c² is the unit of mass, and c is in m/s, but perhaps for the purpose of calculating gamma, E and m are in compatible units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute gamma as (E in eV) / (m*c² in eV). But that's a bit involved, but let's try.

E = 27 GeV = 27e9 eV.

m =3.41 GeV/c² = 3.41e9 eV/c².

c = 3e8 m/s.

So, m*c² = 3.41e9 eV/c² * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Wait, but in eV, m*c² is (3.41e9 eV/c²) * c^2 → 3.41e9 eV.

So gamma = E/(m c²) = (27e9 eV) / (3.41e9 eV) ) = 27/3.41 ≈7.918 as before.

So gamma is correct.

Tau in lab frame: tau = gamma tau_0 = 7.918 * 8e-16 s = 6.334e-15 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So decay length L = c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 6.334e-15 s = 1.9002e-6 m ≈1.9e-6 m.

But earlier when I calculated x for the 30% probability, I got x =1.9e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.28e-6 m.

But the options have 2.08e-6 m as option A. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation; maybe I should recompute the exact value.

Wait, let me compute gamma again exactly.

27 divided by 3.41.

3.41 *7 is 23.87.

27 -23.87 =3.13.

3.13 /3.41 ≈ 0.917.

So 27/3.41 =7.9178 approximately.

So gamma is 7.9178.

Tau_lab =7.9178 *8e-16 = 63.3424e-16 s =6.33424e-15 s.

c =3e8 m/s.

So L=c * tau_lab =3e8 m/s *6.33424e-15 s = 1.900272e-6 m.

So L ≈1.9003e-6 m.

But earlier for the 30% case, we had x= L *1.20397.

Wait, no, in the 30% case, x = L * ln(1/0.3) = L * 1.20397.

So x=1.9003e-6 m *1.20397≈ 2.288e-6 m.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. The closest is option A: 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula. Let's think again about the probability.

The probability that the decay occurs beyond the distance x is P = e^(-x/(c tau)}.

We want P >= 0.3. So:

e^(-x/(c tau)} =0.3.

Take natural logs:

-x/(c tau) = ln(0.3) → x= c tau * (-ln(0.3)).

Wait, ln(0.3) is negative, so -ln(0.3) is positive.

So x= c tau * (1.20397).

So x= (3e8 m/s) * (6.33424e-15 s) *1.20397.

Calculating 3e8 * 6.33424e-15 = 1.900272e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.900272e-6 *1.20397 ≈ 2.288e-6 m.

But that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I messed up the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution so that at least 30% of the decays are observed, meaning that the detector can measure the decay length at least up to x, such that 30% of the decays happen beyond x. So the minimum x is where 70% have decayed before x. So P(x) = 0.7, which is the probability of decaying before x.

So, 1 - e^(-x/(c tau)} )=0.7 → e^(-x/(c tau)} )=0.3.

Which brings us back to the same equation.

So x= c tau * ln(1/0.3) ≈ c tau *1.20397.

So the previous calculation stands.

But the options don't have 2.28e-6. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x.

Wait, another approach: maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution (the minimum x that can be measured) such that 30% of the decays are within x. So the fraction that have decayed within x is 30%, and the fraction beyond is 70%. But that would change the equation.

Wait, let me clarify: the problem states "at least 30% of the decays are observed." So the detector must record 30% of the decays. So perhaps the probability that the decay occurs within the detector's resolution (x) is 30%. So P=0.3=1 - e^(-x/(c tau)} → e^(-x/(c tau)} )=0.7 → x= -c tau ln(0.7).

Wait, ln(0.7)= -0.35667. So x= c tau *0.35667.

So let me compute that.

x=3e8 m/s *6.33424e-15 s *0.35667.

3e8 *6.33424e-15=1.900272e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.35667:

1.900272e-6 *0.35667 ≈6.778e-7 m, which is 6.778e-7 m.

But that's even smaller than the previous x. None of the options match this either.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to see what the options are based on. The correct formula seems to involve gamma, c, tau_0, and the natural log of (1/0.3).

Wait, another approach: perhaps the minimum decay length required is when 30% of the particles decay. So the minimum x is the distance where the cumulative decay probability is 30%.

So 30% have decayed by x: P=0.3=1 - e^(-x/(c tau)}.

So e^(-x/(c tau)} )=0.7 → x= -c tau ln(0.7)=c tau * 0.35667.

So x= (3e8 m/s) *6.33424e-15 s *0.35667.

Let me compute that:

3e8 *6.33424e-15 =1.900272e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.35667: 1.900272e-6 *0.35667 ≈6.778e-7 m, which is 0.6778e-6 m, or 6.78e-7 m.

But none of the options match this. Oh wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula again. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution is the minimum distance that the detector can resolve, which would be the decay length multiplied by (1 - e^{-x/(c tau)} ) equals 0.3? Or maybe the equation is inverted.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the mean decay length. Let me compute the mean decay length, which is c tau = 3e8 m/s * 6.334e-15 s = 1.9002e-6 m. So that's about 1.9e-6 m. So option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close but not exactly the same.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that 30% of the decays are beyond the resolution. So the fraction observed is 30%, meaning the fraction that decay beyond x is 0.3.

So, P=0.3= e^(-x/(c tau)} → x= c tau * ln(1/0.3).

Which is what I did earlier, giving x≈2.28e-6 m.

But again, the closest option is A: 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, 27 divided by 3.41. Let me do this more accurately.

3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = 0.9178.

So gamma=7 +0.9178 =7.9178.

Tau_lab=7.9178 *8e-16=63.3424e-16 s=6.33424e-15 s.

c tau_lab=3e8 m/s *6.33424e-15 s= 1.900272e-6 m.

So that's the mean decay length, L=1.90027e-6 m.

But the question is about 30% of decays, not the mean.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the decay length as the mean, and thus the minimum resolution needed is the mean decay length. But the question specifically says "at least 30%". Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for the minimum resolution as L * ln(2), which is about 0.693 times the mean, but that would give something like 1.9e-6 *0.693 =1.32e-6 m, which is not an option.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, 2.08e-6 is approximately (8e-16 s)*(3e8 m/s) * (gamma * ln(1/0.3)).

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it as:

x= c * gamma * tau_0 * ln(1/0.3).

So, x=3e8 m/s *7.9178 *8e-16 s *1.20397.

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

3e8 *7.9178 =2.37534e9.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.37534e9 *8e-16 =1.900272e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.900272e-6 *1.20397≈2.288e-6 m.

No, same as before.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation is not considering the gamma factor correctly. Maybe the formula is x= c * tau_0 * gamma * ln(1/0.3).

Wait, that's what I did. So same result.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is assuming that the minimum resolution is the mean decay length times a certain factor, but I don't see how that would directly apply.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the minimum distance where 30% of the particles have decayed, which would be when the probability is 30%, so P=0.3=1 - e^(-x/(c tau)}.

So, e^(-x/(c tau)} )=0.7.

x= -c tau ln(0.7) = c tau *0.35667.

So x=1.90027e-6 m *0.35667 ≈6.78e-7 m.

But that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution such that 30% have decayed, which would be when x is such that 30% have decayed, meaning the probability of having decayed is 0.3.

So, 1 - e^(-x/(c tau)} )=0.3 → e^(-x/(c tau)} )=0.7 → x= c tau * ln(1/0.7) → ln(1/0.7)=0.35667.

So x=1.90027e-6 m *0.35667≈6.78e-7 m.

That's 6.78e-7 m, which is 0.678e-6 m, or 678 nm. But none of the options match that either.

Wait, the options have 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2 micrometers. Let me see, perhaps the calculation should be using c * tau_0 * gamma * ln(2), which is the mean decay length multiplied by ln(2), but that gives about 1.33e-6 m, which is still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the calculation differently. Let me compute the exact value again.

Gamma =27 /3.41 =7.9178.

Tau_lab=7.9178 *8e-16=6.33424e-15 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

x= c * tau_lab * ln(1/0.3) =3e8 *6.33424e-15 *1.20397.

Compute 3e8 *6.33424e-15 =1.900272e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.900272e-6 *1.20397 ≈2.288e-6 m.

But the options don't have that. Option A is 2.08e-6 m. Maybe the calculation expects gamma to be 27 /3.41, but perhaps the energy is 27 GeV/c² instead of 27 GeV. Wait, no, the problem states the energy is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Because if the particle's energy is given as 27 GeV, which is the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass), then gamma is E_rest / m_rest, where E_rest is the rest energy, which is m c². Wait, no, the energy E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV/c² * c²) )= 27/3.41 ≈7.918.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the proper lifetime without gamma. Let's see:

If I don't multiply by gamma, then tau_lab is 8e-16 s.

c tau_lab =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-7 m=2.4e-7 m=0.24e-6 m.

So, 0.24e-6 m. Then x= c tau_lab *1.20397=0.24e-6 *1.20397≈0.289e-6 m=2.89e-7 m. That's 289 nm, which is not any of the options either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the mean decay length as the minimum resolution. So, the mean decay length is c tau_lab=1.9002e-6 m, which is approximately 1.9e-6 m. The closest option is A:2.08e-6 m. But why is there a discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the gamma. Let me compute 27 divided by 3.41 again.

3.41 *7=23.87. 27-23.87=3.13. 3.13/3.41 =0.9178. So 7.9178.

So, tau_lab=7.9178 *8e-16=63.3424e-16 s=6.33424e-15 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So L=3e8 *6.33424e-15= 1.90027e-6 m.

So L is 1.90027e-6 m.

But option A is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm. The exact answer would be 1.90e-6 m, but perhaps the calculation uses more precise values.

Wait, let me compute 27 /3.41 more accurately.

3.41 *7=23.87.

3.41 *7.9178 = 3.41*(7 +0.9178) = 3.41*7=23.87 +3.41*0.9178=3.132 → 23.87+3.132=27.002. So 7.9178 gives 27.002 GeV, which is correct.

So, tau_lab=7.9178 *8e-16=63.3424e-16 s.

c tau_lab=3e8 *6.33424e-15 = 1.90027e-6 m.

So, the mean decay length is approximately 1.9e-6 m. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be based on the proper time. Let's try that.

If I use tau_0=8e-16 s.

c*tau_0=3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m.

Then, x= c tau_0 * ln(1/0.3) =2.4e-7 m *1.20397≈2.89e-7 m=0.289e-6 m=2.89e-7 m. No, that's way too small.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution as the mean decay length (L), which is 1.9e-6 m. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option A:2.08e-6 m, which is close.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as the speed of the particle. Wait, the particle is moving at speed v=βc, where beta is v/c. And gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta²).

But perhaps the decay length is calculated as beta c tau.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because sometimes the decay length is given as L= beta c tau.

Wait, because the average distance is v * tau, which is beta c tau.

So perhaps I made a mistake by not including beta in the calculation.

Wait, that would make sense. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, and the speed is beta c. So L=beta c tau.

But earlier I calculated L as c tau, which would be beta=1. But particles don't move at exactly c, so beta is less than 1.

Ah, that's a mistake! I didn't consider beta. I assumed beta is 1, but in reality, beta is less than 1.

So I need to compute beta. So, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Because gamma =1/sqrt(1-beta²) → beta²=1 -1/gamma².

So, beta= sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

Gamma is ~7.918, so 1/gamma^2=1/(62.7)≈0.01595.

So 1-beta²=0.01595 → beta²=0.98405 → beta≈0.99198.

So beta is approximately 0.992.

So the decay length L= beta c tau =0.992 *3e8 m/s *6.33424e-15 s.

Compute 3e8 *6.33424e-15=1.90027e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.992: 1.90027e-6 *0.992≈1.8835e-6 m.

So L≈1.8835e-6 m.

But wait, the problem is to find the minimum resolution (x) where 30% of decays are observed. So P=30%, so x= c tau * beta * ln(1/0.3).

Wait, no. Ok, let's properly account for beta.

The lifetime in lab frame is tau= gamma tau_0.

The speed is v=beta c.

So the average decay length is L= v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

So L= beta c gamma tau_0.

Which would be beta times the value I calculated earlier.

So, beta is about 0.992, so L=0.992 *1.90027e-6 m ≈1.883e-6 m.

But again, that's not matching the options.

Wait, but when accounting for beta, perhaps the decay length is beta c tau_0 gamma.

Wait, no, because tau= gamma tau_0, so L=beta c tau= beta c gamma tau_0.

So with beta=0.992, gamma=7.918, tau_0=8e-16 s.

Compute L=0.992 *3e8 m/s *7.918 *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *7.918=2.3754e9.

Multiply by 8e-16: 2.3754e9 *8e-16=1.9003e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.992: 1.883e-6 m.

Again, same result.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using beta as 1, which would give a longer L, so the x for 30% would be higher. So with beta=1, x would be higher than with beta=0.992.

But earlier, without beta, I had x≈2.28e-6 m.

With beta=0.992, x=2.28e-6 *0.992=2.25e-6 m.

Still, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using beta as E/(pc), but E=pc when the particle is moving at speed v. Because for relativistic particles, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So, for high gamma (like 7.9), p c ≈ E. So, E≈pc, so beta= v/c= (p c)/(E) → beta= (E c)/(E) )= c/c=1, but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the mean decay length without considering beta, which gives 1.9e-6 m, but the options don't match. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the correct answer with the given data and see which option is closest.

Wait, with the correct calculation including beta, the mean decay length is 1.88e-6 m. So the minimum x to have 30% of decays beyond x would be x= L * ln(1/0.3) =1.88e-6 *1.20397≈2.26e-6 m.

Hmm, but again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe the minimum resolution is the mean decay length multiplied by the natural log factor, but perhaps I should compute it using gamma and c tau_0.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem doesn't account for the difference between gamma and beta gamma.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the formula is x= c tau_0 * gamma^2 * ln(1/0.3).

Wait, that would be x=3e8 *8e-16 * (7.918)^2 *1.20397.

Compute (7.918)^2=62.7.

So x=3e8 *8e-16 *62.7 *1.20397.

3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7.

Multiply by 62.7: 2.4e-7 *62.7=1.5048e-5.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.5048e-5 *1.20397≈1.811e-5 m=1.811e-5 m=1.811e-5 m=18.11e-6 m=18.11 micrometers.

But none of the options match that.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should compute the exact value of 2.08e-6 m and see what gamma or tau would give that.

2.08e-6 m = x.

x= c tau_lab * ln(1/0.3) → tau_lab= x/(c * ln(1/0.3)).

So tau_lab= (2.08e-6 m) / (3e8 m/s *1.20397) ) → denominator=3.6119e8 m/s.

So tau_lab= 2.08e-6 /3.6119e8 ≈5.758e-15 s.

But tau_lab= gamma tau_0.

Gamma= tau_lab / tau_0 = (5.758e-15 s) / (8e-16 s) =7.1975.

So gamma would be approximately 7.1975.

But earlier gamma was 7.9178. So perhaps the problem is using a different gamma. But why?

Hmm, perhaps the energy is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV, so gamma=27/3.41=7.9178 (as before). So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution as the mean decay length, which is 1.9e-6 m. But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake earlier. Let me compute 27/3.41 accurately.

3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = let me compute 3.41 *0.9178=3.132 → 3.41 *0.9178=3.132. So 3.13 is just a little less than that. So 3.13/3.41 is approximately 0.9178.

So gamma is 7.9178.

Hmm. Maybe the problem expects the answer to be option A: 2.08e-6 m.

But I'm not seeing why. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps the energy is given as the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh! That's a possibility.

If E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy is E_kinetic + m c².

If E is 27 GeV, and m c² is 3.41 GeV, then E_total =27 +3.41=30.41 GeV.

So gamma=E_total/(m c²) =30.41/3.41=8.90.

Ah, that's a different gamma.

Wait, that changes things.

So, if the energy given is the kinetic energy, then E = K = (gamma -1) m c².

So, gamma= (K/(m c²)) +1= (27 GeV/3.41 GeV) +1=7.9178 +1=8.9178.

So, tau_lab=gamma tau_0=8.9178 *8e-16=7.134e-15 s.

Decay length L= beta c tau_lab.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)}.

Gamma=8.9178.

1/gamma²=1/(79.52)=0.01257.

So beta= sqrt(1-0.01257)=sqrt(0.98743)=approx 0.9937.

So L=0.9937 *3e8 m/s *7.134e-15 s.

Compute 3e8 *7.134e-15=2.1402e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.9937 → 2.1402e-6 *0.9937≈2.126e-6 m≈2.126e-6 m.

Then, the x where 30% of the decays are observed is x= L * ln(1/0.3)=2.126e-6 *1.20397≈2.562e-6 m.

Still not matching option A.

Wait, but perhaps the question states that the energy is 27 GeV, which might be the kinetic energy. If that's the case, then gamma is 8.9178, leading to L= c gamma tau_0 beta.

But even then, it's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is simply done without considering beta, so L= c tau_lab=3e8 *7.134e-15=2.1402e-6 m. Then, x= 2.1402e-6 *1.20397≈2.578e-6 m.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

Option A is 2.08e-6 m.

If I compute 2.08e-6 m as c * tau_lab * ln(1/0.3).

So, x=2.08e-6 m =3e8 m/s * tau_lab *1.20397.

So tau_lab= (2.08e-6)/(3e8 *1.20397) )=2.08e-6/(3.6119e8)=5.758e-15 s.

Gamma= tau_lab / tau_0 =5.758e-15 /8e-16=7.1975.

So gamma=7.1975.

Which would imply that E=gamma *m c²=7.1975 *3.41 GeV=24.57 GeV.

But the problem states that the energy is 27 GeV. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the speed as c, not considering beta. So, L= c tau_lab.

So, with gamma=7.918, tau_lab=6.334e-15 s.

L=3e8 *6.334e-15=1.9002e-6 m.

Then, x=1.9002e-6 *1.20397≈2.288e-6 m.

But the option A is 2.08e-6 m. So perhaps the problem expects us to compute without considering the 30% factor, just taking the mean decay length. But then, the mean decay length is about 1.9e-6 m, and option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is approximately 10% higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute gamma with more precise values.

Wait, 27 /3.41 is 7.9178.

If tau_lab=7.9178 *8e-16=6.3342e-15 s.

L= c tau_lab= 3e8 *6.3342e-15=1.90026e-6 m.

Then, x=1.90026e-6 *1.20397=2.288e-6 m.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as not considering the gamma factor. Let me compute x without gamma.

x= c tau_0 * ln(1/0.3)=3e8 *8e-16 *1.20397=3e8 *8e-16 =2.4e-7 m → 2.4e-7 *1.20397=2.89e-7 m=0.289e-6 m=289 nm. Not matching any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the minimum resolution as the decay length given by L= (gamma * tau_0 * c) multiplied by (ln(2)), which is about 0.693.

So, L=7.9178 *8e-16 s *3e8 m/s *0.693.

Compute:

7.9178 *8e-16=6.3342e-15 s.

6.3342e-15 *3e8=1.90026e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.693 →1.90026e-6 *0.693≈1.313e-6 m=1.313e-6 m.

Still not matching any options.

I'm really stuck here, and I've spent a lot of time on this. I think the correct approach is to account for gamma and beta, compute the mean decay length, and then apply the 30% probability factor. But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A:2.08e-6 m. Let me see what gamma would give that.

If x=2.08e-6 m= c tau_lab *1.20397.

So, tau_lab=2.08e-6/(3e8 *1.20397)=2.08e-6/(3.6119e8)=5.758e-15 s.

Gamma= tau_lab /tau_0 =5.758e-15 /8e-16=7.1975.

Which would imply that gamma is about 7.1975, which would be E=gamma *m c²=7.1975 *3.41=24.56 GeV. But the problem says E=27 GeV, so perhaps this isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not using the proper formula and expects to use the mean decay length without the probability factor. So, the mean is 1.9e-6 m. So the closest option is A:2.08e-6 m.

But I'm not confident. I think I'll settle for the initial calculation, which gave x≈2.288e-6 m, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A.


To determine the minimum resolution needed in the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \), we analyze the decay process and the relevant formulas. The proper lifetime of \( X^0 \) is given as \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \), and the particle's energy is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) with a mass \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The speed of light is \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relating Energy and Lorentz Factor**:  
   The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated using the relation \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \). Substituting \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), we find:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.918.
   \]

2. **Lab Frame Lifetime**:  
   The lifetime in the lab frame is extended due to time dilation:
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 7.918 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}.
   \]

3. **Decay Length**:  
   The average decay length in the lab frame is given by:
   \[
   L = c \tau = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s} \approx 1.900 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
   \]

4. **Probability of Decay Beyond a Distance \( x \)**:  
   The probability of a particle decaying beyond a distance \( x \) is:
   \[
   P(x) = e^{-x / (c \tau)}.
   \]
   To observe at least 30% of the decays, we set \( P(x) = 0.3 \). Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = c \tau \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.3}\right).
   \]
   Using \( \ln(1/0.3) \approx 1.20397 \), we compute:
   \[
   x = 1.900 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \times 1.20397 \approx 2.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated value \( x \approx 2.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \) does not match any option exactly. However, the closest option is **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**. It is possible that the problem assumes a slightly different approximation or rounding in intermediate steps.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the given options, the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is best approximated by **Option A**.

Answer: A
