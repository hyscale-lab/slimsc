Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. But let's try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, and I need to figure out which sequence leads to the desired product with high yield.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target molecule. Let me draw it mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the numbering is a bit confusing. The name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, benzene ring with three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3.

So, positions 1, 2, and 3 are all adjacent on the ring. So the substituents are ortho to each other in a row. So it's like positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Wait, 1,2,3 are adjacent, so their substituents are meta to each other? Because in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a line, forming a meta arrangement for each pair. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho), then 2 and 3 are adjacent (ortho), so 1 and 3 are meta. So ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So the substituents are ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), and nitro (NO2). The question is about the order of reactions to get these groups in the correct positions.

I remember that when introducing substituents on benzene, the order matters because each substitution can affect the next reaction. Also, activating and deactivating groups can direct incoming substituents to specific positions.

So, benzene is the starting material. Let's think about the possible reactions:
