Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's start by reading through the question carefully.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to determine what compound X was.

Hmm, wait a second. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane—that's a common reagent used in certain reactions. Oh right, that's the one used in the Sharpless epoxidation, but wait, no, Sharpless uses a titanium-based catalyst. Oh wait, maybe it's related to epoxide ring-opening? Or perhaps it's part of an elimination reaction. Alternatively, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is often used as a base in certain reactions, like in some eliminations. Oh wait, another thought—if the reaction is with a carbonyl group, maybe it's a conjugate addition or something else.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So the product is this compound that, when you look at its NMR, tells us something about its structure. So perhaps the reaction produces an epoxide, because the product's NMR includes some deshielded protons and carbons which could be from an epoxide. But wait, the starting material is compound X, and the product comes from reacting X with this reagent. Let me think: If X is a carbonyl compound, reacting it with a base might form an enolate. Or if X is an epoxide, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another thought. The reaction conditions are nonpolar solvent and high temperature (403 K, which is about 130°C). That might suggest an elimination reaction. For example, if X is an epoxide, but that would probably require different conditions. Alternatively, perhaps X is a diene and the reagent is involved in some cycloaddition, but that seems less likely.

Wait, let me look at the NMR data for the product. The 1H NMR shows:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, two singlets for 3H each—those are probably methyl groups attached to something that doesn't have neighboring Hs, like carbonyls or aromatic rings where they are isolated. The aromatic region shows multiple doublets: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). That suggests perhaps a para-substituted aromatic ring, but wait, wait. Let me think about coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic protons are part of a substituent. For instance, if there's a styryl group (which is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring), the protons on the double bond would show coupling. Looking at the 1H NMR, the three doublets with varying integration—maybe this is a conjugated diene or a substituted vinyl group attached to benzene.

The 13C NMR data: let's see, a carbon at 197.7 ppm which is a carbonyl (maybe a ketone or an ester, but in the product, considering the reagents, perhaps an epoxide. Wait, but epoxide carbons are usually around 50-60 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carb
