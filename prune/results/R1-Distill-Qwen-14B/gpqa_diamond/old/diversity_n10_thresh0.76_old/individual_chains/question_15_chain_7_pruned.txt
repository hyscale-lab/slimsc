Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting planets using the transit method. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should prioritize observing that one.

The question gives me two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like and have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh wait, that means Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period usually means a tighter orbit.

Also, both planets have circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit. The host stars are different too. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting, so even though one is more massive, they're the same size. I think that might affect the probability of a transit because the size of the star matters for how likely a planet is to pass in front of it from our point of view.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the relative sizes of the planet's orbit and the star. The formula for transit probability, as I recall, is something like (R_star + R_planet) squared over (a_planet)^2, but wait, actually, I think it's more like (R_star / a_planet)^2, because the planet needs to pass in front of the star. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Let me think more clearly.

The transit probability (P) for a planet is given by the formula P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but if the planet is Earth-like and much smaller than the star, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So the formula simplifies to P â‰ˆ (R_star / a_planet). Wait, no, that's not right. I think it's actually the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit multiplied by some factor from the orbital geometry.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate it as R_star / a_planet. But wait
