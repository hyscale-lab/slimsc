Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this question about creating a mouse embryonic chimera using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The setup is that someone wants to study the fate of iPSCs in an embryo. These iPSCs come from various somatic tissues and are labeled with mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter. Oh wait, mRaspberry is a fluorescent protein, I think it's a red fluorescent protein. Right, so each cell type has a specific promoter driving the expression of this red marker. So, depending on their lineage or cell type, the cells will express mRaspberry, which glows red.

They inject these dedifferentiated cells into a 32-cell stage blastocyst. The blastocyst is the early embryo at this stage, and injecting cells into it is a common method in creating chimeras. The idea is that the injected cells will integrate into the embryo and contribute to various tissues as the embryo develops.

Then, every 12 hours, they prepare embryos with TUNEL-FITC staining and observe them under a confocal microscope. Wait, TUNEL is a method used to detect apoptosisâ€”programmed cell death. It labels the DNA fragments in apoptotic cells, and when combined with FITC, it emits a green fluorescence. So, any cells undergoing apoptosis will show up as green.

The question is, what is the first thing they would notice when they look at the embryos under the microscope. The options are A to D.

Thinking about what happens when you inject iPSCs into a blastocyst. iPSCs are pluripotent, so they can differentiate into various cell types. But since each iPSC line has a lineage-specific promoter driving mRaspberry, that means each type of cell (like from a specific tissue) will express red in their respective lineages. So, if a group of cells derived from, say, skin cells startsDifferentiating into a certain lineage, they'll glow red.

Now, when they do the TUNEL-FITC staining, apoptosis would show up as green. But when would the iPSCs start undergoing apoptosis? Or maybe the host cells are undergoing apoptosis. Wait, but the question is about the
