Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. The mass is negligible, so I guess we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just potential energy. 

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and choose the right option from A to D.

Hmm. Since all the charges are the same sign, I'm thinking about how they would arrange themselves to minimize the potential energy. But wait, the 13th is fixed at P, so the others are moving around it. Wait no, the 12 are fixed at 2 m from P. Oh wait, the setup is that 12 are fixed at 2 m from P, and the 13th is at P. So this forms, like, a central charge and a ring of 12 charges around it?

Wait, no—wait. The problem says 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of those 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P. The 13th is fixed at P. So the entire system is made up of 13 charges: one at the center (P), and 12 arranged around it, each 2 meters away.

Now, each of the 12 is at 2 m from the center. So each of them is a distance r = 2 m from P, which has a charge of 2e. So each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the central one is also 2e.

Wait, but in terms of potential energy, we need to calculate the potential energy of each charge in the field of the others. But wait, in an isolated system, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But since the system is isolated, adding all the interactions.

Wait, but since the charges are identical and all the same sign, they would repel each other. So the potential energy will be positive because like charges repel, and the potential energy between
