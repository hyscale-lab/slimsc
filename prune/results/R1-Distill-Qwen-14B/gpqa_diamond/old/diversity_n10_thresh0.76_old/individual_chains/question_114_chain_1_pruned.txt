Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when you have a ketone reacting with a cyanide, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but for ketones, the reaction with HCN or its salts typically gives a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation, yeah, that's when the cyanide adds to the carbonyl group, and water also adds, leading to a diol with a nitrile group.

Wait, so butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) would react with NaCN. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, does the reaction go via HCN? Oh wait, no, in the presence of an acid catalyst, the cyanide can attack the carbonyl. Oh right, the cyanohydrin formation requires an acid catalyst. So for the first reaction, the reagent A must be an acid, like H3O+.

Wait, but another possibility: sometimes, in the presence of a strong base, like in the hydroxide conditions, but I think for cyanohydrin, you need an acid. So if butan-2-one (ketone) is treated with NaCN and an acid, it will form the cyanohydrin. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When the cyanide adds, the nitrile group comes in on the same carbon as the hydroxyl. So the product structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that makes sense.

So the first reagent A must be an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or maybe H2SO4. Looking at the options, let's see. The options are A) H3O+ and B: HCl; B) H3O+ and CH3COOH; C) NaHSO3 and HCl; D)
