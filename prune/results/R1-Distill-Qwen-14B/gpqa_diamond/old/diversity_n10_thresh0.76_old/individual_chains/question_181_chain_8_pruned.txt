Okay, so I've got this neutrino flux question here. Hmm, let me think carefully. I remember that neutrinos are produced in the Sun through various processes. The question is about what happens if the pp-III branch suddenly stops. 

Wait, the pp-III branch is one of the proton-proton chain reactions. Right, the proton-proton chain is the main source of solar energy. So there are different branches in the pp chain. The pp-I branch produces helium-4, while the pp-II and pp-III are other branches, maybe involving more protons or different steps.

Oh, right! The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the pp-I. Because in pp-III, the reaction involves more steps, leading to higher-energy particles. So neutrinos from pp-III would have higher energies than those from pp-I.

But wait, the problem says the pp-III branch stops. So all other reactions, including pp-I and maybe other processes, continue as usual. So if pp-III stops, then the production of high-energy neutrinos from that branch would stop. But what about other sources?

Wait, the Sun's main neutrinos are from the proton-proton chain. The pp-I branch produces the majority of the neutrinos, I think. But the pp-III branch contributes a smaller fraction but produces higher-energy neutrinos.

So if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like in the 800-900 keV band) would be reduced. But the lower-energy neutrinos (700-800 keV) would be mostly unaffected because they come from pp-I, which is still active.

The question is about the ratio of the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) to band 2 (800-900 keV). If pp-III is stopped, then the flux in band 2 would drop significantly, but band 1's flux remains roughly the same. So the ratio would be much higher than 1.

But wait, how much do the pp branches contribute to each band? Let me think about neutrino energies. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos with energies up to about 200 keV, right? Because in the pp-I, the last step is a neutron and proton combining into deuterium, releasing a positron and a neutrino with around 0.4 MeV (so
