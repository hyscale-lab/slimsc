Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, particles in a box like this have quantized energy levels. Each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n.

The problem asks for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state energies of the system. The options are given, and I need to compute it in terms of E, where E is equal to π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each individual particle's energy is En = (n²)E, right?

Wait, but wait, because there are four identical particles, which are fermions since they're spin-1/2. Oh, right, the Pauli exclusion principle applies. So each particle must occupy a unique quantum state, meaning that no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. But wait, in a 1D infinite well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. Since they're spin-½, each state can have two possible spins: up and down. So each n can hold two particles.

So the system's ground state would have the lowest possible energy, with each particle in the lowest available states. Let me think: for four particles, the first two can be in n=1, each with opposite spins. Then the next two would go to n=2, each with opposite spins as well. Wait, no, because n=1 can hold two, n=2 can hold two. So all four can be filled with n=1
