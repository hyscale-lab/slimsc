Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The setup involves some genetic constructs and experiments in primary astrocyte culture and mouse models. The problem is that after some crosses and testing, there's no green signal observed under the confocal microscope. I need to figure out why.

First, let me try to understand the components of the experiment.

The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets. So the receptor probably has an extracellular domain for ligand binding.

They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. So, the ligand is first, then the receptor.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think it's constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so it can drive translation of the downstream ORF, even in the presence of a stop codon in the upstream ORF. So, the ligand is expressed under CBA, and the receptor is expressed using IRES.

Wait, the vector setup: between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh, so these are stop cassettes that can be removed by Cre recombinase. LoxP and lox2272 are different recombinase recognition sites. So, if Cre is expressed, it will recognize these and delete the stop cassettes, allowing the downstream genes to be expressed.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, meaning each cassette is between the first ORF and the second. So, the ligand is first, then a stop cassette (loxP), then mCherry. Then, the receptor is after another stop cassette (lox2272). So, the expression would be: the CBA promoter drives the expression of the ligand ORF. Then, a stop codon, followed by loxP sites. If Cre is present, it would delete the loxP-stop-loxP, allowing mCherry to be expressed with the ligand? Or wait, no. Because the stop is between the ligand and mCherry. So, without Cre, the ligand is expressed, and then the stop prevents mCherry from being expressed. If Cre is present, it deletes the stop, so the
