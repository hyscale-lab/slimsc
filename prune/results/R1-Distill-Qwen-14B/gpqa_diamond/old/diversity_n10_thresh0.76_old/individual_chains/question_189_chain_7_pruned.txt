Okay, so I have this question about particles and symmetry breaking. Hmm, I need to figure out which particle isn't associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. Let me think about each option one by one.

First, I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking often leads to the appearance of new particles called Goldstone bosons. These are massless particles that arise when a continuous symmetry is broken. But wait, sometimes the symmetry breaking leads to massive particles if the symmetry is not exactly broken, like in the Higgs mechanism.

Option A: Phonon. Phonons are related to vibrations in a crystal lattice. They arise from the quantization of elastic vibrations. I'm trying to recall if phonons are Goldstone bosons. Oh right, in solid-state physics, when a crystal has a translational symmetry, breaking it (like when a crystal forms) can lead to phonons. So phonons are Goldstone bosons from spontaneous symmetry breaking. So A is associated with broken symmetry.

Option B: Skyrmion. Skyrmions are topological solitons in certain field theories. I think they appear in the context of pion physics and the Skyrme model. They are associated with the pions, which are Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. So Skyrmions themselves are not Goldstone bosons, but the model uses them to describe the pions which are. So B might be associated with symmetry breaking.

Option C: Magnon. Magnons are the quasiparticles representing spin waves in magnetic materials. They arise due to the quantization of spin waves. I think that when a magnetic material has a broken symmetry (like in antiferromagnetism), the spin waves (magnons) are the Goldstone bosons. So C is associated with broken symmetry.

Option D: Pion. Pions are well-known as the Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are the result of the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry due to the quark condensate. So D is definitely associated with symmetry breaking.

Wait, the question is asking which particle is NOT associated with spontaneously broken symmetry. So all the options except one are linked to broken symmetry. So which one doesn't fit?

Wait, let me think again. Pions are from broken symmetry. Magnons are from broken symmetry. Phonons are too. So what about Skyrmions? Skyrmions
