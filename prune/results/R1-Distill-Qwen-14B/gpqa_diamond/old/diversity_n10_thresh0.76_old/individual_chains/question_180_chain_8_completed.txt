Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. Out of these, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places, in Joules.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when dealing with charges and their potential energy, electric potential energy comes into play. Since all the particles are identical and have the same charge, this must be a problem involving the electrostatic potential energy between each pair of charges.

Wait, but the system is isolated, so we don't have to consider any external fields, I think. We're just looking at the potential energy within this system.

So, the setup is: one charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. But wait, are the 12 charges all at a distance of 2 meters from P, and are they fixed in space as well, or can they move? Wait, the problem says "constrained to stay at 2 m from point P." So I think they can't move closer or farther from P, but they might be free to move around as long as they remain 2 meters away. Or perhaps they are all at the same point 2 meters away? No, no, that wouldn't make sense because if they are constrained to stay at 2 m, but nothing says they're at the same position. Hmm, but wait, perhaps they are all at 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. But wait, the problem is talking about the minimum energy of the system. So maybe the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy.

Wait, but when you have multiple charges, the potential energy depends on their pairwise interactions. So to find the minimum energy, perhaps we need to arrange the charges in such a way that the total potential energy is minimized.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance r=2 m from P, but what about their distances from each other? Because the potential energy between any two charges is dependent on their mutual separation.

But wait, the question is about the minimum energy of the entire system. So perhaps the system's potential energy is the sum of all the potential energies between each pair of charges. But since the system is isolated, the potential energy is the sum of the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position.

Wait, no—actually, the formula for the potential energy of a system of point charges is the sum over all distinct pairs of (1/(4πε₀)) * (q_i q_j)/r_ij. So in this case, we have 13 charges: 1 fixed at P (charge 2e), and 12 each at 2 m from P.

Wait, but the 12 charges are constrained to be at 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other are not specified. To find the minimum energy, perhaps we need to arrange the 12 charges in such a way that their mutual repulsion is minimized. Because all charges are positive (2e each), they would repel each other. So to minimize the potential energy, we should maximize the distances between them, right? Because potential energy is positive when like charges are placed together, and higher distances lead to lower potential energies.

Wait no, wait. Wait, since each pair of like charges contributes a positive potential energy, to minimize the total, we need to place them as far apart as possible. So the minimal potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

But wait, how many pairs are we considering? Let me think. The system has 13 charges: one fixed at P, and 12 around it.

So the potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between:

1. The fixed charge (2e at P) and each of the 12 charges at 2 m. So 12 terms, each with r=2 m.

2. The potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges. Since the 12 are constrained to be 2 m away from P, but their mutual distances can vary. So the arrangement of these 12 charges will affect the mutual potential energies between them.

Ah, so the total potential energy U is composed of two parts: U1 (between the fixed charge and the 12) and U2 (between the 12 charges themselves).

So U = U1 + U2.

But the question is about the minimum energy. So to find the minimum U, we need to find the configuration that minimizes U, which would involve minimizing both U1 and U2.

Wait, but U1 is fixed because all the 12 charges are at 2 m from P. Wait no, because each of the 12 charges is a distance of 2 m from P, so U1 will be 12*( (8e²)/(4πε₀ * 2) ), since each charge at 2 m will contribute (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀*2) to U1. So that's a fixed value, regardless of how the 12 charges are arranged relative to each other.

But U2 is the sum of all the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges. Since each charge is 2e, the potential energy between any two of them is (2e)^2/(4πε₀ r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between the i-th and j-th of the 12 charges.

Wait, but how do the 12 charges arrange themselves to minimize U2? Since all charges are positive, placing them as far apart as possible would minimize U2, because the potential energy between them would be lower (since r_ij is larger). Oh wait, no—wait, each term in U2 is positive because it's (positive charge * positive charge)/(distance). So to minimize U2 (which is a positive number), we need to maximize the sum of 1/r_ij terms. Wait, no, because each term is (2e)^2/(4πε₀ r_ij), so to minimize U2, we want to minimize each term, which means making r_ij as large as possible. But how?

Wait, but the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions must lie on a sphere of radius 2 m centered at P. So the mutual distances between any two charges can't be more than 4 m (if they're diametrically opposite on the sphere). But to minimize U2, which is the sum of all the 1/r_ij terms, we need to maximize each r_ij, because that would make each term as small as possible. So the minimal U2 occurs when all the 12 charges are as far apart as possible from each other on the sphere. The configuration that maximizes the minimal distance between any two charges on a sphere is a regular icosahedron arrangement. But the exact calculation might be complex.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at the same position relative to P, perhaps on the same point? No, because that would make their mutual distances zero, which would make U2 infinite, which can't be the case. So that can't be the arrangement for minimum energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are all at the same position, but that doesn't make sense because they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but not necessarily at the same point. So maybe the problem doesn't require considering the interactions between the 12 charges and only asks for the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, and the mutual potential energies between the 12 are at their minimum possible.

Wait, but the problem says 'the minimum energy of this system.' So perhaps the minimum occurs when the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges are as small as possible, which would be when they are as far apart as possible. But calculating that exactly might be complicated.

Wait another approach: perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the other 12, and not the mutual energies between the 12. But that seems unlikely because when you have a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy includes all pairs.

Wait, but perhaps in the scenario where the 12 charges are all at 2 m from P and arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are as large as possible, their mutual potential energy is minimized. But I'm not sure about the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero because they're arranged symmetrically in a way that their contributions cancel out, but I don't think that's the case because all charges are positive, so the potential energies would sum up to a positive value.

Wait, but maybe the problem simplifies things. Let me think again: the fixed charge at P has 2e, and the other 12 each have 2e and are at 2 m from P. So the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge is (2e * 2e)/(4πε₀ * 2 m). So that would be 4e²/(4πε₀ * 2) = 2e²/(4πε₀ * 1) = (2e²)/(4πε₀).

But wait, 12 charges, so U1 is 12 * (2e²)/(4πε₀ * 2) )? Wait, wait, let's compute that correctly.

Wait, the potential energy between two point charges is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r. So for each of the 12 charges, their charge is 2e, the fixed charge is 2e, so each pair contributes (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2 m) ) = (4 e²)/(4πε₀ * 2 m) ) = (2 e²)/(4πε₀ m ). Since m is 2 m, so 2/(2*2)= 2/(4) = 0.5. So each pair contributes (2 e²)/(4πε₀ * 2) )= (e²)/(4πε₀ * 1) )= e²/(4πε₀), because 2e * 2e is 4e², divided by (4πε₀ * 2m), which is 4πε₀ * 4. Because 2m is 2 * 2 =4 meters?

Wait, no, wait. The distance r between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is 2 m. So for each, r = 2 m.

So each term is (2e)(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2 m) ) = (4 e²)/(8 π ε₀ m ) )? Wait, no, 4 e² is from 2e * 2e, and denominator is 4πε₀ * 2 m. So putting it all together, each term is (4 e²)/(4πε₀ * 2 m) ) = (4 e²)/(8 π ε₀ m ) ) = (e²)/(2 π ε₀ m )).

Wait, no, m is 2 meters, so 4πε₀ * 2 is 8πε₀. So 4e² / (8πε₀) ) = e²/(2 π ε₀). Since there are 12 such terms, U1 = 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀)) ) = (6 e²)/(π ε₀).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recalculate.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, where the 13th charge (2e) is located.

So for each of these 12, the potential energy is (2e)(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2) ) = (4e²)/(8 π ε₀) )= e²/(2 π ε₀).

So for 12 charges, U1 = 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀)) )= (6 e²)/(π ε₀).

Now, what about the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges? Each pair of the 12 charges contributes (2e)(2e)/(4πε₀ r_ij ), where r_ij is the distance between the i-th and j-th charge.

So the number of such pairs is C(12, 2) = 66.

So U2 = sum_{i < j} [ (4 e²) / (4 π ε₀ r_ij) ) ] = sum_{i < j} (e²)/(π ε₀ r_ij) ).

But the problem is that the mutual distances r_ij depend on how the 12 charges are arranged on the sphere of radius 2 m. To minimize the total potential energy, we need to arrange the charges such that the sum of 1/r_ij is minimized. Because each term is positive, the sum is minimized when each r_ij is as large as possible.

Wait, but if all the 12 charges are equally spaced on the sphere, maybe the mutual distances are maximized, leading to the minimal sum. But calculating this sum is non-trivial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the potential energy from the fixed charge, or perhaps the problem is designed such that the mutual potential energy doesn't contribute, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, let's see. The options are in the order of 1e-26 J or 1e-27 J. Let's compute U1 and see where that stands.

The value of e is 1.602e-19 C.

So e² is (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

4πε₀ is approximately 1.11265e-10 F/m (farads per meter).

So let's compute U1: (6 e²)/(π ε₀) )

Wait, wait, no, earlier I calculated U1 as 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀)) )= 6 e²/(π ε₀).

So U1 = 6 * (e²) / (π ε₀) )

Plugging in the numbers:

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

π ε₀ ≈ 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 F/m ≈ 2.78e-11 F·m.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 4π ε₀ is about 1.112e-10 F/m, so π ε₀ is 4π ε₀ /4 = 1.112e-10 /4 ≈ 2.78e-11 F·m.

So U1 = 6 * (2.566e-38) / (2.78e-11) ) 

Compute numerator: 6 * 2.566e-38 = 1.5396e-37.

Denominator: 2.78e-11.

So U1 = 1.5396e-37 / 2.78e-11 = approx 5.535e-27 J.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

1.5396e-37 / 2.78e-11 = (1.5396 / 2.78) * 1e-26.

Since 1e-37 / 1e-11 = 1e-26.

1.5396 / 2.78 ≈ 0.5535.

So U1 ≈ 0.5535e-26 J = 5.535e-27 J.

But wait, looking at the answer options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, and option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is 28.22e-27 J. So U1 is about 5.5e-27 J.

But wait, what about U2? If we include U2, it would increase the total energy. But in the options, the smallest option is 7.056e-27 J, which is higher than U1, so perhaps U2 is being considered, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, not their mutual energies. Let me see why that might be the case.

Another possibility: perhaps the 12 charges are all located at the same point 2 meters from P, but that can't be because that would bring them infinitely close, making U2 extremely large. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energies sum up, but without knowing their exact arrangement, perhaps the problem expects you to calculate only the U1 part.

Wait, the question says "the minimum energy of this system". So perhaps the mutual potential energies between the 12 is zero, but that's only possible if their arrangement nullifies those terms, which isn't possible with all positive charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are considered negligible compared to U1, but in this case, with 66 terms, each of order e²/(4πε₀ r_ij), and r_ij being at least 0 (but can't be zero), but more likely a few meters apart, perhaps the sum is comparable to U1.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem expects us to only consider U1, as it's easier.

But let me think again: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged symmetrically on a sphere, and their mutual potential energies sum up to a certain amount. But calculating that would require knowing their positions, which might not be straightforward.

Wait, but in the case of a regular polygon arrangement, like a regular icosahedron, the average distance between points on the sphere can be determined, but I'm not familiar with the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy contributes a factor that's not negligible, but without knowing the exact arrangement, I might have to assume it's zero, which isn't correct, but perhaps the problem expects that U2 is zero. But that doesn't make sense because all charges are positive, so U2 must be positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are fixed at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are such that their potential energies are at a minimum. But without the necessary data, perhaps it's intended to ignore U2.

Wait, looking back at the question, perhaps the system's minimum energy is when the 12 charges are as far away as possible from each other, thus minimizing U2.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem expects us to compute only U1, and that's why the answer is option B (2.822e-26 J), which is approximately twice the U1 I calculated earlier.

Wait, earlier I found U1 as 5.535e-27 J. Option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 5x10^-27 *5=5e-26, but wait, 5.5e-27 is 0.55e-26, and option B is 2.82e-26, which is about 5 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating U1.

Let me recalculate U1.

Each term: charge1 is 2e, charge2 is 2e, r is 2 m.

So for each pair: U = (2e * 2e) / (4 π ε₀ * 2 m) ) = (4 e²) / (8 π ε₀ m ) )

Wait, no: 4e²/(4 π ε₀ * 2) ) = e²/(2 π ε₀ )

So each of the 12 terms is e²/(2 π ε₀ )

So U1 = 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀)) ) = 6 e²/(π ε₀ )

Wait, yeah that's correct.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

π ε₀ = approximately 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 C²/(N·m²) )= 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 2.775e-11 C²/(N·m²).

So U1 = 6 * 2.566e-38 / (2.775e-11 )

Compute numerator: 6 * 2.566e-38 = 1.5396e-37.

Divide by denominator 2.775e-11: 1.5396e-37 / 2.775e-11 = (1.5396 / 2.775) * 1e-26.

1.5396 / 2.775 ≈ 0.5535.

So U1 ≈ 0.5535e-26 J = 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27 J. But that's larger than U1. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U1.

Wait, the formula is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r.

So for each pair, U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e) / (2 m) ) = (4 e²)/(4 π ε₀ * 2 m ) )= (4 e²)/(8 π ε₀ m ) )= e²/(2 π ε₀ m )

Wait, no, because m is 2, so 2 m is 2 meters.

Wait, that's correct. So each pair contributes (4 e²) / (4 π ε₀ * 2 m )

Wait, 4 e² / (8 π ε₀ m ) ) = e²/(2 π ε₀ m )

But m is 2, so 2 π ε₀ m becomes 4 π ε₀.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me recompute U1 correctly.

Each pair:

U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e) / (2 m) ) = (4 e²)/(4 π ε₀ * 2 m )

Which simplifies to (4 e²)/(8 π ε₀ m ) ) = e²/(2 π ε₀ m )

Wait, m is 2 meters, so:

e²/(2 π ε₀ * 2 ) )= e²/(4 π ε₀ )

So each of the 12 pairs contributes e²/(4 π ε₀ )

Thus, U1 = 12 * (e²/(4 π ε₀ )) )= 3 e²/(π ε₀ )

Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. I had mistakenly thought each term was e²/(2 π ε₀ ), but actually, it's e²/(4 π ε₀ ). So U1 is 12 * e²/(4 π ε₀ )= 3 e²/(π ε₀ ).

So let's recalculate U1.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

π ε₀ ≈ 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 2.775e-11 C²/(N·m²).

So U1 = 3 * 2.566e-38 / (2.775e-11 )

Compute numerator: 3 * 2.566e-38 = 7.698e-38.

Divide by 2.775e-11: 7.698e-38 / 2.775e-11 = (7.698 / 2.775) * 1e-27.

7.698 / 2.775 ≈ 2.774.

So U1 ≈ 2.774e-27 J.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 10 times larger than this.

Wait, where could I have made a mistake? Let me check the units and the formula again.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up meters and something else. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1/(4πε₀) is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². So alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using this value.

So U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r.

So for each pair, U = (8.988e9) * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m )

Wait, e is 1.602e-19 C, so 2e is 3.204e-19 C.

So U per pair = 8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2 = 1.027e-37 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 1.027e-37 = 9.245e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6225e-28 J.

So each pair contributes approximately 4.6225e-28 J.

There are 12 such pairs, so U1 = 12 * 4.6225e-28 = 5.547e-27 J.

Wait, that's about 5.547e-27 J, which is close to 5.5e-27 J, which is option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps the problem includes the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges.

Wait, let's think about U2. The 12 charges are each 2e. So the potential energy between any two is (2e)^2/(4 π ε₀ r_ij )= (4 e²)/(4 π ε₀ r_ij )= e²/(π ε₀ r_ij )

Now, the number of pairs is 12 choose 2 = 66.

So U2 = sum_{i < j} (e²/(π ε₀ r_ij )) 

But without knowing the r_ij's, it's hard to compute this sum. However, perhaps we can assume that all r_ij are the same, but that's not possible unless all 12 charges are at the same point, which they can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to U1. But in that case, the answer would be approximately 5.5e-27 J, which is not among the options except option C is 7.056e-27 J. Hmm, but 5.5e-27 isn't an option, but option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 5 times larger.

Wait, so perhaps I missed a factor in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, when I calculated U1 using the Coulomb's constant approach, I got 5.547e-27 J. But perhaps I should be considering the potential energy of bringing each charge from infinity to their position, which would include the fixed charge.

Wait, wait, the 12 charges are at 2 m from P, but the fixed charge is also part of the system. So the potential energy of each charge is the work done to bring it from infinity to 2 m away from P, but since the fixed charge is already there, the work done is against the electric field of the fixed charge.

Wait, but that's the same as what I calculated earlier. So perhaps I should be multiplying by 12.

Wait, but earlier I found U1 as 12 * (each pair's energy), which is correct.

But perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy of the system as a whole, not just pairwise.

Wait, perhaps the total potential energy is U1 plus U2, and I've only calculated U1 so far.

Wait, but without knowing U2, I can't compute the total. So perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute U1 only, but let me see if that matches any of the options.

Wait, earlier calculation using Coulomb's constant gave me U1 ≈5.5e-27 J, which isn't an option. But looking back at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 5 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try calculating using the exact Coulomb's constant.

Coulomb's constant k = 1/(4πε₀) ≈ 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So U1 = 12 * [ (2e)(2e) / (2 m) * (1/(4πε₀)) ) ]

So U1 = 12 * [ (4 e²) / (2 * 4 π ε₀ * 2 m ) ) ]

Wait, wait, no: the distance is 2 m, so each pair is (2e)(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2 m )

So each pair's U is (4 e²)/(4 π ε₀ * 2 m ) ) = (4e²) / (8 π ε₀ m )

So U1 = 12 * (4e²)/(8 π ε₀ m ) ) = (12 *4e²) / (8 π ε₀ m )

Simplify numerator: 48 e².

Denominator: 8 π ε₀ m.

So U1 = (48 e²) / (8 π ε₀ m ) )= 6 e²/( π ε₀ m )

Wait, m is 2, so 6 e²/( π ε₀ * 2 )= 3 e²/( π ε₀ )

So U1= 3 e²/( π ε₀ )

Now, e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So U1 = 3 * 2.566e-38 / ( 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 )

Compute denominator: 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 2.775e-11.

So numerator: 3 * 2.566e-38 = 7.698e-38.

So U1 = 7.698e-38 / 2.775e-11 = approximately 2.774e-27 J.

Which is 2.774e-27 J, which is 2.774 x 1e-27, which is 0.2774e-26 J.

Wait, but that's 2.774e-27 J, which is about 0.277e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 10 times larger. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think again: the fixed charge at P has 12 others each at 2 m. So the number of pairs between the fixed and the 12 is 12. So U1 is 12 * (each pair's contribution).

Each pair's contribution is (2e * 2e)/(4 π ε₀ * 2 m ) ) = (4e²)/(8 π ε₀ m ) )= e²/(2 π ε₀ m )

Since m=2, that's e²/(4 π ε₀ )

So each pair contributes e²/(4 π ε₀ ), and 12 pairs, so U1 =12 * e²/(4 π ε₀ )= 3 e²/( π ε₀ )

So U1 = 3 * (1.602e-19)^2 / (3.1416 * 8.854e-12 )

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

So 3 * 2.566e-38 =7.698e-38.

Divide by (3.1416 *8.854e-12 ) = 2.775e-11.

So 7.698e-38 / 2.775e-11 = 2.774e-27 J.

Again, same result.

So where is the discrepancy? The options don't have 2.77e-27 J. The closest option is option C:7.056e-27 J, which is about 2.5 times larger.

Hmm, but perhaps I should also calculate U2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is being placed at that position, and the potential energy includes the work done to bring all 12 charges from infinity to their positions, taking into account the potential created by all other charges as they are placed.

Wait, but the system is isolated, so the potential energy is the sum of the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position, considering the potential created by the charges already in place.

So the fixed charge is at P. Let's call it charge Q1.

We bring the first charge Q2 (2e) from infinity to 2 m from Q1. The work done is (2e * 2e)/(4 π ε₀ * 2 ) = (4 e²)/(8 π ε₀ )= e²/(2 π ε₀ )

Then, bring the second charge Q3. Now, the potential at the location of Q3 is due to Q1 and Q2. But since all charges are at 2 m from P, maybe the triangle formed by Q1, Q2, and Q3 is such that Q2 and Q3 are both at 2 m from Q1 and at some distance apart.

But this complicates the calculation, as each new charge's placement would require considering the potential from all previously placed charges.

But with 12 charges, this would get very complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, ignoring the mutual potential energies between the 12.

In that case, the total energy would be U1=3e²/(π ε₀ )= approximately 2.77e-27 J.

But this isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 12 charges are all at 2 m from each other as well as from the fixed charge. But that can't be, because if each is 2 m from P, their mutual distance can't all be 2 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron around P, but without specific data, it's unclear.

But perhaps the problem ignores the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges, and only considers the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12. In that case, the U1 is approximately 2.77e-27 J, but none of the options match this exactly. The closest option is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me compute U1 again with exact numbers.

Compute U1 = (3 e²)/( π ε₀ )

e = 1.60217663e-19 C.

e² = (1.60217663e-19)^2 = 2.56697e-38 C².

π ε₀ = 3.14159265 * 8.854187817e-12 F/m ≈ 2.7752e-11 F·m.

So U1 = 3 *2.56697e-38 / 2.7752e-11 = (7.70091e-38) / (2.7752e-11) ≈ 2.774e-27 J.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps there's another factor I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the potential energy is twice the value I calculated because each pair is counted once, but perhaps the formula actually accounts for each charge being in the field of all others. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the system as if it's being evaluated in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge, but their mutual distances are zero, which would make U2 infinite, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the potential energy. Let me think again: the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, considering the potential each new charge brings to the existing configuration.

So, the fixed charge is at P. Then, bringing the first of the 12 charges from infinity to 2 m away requires work U1a = (2e)(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2 ) = e²/(2 π ε₀ )

Then, bringing the second charge, but now the potential at 2 m is due to the fixed charge and the first charge. So the work done is (2e) * [ potential at 2 m due to existing charges ].

The potential at the new charge's location is V = (2e)/(4πε₀ * 2 ) + (2e)/(4πε₀ * r_12 ), where r_12 is the distance between the first and second charges.

But if the two charges are both 2 m from P, the distance between them depends on their arrangement. If they are diametrically opposed, r_12 would be 4 m. If they're at the same point, r_12 approaches zero, but that's impossible.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are placed in such a way that the mutual distances are as large as possible, so r_12 is maximized.

But this is getting too complicated, and perhaps the problem expects us to ignore U2 and only calculate U1.

Wait, looking at the options again, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 10 times larger than the U1 I calculated. Maybe I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should use 12 * (2e)^2/(4πε₀ * 2) ), which would be 12 * (4e²)/(8 π ε₀ )= 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀ )) )

Which would be 12 * e²/(2 π ε₀ )=6 e²/(π ε₀ )

Wait, but that brings back the same calculation as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the 12 charges as a single entity, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using r=2 meters for all interactions, including mutual ones. So for the 12 charges, each pair is at 2 meters apart, which is impossible because placing 12 points on a sphere can't have all pairwise distances equal to 2 m. But if we assume that each pair is at 2 m, then U2 would be 66 * (4e²)/(4 π ε₀ * 2 )= 66 * e²/(2 π ε₀ )

So U2= 66 * e²/(2 π ε₀ )=33 e²/(π ε₀ )

Then total U = U1 + U2 = (3 e²/ π ε₀ ) + (33 e²/ π ε₀ )=36 e²/(π ε₀ )

So U=36 * 2.566e-38 / (2.775e-11 ) )=36 * (2.566e-38 / 2.775e-11 )

Compute 2.566e-38 /2.775e-11 = 9.245e-28.

Multiply by 36: 36 *9.245e-28 ≈332.8e-28 =3.328e-26 J.

Hmm, which is 3.328e-26 J. Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is close but not the same. Option A is 5.645e-26 J, which is higher.

But this would imply that the mutual potential energies are all at 2 m, which isn't possible, so perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are being ignored, and the answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J.

But earlier calculations without U2 gave U1 as approximately 2.77e-27 J, which is 0.277e-26 J, much smaller than option B.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the U1. Let me compute U1 once again.

Each of the 12 charges contributes (2e * 2e)/(4 π ε₀ * 2 )= (4 e²)/(8 π ε₀ )= e²/(2 π ε₀ )

So U1=12 * e²/(2 π ε₀ )=6 e²/(π ε₀ )

So e²=2.566e-38 C².

π ε₀=2.775e-11.

So U1=6 * 2.566e-38 / 2.775e-11 = (15.396e-38 )/ (2.775e-11 )=5.535e-27 J.

Which is about 5.535e-27 J.

But option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects you to calculate the potential energy using the formula for potential energy between point charges as (q1 q2)/(4 π ε₀ r ), but when there are multiple charges, you sum all the pairs.

But without including U2, the answer is about 5.5e-27 J, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should also compute the potential energy of the fixed charge as being in the field of the 12 others. But that's already included in U1.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the electric potential energy as the sum of the potential at each charge multiplied by its charge. But I think that's essentially the same as summing all the pairwise interactions.

Wait, the formula U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i, where V_i is the potential at the location of charge i due to all other charges.

In this case, the fixed charge at P has a potential V1 due to all 12 charges. Each of the 12 charges has a potential V_i due to the fixed charge and the other 11 charges.

But calculating this would require knowing the potentials at each point, which again depends on the arrangement of the 12 charges.

But perhaps the problem is only asking for the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, which would be U1 as calculated earlier.

But then why isn't the option matching? The only option close to 5.5e-27 J is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute U1 again.

U1 = 12 * (2e * 2e) / (4 π ε₀ * 2 ) = 12 * (4 e²)/(8 π ε₀ )= 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀ )) )=6 e²/(π ε₀ )

Compute:

e =1.602e-19 C.

e²=2.566e-38.

π ε₀=2.775e-11.

So U1=6 *2.566e-38 / 2.775e-11 = (15.396e-38 ) / 2.775e-11 = 5.535e-27 J.

Hmm.

Looking at the options again:

A)5.645 x 10^-26

B)2.822 x 10^-26

C)7.056 x 10^-27

D)122.330

The only option close to 5.5e-27 is C, which is 7.056e-27. But that's about a 26% difference. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are zero, which would give an infinite U2, but that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are 2 m, but that's not feasible for 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2 m.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular icosahedron around P, and the average distance between any two charges can be calculated. But without knowing the exact formula, perhaps I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, and that's all.

But given that, the U1 is 5.5e-27 J, but the options don't have that. The closest is C:7.056e-27 J.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the calculations once more.

Wait, U1 = 12 * ( (2e)^2 ) / (4 π ε₀ * 2 )

=12 * (4e²) / (8 π ε₀ )

=12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀ ) )

=6 e²/(π ε₀ )

So 6 * (1.602e-19)^2 / ( π * 8.854e-12 )

Compute numerator: 6 * 2.566e-38 =1.5396e-37.

Denominator: pi *8.854e-12 ≈2.775e-11.

So U1 =1.5396e-37 / 2.775e-11 =5.535e-27 J.

Hmm, yes, that's correct.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 m from the fixed charge, but each is also 2 m away from each other. But that's impossible because in 3D space, you can't have more than 3 points all equidistant from each other on a sphere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that all the 12 charges are at the same point 2 m away, but that's impossible because then the mutual distance would be zero, making U2 infinite.

So perhaps the problem expects us to only consider the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, which is approximately 5.5e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each charge in the potential created by all other charges.

So for the fixed charge at P, it's 2e. The potential it creates at a distance of 2 m is V = (2e)/(4 π ε₀ * 2 )= e/(4 π ε₀ )

Each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of 2e * V = 2e * (e/(4 π ε₀ )) )= e²/(4 π ε₀ )

So for 12 charges, the total U1 is 12 * e²/(4 π ε₀ )=3 e²/(π ε₀ ), which matches the earlier calculation.

But again, this gives 5.5e-27 J, which is not an option. So perhaps the problem expects to include U2, but in that case, without knowing the arrangement, it's impossible to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the 12 charges as being placed at 2 meters from each other, not from P. But no, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 13th charge is at the center of a sphere where the 12 charges are placed on the surface, but their mutual distances are such that each is 2 meters apart, which isn't possible on a sphere of radius 2 m.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as (n choose 2) * (charge^2)/(4 π ε₀ r), where r is 2 m for all pairs. So for the 13 charges, it's 13 choose 2, but that's not the case because the 13th is fixed.

Wait, the 13th is fixed, so the total number of pairs is (13-1) + (12 choose 2) = 12 + 66 =78 pairs.

But this would require each pair to be at 2 m, which isn't possible. So perhaps the problem is making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, which is U1=5.5e-27 J, but the options don't have this.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using exponents correctly.

Wait, U1 =3 e²/( π ε₀ )

e²= (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So U1=3 *2.566e-38 / (3.1416 *8.854e-12 )= (7.698e-38 )/(2.775e-11 )=2.774e-27 J.

Which is 2.774e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27 J, which is about 2.5 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy twice, once as the charge being brought in, and once as the source of potential. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as the potential energy between two point charges being (q1 q2)/(4 π ε₀ r ), but when you have multiple charges, the potential energy is (1/2) Σ q_i V_i, where V_i is the potential at the location of charge i due to all other charges.

But in this case, for the fixed charge at P, the potential due to the 12 charges would be V_P = (12 * 2e)/(4 π ε₀ * 2 )= (24 e)/(8 π ε₀ )=3e/(π ε₀ )

So the potential energy of the fixed charge is 2e * V_P = 2e * (3e/(π ε₀ ))=6 e²/(π ε₀ )

Which is the same as U1.

And for each of the 12 charges, the potential at their location is due to the fixed charge and the other 11 charges.

The potential due to the fixed charge is V_i = 2e/(4 π ε₀ *2 )=e/(4 π ε₀ )

The potential due to the other 11 charges at their location depends on their arrangement, which again is unknown.

But perhaps the problem is only considering the potential due to the fixed charge, leading to U = 12 * (2e * e/(4 π ε₀ )) )=12 * (2 e²/(4 π ε₀ ))=12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀ )) )=6 e²/(π ε₀ )

Which again brings us back to the same calculation: U1=6 e²/(π ε₀ )=5.5e-27 J.

But this still doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as the sum of the potential energies of each charge in the potential of all others, including the 12 charges. So for each charge, the potential is due to the fixed charge and the other 11 charges.

So for the fixed charge, the potential energy is 2e multiplied by the sum of potentials from the 12 charges. But each of the 12 charges contributes a potential at P of 2e/(4 π ε₀ *2 )=e/(4 π ε₀ )

So the total potential at P is 12 *e/(4 π ε₀ )=3e/(π ε₀ )

So the potential energy of the fixed charge is 2e * (3e/(π ε₀ )) )=6 e²/(π ε₀ )

For each of the 12 charges, the potential at their location is due to the fixed charge (2e) and the other 11 charges. The potential due to the fixed charge is 2e/(4 π ε₀ *2 )=e/(4 π ε₀ )

The potential due to the other 11 charges depends on their arrangement. If each of the other 11 charges is 2 m away from the current charge, then each contributes 2e/(4 π ε₀ *2 )=e/(4 π ε₀ )

So the potential from the 11 charges is 11 * e/(4 π ε₀ )

So the total potential at a 12th charge is [e/(4 π ε₀ ) ] + [11 *e/(4 π ε₀ ) ]=12 e/(4 π ε₀ )=3e/(π ε₀ )

So the potential energy for each of the 12 charges is 2e * 3e/(π ε₀ )=6 e²/(π ε₀ )

Since there are 12 such charges, the total from them is 12 *6 e²/(π ε₀ )=72 e²/(π ε₀ )

Adding the fixed charge's potential energy: 6 e²/(π ε₀ ) +72 e²/(π ε₀ )=78 e²/(π ε₀ )

Wait, but this would be the case only if each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from all others, which isn't possible. So this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved in a different way. Maybe the minimum energy occurs when the charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energies are minimized, but without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't compute U2.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26 J, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are placed at a distance of 2 meters from each other as well as from the fixed charge, leading to each pair contributing (2e)^2/(4 π ε₀ * 2 )=e²/(2 π ε₀ )

The number of such pairs is 13C2=78 pairs. So U=78 * e²/(2 π ε₀ )

=39 e²/( π ε₀ )

Which would be 39 *2.566e-38 / 2.775e-11=39 *9.245e-28 ≈3.606e-26 J.

Which is close to option B:2.822e-26 J. But not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the pairs between the 12 and the fixed charge, leading to U=12 *e²/(4 π ε₀ *2 )=12 *e²/(8 π ε₀ )=3 e²/(2 π ε₀ )

Which is 3 *2.566e-38 / (6.283e-11 )=1.5395e-38 /6.283e-11≈2.45e-28 J. Which is much smaller than the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26 J, but I'm not confident.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we analyze the potential energy contributions between the charges. The system consists of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a fixed charge at point \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of two contributions: 

1. **Potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 charges (\( U_1 \)):**  
   Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge. The potential energy between two charges is given by:  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
   \]  
   For each pair, \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \) and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:  
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = \frac{4e^2}{8 \pi \epsilon_0} = \frac{e^2}{2 \pi \epsilon_0}
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such pairs, the total contribution is:  
   \[
   U_1 = 12 \cdot \frac{e^2}{2 \pi \epsilon_0} = \frac{6e^2}{\pi \epsilon_0}
   \]  

2. **Potential energy between the 12 charges (\( U_2 \)):**  
   The 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from the fixed charge but can move relative to each other. The potential energy between any two charges is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{(2e)(2e)}{r_{ij}}
   \]  
   where \( r_{ij} \) is the distance between two charges. To minimize the total potential energy, the charges should be arranged to maximize \( r_{ij} \), as larger distances reduce the magnitude of the potential energy. However, calculating \( U_2 \) requires knowledge of the exact spatial arrangement of the charges, which is not provided. Thus, \( U_2 \) is not explicitly computed in this analysis.

### Numerical Calculation of \( U_1 \)
Using \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), \( \epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \), and \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):  
\[
e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
\]  
\[
\pi \epsilon_0 = 3.1416 \cdot 8.854 \times 10^{-12} = 2.775 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{F} \cdot \text{m}
\]  
\[
U_1 = \frac{6e^2}{\pi \epsilon_0} = \frac{6 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38}}{2.775 \times 10^{-11}} = \frac{1.5396 \times 10^{-37}}{2.775 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 5.535 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]  

### Comparison with Options
The calculated value of \( U_1 \) is approximately \( 5.535 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \). However, this does not match any of the provided options directly. The closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is slightly larger than the computed value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or additional considerations not explicitly addressed in the problem setup.

### Conclusion
Given the available options and the analysis, the most reasonable choice is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, as it is the closest to the computed value of \( U_1 \).  

Answer: C
