Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think it through. The question is about determining the number of 13C-NMR signals in the final product E. The starting material is propionaldehyde, and it goes through a series of reactions. Hmm.

Let me break down each step. The first reaction is propionaldehyde with EDT and BF3. Wait, EDT is probably ethyl diethyl tin, right? BF3 is a Lewis acid catalyst. Oh, right, that's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces aldehydes to alkanes. So propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) would become CH3CH2CH2OH? Wait no, wait. Wait, no, Clemmensen reduces the aldehyde group (-CHO) to a methylene group (-CH2-). Wait, no, maybe I got that mixed up. Wait, no, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. Clemmensen would reduce the aldehyde to a CH2 group. So propionaldehyde (RCHO) becomes RCH2OH? No, wait, wait. No, wait, the Clemmensen reduction actually uses H2 and a catalyst to reduce aldehydes and ketones to alkanes. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up with something else. Oh wait, no. Wait, the Clemmensen reaction is when you have an aldehyde or ketone, and you reduce it to an alkane. Oh wait no, wait. Let me think: Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat, right? And it reduces carbonyl groups to CH2. So an aldehyde (RCHO) becomes RCH2H, so RCH2- group. Wait, but propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. So reducing that would give CH3CH2CH2-... but wait, that would be a primary alcohol? No, wait, no. Oh wait, no. Wait, the aldehyde is RCHO. Clemmensen would reduce it to RCH2–, but wait, what's R in this case? R is CH2CH2? Wait, no. Propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. So R is CH2CH3. So the aldehyde is CH3CH2CHO → after Clemmensen → CH3CH2CH2-... but wait, how? Because the aldehyde (CHO) becomes CH2. So propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) becomes CH3CH2CH2 something? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Clem
