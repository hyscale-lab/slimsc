Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. Hmm, electrons are fermions, so their total wavefunction has to be antisymmetric. But wait, the question says we're ignoring the spin angular momentum. Oh right, because sometimes you can separate orbital and spin parts, but maybe here it just wants us to focus on the orbital part.

The state given is |1,1,2,-1>. So l1 and l2 are both 1, which makes sense because p orbitals have l=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. So the total orbital angular momentum is L=2, and its z-component is -ħ.

Wait, but the question is about measuring L1z and L2z. Each of these is the z-component of the individual electrons' orbital angular momenta. So L1z is m1 times ħ, and L2z is m2 times ħ. Since l1 and l2 are both 1, their possible m values (m1 and m2) can be -1, 0, +1.

But wait, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. So when we're in this state, the total m is -1. So m = m1 + m2 = -1. So possible combinations of m1 and m2 that add up to -1 would be (-1,0), (0,-1), (0,0) isn't possible because that would sum to 0. Wait, no, 1 + (-2) isn't possible since m can't exceed l or go below -l. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to m=-1 are:

(1, -2) → but wait, m can't be -2 because l=1, so m ranges from -1 to +1. So that's impossible. So (m1, m2) can be ( -1, 0 ), (0, -1 ). Are there any others? No, because 1 + (-2) is invalid, so only those two possibilities.

Wait, but the state is given as |1,1,2,-1>, which is a coupled state. So when you have two particles, the coupled state is a combination of their individual states. Let me think. The state |l1, l2, l, m> is a combination of |l1, m1> and |l2, m2> such that m1 + m2 = m. So the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a sum of all possible |m1, m2> pairs where m1 + m2 = -1.

But wait, in the coupled state, the possible m1 and m2 values are such that m1 + m2 = m, which is -1 in this case. So for each possible m1 and m2 that sum to -1, we have contributions in the state. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |1, m1> ⊗ |1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, but how does that expansion look? For two p orbitals (l=1 each), the possible total l can be 2 or 0 or 1. Since the given state has l=2, we are in the l=2 subspace. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a particular combination. 

But what about the expansion in terms of the product states? Let's think about all possible m1 and m2 pairs where m1 + m2 = -1. The possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1, 0), (0, -1). Are there any others? No, because for m1 being 1, m2 would have to be -2, which isn't allowed. So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a combination of the
