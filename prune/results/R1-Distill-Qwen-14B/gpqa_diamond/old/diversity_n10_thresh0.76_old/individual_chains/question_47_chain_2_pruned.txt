Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's break this down. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, looking at the IR data. Strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretches. Amines or amides maybe? The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl group. Could be an ester, amide, or maybe a ketone. But given the formula, which includes an oxygen count, ester or amide makes more sense.

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let's see: 1.20 ppm triplet (t, 3H). That's likely a CH3 group attached to something like an ethyl group. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so maybe a -CH2CH2- structure, like an ethyl ester.

Then, 4.0 ppm broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad singlet could be some sort of NH group, but wait, earlier the IR suggested N-H. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2- group, but that might be more around 3.5-4.0. Hmm.

4.5 ppm quartet (q, 2H). Quartet with 2H—maybe a CH2 connected to something else. Since we have an ethyl group at 1.2, this could be the CH2 next to the oxygen. Like in an ester group, the -OCH2CH3. But wait, the triplet is 3H, so perhaps the ethyl is split as CH2CH3. Wait, but the quartet at 4.5 with 2H would be the adjacent CH2. So, for an ethyl ester, OCH2CH3, the protons on the CH2 would be a quartet (because they're next to the triplet of the CH3). But wait, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 is split by the neighboring CH3, giving a quartet. So yeah, the 4.5 ppm quartet would make sense for that. So that supports an ethyl ester or maybe an ethyl amide.

Next, the aromatic protons. At 7.0 ppm doublet (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm doublet (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two equivalent protons would split into two doublets. So the substituents are opposite each other on the ring.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the substituents on the benzene would be at 3 and another position? Wait, benzamide is a CONH2 group. And an ethoxy at position 3. Then, the ring would have substituents at positions 3 and 1 (for para? No, 3 and 1 are meta, not para). Wait, para would be positions opposite each other. So if one substituent is at position 3, the other would be at position 7, which is meta. Hmm, but the NMR shows two doublets—so maybe a para substituent. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two groups in para positions. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on adjacent carbons but in a way that the coupling leads to doublets. Not sure yet.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH- attached. So the structure would be HCONH-(4-ethoxyphenyl). Wait, no, N-substituted formamide. The formamide group is HCONR2, but in this case, it
