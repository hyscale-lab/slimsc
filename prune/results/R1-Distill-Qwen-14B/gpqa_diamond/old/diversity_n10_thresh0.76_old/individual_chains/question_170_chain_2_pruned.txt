Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). We need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are A to D. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, spin states are often represented as two-component vectors since electrons have spin-1/2. So the state vector here is a two-dimensional vector, given as (3i, 4). That means the components are 3i for the first element and 4 for the second. Let me write that out: ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product: <S_y> = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. Right, but I need to be careful with the operators. The spin operator S_y is given in terms of σ_y, the Pauli matrix. Oh right, because for spin-1/2 particles, S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So σ_y is given as a matrix:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So, S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

So let me write S_y:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Now, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

But wait, ψ is a column vector. So to compute this, first I need to write ψ as a column vector. So ψ = [3i; 4], right? Because the first component is 3i and the second is 4.

So the steps are:

1. Compute S_y |ψ> to get the state after applying S_y.
2. Then take the inner product of ψ with that result.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute ψ† S_y ψ directly.

Let's think about the steps.

First, let me write out the matrix S_y:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So the matrix is:

[ 0, -iħ/2 ]
