Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me start by breaking down each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR data shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. So, the presence of an -OH group is likely. That suggests the compound might have either an alcohol or maybe a carbonyl group with some hydrogen, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 area is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, or esters. The 1650 peak could be another carbonyl, maybe an ester or maybe something else. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Another possibility is that the 1650 peak is from conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution. Alternatively, it could be a carbonyl with some vibrational differences, like an ester or a conjugated ketone.

Moving on to the ¹H NMR. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, right? So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe in an alkene or part of a ring. So we're looking at something with a double bond and an -OH group.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Let's think. The molecular ion could break down into smaller fragments. 45 is an odd mass, so maybe it's a CH₂O fragment or something else. Wait, 45 corresponds to the molecular weight of (CH3CO)O− but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment with 2 carbons, like maybe (CH3)2O, but I'm not certain. Another thought: 45 could be the mass of a carbonyl-containing group. For example, the acetate group has a molecular weight of 60, but perhaps a fragment could be 45. Wait, no, the acetate ion is 59 (CH3COO⁻). So maybe a different approach: 45 is the mass of a fragment like CH₂CO (45), but that's 45? Let's compute: C=12, H2=2, CO=28, so total 12+2+28=42. Wait, that's 42, not 45. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH3CHO (30), but that's 32 (CH3CHO would be 44? Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps 45 is the mass of a carbonyl-containing group. Let me think
