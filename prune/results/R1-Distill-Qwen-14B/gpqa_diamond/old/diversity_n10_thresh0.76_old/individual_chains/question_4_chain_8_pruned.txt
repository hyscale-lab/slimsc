Okay, so I've got this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate them. But this is a different scenario.

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields work. Let me think about each equation. There are four of them, right?

The first equation is about the divergence of the electric field. Oh, right, Gauss's law. It says that the electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the charge enclosed. In our universe, that's E·dA = Q_enc / ε₀. I don't think this equation changes because it's about electric charges, and the question doesn't say anything about changing how charges behave. So maybe this equation stays the same.

The second equation deals with the circulation of the electric field, which is Faraday's law. It relates the changing magnetic flux to the induced electric field. The integral of E around a loop equals the negative rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. In our world, this is correct, but how would isolated magnetic poles affect this? Hmm, wait, in our universe, magnetic monopoles don't exist, but if they did, how would Maxwell's equations change?

Wait, I remember that if magnetic monopoles existed, there would be a similar Gauss's law for magnetism. Because right now, Gauss's law for B is that the divergence of B is zero, which implies no isolated magnetic charges. So if in this universe, magnets can have isolated poles, then divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. So the equation ∇·B = 0 would change, maybe to something like ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So that would change the first equation I thought about, but wait, no, the first equation was about E. The divergence of B is in a different equation.

Wait, the four Maxwell equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (Gauss's law for E)
2. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's law)
3. ∇·B = 0 (Gauss's law for B)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (Ampère-Maxwell law)

So in our universe, equation 3 says divergence of B is zero. If there are magnetic monopoles, equation 3 would change. But what about the others? Let me think. Faraday's law (equation 2) relates E and B. If B can have sources and sinks, does that affect equation 2? Probably not directly, because equation 2 is about the curl of E and the time derivative of B.

Wait, but if B can have sources, then maybe there would be a new term in equation 2. Or maybe not. Let me think about the symmetries. Maxwell's equations are symmetric when you have both electric and magnetic charges. So if magnetic monopoles exist, there should be a term in equation 2 similar to equation 1.

Wait no, equation 2 is about the curl of E. If B has sources, would that change the curl
