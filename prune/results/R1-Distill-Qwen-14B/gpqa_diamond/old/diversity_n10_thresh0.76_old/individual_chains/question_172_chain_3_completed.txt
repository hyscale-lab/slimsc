Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me see. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. They also mention that the photospheres are in LTE, which I think means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium.

Wait, LTE implies that the conditions are such that the gas can be described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, right? So the excitation of atoms depends on the temperature. I remember something about Boltzmann factors determining the population of energy levels.

The Boltzmann distribution equation is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp(- (E_i - E_j)/(k T)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. In this case, the energy difference is given as delta E = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is given.

Let me clarify: the excitation level is the population in a higher energy level compared to a lower one. So for star_1, the population in level i compared to level j is n1_i / n1_j = 2. For star_2, it's n2_i / n2_j = 1 (since it's half as excited? Or wait, star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. So maybe star_2 is less excited, so n2_i / n2_j is 1 or some other number? Wait, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level." So I think the ratio for star 1 is 2, and for star 2 is 1? No, wait no, maybe star_1's ratio is 2, and star_2's ratio is 1. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So for a given energy level, the excitation is higher in star_1. So for that specific level, the population is higher. So perhaps for each star, the ratio is [n_i / n_j] = something.

Wait, maybe it's that the excitation potential is such that the ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, the ratio is [n_i / n_j] = exp(-delta E/(k T)). So for star 1, it's [n1_i/n1_j] = exp(-delta E/(k T1)). For star 2, it's [n2_i/n2_j] = exp(-delta E/(k T2)).

But the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, perhaps the ratio for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. Or maybe star_1 has twice the excitation level. Hmm.

Wait, the question states that the excitation is twice as much. So n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j). Or is it the other way? Let me think. For star_1, the excitation is higher, so the population in that level is higher. So for star_1, [n_i/n_j] is higher.

Wait, but let me get the setup right. Let me denote:

For star 1: n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j)

Because star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. So the ratio is double.

But using the Boltzmann factors, I can write for each star:

n_i/n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) )

Since E_i > E_j, the exponent is positive, so we have:

n_i/n_j = exp( - delta E / (k T) )

Wait, wait, no. Wait, delta E is E_i - E_j. So if E_i is higher, then the exponent is negative. So the ratio is exp(- delta E/(k T)).

So for star_1: ratio_1 = exp( - delta E/(k T1) )

For star_2: ratio_2 = exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

But according to the problem, ratio_1 = 2 * ratio_2.

Wait, no: because star_1 has twice the excitation, so ratio_1 = 2 * ratio_2.

So:

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because if star_1 is hotter, then the ratio would be higher. Because higher temperature would mean more excitation. So if star_1 is hotter, T1 > T2, then delta E/(k T1) is smaller, so exponent is less negative, so exp(...) is larger. So that makes sense.

So the equation is:

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Let me take natural log on both sides.

- delta E/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ - delta E/(k T2) ]

Let me rearrange:

- delta E/(k T1) + delta E/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out delta E/(k):

delta E/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, let me write that as:

delta E/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

So:

delta E/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is interesting because k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Let me compute delta E/(k):

delta E = 1.38e-23 J

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So delta E/k = (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) ) = 1 K.

So delta E/(k) = 1 K.

Substituting back into the equation:

1 * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which rearranges to:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which is the same as our equation. So option D is correct.

Wait, but wait, let me check the options again.

Option D says:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which is exactly what we have here. So the correct equation is option D.


The question involves determining the correct equation for the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is approximately \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann distribution relates the population ratio of two energy levels to the temperature \( T \) as:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)).

For star_1, the excitation level is twice that of star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann distribution for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring the temperature terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E / k = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) / (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) = 1 \, \text{K} \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is given by option D.

Answer: D
