Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and see what I can figure out.

The problem describes a series of reactions and observations involving mixtures X and Y, and a hydrocarbon Z. The goal is to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

First, let's break down the information given.

1. **Mixture X**: It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. So, the liquids in X must have some unsaturation—either double bonds or triple bonds—that react with bromine. Since bromine decolorizes via addition reactions (like alkenes and alkynes) or substitution (like benzene, but that would be much more reactive).

2. **Treatment with Platinum and Heat**: When mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) under heat, a new mixture Y is formed. Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine. So, the reaction is a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but Y is a mixture of two, so maybe each component of X undergoes a disproportionation?

Wait, no. Wait, X is a mixture of two liquids. Each of them might undergo a reaction. Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think.

The reaction with Pt and heat probably involves hydrogenation or some kind of addition. Oh, but wait, the problem says "disproportionation." So, perhaps each component of X is undergoing some kind of redox reaction where they change oxidation states.

Wait, but the result is a mixture Y of two other liquids. So maybe one component of X is getting hydrogenated and the other is getting something else. Or perhaps each component in X is undergoing a reaction that produces two different products, like a disproportionation.

But wait, if X has two liquids, and each undergoes a reaction to form two products each, but the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. That suggests that the overall reaction leads to two products, each formed from X's components. Hmm, maybe each X component is being split into two Y components. Or perhaps each X component is undergoing a reaction, but the mixture ends up having two products in total.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is that each component in X is being hydrogenated in a way that causes a change. But wait, the next step is about the hydrogenation of X and Y with Pt under severe conditions.

Wait, the next part: Hydrogenation of both X and Y in the presence of Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance, hydrocarbon Z. So when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, and same when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, produce the same product Z.

Also, Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent. Hmm, common solvents with high hydrogen content—maybe something like hexane, heptane, or maybe something else. But let's get to that.

Z's mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate that. The mass percent of H is 14.28%, which is roughly 1/7
