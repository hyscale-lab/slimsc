Okay, so I have this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, without any movement, the speed would just be 1/n since c is given as 1 here. But since the glass is moving, things get more complicated.

Oh right, this is probably a problem involving special relativity. Because when the medium is moving, the speed of light as measured in the lab frame isn't just the regular c/n. I think it's something to do with adding velocities relativistically.

So in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula for adding velocities is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, here the light is in a medium, so its speed in the medium is 1/n, and the medium itself is moving at v. But wait, in which direction? The glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.

Wait, let me clarify. The light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at 1/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, we need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me recall: when you have a velocity u in a frame S, and you want to find the velocity u' in frame S' which is moving at velocity v relative to S, the formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(c²)).

But wait, in this case, the medium is moving. So in the medium's rest frame, the light is moving at 1/n. So from the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the medium, the light's speed would be (u + v_medium) / (1 + (u*v_medium)/(c²)), where u is the speed in the medium's frame and v_medium is the speed of the medium relative to the lab.

Wait, but in the problem, the medium is moving in the same direction as the light. So the medium is moving at velocity v (towards the observer), and the light in the medium is moving at 1/n in the same direction. So, from the lab's perspective, the light's velocity is the sum of the medium's velocity plus the light's velocity in the medium, but corrected for relativity.

So applying the formula, u_lab = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²
