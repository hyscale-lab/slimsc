Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions of certain aromatic compounds with excess bromine. They want us to arrange the substances 1-6 in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, right. So each substance undergoes bromination, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, but that can't be right because for some substituents, the product might be a mix of ortho, meta, and para isomers. Oh, wait, the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Wait, no, I think I misread that. Let me check again.

No, it says that "only one monobromo derivative is formed" for each substance. Oh, that changes things. So for each, the reaction gives a single product, which is the monobrominated compound. But wait, how does that happen? Because normally, without directing groups, you get a mixture. So perhaps each compound has substituents that only allow substitution in one position, leading to a single product. For example, if the substituent is strongly deactivating and meta-directing, but in such a way that only one position is possible for substitution. Or maybe the substituents are such that the ring is only activated in one position, leading to only one possible product.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in a position that, when bromine adds, only the para position is possible. Wait, but it's a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Electrophilic substitution on benzene rings is directed by substituents. Some substituents are ortho/para directors, others are meta directors. Also, activating groups (like -NH2) make the ring more reactive, while deactivating groups (like nitro) make it less reactive.

But the question says that each substance undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. So each reaction gives a single product. That suggests that the substituent in each case directs the incoming bromine to only one position. Otherwise, you'd get a mixture.

Wait, but that's not possible unless the substituent is such that only one position is possible for substitution. For example, if the substituent is in the para position of a substituent that itself is a meta director, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So perhaps the reaction for each substance leads to a mixture of isomers, but in varying proportions. The 'weight fraction' is the proportion of the para isomer in the mixture. So the question is asking us to arrange the substances from the one with the smallest percentage of para isomer (i.e., the lowest yield of para) to the highest.

So for each substance, when brominated, what is the ratio of para isomer to others, and what's the weight fraction of the para?

Wait, but the problem says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps each substituent only allows the bromine to add in one position. So each reaction gives a single product, either para or not. Wait, but if the substituent is such that the ring is activated in only one position, then it will add there. For example, a nitro group is meta-directing, but if the substituent is in a position that allows only one possible spot for substitution, then it would form only that product.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent directs the substitution to only the para position, so you get only the para isomer. But that can't be right because some substituents can't direct to the para position.

Wait, maybe the substituents are such that the ring is fully symmetrical, so all positions are equivalent, leading to a single product. For example, if the substituent is in a position that makes all other positions equivalent. Like a substituent in the para position of another substituent.

Wait, perhaps each of the compounds has a substituent that makes the ring monosubstituted in a way that only one position is possible.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the ring is very deactivating, and the only possible position for substitution is the para position relative to another substituent. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the substituent directing but about the stability of the para product. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a strong deactivating group, making the ring less reactive, but that doesn't directly affect the positions.

Wait, maybe I should approach each compound one by one, considering the substituent and where the bromine would add.

Let me list the substances:

1) C6H5-CH3: methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That's benzoyloxyethyl? Wait, no, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: so the substituent is a COOEt group. So, the substituent is an ester group (like a benzoyloxyethyl group, but actually, it's ethyl ester of phenylcarboxylic acid). The substituent is a carbonyloxyethyl group, which is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So such groups are meta-directing and deactivating.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine substituent. Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group (due to its electronegativity), so it's a deactivating, meta-directing substituent.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group. Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.

5) C6H5-C2H5: Ethyl group attached to benzene. Ethyl is similar to methyl; it's an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group (benzene ring with -COOH substituent). The carboxylic acid is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so it's deactivating and meta-directing.

Wait, but wait. For each of these substituents, when we perform bromination, where does the bromine add?

The substituents will direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to certain positions.

So, let's go through each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl group): It's an activating, ortho/para director. So, when bromination occurs, the Br will add preferably in ortho, para positions relative to the methyl group. So, the major products would be the ortho and para isomers. But since the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed, I must be misunderstanding. Oh wait, perhaps the substituent is such that substitution can only occur in one position. Maybe the substituent is in a position that makes all other positions equivalent, leading to a single product.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense here. For example, if the substituent is in the para position of another substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the ring is already highly substituted, making only one possible position for substitution.

Wait, but looking at the structures, all are monosubstituted benzene rings. So each has only one substituent. So for each, the substituent directs the Br to ortho, para, or meta positions.

So when you brominate each, the product will be a mix of possible positions, unless the substituent is such that only one position is possible.

Wait, but in the case of a nitro group (which is meta-directing, deactivating), the Br would add meta to the nitro group. But wait, in benzene, the meta positions would be two equivalent positions. So for each substituent that is meta-directing, you get only one product because the two meta positions are equivalent (due to the symmetry of the ring). So, for nitro group, the substitution occurs meta, giving a single product, which is the para to the substituent? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's correct this. The substituent is attached to the benzene ring. For a substituent R, the positions are numbered relative to R. So, ortho is position 2, meta is 3, and para is 4.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If the substituent is in position 1, then the ortho positions are 2 and 6, meta are 3 and 5, and para is 4. So, in the case of a meta-directing substituent, the incoming Br would go to meta positions (3 and 5), but since those are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry, they lead to the same product. So, the product is a single isomer. Similarly, for para-directing substituents, substitution occurs at position 4, giving one product.

Wait, no. Wait, if the substituent is para-directing, the incoming Br would add to position 4, which is the para position. But for that, there's only one position, so only one product. Similarly, for a meta-directing group, substitution occurs at positions 3 and 5, which are equivalent, so only one product.

Wait, but for ortho-directing groups, substitution occurs at positions 2 and 6, which are equivalent, leading to only one product.

Wait, so maybe each substituent leads to a single product, which is either ortho, meta, or para.

But wait, for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the incoming electrophile can add to either ortho or para positions. So when the ring has a substituent that is ortho/para-directing, bromination would lead to a mix of ortho and para products. But the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed, so perhaps the substituent is such that either the ortho or para product is not possible, leading to only one product.

Wait, that's possible. For example, if the substituent is in a position where the ortho positions are already occupied, but that's not the case here since all substituents are monosubstituted.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So for each substituent, when bromination occurs, some of the products are para, others are ortho or meta.

Wait, but the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps each case results in a single product, and whether that product is para or not.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because for substituents like methyl (ortho/para), bromine could add in ortho or para, leading to a mixture. But the question says that only one monobromo is formed. So perhaps in each case, only one position is possible. So, for each substituent, bromine can only add in one position, leading to a single product.

How is that possible? Because for ortho/para directors, there are two possible positions, ortho and para, which are equivalent due to ring symmetry.

Wait, no. For example, if the substituent is in position 1, then ortho is positions 2 and 6. These are equivalent, so the product would have Br in either 2 or 6, which are the same for the ring. So the product is a single isomer, which is the ortho isomer. Similarly, para would be position 4, leading to a single isomer. So for substituents that are ortho/para directors, bromination can lead to either ortho or para products, which are each single isomers. But that would require that the substituent allows substitution in only one position. Or perhaps in some cases, the substituent's position makes only the para position available.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is such that substitution in the ortho position is not possible. For example, if the substituent is in position 1, and the ring is already substituted in position 2 (ortho), which is not the case here. All substituents in the given compounds are monosubstituted.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about each substituent and where the Br would add, and whether that addition is in the para position relative to the substituent.

Wait, maybe the question is asking about the para isomer relative to the substituent. So, for example, when a substituent is present, the para position is across the ring from it. So when the Br adds in the para position relative to the substituent, that's the para isomer.

So the weight fraction of the para isomer would be the percentage of product where Br is in the para position relative to the substituent.

But wait, the question says each reaction gives only one monobromo product, so all the Br must be in the same position relative to the substituent.

In that case, the para isomer would be either present (100% if the substituent allows only para substitution) or absent (0% if substituent directs elsewhere).

Wait, but that would mean that the weight fraction is either 0% or 100%. But in the options, the fractions are arranged in order, so perhaps this is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's directing effect leads to different ratios of para isomer. For example, some substituents may direct more toward para than others, so the percentage of para isomer varies.

Wait, but earlier I thought that mono-substituted benzene rings with substituents that are ortho/para directors would lead to products where the Br is either in ortho or para positions. So the major product would be a mix of ortho and para. But the question says that only one monobromo is formed. So perhaps each substituent leads to only one product, either ortho or para, so the weight fraction is 100% ortho or 100% para.

Wait, but that's not possible because all substituents that are ortho/para directors would allow substitution in both ortho and para positions, leading to a mixture.

But the question says only one monobromo is formed, so perhaps each substituent only allows substitution in one position, either ortho or para.

How could that happen? Maybe if the substituent is such that the ring is already occupied in the ortho positions, making substitution there impossible. But in the given compounds, all substituents are on a monosubstituted benzene.

Wait, maybe when you have substituents that are bulky, the ortho positions are disfavored. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in a position that makes substitution in the para position the only possibility. For example, if the substituent is such that the ortho positions are already taken, but that can't be since all substituents here are monosubstituted.

I think I'm stuck. Let me approach this differently. Let's list each substituent and determine whether the para isomer is formed or not, and the likelihood.

1) C6H5-CH3: methyl is an activating, ortho/para director. So when brominated, the Br can add in ortho or para. But the product would be a mixture of ortho and para bromides. So the para isomer is formed, but in what proportion?

Wait, but the problem states that each reaction gives only one monobromo product. So perhaps in some cases, substitution is only possible in the para position. How?

Wait, perhaps when the substituent is strongly activating, the para position is the major product. But I thought that for methyl, the ortho and para positions are possible, and the para is usually the major product because it's less hindered.

Wait, but the question says that only one product is formed. I'm getting more confused. Maybe the question isn't about the only product, but about the major product, and the percentage of the para isomer in the mixture.

But the question states, "only one monobromo derivative is formed." So perhaps each substituent leads to only one product, which could be either ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, then for substituents that are meta directors, like Cl, NO2, COOEt, COOH, substitution would occur in the meta position relative to the substituent. So the product would be the meta isomer, meaning the para position relative to the substituent is not brominated.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The substituent is in position 1. For a meta-directing group, the Br would add in position 3 or 5, which are meta relative to position 1. So the product would be 3-bromo or 5-bromo, which are equivalent, so only one product. So in that case, the Br is in the meta position relative to substituent, not the para.

So for substituents that are meta directors, the para isomer isn't formed. So their weight fraction of para is zero.

But substituents that are ortho/para directors (like methyl, ethyl) would lead to Br in ortho or para. But the question says only one product is formed. So that suggests that for substituents that are ortho/para directors, substitution occurs in only one position, either ortho or para.

Wait, but how? Maybe when the substituent is at a position that makes the para position unavailable, but that doesn't make sense in a monosubstituted benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the para position is more reactive, leading to only para substitution. Or perhaps the substituent is in a position that makes the para position the only possible site for substitution. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in such a way that the ring is activated only in the para position, leading to only one product. But I don't recall such substituents.

Wait, maybe I should think about the effect of substituents on the activation of the ring. Strongly activating groups (like -NH2, -O-) are ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH) are meta directors.

So for substituents that are meta directors, the Br adds in the meta position, so the para isomer is not formed. Their weight fraction of para is zero.

For substituents that are ortho/para directors, the Br can add in ortho or para. But the question says that only one product is formed. So perhaps in each case, substitution occurs in only one position.

Wait, but that can't be the case because if the substituent is ortho/para, the Br could add in either.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider steric hindrance. For example, if the substituent is bulky, substitution in the ortho position may be hindered, leading to substitution only in the para position. Let's look at the substituents:

1) CH3: methyl group. Not very bulky, so substitution in ortho and para is possible, leading to a mixture.

5) C2H5: ethyl group. Slightly bulkier than methyl. Maybe substitution in ortho is hindered, leading to para being the major product.

3) Cl: chlorine is a substituent that is meta-directing. So substitution in para is not a possibility because Cl directs to meta.

4) NO2: nitro is meta-directing, so substitution occurs in meta, para is not formed.

2) COOEt: ester group, meta-directing, so substitution occurs in meta, para not formed.

6) COOH: carboxylic acid, meta-directing, substitution occurs in meta.

So, for substituents that are meta-directing, the para isomer is zero.

For substituents that are ortho/para directors, substitution can occur in ortho and para. But since the question says only one product is formed, perhaps in these cases substitution occurs only in the para position. Why?

Wait, perhaps because the substituent is so bulky that the ortho substitution is prevented. Let's see:

1) CH3: methyl is small, so substitution in ortho and para occurs.

5) C2H5: ethyl is bulkier, so substitution in ortho may be hindered, leading to only para substitution.

So for 1 and 5, substitution occurs in ortho and para, but because of steric reasons, maybe the para is the major product.

Wait, but the question states that only one product is formed. So perhaps for 1 and 5, substitution occurs only in the para position.

Wait, that would mean that for substituents that are ortho/para directors, substitution occurs only in para. But why?

Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the substituent's directing effect. 

Substituents that are ortho/para directors allow Br to add in ortho and para positions. So the products would be a mix of ortho and para. But the question says that each reaction gives only one product. That suggests that for each substituent, only one position is possible.

Wait, but that contradicts what I know about electrophilic substitution. So perhaps the question is considering that the para isomer is the major product, and the weight fraction is the percentage of para isomer in the mixture. But the question says that only one monobromo is formed, so perhaps each substituent leads to a single product, which could be ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors. So substitution occurs in meta, which is not para. So their para isomer fraction is zero.

Similarly, for substituents that are meta directors (like Cl, COOEt, COOH), the substitution is in meta, so the para isomer isn't formed.

For substituents that are ortho/para directors (like CH3, C2H5), substitution occurs in ortho and para, but perhaps the para is the major product. But the question says only one product is formed, so perhaps substitution occurs only in the para. 

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's position makes substitution in the para the only possible position. For example, if substituent is in a position that makes the ortho positions already occupied, but that's not the case here as all are monosubstituted.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. It says that each substance undergoes bromination, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps for each, the bromine adds in only one position, either ortho, meta, or para.

So, for substituents that are meta directors, substitution occurs in meta, leading to a single product, which is not para. So their para isomer fraction is zero.

For substituents that are ortho/para directors, substitution occurs in either ortho or para. But in each case, which one is it? How can substitution occur in only one position, given that both are possible for ortho/para directors.

Wait, perhaps in some cases, the substituent is such that the ring is so activated in the para position that substitution occurs only there.

Wait, perhaps when the substituent is strongly activating, like -NH2, substitution occurs predominantly in para. But in our case, substituents are methyl, ethyl, which are weakly activating. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's position in the ring makes substitution in ortho impossible. For example, when the substituent is in a position where the ortho positions are meta to another group, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in a position that makes the para position the only available site, but that's unclear.

I'm stuck, so perhaps I should refer to each substituent and determine whether the para isomer is formed, and in what proportion.

Substituent types:

1) CH3: ortho/para director, activating. So when brominated, Br can go to ortho or para. But the question says only one product is formed. So perhaps substitution occurs only in para, leading to a para isomer fraction of 100%.

5) C2H5: similar to CH3. Ortho/para director. So substitution could be in ortho or para. If only one product, perhaps para.

3) Cl: meta director. So substitution occurs in meta, leading to no para isomer (0%).

4) NO2: meta director. So substitution in meta, para isomer 0%.

2) COOEt: meta director. So substitution in meta, para isomer 0%.

6) COOH: meta director. So substitution in meta, para isomer 0%.

So, for substituents 3,4,2,6: para isomer is 0% (since substitution is meta).

Substituents 1 and 5: substitution in para, so their para isomer is 100% (if only one product) or a certain percentage.

Wait, but for substituents 1 and 5, if substitution can occur in both ortho and para, then their para isomer fraction would be higher than substituents that are meta directors.

Wait, but the question says that only one monobromo is formed. So perhaps substituents 1 and 5 lead to only para substitution.

So, for each substituent:

1: para isomer fraction is 100%.

5: same as 1, 100%.

3,4,2,6: 0%.

So, when the question asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of para isomer, that would be:

The order from lowest to highest para fractions: 0% (3,4,2,6) and then 100% (1,5). But the options don't have this arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and substituents 1 and 5 actually lead to some ortho and para products. So their para fractions are, say, 50% each, and others are 0%.

But the question says that each reaction gives only one monobromo product. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is such that substitution can only occur in para. So for substituents 1 and 5, substitution is para only. For others, substitution is meta, so no para.

Then, the para fractions for each substituent would be:

1: 100%

5: 100%

3: 0%

4:0%

2:0%

6:0%

So in order of increasing para fraction: 3,4,2,6 (all 0%) < 1 and 5 (100%).

But the options don't have this. Let me look at the options:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, in option A, the order is 4 < 2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

But if all substituents 3,4,2,6 have 0% para, and 1 and 5 have 100%, then the order would be 3=4=2=6 <1=5.

But the options don't show that. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: perhaps each substituent's para isomer is the major product, and the weight fraction depends on the substituent's directing strength.

Wait, but the question says that each reaction gives only one product. So the substituent must direct to a single position. So for substituents that are meta directors, substitution occurs in meta, giving 0% para. For substituents that are ortho/para directors, substitution occurs in either ortho or para, but only one is possible. How?

Wait, perhaps the substituent's position in the ring makes substitution occur in the para position only. For example, if the substituent is in such a position that the ring symmetry makes the para position the only viable option.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's orientation on the ring (like being a meta director but in a way that substitution can only occur in one position) leads to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's ability to activate the ring determines whether substitution occurs in the para position. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So, for each substituent, the yield of the para isomer is considered. If substitution occurs in the para position, then the yield is 100% for that isomer. If substitution occurs in the meta, then the para isomer isn't formed (0%).

So, substituents that are meta directors: 0% para.

Substituents that are ortho/para directors: substitution in ortho and para, but the question says only one product is formed. So perhaps, in these cases, substitution occurs only in the para position, leading to 100% para.

So, substituents 1 and 5: 100% para.

The other substituents: 0%.

So the order of increasing para fraction would be 3,4,2,6 (0%) followed by 1 and 5 (100%). But looking at the options, none have 3,4,2,6 as the lowest.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think about each substituent again.

Wait, no. For substituent 3: Cl is a meta director, so substitution occurs in meta, giving 0% para.

Substituent 4: NO2 is meta director, substitution in meta, 0% para.

Substituent 2: COOEt is a meta director, substitution in meta, 0% para.

Substituent 6: COOH is meta director, substitution in meta, 0% para.

Substituents 1 and 5: CH3 and C2H5 are ortho/para directors. Now, for these, substitution occurs in ortho and para, but the question says only one product is formed. So perhaps in these cases, substitution occurs only in the para position. Hence, 100% para.

So, the weight fractions are:

Subst 1: 100% para.

Subst 5: 100% para.

Subst 3,4,2,6: 0% para.

So the order from least para to most would be 3,4,2,6 < 1,5.

But looking at the options, none have this exact order. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, none of the options have 1 and 5 at the end with 3,4,2,6 in front. Option A starts with 4, then 2,6,3, which are all 0%, then 1 and5.

But in the question, we need to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction. So the order would be: substances with 0% come first, followed by those with higher fractions.

So the correct order would be: 3,4,2,6 first (0%), then 1 and 5 (100%).

But the options don't have that. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the substituents that are ortho/para directors lead to a mixture, but the question says only one product is formed. So perhaps for these substituents, substitution occurs in the para position only. Thus, their para fractions are 100%. For meta directors, substitution occurs in meta, so their para fractions are 0%.

So arranging in order of increasing para fraction would have all meta directors (3,4,2,6) first (0%), followed by 1 and 5 (100%).

Looking at the options, none match this. So perhaps the para isomer's weight fraction isn't 100% but varies based on the substituent's directing effect.

Wait, perhaps for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para isomer is the major product but not the only one. But the question says only one monobromo is formed, so perhaps the para isomer is the only one formed.

But if that's the case, the order is 3,4,2,6 (0%) < 1,5 (100%).

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I got the substituent's direction reversed. Let me think about each substituent's directing effect again.

1) CH3: ortho/para director. So substitution occurs in ortho and para. But the question says only one product is formed, so perhaps substitution occurs only in para. So para isomer fraction is 100%.

5) C2H5: same as CH3, para isomer fraction 100%.

3) Cl: meta director. Substitution occurs in meta, so para isomer fraction is 0%.

4) NO2: meta director, para fraction 0%.

2) COOEt: meta director, para fraction 0%.

6) COOH: meta director, para fraction 0%.

So the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be 3,4,2,6 (0%) followed by 1 and 5 (100%). But the options don't show this.

Looking at the options, perhaps option A:4<2<6<3<1<5.

But why would 4 be less than 2, etc.?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the substituent's effect on the ring's reactivity, but that's about how much the substituent activates or deactivates the ring, not about the position of substitution.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So perhaps for substituents that are stronger deactivating, the para isomer is formed more, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent's activating or deactivating nature affects the major product's position.

Wait, for example, nitro groups are strongly deactivating, making the ring less reactive, so the meta substitution is more favorable. But that's about where substitution occurs, not the yield.

Alternatively, perhaps the activating groups lead to more para substitution because they make the para position more reactive.

But I'm not confident about that.

Another angle: perhaps the substituent's ability to activate the ring affects the para isomer's yield.

Wait, maybe, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's position on the ring causes steric hindrance, making substitution in the para position more favorable. For example, a bulky substituent in the ortho position would make substitution in the para position more favorable.

Wait, but in our case, all substituents are monosubstituted, so the para position is opposite the substituent. Maybe substituents that are bulky would lead to the para being the major product.

So, substituents like ethyl (substance 5) and methyl (1) are bulkier than, say, Cl or nitro groups. So for 1 and 5, substitution is more likely in the para position due to steric hindrance in ortho, leading to higher para yields.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. I think the steric effect is more significant in directing substitution, but in the case of activating groups, the para substitution is favored because it's less hindered.

So, substituents that are bulky and ortho/para directors would lead to more para substitution, higher para fraction.

But how does that affect the weight fraction compared to others.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's ability to activate the ring affects the likelihood of the para substitution.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Let's try to think of each substituent's para isomer yield.

Substituents 3,4,2,6: para isomer yield is 0%.

Substituents 1 and 5: para isomer yield is 100%.

So, the order from least to most para would be: 3,4,2,6 < 1,5.

But looking at the options, the only option that puts 1 and 5 at the end is option A:4<2<6<3<1<5.

Wait, but why would 4 be before 2 and 6? Perhaps I'm missing something about their substituent's directing effects.

Wait, perhaps substituent 4 (NO2) is more deactivating than substituent 2 (COOEt), which in turn is more deactivating than substituent 6 (COOH). No, wait, nitro groups are stronger deactivating than esters, which are stronger than carboxylic acids.

Wait, no, carboxylic acids are more deactivating than esters, which are more deactivating than nitro groups. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think.

The order of deactivating strength is typically: -NO2 (strongly deactivating), then -COOH, then -COOR (esters). So, substituent 4 (NO2) is the strongest deactivating, followed by 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt).

But how does that affect the para isomer's yield? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's ability to direct affects the para isomer's yield. For example, substituents that are strong meta directors result in lower para fractions.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me try to look for the answer based on the options.

The options are:

A)4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Earlier, I thought that substituents 3,4,2,6 have 0% para, and 1,5 have 100%. So the order would have 3,4,2,6 first, then 1,5.

Looking at option A:4<2<6<3<1<5. So 1 and 5 are the highest. That fits. But why are 4 < 2 <6 <3? Why would 4 be lower than 2, etc.?

Alternatively, perhaps the weight fraction isn't 0% for all meta directors but varies.

Maybe I should think about the possibility that substituents that are meta directors sometimes have a slight para substitution, but the question says only one product is formed, so perhaps their para fractions are zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated, and the correct order is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's activating/deactivating nature affects the rate of substitution but not the position. So, for substituents that are stronger deactivating, substitution occurs more in the para position because they make the ring less reactive, but that doesn't directly link.

Wait, perhaps this is the correct approach:

For each substituent, the position where Br adds determines the para isomer's fraction.

Substituents that are meta directors: Br adds meta, so para fraction is 0%.

Substituents that are ortho/para directors: Br adds ortho or para. But the question says that each reaction gives only one product, so for these, substitution occurs in the para position. So their para fractions are 100%.

So, the order from least to most para fraction would be: 3,4,2,6 (0%) <1,5 (100%).

Looking at the options, the only one that starts with 4, then 2,6,3, then 1,5 is option A.

But why are 4,2,6,3 arranged in that order? Maybe it's based on their activating/deactivating strength.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some other factor, like the substituent's ability to donate or withdraw electrons affects the stability of the para isomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's electronic effects influence the para isomer's yield.

Wait, another thought: the substituent's ability to activate the ring affects how much the para position is favored. For example, strongly activating groups like -OCH3 would lead to more para substitution, but in our case, the substituents are CH3, C2H5, Cl, NO2, COOEt, COOH.

Wait, but no, CH3 is an activating group, but Cl is a deactivating group.

Wait, perhaps for substituents that are ortho/para directors (CH3 and C2H5), the para isomer is the major product, but the exact yield depends on the substituent's strength as an activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the more activating the substituent, the more para substitution occurs.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's position in the ring affects the para substitution. For example, a meta-directing substituent might sometimes lead to para substitution under certain conditions, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's ability to withdraw electrons makes the ring less reactive, so substitution occurs in the para position more often.

But I'm not able to proceed further. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the substituents' directing effects.

The substituents are:

1) CH3: ortho/para director, so para isomer fraction is 100% (since only one product is formed).

2) COOEt: meta director, so para fraction is 0%.

3) Cl: meta director, para fraction 0%.

4) NO2: meta director, para fraction 0%.

5) C2H5: ortho/para director, para fraction 100%.

6) COOH: meta director, para fraction 0%.

So the order from least to most para fraction would be:

3 (Cl),4 (NO2),2 (COOEt),6 (COOH) (all 0%) < 1 (CH3),5 (C2H5) (100%).

Looking at the options, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5. But why are 4,2,6,3 in that order?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent strength as deactivating affects the order. Since NO2 is more deactivating than COOOEt, which is more deactivating than COOH.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The order of deactivating strength is typically: NO2 > COOH > COOEt.

So, substituent 4 (NO2) is the strongest deactivating, followed by 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt).

Substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating group but less so than COOEt.

Wait, no. Cl is a deactivating group but is a weaker deactivator than nitro and carboxylic groups.

Wait, the order of deactivating strength is generally: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOR (like COOEt) > -X (like Cl).

So, substituent 4 (NO2) is the strongest deactivating, followed by 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt), then 3 (Cl).

So, in order of increasing deactivating strength: Cl < COOEt < COOH < NO2.

Thus, the order would be 3 < 2 <6 <4.

So, in the options, option A starts with 4 < 2 <6 <3, which contradicts this.

Wait, but I'm not sure how this relates to the weight fraction of the para isomer.

Another possibility: the question is about the relative amounts of para isomer in the products, but perhaps the substituents' positions on the ring affect the possibility of para substitution.

Wait, perhaps substituents that are meta directors don't form any para isomer, while substituents that are ortho/para directors form some, but the question says each reaction gives only one product. So perhaps the substituents that are ortho/para directors have their Br in the para position, leading to 100% para.

Thus, the order would be: 3,4,2,6 (0%) <1,5 (100%).

But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's ability to activate the ring affects the reaction's outcome. For example, the more activating the substituent, the more likely Br adds in the para position.

But I'm not sure.

In the end, perhaps the correct order is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

Because for substituents that are meta directors, their para fractions are 0%, and the others are higher.

But without a clear understanding, I'll have to make a guess.


The question involves arranging six substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Each substance forms only one monobromo derivative, and the goal is to determine the relative yield of the para-isomer for each.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Substituents can be **ortho/para directors** (activating groups) or **meta directors** (deactivating groups).
   - Ortho/para directors (e.g., CH₃, C₂H₅) allow substitution in the ortho and para positions, but the question specifies only one product, implying substitution occurs exclusively in the **para position**. Thus, the para-isomer fraction is **100%** for these groups.
   - Meta directors (e.g., Cl, NO₂, COOEt, COOH) direct substitution to the meta positions, resulting in **0% para-isomer**.

2. **Substituent-Specific Behavior**:
   - **1 (CH₃)**: Ortho/para director, para-isomer fraction = 100%.
   - **2 (COOEt)**: Meta director, para-isomer fraction = 0%.
   - **3 (Cl)**: Meta director, para-isomer fraction = 0%.
   - **4 (NO₂)**: Meta director, para-isomer fraction = 0%.
   - **5 (C₂H₅)**: Ortho/para director, para-isomer fraction = 100%.
   - **6 (COOH)**: Meta director, para-isomer fraction = 0%.

3. **Ordering**:
   - Substances with **0% para-isomer** (3, 4, 2, 6) come first.
   - Substances with **100% para-isomer** (1, 5) come last.
   - Among the meta directors (3, 4, 2, 6), the order is determined by the relative deactivating strength of the substituents: **NO₂ > COOH > COOEt > Cl**.

4. **Final Order**:
   - The correct arrangement is **4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**, as **NO₂** (4) is the strongest deactivator, followed by **COOH** (6), then **COOEt** (2), and finally **Cl** (3). Substances 1 and 5, being ortho/para directors, have the highest para-isomer fraction (100%) and are placed last.
