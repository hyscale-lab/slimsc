Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully again.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The key points are:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2.
- The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2.
- The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is related to its temperature. The formula is Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.
- The radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. Wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But for calculating luminosity, I think the Doppler shift might come into play. Because if the star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted wavelengths could be shifted, but the question states that the observed wavelengths at maximum brightness are the same. But wait, wait. The original emission peak would be at the same λ, but if their velocities differ, wouldn't their observed peak wavelengths change? But the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. Hmm, but the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So perhaps the observed λ_max is the same, but their rest λ_max might be different because of their velocities. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think.

Wait, but the problem says the stars radiate as black bodies. So perhaps we should consider their intrinsic properties (temperature, radius) and then account for any Doppler shift in their observed brightness. But since the observed wavelengths are the same, that might imply that their rest wavelengths are the same, or that the Doppler shift brings them to the same observed λ_max.

Let me think again. The peak emission wavelength is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T. If both stars have the same observed λ_max, but if they're moving towards or away from us, their actual temperatures could be different. But the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same. So perhaps the Doppler effect is causing their emitted λ_max to shift to the same observed wavelength.

So the Doppler shift formula is: observed wavelength λ = λ0 * sqrt[(1 + v_r)/(1 - v_r)] , where v_r is the radial velocity (assuming non-relativistic speeds, which is probably the case here since 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light, but wait, the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.23% of c, so maybe non-relativistic approximations are okay? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe the problem expects us to use the relativistic Doppler formula. Let's see.)

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the
