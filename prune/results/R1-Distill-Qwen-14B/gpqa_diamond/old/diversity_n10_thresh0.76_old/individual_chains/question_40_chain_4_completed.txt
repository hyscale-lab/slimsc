Okay, so I need to figure out this chemistry question. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about two chemists talking as they leave a lab. One asks how it went, and the other says, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other." Hmm, what does that mean?

I remember that in the lab, when compounds stick together or don't separate, it could have to do with their physical properties. If the compounds are on top of each other, maybe they're not separating during a reaction or a purification process. 

Looking at the options:

A) Similar polarities. Polar compounds might interact via dipole-dipole forces, but if they have similar polarities, would that cause them to stick together? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason.

B) Bonding through non-covalent interactions. Non-covalent like van der Waals, hydrogen bonds, etc. If the compounds have such interactions, they might stick together, making it hard to separate them. That sounds plausible.

C) Similar boiling points. If their BP is similar, they might not separate during distillation. But the statement is about being on top of each other, which might relate more to physical state or interactions rather than separation during a process.

D) Similar optical rotations. That's about chirality and their direction of rotation. I don't see the connection to them sticking together physically.

So, the chemist's compounds are "on top of each other." That suggests they're not separating, possibly because they're interacting strongly. Non-covalent interactions would make them stick together. So option B is likely the answer.

Wait, another angle. Maybe it's about chromatography? If the compounds have similar properties, they might elute together. But the question doesn't mention chromatography, just that they are on top of each other, which sounds more like physical aggregation rather than separation in a process.

So, non-covalent interactions (B) would cause them to clump together, making it hard to isolate them. So the answer should be B.


The chemist's statement that their compounds are "on top of each other" suggests that the compounds are not separating, likely due to strong interactions between them. Among the options, non-covalent or van der Waals interactions (option B) are the most plausible explanation, as these forces can cause compounds to stick together, making it difficult to isolate them. Other options, such as similar polarities (A), similar boiling points (C), or similar optical rotations (D), do not directly explain the physical aggregation described.

Answer: B
