Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let's see, the options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D corresponding to them.

The question gives four scenarios, each describing a planet with certain characteristics. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, to find the highest density, I think I need to calculate the density for each option.

Let me list out each option again:

a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. I think that's right because Earth is made of rock and metal.

b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait, no. Wait, option b says the density is 5.5. So that might not be the right approach. Or does it? Wait, no. Wait, the question is asking which has the highest density, so if one is given a density, then maybe that's the answer. But wait, no, wait. Or maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me read the options again correctly. Option b says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, so if the density is given as 5.5, then that's the planet's density. So, that's option b.

But wait, other options might have higher densities. Let me think.

Option c) same composition as Earth, 5 times Earth's mass. So same composition, so same density as Earth, which is 5.5?

Wait, wait, same composition as Earth. So if it's more massive but same composition, same density. So the density would be same as Earth's, which is 5.5.

Option d) same composition as Earth, half the mass. So same density again, 5.5.

Wait, but wait, option a is same as Earth, so 5.5. Option b's density is given as 5.5. So why is option b an option? Unless I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The question says, which has the highest density. So for each option, I need to compute the planet's density and compare.

Let me go through each option:

Option a: Mass = Earth mass (M_e), radius = Earth radius (R_e). So volume is
