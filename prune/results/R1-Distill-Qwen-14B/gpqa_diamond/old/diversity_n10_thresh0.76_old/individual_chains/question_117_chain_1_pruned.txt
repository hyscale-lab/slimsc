Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question lists four compounds and asks which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each a combination of these. Let me think about each compound one by one.

First, what's optical isomerism? Oh right, it's a type of stereoisomerism where compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, leading to different optical properties. This can happen due to chirality, which requires a tetrahedral chiral center. Alternatively, things like allenes or certain rings (like in some cyclohexanes) can have axial chirality, but I think those are less common. Also, some compounds can show optical isomerism due to other factors, like meso compounds, but only if they have multiple stereocenters.

Let me go through each compound:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
Hmm, okay, so this is a biphenyl compound with substituents. Let's break it down. The biphenyl ring has two phenyl groups connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 6 and 2 on each phenyl. Wait, but looking at the substituents, we have two nitro groups at 6 and 6', and two carboxylate groups at 2 and 2' on each ring. 

Wait, so the structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond, and each has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester (since it's the dimethyl ester). So the question is whether this structure allows for any stereoisomerism. Since the rings are connected by a single bond, they can rotate relative to each other. But for biphenyls, sometimes the substituents create a scenario where the molecule can have axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral.

In this case, the substituents are in positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me imagine the structure: each phenyl has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. The two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So when the rings rotate, the substituents could be arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry or not.

Wait, but if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule chiral, then it can have optical isomers. For biphenyls, the presence of substituents in certain positions can lead to cis and trans configurations. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe this compound has a plane of symmetry. Let me think about the substituents. Each phenyl has a nitro and a COOCH3 group. If the substituents are in positions that are symmetric, then the molecule might not be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are opposite each other, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, if each phenyl group has a nitro and a COOCH3, and they are placed in positions that mirror each other, the molecule might not be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the entire molecule chiral, then it would have optical isomers.

I'm not entirely sure about this one. Maybe it's better to come back after checking the others.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So the propanoate ester has a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. Let's see the structure: the propanoate would be CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, noâ€”propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but
