Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these phosphate equilibrium concepts. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. We're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO₄³⁻, at 25°C. The given Ka values for H₃PO₄ are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. I remember that orthophosphate is the conjugate base after deprotonation. So the species involved in the solution are H3PO4, H2PO4⁻, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But wait, in this solution, we have KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. So those are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2- respectively.

I think this is a buffer solution problem because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. But wait, in this case, which one is the acid and which is the base in their respective salts?

KH₂PO₄ is potassium hydrogen phosphate. It dissociates into K+ and H₂PO4⁻. H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, which can act as an acid (donate a proton) to become HPO4^2- or as a base to become H3PO4.

Similarly, Na₂HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which dissociates into Na+ and HPO4^2-. The HPO4^2- ion can act as an acid (donate a proton to become H2PO4^-) or a base (gain a proton to become PO4^3-).

Wait a second, so the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. The H2PO4^- can donate a proton (so it's a weak acid) and HPO4^2- can accept
