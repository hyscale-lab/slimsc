Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. Oh wait, wait. A 6-membered ring with two substituents and 8 carbons total. So the ring itself is 6 carbons, and each substituent adds one each. So each substituent is one carbon? Or maybe one of them is a larger group.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: the substituents might have more than one carbon each, but the total is still 8. So the ring is 6, plus two substituents totaling 2 more, so each substituent is one carbon. But wait, that might not make sense if one substituent is a carbonyl group. Let me think.

The peaks in the FTIR indicate a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the molecule has both a carbonyl and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, there are two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like maybe a ketone, or an ester, etc.), and the other is a halogen (Cl, Br, I, but likely Cl or Br because those are more common).

Wait, but wait, the total carbons are 8. The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Each substit
