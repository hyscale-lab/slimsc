Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's try to understand it step by step. So the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle meet, they annihilate and produce energy, usually in the form of photons.

Alright, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron, which is the antimatter counterpart of an electron, is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. So they're approaching each other, right?

After colliding, they annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but their directions are measured as one moving upper-right and the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. So the key points here are conservation laws. Specifically, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Since the photons are moving in opposite directions in some sense (upper-right and lower-right), their momenta must add up to conserve the total momentum of the system before the collision.

Let me think about the initial momentum. The electron and positron have their own momenta. The Lorentz factor (gamma) is given for each. The electron has gamma =4, so its momentum is gamma*m*v. Similarly, the positron has gamma=2.

But wait, wait. The positron is moving in the opposite direction to the electron. So, if the electron is moving to the right (from left), the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their velocities are in opposite directions.

But when it comes to momentum, I should consider the direction. Let's set up a coordinate system where the positive x-direction is to the right.

Electron (e-): moving from left to right, so positive x direction. Its momentum is p_e- = gamma * m_e * v.

Positron (e+): moving from right to left, so negative x direction. Its momentum is p_e+ = gamma * m_e * v (but in the negative x direction).

Wait, but wait. The mass of an electron and positron is the same. So m_e is the same for both.

But wait, the Lorentz factors are different. For the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, it's 2.

Wait, but to find their velocities, perhaps I should compute their speeds. Because gamma depends on velocity.

But maybe it's easier to compute total relativistic momentum. Because the momenta are vectors, so their directions matter.

Wait, the electron is moving to the right, so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative.

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e- - p_e+.

But wait, because their velocities are in opposite directions, their momenta are in opposite directions. So I need to compute each momentum as a vector.

Let me compute each momentum magnitude:

p_e- = gamma_e * m_e * v_e-

p_e+ = gamma_p * m_e * v_p

But since gamma is 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron, and the velocities are in opposite directions, the total initial momentum would be (gamma_e * m_e * v_e-) - (gamma_p * m_e * v_p) ?

Wait, no. Because the positron's velocity is in the negative x-direction, so its momentum is negative. So the positron's momentum is -gamma_p * m_e * v_p, where v_p is its speed magnitude. So the electron's momentum is positive, the positron's is negative.

Wait, but how do the speeds relate? Because gamma depends on the speed. So perhaps I can express the momenta in terms of gamma.

Wait, for a particle, the momentum p is gamma * m * v. But v can be expressed in terms of gamma and m. Alternatively, since beta = v/c, and gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). But maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate the energies. Because in the center of momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. But in this case, the initial momentum isn't zero because the two particles have different gammas and velocities.

Wait, but when they annihilate, they produce two photons. And the photons have equal energy but different directions. But their momenta vectors must sum up to the initial total momentum. So the sum of the photons' momenta equals the initial total momentum.

Moreover, since photons' energy and momentum are related by E = pc (because for photons, m=0, so E² = (pc)² + (mc²)² → E = pc). So each photon's momentum magnitude is E/c.

But in this problem, both photons have the same energy, so their momentum magnitudes are equal. Let me denote the energy of each photon as E. Then their momenta are E/c each. But their directions are such that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So their momenta vectors are symmetric about the x-axis.

Wait, perhaps. Let me imagine the x-y plane. Photon 1 is moving upper-right, so its momentum vector has positive x and positive y components. Photon 2 is moving lower-right, so positive x and negative y components. Or wait, no. Upper-right could imply both positive x and positive y, lower-right would be positive x and negative y.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the initial momentum was in the x-direction, but the photons' momenta have both x and y components. So how does that work?

Wait, no, because the photons are moving in directions that are not purely along the x-axis. So their momenta will have both x and y components.

Since their energies are the same, E1 = E2 = E. The momenta magnitudes are the same: p1 = p2 = E/c.

Each photon's direction is determined by an angle. Let's say photon 1 is at an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 is at an angle theta below the x-axis. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

Wait, but if the directions are upper-right and lower-right, then perhaps the angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So if one is at angle theta from the x-axis upwards, the other is at theta from the x-axis downwards.

But the problem states that one is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right. So they are symmetric about the x-axis.

So their y-components would be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

So when we sum their momenta, the y-components will cancel out. Because p1y = + (E/c) sin(theta), p2y = - (E/c) sin(theta). So p_total y = 0.

But wait, that can't be right because the initial total momentum in the y-direction is zero. So that makes sense.

But in the x-direction, their momenta add up. So p_total x = (E/c) cos(theta) + (E/c) cos(theta) ) = 2 (E/c) cos(theta).

This must equal the initial total momentum in the x-direction.

Now, the initial total momentum is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron.

Let me compute that.

Electron's momentum: p_e- = gamma_e * m_e * v_e-

Positron's momentum: p_e+ = gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But since it's moving in the opposite direction, p_e+ is negative. So total initial momentum: p_initial = p_e- - p_e+.

Wait, but the positron is moving in the negative x-direction, so its momentum is negative. So the total is p_initial = p_e- + (-p_e+) = p_e- - p_e+.

So I need to find the values of p_e- and p_e+.

But how? Well, gamma is given for each. So gamma_e =4, gamma_p=2.

The momentum p = gamma * m_e * v.

But v can be expressed in terms of beta and c, where beta = v/c.

And gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So let's compute beta_e and beta_p.

For the electron: gamma_e =4.

beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

So p_e- = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = gamma_e * m_e * (beta_e c) = gamma_e beta_e c m_e.

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2.

beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660 c.

p_e+ = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p c.

So let's compute the momenta.

p_e- = 4 * (sqrt(15)/4) c m_e = sqrt(15) c m_e.

Wait, let's compute it more carefully.

gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(1 - (1/4^2)) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4.

p_e- = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 m_e * (beta_e c) = 4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4 c) ) = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Similarly, p_e+ = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 m_e * (beta_p c) = 2 m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c) ) = m_e sqrt(3) c.

So the electron's momentum is sqrt(15) c m_e, and the positron's is sqrt(3) c m_e. But the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. So p_initial = p_e- - p_e+ = sqrt(15) c m_e - sqrt(3) c m_e.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so when adding, it's subtracted.

So p_initial = p_e- - p_e+ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c m_e.

Wait, no. Wait, the positron's momentum is in the negative x direction, so p_e+ is negative. So p_initial = p_e- + p_e+ (since p_e+ is negative).

Wait, let me think again. Let's say the electron is moving to the right (positive x), so p_e- is positive. The positron is moving to the left (negative x), so its momentum p_e+ is negative. So p_initial = p_e- + p_e+.

So p_initial = sqrt(15) c m_e + (- sqrt(3) c m_e ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c m_e.

Wait, that's what I had earlier. So p_initial = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c m_e.

Wait, but sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(15) minus sqrt(3) is about 2.14, which is positive. So the initial momentum is positive, meaning in the direction of the electron's motion.

Now, the total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' momenta. Each photon has momentum E/c (because E=pc for photons). Let me denote the energy of each photon as E.

So the momentum of each photon is a vector: for the first, (E/c) [cos(theta), sin(theta)] and for the second, (E/c) [cos(theta), -sin(theta)].

So the total momentum after annihilation is:

p_photon_total = [ E/(c) ( cos(theta) + cos(theta) ), E/(c) ( sin(theta) - sin(theta) ) ].

The y-components cancel, as expected. So p_photon_total = [ 2 E cos(theta)/c , 0 ].

Wait, no. Wait, the sum of the y-components is E/c sin(theta) + (-E/c sin(theta)) =0. So yes, the y-component is zero, which makes sense because the initial y-component was zero.

The x-component is E/(c) ( cos(theta) + cos(theta) ) = 2 E cos(theta)/c.

This x-component must equal the initial x-component of the system's momentum, which was (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c m_e.

So:

2 E cos(theta) / c = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c m_e.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about units.

Wait, the momentum in the initial system is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c m_e. The momentum after is 2 E cos(theta)/c.

But we can equate the magnitudes. So:

2 E cos(theta) / c = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c m_e.

Wait, but E is the energy of each photon. But the electron-positron system annihilates into two photons, so the total energy is the sum of the rest masses plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, wait. The rest mass energy of the electron and positron together is 2 * m_e c². But since they're moving, their total energy is higher.

So the total energy before annihilation is the sum of their relativistic energies.

Electron's energy: E_e- = gamma_e m_e c² =4 m_e c².

Positron's energy: E_e+ = gamma_p m_e c² =2 m_e c².

So total initial energy: 4 m_e c² +2 m_e c²=6 m_e c².

Since energy is conserved, the total energy after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' energies. So 2E =6 m_e c² → E=3 m_e c².

Ah, that's a crucial point. So each photon has energy E=3 m_e c².

So plugging back into the momentum equation:

2 * (3 m_e c²) * cos(theta) / c = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c m_e.

Simplify left side:

2 *3 m_e c² * cos(theta) /c = 6 m_e c cos(theta).

So:

6 m_e c cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c m_e.

We can cancel c and m_e from both sides:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.

Let me compute this value.

Compute sqrt(15): about 3.87298.

sqrt(3): about 1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 -1.73205 ≈2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6≈0.35682.

So cos(theta) ≈0.35682.

What angle has a cosine of approximately 0.35682?

Well, I remember that cos(60°)=0.5, cos(70°)≈0.3420. So 0.35 is between 60 and 70, closer to 70.

Wait, 0.35682 is approximately 0.357, which is about 70 degrees?

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute theta = arccos(0.35682).

Using a calculator: arccos(0.35682) ≈69 degrees.

Wait, let me compute it:

cos(69°) is about 0.3584.

Wait, 0.3568 is close to that. So theta is approximately 69 degrees.

Wait, but wait. Because the electrons' motion is such that the initial momentum is in the x-direction, and the photons' momenta are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

Wait, but each photon has an angle theta from the x-axis. But the problem states that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So each photon's direction is theta above and below the x-axis, respectively.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the total momentum after is 2 E cos(theta)/c, which equals the initial momentum.

But in our calculation, theta was the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. So the two photons are at +theta and -theta.

Thus, the angle between the two photons' directions would be 2 theta.

Because one is at +theta, the other at -theta, so the angle between them is 2 theta.

So if theta is approximately 69 degrees, the angle between them would be 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138. So the answer is C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any error in the calculations.

Let me recompute cos(theta):

sqrt(15)= ~3.87298

sqrt(3)= ~1.73205

sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)= ~2.14093

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6= ~0.35682.

So cos(theta)=0.35682 → theta ≈69 degrees.

So the angle between them is 2 theta → 138 degrees.

So the correct answer is C) 138.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, producing two photons of equal energy. The key principles are conservation of energy and momentum.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum
The electron and positron move along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, respectively. Their momenta are calculated as:

- **Electron's momentum**:  
  \[
  p_{e^-} = \gamma_{e^-} \cdot m_e \cdot v_{e^-} = 4 \cdot m_e \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}c\right) = \sqrt{15} \cdot m_e \cdot c
  \]

- **Positron's momentum**:  
  \[
  p_{e^+} = \gamma_{e^+} \cdot m_e \cdot v_{e^+} = 2 \cdot m_e \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c\right) = \sqrt{3} \cdot m_e \cdot c
  \]

Since the positron moves in the opposite direction, its momentum is subtracted. The total initial momentum is:  
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_{e^-} - p_{e^+} = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \cdot m_e \cdot c
\]

### Step 2: Energy Conservation
The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron:  
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_{e^-} \cdot m_e \cdot c^2 + \gamma_{e^+} \cdot m_e \cdot c^2 = 4m_e c^2 + 2m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2
\]

After annihilation, this energy is converted into the energy of two photons:  
\[
2E = 6m_e c^2 \implies E = 3m_e c^2
\]

### Step 3: Momentum Conservation
The photons move symmetrically about the x-axis, with equal magnitudes of momentum \(p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{3m_e c^2}{c} = 3m_e c\). Let the angles of the photons with respect to the x-axis be \(\theta\) (upper-right) and \(-\theta\) (lower-right). The total momentum in the x-direction is:  
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_1 \cos\theta + p_2 \cos(-\theta) = 2 \cdot 3m_e c \cdot \cos\theta
\]

This must equal the initial momentum:  
\[
2 \cdot 3m_e c \cdot \cos\theta = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \cdot m_e \cdot c
\]

Simplify:  
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}
\]

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \(\theta\)
Using approximate values:  
\[
\sqrt{15} \approx 3.872, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732
\]
\[
\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 3.872 - 1.732 = 2.140
\]
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{2.140}{6} \approx 0.3567
\]

The angle \(\theta\) is:  
\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Angle Between Photons
The photons are symmetric about the x-axis, so the angle between them is:  
\[
\text{Angle} = 2\theta = 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138°**.  
**Answer: C**
