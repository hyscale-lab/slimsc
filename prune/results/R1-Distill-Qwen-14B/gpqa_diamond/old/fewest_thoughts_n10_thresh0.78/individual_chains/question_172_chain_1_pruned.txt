Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me think. I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution from my chemistry class. Oh right, it's about how particles distribute in energy states at thermal equilibrium. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level is higher in star_1. I think the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The formula I remember is the ratio of populations in two energy states. The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy state to a lower one is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)), where g is the statistical weight. 

Wait, in this case, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the ratio of the populations is 2, since star_1's atoms are twice as excited. So if I let star_1 be state 2 and star_2 be state 1, their ratio would be n2/n1 = 2. But I'm not sure if they're the same element, but the question says iron, so same element, same ionization state probably. So g would be the same for both, because same energy levels. So the ratio is just exp(ΔE/(k T)) or something like that.

Wait, let's get the formula right. The Boltzmann factor is for the relative populations between two energy levels. So the ratio n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since both stars have the same energy levels, g_i = g_j, so the ratio simplifies to exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). 

In this problem, star_1 has n1 and star_2 has n2. But wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So maybe the higher energy state is what's being compared. Let's clarify. Let's say the two energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 higher than E1.

So, for star_1, the population of E2 is twice that of E1 (assuming E2 is the excited state). Wait no, actually, the question says
