Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, blue dithiocyanato complexes. I remember that in cobalt complexes, the color can change based on the ligands. Dithiocyanato might mean complexes with two SCN- ligands. But I'm not entirely sure which complexes are which. Oh right, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where n varies.

Stability constants, β, are given for each complex. The stability constant indicates how stable a complex is; a higher β means a more stable complex. So, β1 is the constant for the first complex, which would be CoSCN^2+ (assuming it's a +2 charge), β2 for the next, like Co(SCN)_2^0, β3 for the next, and β4 for the highest complex, maybe Co(SCN)_4^2-?

But wait, I should confirm the charges. Each SCN- is -1. So, Co^2+ with one SCN- would be CoSCN^+, which doesn't make sense because 2+ + (-1) = +1 charge. Oh, wait, maybe it's a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ where n ranges. Hmm, but the charge would then be 2+ plus n*(-1), so for n=1, [CoSCN]^+; n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0; n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^-; and n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the stability constants are given in order β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β3 is the largest, which means the [Co(SCN)_3^-] complex is the most stable. That's interesting because usually higher stability constants mean more stable, so the most of that would form. But the question is about dithiocyanato complexes, which would be n=2, right? Because di- implies two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which has a stability constant β2=40.

Wait, but that can't be right because β3 is larger. So the most prevalent would be the one with the highest β. But the question is about dithiocyanato, which is n=2, so β2=40. So maybe the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where m depends on n.

But I'm a bit confused about the charge. Let me try to think again. The general formula for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^k+ would be: Co^2+ has a +2 charge, each SCN- adds -1. So the total charge is 2+ - n*(1-) = 2 - n. So for n=1, [CoSCN]^+; n=2, Co(SCN)_2 → neutral; n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^-; and n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β3 is the largest. That would suggest that the [Co(SCN)_3^-] is the most stable. So the majority of Co would be in that form. But the question is about the dithiocyanato, which is n=2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the distribution of each complex in solution. The problem is that multiple complexes can form, and the one with the highest stability constant might not necessarily dominate if the ligand concentration isn't high enough.

So the approach would be to find the fraction of each complex in the solution. Since the total cobalt is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the concentration of Co, so the formation of complexes is favored.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the stability constants and the concentrations of the
