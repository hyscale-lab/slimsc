Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because these synthesis problems can get tricky. Let me take it step by step.

The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options give different sequences of reactions, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let's break down the target molecule. The substituents on the benzene ring are:

1. Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at position 1.
2. tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2.
3. Nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering might be important. Let me visualize the structure. If I number the benzene ring such that the ethoxy is at position 1, then the tert-butyl would be at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a meta arrangement with respect to each other.

Now, thinking about the synthesis steps. Since benzene is the starting material, we'll need a series of electrophilic substitutions. Each substituent will be added in a specific order because the order affects the positions where the next groups attach.

I remember that activating groups (like -OCH3, which is an activating, ortho/para-directing group) facilitate the next substitution, while deactivating groups (like -NO2, which is a strong deactivating and meta-directing group) make the ring less reactive and direct the next substituent to specific positions.

Wait, but wait, the substituents on the benzene are a mix. Let's think about their order of addition.

Let me list the substituents:

- Ethoxy (OCH2CH3): This is an activating group, ortho/para-directing.
- tert-Butyl: This is a strong activating group (tertiary butyl is bulky but still activating because it's an alkyl group), so it's ortho/para-directing.
- Nitro: A deactivating, meta-directing group.

But wait, the nitro group is deactivating, so it should be added before activating groups to control where the activating groups attach because once you add a deactivating group, it affects the positions where the next substituent goes.

Alternatively, the order may depend on which substituent is added first. Hmm.

Let's consider the directing effects.

If we add the ethoxy group first, it would be activating, so the next substituent (like nitro) would be directed ortho or para. But wait, nitro is a strong deactivating group, which is typically added under nitrating conditions. But if I add the nitro group after the ethoxy, the ethoxy directs it to ortho or para. But I need the nitro to be at position 3 relative to the ethoxy at position 1. Let me think about the numbering.

Wait, let's imagine the benzene ring. Let's say the ethoxy is at position 1. If the next substituent is nitro, it would go either at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, nitro is at position 3. Hmm, that's a problem because if ethoxy is at 1 and nitro is at 3, that's meta to each other. But ethoxy is ortho/para-directing. So that suggests that the nitro group must have been added before the ethoxy group. Because if the nitro is added first, it's deactivating and meta-directing. Then, the ethoxy would add either ortho or para to the nitro.

Wait, but let me think again. If I add the nitro group first, then the ethoxy would be added in the next step. Nitro is meta-directing, so the ethoxy would go into a position that's meta to the nitro.

Wait, but the target has ethoxy at
