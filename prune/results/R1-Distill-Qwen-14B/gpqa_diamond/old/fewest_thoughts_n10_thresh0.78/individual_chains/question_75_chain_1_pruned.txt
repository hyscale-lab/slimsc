Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the transgenic mouse model. Let's see what the problem says.

The researcher introduced a coding sequence for GADD45G into a plasmid, modified to include a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine and selected resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

The plus strand sequence is provided. Let me read through it. The start is ATG, which is the methionine for the start codon. Then the next codons are TAC (tyrosine), CC (proline), ATACG (wait, ATAC is I think Ile-Thr-Ala? But wait, each codon is three letters. Let's break it down.

Wait, the initial part: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the first codon is ATG (Met), then TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), then TAC (Tyr) again, GAT (Asp), G (wait, how? Oh, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me write it out.

Looking at the sequence:

Wait, that's a long sequence. So the start is ATG, which is correct. But let me look for any in-frame stop codons, because if there's a stop codon (like TAG, TGA, or TAA) in the reading frame, the ribosome would terminate early, and the protein wouldn't be full-length.

So let's translate it step by step.

Looking at the sequence:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T C C A G A TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTT CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC TGG CGG TGC GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACG CTG ATC CAG GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACG ATC GAC ATG TGT GCG CGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTT GCA CTG CAT CCT C AT TCG AAC CCC CAA CGA GGA CGC CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CTT GGA GAA GCT CAG CCT GTT T TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC TCT CCC GAG TGA

Each group of three is a codon.

Looking for any of the stop codons: TAG, TGA, TAA.

Looking through the codons:

The sequence near the end: ... CAG CTT GCA CTG CAT CCT C AT TCG AAC CCC CAA CGA GGA CGC CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CTT GGA GAA GCT CAG CCT GTT T TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC TCT CCC GAG TGA

Wait, so the very last part is TGA. Right before that is TCT CCC GAG TGA.

So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh wait, but TGA is the stop. So where is the stop codon in the sequence?

Wait, the sequence ends with ...TGA. Let me count from the end.

The last part of the provided sequence is:

...ACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, the last 12 nucleotides before the end are: GAG TGA.

Wait, no, looking again, the end is:

...GAGTGA

So the last codon is GAG (glutamic acid), then TGA. Wait, no, the last part is TGA. Let me see: the last few cod
