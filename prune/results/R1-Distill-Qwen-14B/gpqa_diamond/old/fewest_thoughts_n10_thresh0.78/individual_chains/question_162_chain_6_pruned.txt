Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element in two dimensions. I remember that in general relativity or differential geometry, the metric tensor describes the geometry of space. So this is probably a 2-dimensional metric, right?

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a hyperbolic sphere. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact properties.

From what I recall, the area of a sphere in 2D (which is a circle) is 2πr. But this is a pseudosphere, which I think has a different formula. Or wait, wait—maybe it's about the total area in the space described by this metric. Because sometimes the metric can represent a space with a certain curvature, and the area calculation depends on that.

So first, let me try to understand the metric. The given metric is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let's write that as ds² = [32/(A)] (dx² + dy²), where A = 4 - x² - y².

Wait, the denominator looks like 4 - (x² + y²). So that
