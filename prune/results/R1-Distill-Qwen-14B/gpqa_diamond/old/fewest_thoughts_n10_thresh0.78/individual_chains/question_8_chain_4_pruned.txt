Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm, let's see.

So the setup is that they found three genes, G1, G2, G3, and made knockouts. Then they tested the resistance of the mutants and some double mutants. The question is about what conclusions we can draw about their interactions.

The data given are the resistance percentages compared to the wild-type control. Wild-type is 100%, so higher means more resistance, lower means more susceptible.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% → less resistance than wild type.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible.
- g3: 50% → halfway resistance.
- Double mutants:
  g1g2: 0% → no resistance.
  g1g3: 10% → very low.
  g2g3: 0% → no resistance.

Wait, and the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So probably, one is a regulator.

So I need to model the gene interactions based on the data.

Let me think about epistasis and redundancy. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that suggests epistasis. For example, if g2g3 is 0% like g2, then perhaps G3 is epistatic to G2 or vice versa.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% same as g2. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is as bad as g2 alone. So maybe G1 is downstream of G2? Because if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then knocking out G2 would cause more problems, and G1 being downstream wouldn't add much when G2 is already gone. Wait, but g1 alone is 75%, which is better than g2's 0. So maybe G2 is upstream of G1. Because if G2 is a transcription factor for G1, then without G2 (g2), G1 isn't expressed, so the plant is more susceptible. But wait, g1 is a single mutant, so if G2 is upstream, then knocking G1 would still allow G2 to function, but perhaps not, because G1 might be the target. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about each gene's effect.

G2's single mutant is 0% → very severe. So G2 is probably a key gene; maybe the transcription factor, because if it's upstream, the downstream genes might not be expressed.

G1 mutant is 75% → still some resistance. So maybe G1 contributes but isn't the only one.

G3 mutant is 50% → less than G1 but better than G2.

Now for the double mutants:

g1g2 → same as g2 (0%). So if you have both g1 and g2, the resistance is as bad as g2. That suggests that G1's function is redundant or that G1 is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is a transcription factor for G1, then without G2, G1 can't function, so knocking out G1 as well doesn't change the situation; you already can't activate it.

Similarly, g1g3 is 10%. So without G1 and G3, the resistance is worse than either single (g1 is 75, g3 is 50). But 10% is worse than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 have some additive effect, but when both are gone, the effect is much worse.

g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So double mutant g2g3 is as bad as g2, which suggests that G3 is not adding anything beyond G2. Maybe G2 is upstream of G3, so without G2, G3 can't function either.

Wait, but G3's single mutant is 50% which is better than G2's 0%. So without G3, the resistance is half. Without G2, it's zero.

So perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates G3 and G1. Let's think: G2 is a TF; G1 and G3 are downstream.

In that case, if G2 is knocked out (g2), then G1 and G3 can't be expressed, so the plant can't resist the disease → 0% resistance.

If G1 is knocked out (g1), then G2 is still present and can activate G3. So resistance is 75% – maybe G3 contributes 50% (since g3 is 50%) and G1 contributes another 25% (because 75% - 50% = 25%). So G1 adds to the resistance.

If G3 is knocked out (g3), then G2 is fine and can activate G1, leading to 75% (since G1 contributes 75% when G3 is knocked out? Or wait, maybe when G3 is knocked out, G1 is still active. So G1 provides 75% and G3 provides 25% (since 75 is G1, but in g3, only G1 is active, so 75% is G1's contribution).

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3: both G1 and G3 are knocked out. Then, resistance is 10%, which is much lower than either single. But if G2 is a TF, then without G2, you can't get any activation. But in this case, G2 is functional because it's not knocked out. So why is the resistance so low?

Hmm, maybe the model is different. Maybe G2 is a TF for G1, which in turn is a TF for G
