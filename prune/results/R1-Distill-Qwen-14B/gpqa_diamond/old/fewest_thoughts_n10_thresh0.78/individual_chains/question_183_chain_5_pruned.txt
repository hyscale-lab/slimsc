Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slowly.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. The reactant given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus with HI is usually used for the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe for some other elimination reactions. Wait, no, wait. Oh right! Red phosphorus is often used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for ketones to get rid of the carbonyl. Alternatively, wait, another reaction comes to mind: maybe it's about the hydrolysis of nitriles, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can cause the cleavage of certain groups.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclohexene ring with substituents. Let me draw the structure mentally. The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). Then, substituents are at carbon 2 (formyl group) and carbon 5 (vinyl group). Oh wait, wait: wait, 2-formyl means the formyl is on carbon 2. 5-vin
