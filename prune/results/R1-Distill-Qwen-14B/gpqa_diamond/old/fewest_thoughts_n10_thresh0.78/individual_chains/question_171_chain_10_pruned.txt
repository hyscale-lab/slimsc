Okay, so I have this chemistry question about electrophilic substitution reactions, and I need to figure out the order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer for each substance when bromine is added in excess. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question lists six substances, each with a benzene ring attached to different groups. The task is to arrange them from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer. So I need to determine the directing effect of each substituent because that affects where the bromine will add—either para, meta, or ortho.

Wait, right. Electrophilic substitution reactions are directed by substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups activate the ring and are ortho/para directors. Electron-withdrawing groups deactivate the ring and can be meta directors. But wait, some deactivating groups are still ortho/para directors if they are strong enough, but I think that's only for groups like nitro which are meta directors. Wait, no—nitro is a strong deactivating and meta-directing group. Similarly, carbonyl groups are deactivating and meta-directing.

So let me list each substituent and their directing effects:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron donor (it's an alkyl group with +I effect). So it's an ortho/para director.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: Wait, that's benzoyloxy attached to ethyl? No, wait, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh wait, no, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Wait, no, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5? Or maybe it's an ester group. Wait, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the compound is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5, which would be benzoyloxyethyl? Or wait, perhaps it's an ester, like the benzoyl group connected via an oxygen to an ethyl. So the substituent is O-CO-C6H5? No, wait, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So the structure is benzene ring with a group that's a carbonyloxyethyl? Or perhaps it's a benzoyloxy group attached to ethyl. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is benzene with a substituent which is a carbonyl group connected to an ethoxy. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write it properly.

The formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Hmm, so perhaps it's benzene with a group: (CO-O-C2H5) attached. So the substituent is a carbonyl connected to an ethoxy group. Wait, no. Let's see: C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh, wait, that's more like benzene connected to a carbonyl group (CO), which is then connected to an O-C2H5. So the substituent is O-CO-C2H5? Or wait, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh no, that's probably the structure: benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyloxy group attached to ethyl. So the substituent is O-CO-C2H5.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as the benzoyloxy group (O-CO-C6H5) but in this case, it's O-CO-C2H5? No, wait, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So benzene ring (C6H5) is attached to a CO group, which is attached to an O-C2H5. So the group is (CO-O-C2H5), which is an ester group. So the substituent
