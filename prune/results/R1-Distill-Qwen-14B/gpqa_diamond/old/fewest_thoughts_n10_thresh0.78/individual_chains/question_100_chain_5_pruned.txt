Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem starts with compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Then it undergoes bromination in CCl4 to form compound B. Following that, B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. Then, C is passed through a red-hot iron tube to produce D. Then, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. E, in the presence of iron scrap and HCl, forms F. F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Finally, G reacts with NaOH to form H. And the question is asking which statement about the products is incorrect.

I need to figure out each step to identify the products and then check each option against them. Let's break it down.

First, compound A is C3H6. The molecular formula for C3H6 is interesting because it could be either propene (which is an alkene) or cyclopropane, which is a cyclic compound with three-membered ring. But wait, cyclopropane is pretty stable, but more importantly, when it comes to bromination, alkenes typically undergo addition reactions. So I think A is propene, which is CH2=CH2CH3. Wait, no, propene is actually CH2=CHCH3. So A is propene.

Bromination of propene (an alkene) in the presence of CCl4 would likely be an addition reaction. CCl4 is a solvent, so the bromine (Br2) would add across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane. Alternatively, if it's not a symmetric addition, maybe it's 1,1-dibromopropane, but wait, propene has two possible positions for addition. Let me think. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? Wait, no, propene is CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. So when Br2 adds, it would add to the double bond, making either 1,2-dibromopropane. Because propene is CH2=CH2CH3, the addition would result in CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, wait. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3; adding Br2 across the double bond gives CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait no, because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So adding Br across would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next step: B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to an elimination reaction, E2 mechanism. So when 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate one molecule of HBr, but wait, wait, with two bromines, it can eliminate twice? Or maybe it's a di-elimination? Let me think. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, no, the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3? No, wait, the structure of 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, no, wait. Let me write it properly.

Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 to that would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because each Br would take a position on adjacent carbons.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds, it's an anti addition, so the two Br atoms would add to adjacent carbons, making 1,2-d
