Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about the decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is for the interaction between X and fermions, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to determine which decay options are possible kinematically at the lowest order.

First, I remember that for a particle to decay into a pair of fermions (like a quark-antiquark pair or lepton-antilepton), the mass of the boson has to be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because in particle physics, the decay products' rest masses can't exceed the mass of the parent particle. So the condition is m_X ≥ 2m_f, where m_f is the mass of the fermion.

Looking at the Lagrangian, it's given by L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, that doesn't look quite right. Oh, I think it's probably a typo or formatting issue. The correct form for a Yukawa interaction would be something like L = λ X ψ ψ, where ψ is a fermion field. So the interaction term is X ψ ψ, meaning that X can decay into two fermions, like ψ and ψ-bar.

So the boson X interacts with fermions f, and the possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs. So we're looking for all fermion pairs where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, each fermion has a mass, and because they come in pairs, the total rest mass for the pair is 2*m_f. So X can decay into any fermion f and its antiparticle f-bar, provided that 2*m_f ≤ m_X.

Now, m_X is 6 GeV. So each fermion's mass must be ≤ 3 GeV. Let's list the masses of the known fermions:

- Up quark (u): ~1.5 GeV (but sometimes the mass is given as around 2.2 MeV, but wait, wait. Wait, I think I'm mixing up. Let me think: up and down quarks are the lightest, with masses around a few MeV. The charm quark (c) is about 1.5 GeV, bottom (b) is around 5 GeV. The top quark is super heavy, about 173 GeV. For leptons, the electron is ~0.0005 GeV, muon ~0.1 GeV, tau ~1.78 GeV. Neutrinos are even lighter, but we can ignore them for this as the interaction term probably doesn't include them.

Wait, but let me be precise. Let me list the masses:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV = 0.0022 GeV
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV = 0.0047 GeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV = 0.1 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, but wait. Some sources might have different values. For example, the strange quark is about 95-100 MeV, so 0.095-0.1 GeV. The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, but maybe I'm mixing up. Oh well, I think for the sake of this problem, the exact masses of the quarks are given in some standard way.

So, the condition is that 2*m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So, which fermions have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Looking at all the fermions:

Electron: 0.0005 GeV → yes.
Muon: 0.105 GeV → yes.
Tau: 1.777 GeV → yes, since 1.777 < 3.
Up quark: ~0.0022 GeV → yes.
Down quark: ~0.0047 GeV → yes.
Strange quark: ~0.1 GeV → yes.
Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV → yes.
Bottom quark: ~4.7 GeV → 4.7*2=9.4 GeV >6 GeV → no.
Top quark: way too heavy.

So possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e-
μ+ μ-
τ+ τ-
u u-bar
d d-bar
s s-bar
c c-bar

Wait, but wait: for quarks, you have to consider that they are confined, but in terms of decay products, X can decay into a quark and antiquark. But in practice, when you have a boson decaying into quarks, it's likely to produce a jet (two quarks), but for the purposes of this problem, I think the question just wants the possible fermion pairs, regardless of whether they're quarks or leptons.

Now, among the options given, let's look at each option.

Option A: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar
