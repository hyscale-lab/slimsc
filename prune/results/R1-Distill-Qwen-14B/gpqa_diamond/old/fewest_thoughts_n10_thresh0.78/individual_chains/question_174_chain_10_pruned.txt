Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear fission, and I need to figure out the difference between the correct kinetic energy and the classical approximation. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other, and together their rest masses sum up to 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, and then compare it with the classical approximation to find the difference.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero. That means the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me denote the rest masses. Let me call the two fragments as m1 and m2. Given that m1 is twice m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Because the sum is 99% of M.

So, let's set up the equations. Let me let m2 = x. Then m1 = 2x. So, m1 + m2 = 3x = 0.99 M. So x = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M. So m2 is 0.33 M, m1 is 0.66 M.

Wait, but wait. The initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. But after fission, the total rest mass is 0.99 M c², which is 297 GeV. So the mass deficit is 3 GeV, which must be converted into kinetic energy and any binding energy (but the problem says to ignore electrons, so perhaps we can assume that all the missing mass goes into kinetic energy? Or maybe the binding energy is negligible, or perhaps the kinetic energy comes from that missing 3%? Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of energy and momentum conservation.

But since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission is zero. So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, if I denote the velocities as v1 and
