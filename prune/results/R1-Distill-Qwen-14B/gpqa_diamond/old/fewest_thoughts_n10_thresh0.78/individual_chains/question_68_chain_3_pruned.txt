Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let me read it again.

The problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. So mu = γ S_z. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillating. What's the oscillation frequency?

Hmm. I remember that in such situations, when the magnetic field changes, the spin precesses around the new field direction. Spin precession... right, like how a top spins around a vertical axis if you nudge it.

Wait, but the initial state is aligned with the Z field. When the field switches to Y, the system is suddenly changed. So the state of the spin might not be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. That would cause it to evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

Let me think about the energy levels. The original Hamiltonian is H_initial = -γ B S_z. The eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies proportional to +1/2 and -1/2 (since spin 1/2, S_z is ħ/2 times those). 

After the magnetic field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -γ B S_y. Oh wait, no, because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, but when the field is along Y, the interaction is mu dot B, which would be gamma (S · B). So if B is along Y, then H_final is -gamma B S_y. Or wait, wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is -mu · B. So if B is along Y, the energy is -gamma B S_y.

But in quantum mechanics terms, the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y. 

The initial state is |+z>, because the particle was aligned with the Z field. So the new Hamiltonian's eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

Now, when you have a state that's a superposition, it'll evolve over time. The expectation value of an observable (like S_z) will oscillate if the state is a combination of energy eigenstates with different energies.

So let me write the initial state as |psi(0)> = |+z>.

The eigenstates of H_final are |+y> and |-y>. To find the expansion, I need to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

I remember that the eigenstates of S_y are superpositions. Specifically, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). Wait, no, wait—that's if we're writing them in terms of S_z eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of
