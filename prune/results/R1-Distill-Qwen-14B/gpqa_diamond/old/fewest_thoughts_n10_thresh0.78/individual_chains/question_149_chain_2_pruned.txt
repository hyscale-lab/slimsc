Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR shows something unexpected. The spectrum looks right except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and roughly equal integrals, together adding up to 1H. So, that suggests maybe something is causing the proton to split into two, but the integrals are equal, which could mean they're not each a part of a singlet but maybe a doublet or something else.

They also say that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Wait, so if it's not spin-spin coupling, what else could cause two peaks for the same proton? Oh, maybe it's some kind of splitting from the environment, like if the proton is in a different configuration in different molecules in the sample.

Looking at the LC-MS part: the crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. That's interesting because if it's the same mass, the peaks must be from the same compound, but different forms. Or perhaps they're isomers but with the same molecular weight. Wait, but if the mass is the same, maybe it's not a different molecule but something else, like enantiomers or diastereomers.

So, let's think about the options. The options are A to D, each a different possibility.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different molecular weight. The LC-MS shows the same mass, so A is probably not correct because a precursor would have a lower mass, not the same.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight and same physical properties except for direction of rotation and how they interact with chiral environments. In NMR, enantiomers would look identical because the NMR can't distinguish them unless you have a chiral environment. Wait, but in an achiral environment, if the sample is a racemic mix, the NMR would show the same as a single enantiomer. Unless the sample is impure with something else. But the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. Wait, but if it's a racemic mix, the NMR shouldn't split into two. Unless maybe the sample is a diastereomer? No, enantiomers wouldn't cause that. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, another thought: in an NMR, if the molecule is chiral and the sample is a racemic mix, the peaks could be split due to the presence of a diastereotopic proton. Wait, no, maybe not. Or perhaps if the environment is causing splitting.

Wait, but the question says that the two peaks are from the same alpha-proton. So in a racemic mixture, each enantiomer's NMR would look the same, so the integral would be the same as a pure sample. So why would there be two peaks for the same proton? Maybe that's not the case. Maybe it's a different issue.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Double coupling refers to a situation where a proton is coupled to two different sets of equivalent protons, causing splitting. But the question mentions that spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause. So if it's not
