Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should prioritize observing it. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since it orbits faster. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. But despite that, both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that might mean that Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, which might make it a bit larger, but in this case, both have same radii. So, the size of the stars isn't a factor in differentiating here.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. The main one is the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. If the orbit is edge-on, the planet will transit. But how likely is that? The probability is roughly proportional to (R_planet + R_star) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, the probability is more accurately given by the formula P ≈ (R_star) / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so it simplifies. So P ≈ (R_star) / a.

Wait, but that's the geometric probability. Because for a given star and planet, the chance that the orbit is aligned such that it transits is (R_star / a). Because the planet's orbit must lie in a very specific plane relative to us. So higher a (more distant planet) gives lower probability, and larger R_star gives higher probability.

Wait, but let's think about the relation between the semi-major axis and the orbital period. Kepler's third law comes into play here. The formula is a³ = (G(M_star + M_planet) * P²) / (4π²). But since the planets have the same mass and the stars have different masses, the semi-major axes will be different.

Wait, but the mass of the planet is much smaller than the star's mass, right? Because for exoplanets, the planet's
