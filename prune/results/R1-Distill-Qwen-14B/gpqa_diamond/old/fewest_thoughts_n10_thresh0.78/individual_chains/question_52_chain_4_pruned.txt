Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, so the problem is about a star with specific characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They want to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels in a star's photosphere can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels based on their temperatures. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels (level 1 and level 2) is being considered. So, I think the ratio would be n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Wait, when spots are present, the effective temperature of the photosphere drops. So when the star has spots, the Teff is 5500 K, and without spots, it's 6000 K.

Wait, but wait: the overall photospheric effective temperature. Oh, but dark spots are cooler regions. So, the average Teff of the star's surface would be lower when spots are present. But the star's photosphere itself might have
