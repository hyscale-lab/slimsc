Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules have two atoms connected by a bond, and their motion can be modeled using quantum mechanics when considering both rotation and vibration. 

The question is asking about the momentum of a photon that needs to be absorbed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would be the first excited state. 

The molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, noâ€”wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model. So this model includes both rotational and vibrational energy levels. But sometimes people use the rigid rotor model for rotation, but since this is the non-rigid one, maybe the bond length can change a bit? Or does that affect the problem? Not sure yet.

The problem gives me masses of the two atoms, X and Y. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. 

I need to find the momentum of the photon. Oh, right, photons carry energy and momentum. The energy of the photon would be related to the energy difference between the two states of the molecule.

Wait, when the molecule absorbs a photon, it's going to transition from one energy state to another. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between these two states. But the question is about the momentum, not the energy. Since momentum p
