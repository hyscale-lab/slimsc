Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question involves two reactions and the reagents needed for each. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, which produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with sodium cyanide, what usually happens? Oh, I remember, that's a nucleophilic addition reaction. Ketones can undergo addition reactions with nucleophiles like CN-.

So the reaction would be the addition of CN- to the carbonyl group. Let me think about the mechanism. The ketone's carbonyl is attacked by the cyanide ion, which would form a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is a compound where the carbonyl has added a hydroxyl group and a cyanide group.

Wait, but butan-2-one structure is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butan-2-one is four carbons, so the product has four as well. Oh wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile—so the structure is CH2(C)(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile would have four carbons, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methyl. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is correct.

So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. This usually requires an acid catalyst. Wait, because the cyanide is a weak nucleophile. In aqueous conditions, it can't attack the carbonyl effectively. So you need an acid to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, so that the CN- can attack.

Wait, but wait, sometimes when you have a base, but wait, no—the NaCN is a source of CN- which is a strong nucleophile but a weak base. Hmm. Wait, in the presence of H3O+ (like in acidic conditions), the carbonyl becomes a better electrophile. So A is H3O+ perhaps?

So for reaction A, the reagent is H3O+ as a catalyst. So looking at the options: option A and B have A as H3O+. Option C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Hmm, but wait another thing. Sometimes, when the ketone is treated with NaCN and H2SO4 (or another acid), it forms the cyanohydrin. So that makes me think that A is H3O+ or H2SO4. So in the options, the possible choices are A or B for A being H3O+.

So moving on to the second reaction. The product from the first reaction, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, is treated with reagent B and H2O, to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, no, wait a minute. Wait, no, the first product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. But in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Oh, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Wait, the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the second reaction is a nitrile (butanenitrile) being converted to a carboxylic acid. Oh, right! That's the hydro hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. What reagents are typically used for that?

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic or basic conditions. Typically, under strong acidic conditions with heat, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you might get a different product, like a carboxylate salt.

Wait, but the product here is a carboxylic acid. So the hydrolysis would require an acid catalyst. So what's the usual reagent? I think HCl is often used in acidic hydrolysis of nitriles. Or maybe other acids like H2SO4.

But wait, another point: in some cases, especially when you have a hindered nitrile, like if there's a bulky group, you might need a strong acid. Or sometimes, other catalysts are used.

Looking at the options, the reagents B are either HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid). So for the second reaction, B is the reagent, and H2O is present.

Wait, the first part of the question is Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

Reaction 2: product (2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile) + B (H2O) → another product.

Wait, no, wait. The first reaction is butan-2-one (which is a small molecule) reacting with NaCN and A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with a more complex molecule: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So perhaps the second reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is probably an acid, like HCl or acetic acid.

Wait, but when H2O is present, and B is a catalyst, the conditions are either acid-catalyzed or base-catalyzed. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, it's likely acidic conditions. So B would be HCl or another acid.

So putting it together.

Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+
