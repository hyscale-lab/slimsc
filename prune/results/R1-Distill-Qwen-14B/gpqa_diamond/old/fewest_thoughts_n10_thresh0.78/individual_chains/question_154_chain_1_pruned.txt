Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the chemist found a white solid, and we have to figure out what it is using the spectral data provided. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best.

First, let me look at the mass spectrum. The molecular ion is at m/z 156, which is 100%. There's another peak at 158 with 32%. Hmm, the molecular ion is usually the highest point, so the molecule's molecular weight is 156 g/mol. The 158 peak is probably a fragment or maybe an isotope. Wait, chlorine has a significant natural abundance. Chlorine-35 is about 75%, Cl-37 is about 25%. So maybe the molecular ion is 156, but then adding an extra Cl would give 158. Let me check: if the molecular formula has one Cl, then the isotopic peaks would be at 156 (for Cl-35) and 158 (Cl-37), assuming it's a molecule with one Cl. The relative intensities would be 75% and 25% for the two isotopes. But wait, the given peaks are 100% at 156 and 32% at 158. Hmm, that doesn't align directly. Maybe it's something else, like a fragment.

Next, looking at the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. That usually suggests an -OH group because O-H stretches in alcohols or carboxylic acids are broad. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have O-H (broad) and a carbonyl around 1700, maybe a bit higher if it's an ester or acid chloride. Wait, benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1680-1720, I think. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an ester or acid chloride could also show a peak around there.

Now, the 1H NMR. Let's go through it.

11.0 ppm singlet, 1H. That's a strong downfield shift. Probably an aldehyde proton? Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe a carboxylic acid -OH proton. But wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, not a singlet. Oh wait, the OH in a carboxylic acid is usually a broad peak, but in the NMR, it's shown as a singlet here. Maybe it's not an -OH. Hmm. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is usually a singlet but around 9-10 ppm. Wait, 11 is a bit high for an aldehyde. Could it be an acidic proton, like a phenol? No, phenols are more around 5-7 ppm. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. Or perhaps a carbonyl oxygen is affecting it. Wait, another possibility is a ketone, but that doesn't have a proton. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH as in a benzoic acid, but if the solution is in D2O or if it's an exchange, maybe it's a singlet. Though I'm not sure. Let me think more.

The next peaks: 8.02 ppm doublet (2H), and 7.72 ppm doublet (2H). These are in the aromatic region. The doublets suggest coupling between two protons each. So maybe a para-substituted benzene. The two doublets with 2H each could indicate two substituents on the ring. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons adjacent to substituents would be as a doublet. For example, in para-substituted rings, the two sets of doublets would each have two protons each, like in para-xylene. Here, the substituents would be in the para positions, and the protons next to them would be in doublets.

Putting this together: the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each meta to each other. Wait, no, wait: if it's para, then the substituents are opposite each other, but the protons are in positions ortho and meta. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me visualize. If the substituents are para on the benzene ring, then the adjacent (ortho) protons would be equivalent, and the protons in the meta positions would couple with each other. So for example, in a para-disubstituted benzene, you would have two sets of doublets, each integrating for two protons. That makes sense with the NMR given.

Now, looking at the possible options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzene ring with Cl at position 3, OH at 2, and aldehyde at position 1. Wait, numbering might be different. Alternatively, maybe it's 2-hydroxy-3-chlorobenzaldehyde. The substituents are adjacent (ortho) and meta. The NMR would show more complex splitting, perhaps, because the substituents are near each other. But the NMR given shows two doublets each of 2H, which suggests all four aromatic protons are equivalent in two groups. So para substitution might be more likely. Let me think more about the options.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a benzene ring with Cl at position 4 (para) relative to the COOH group. So the substituents are Cl and COOH in para positions. Then, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH), and 3 and 5 (meta to COOH, and adjacent to Cl). Wait, no, if it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, then the COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4. Then positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH. But if the substituents are at 1 and 4, then the aromatic protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 as well. So in the NMR, you'd see 2 sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the given data. So that's a possibility.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That would be OCl-CO-O-Ph. But wait, phenyl chloroformate would have the structure Cl-CO-O-Ph. The functional groups would be an ester (COO) and a Cl. The IR would show a strong carbonyl (ester), which would be around 1720 cm^-1, which matches. The NMR: the aromatic protons would again be para-substituted, as in option B. But what about the other signals? The chloroformate group, maybe some other peaks. Also, the mass would be different. Let's calculate the molecular weight of each option.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So substituents are Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. Then the aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. But wait, position
