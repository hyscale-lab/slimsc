Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has Earth's radius and a transit impact parameter of 0.2, with an orbital period of 3 days. They want to find the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which is 2.5 Earth radii in size. The key here is that the second planet must also exhibit both transit and occultation events. Hmm, so I remember that occultation is when a planet passes behind the star from our point of view, right? So both transit (when the planet passes in front of the star) and occultation (when it passes behind) need to happen.

I think the main thing here is about the orbital periods and their relationship. Wait, both planets are in the same system, same star, same orbital plane, and circular orbits. So I think the requirement for both transit and occultation is related to their orbital periods relative to each other. Oh right, for a planet to transit, it must pass in front of the star, and for occultation, it must pass behind. But how does that relate to the orbital periods?

Wait, maybe it's about their orbital periods being in a certain ratio so that the planets line up correctly for both events. Because if the periods are in a harmonic ratio, they'll align periodically. Like, one might orbit much faster than the other.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think again. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight, and the same goes for the occultation. But for both to happen, the two planets must pass through these points in their orbits at the same time, or perhaps in a way that their orbital periods are synchronized so that their transits and occultations happen regularly.

Wait, no. Maybe it's about the size of their orbits. The impact parameter of the first planet is 0.2. Impact parameter is the distance, in units of the star's radius, that the planet's path misses the center of the star. So a value of 0 would mean a central transit, but 0.2 means it's offset by 20% of the star's radius.

But how does this relate to the second planet? Maybe it's about the orbital distance. Let
