Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Let's see, the question says that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually refer to the formation of complexes, right? So Co(II) forms complexes with SCN- in different stoichiometries.

The problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. So that's the second complex, maybe, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, let me think. The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^- (maybe), and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or maybe different charges. Hmm, but the key here is the stability constants given are β1 to β4, which are the formation constants for each step.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β represents the formation of a complex with n SCN- ions. Like, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^0 (wait, no, because Co^2+ plus 3 SCN- (each -1) would be overall charge 2+ -3 = -1. Hmm, maybe I need to get that right. Let me calculate the charge for each complex.

Co^2+ plus n SCN^- gives [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+ -n} because each SCN- is -1. So for n=1, it's [CoSCN]^+ (charge 2+ -1= +1). For n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (2+ -2= 0). For n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^−
