Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound. The 1H NMR spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule, except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Hmm, okay, so spin-spin coupling would cause splitting into multiple peaks, but here it's two peaks with same shift. So maybe it's not coupling but something else.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temp shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass as expected. So, same mass, same retention time? Wait, same mass but two peaks. Same mass could mean same molecular weight, but maybe different structures? Or maybe stereoisomers?

Let me look at the options.

Option A: Contaminated with precursor. If there was a precursor, the mass would be different, right? Because the precursor would be the starting material before the reaction. So the LC-MS would show a peak with higher mass. But in the question, both peaks have the same mass as the expected. So A might not be it.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have same molecular weight and same NMR shifts? Wait, no, in 1H NMR, enantiomers would show the same peaks because the environment is the same for each proton in each enantiomer. But wait, in the question, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Enantiomers wouldn't do that because their NMRs are same. So maybe B is not the answer.

Wait, but wait. The integration is 1H, same as expected. So each peak is 0.5H? But in enantiomers, each alpha proton would be the same, so same environment, same shift. So why two peaks? I think enantiomers wouldn't cause that. So maybe B is not the right option.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Wait, double coupling in the reaction? I'm not too familiar, but during an amide formation reaction, like when forming a peptide bond, sometimes you can have some coupling events. Maybe when forming the amide, you have some double coupling leading to some diastereomers? Or perhaps some other side products. Not sure, but I'll come back to this.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties. So in NMR, they can have different shifts. But the question says two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. Wait, how would that happen? If the molecule is in a mixture of diastereomers, each diastereomer would have the same number of protons, but in different environments. So each diastereomer's alpha proton would have a different shift. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. Hmm, but perhaps the environment isn't too different, so shifts are similar.

Wait, but in the NMR, each diastereomer would cause the same proton to split into different peaks. So the integral would be 1H total. That fits. Because each diastereomer has the same number of alpha protons, so each contributes 0.5H. So two peaks adding up to 1H. And the shifts are similar, perhaps because the environment is not that different. So this could explain the NMR.

And for the LC-MS, since the diastereomers have different physical properties, they could have different retention times, but the question says the peaks are same mass. Wait, diastereomers have same molecular weight, right? Because same molecular formula. So LC-MS would show two peaks with same mass but different RT. But the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. Wait, same mass? Because same formula. So that fits. So for diastereomers, same mass, different RT. So in this case, the two peaks in LC-MS would have same mass.

But wait, the question says that the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity and same mass. So if the compound is a diastereomeric mixture, that would result in two peaks. So D seems possible.

Wait, but wait: the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. If it's diastereomers, each diastereomer's alpha proton would be in a different environment, so their shifts would be different. So in the NMR, each diastereomer would contribute a peak for that proton. So the same proton in each diastereomer is split into two, each with similar (but not same) shifts. And the integrals add up to 1H, because each is 0.5H (if it's a 50:50 mixture). So that fits.

So looking back at the options, D seems plausible. What about B?

Enantiomers in NMR would not produce two peaks for the same proton because the environment is the same. So you wouldn't see double peaks for the same proton. So B is not the answer.

What about Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond forming. I'm not too sure. Double coupling in NMR usually refers to when a proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons, leading to more complex splitting. But the question says that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So the issue is not coupling, but something else. So double coupling as in the reaction might be more about the reaction process, perhaps leading to some isomers.

Wait, during amide bond formation, sometimes you can get some side products. Maybe if the reaction forms two different products with the same molecular weight but different structures. Like, perhaps some isomerization. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of racemization, but that's about enantiomers again.

Alternatively, perhaps the double peaks are due to some sort of tautomerism or another equilibrium.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound is a mixture of two diastereomers, which would fit option D. So in the NMR, each diastereomer contributes a peak for the same proton, leading to two peaks. The LC-MS would separate them since diastereomers have different retention times but same mass.

So putting it all together, the NMR showing two peaks for the same proton and LC-MS showing two same mass peaks, same intensity, suggests that the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.

So the answer should be D.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, equal integrals (adding up to 1H), and a coupling pattern that rules out spin-spin coupling. Additionally, LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature reveals two peaks of equal intensity, both with the same mass as the expected molecule.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (Contaminated with a precursor):** A precursor would have a different molecular weight, leading to a distinct peak in LC-MS. Since both peaks in LC-MS have the same mass as the expected molecule, this option is unlikely.

- **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers):** Enantiomers have identical physical properties, including NMR shifts, as their environments are mirror images. Thus, they would not produce two distinct peaks for the same proton in the NMR spectrum. This makes B an unlikely explanation.

- **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond forming):** While "double coupling" can occur in NMR, the question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the duplicate peaks. Additionally, this term typically refers to splitting patterns in NMR, not to reaction byproducts. Thus, this option is not consistent with the observations.

- **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties, including NMR shifts, but the same molecular weight. In the NMR spectrum, each diastereomer would contribute a peak for the same alpha-proton, leading to two peaks with similar shifts. The integrals would add up to 1H if the mixture is 50:50. In LC-MS, diastereoisomers would elute at different retention times but have the same mass, consistent with the observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this accounts for the NMR and LC-MS data provided.
