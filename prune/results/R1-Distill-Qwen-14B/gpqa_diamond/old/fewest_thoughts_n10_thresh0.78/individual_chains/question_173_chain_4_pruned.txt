Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that an electron is moving at a speed v of 2×10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. The options are A to D, each with different exponents of 10, so I guess it's about getting the right order of magnitude.

Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is involved here. The principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle. The formula I remember is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, but when estimating the minimum uncertainty, we often take Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2. So that's the starting point.

First, I need to find Δp, the uncertainty in momentum, and then relate that to energy. Since the electron is moving at a certain speed, maybe I can relate its momentum to its velocity. Momentum p is mass times velocity, but since we're dealing with uncertainties, Δp would be the mass times Δv, or wait, maybe not exactly—wait, no, actually, if the speed is given as v, perhaps the uncertainty in momentum is based on the uncertainty in velocity, Δv. Hmm, but wait, in this problem, I think the speed is given, but the uncertainty is in the position, not the velocity. So perhaps I should calculate Δp from Δx using the uncertainty principle.

So let's proceed. First, calculate Δp. The formula is Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Wait, no, the uncertainty principle is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, so rearranging, Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) * something. Wait, actually, the minimal uncertainty is when Δx * Δp = ħ/2. So Δp = ħ/(2Δx). 

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact constants. Let me get the values right. ħ is approximately 1.0545718×10^-34 J·s. Oh, right, that's the reduced Planck constant. So, Δx is given as 0.1 nm
