Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the difference must be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Not sure.

Wait, let me think. When you have two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the uncertainty in their energies is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. To resolve them, the energy difference |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the peaks might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So ΔE_diff = |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach is that the energy resolution required is ΔE_res ≈ ħ/(Δt), where Δt is the time over which the measurement is made. But since the states have different lifetimes, perhaps the time available for measurement is the minimum of the two lifetimes, or maybe the longer one?

Wait, perhaps the time resolution needed is the time during which the states can be observed. Let's think: the lifetime of the first state is 1e-9 seconds, and the second is 1e-8 seconds. So, the first state doesn't last as long. If we are trying to measure the energy difference, the time we can observe both states is limited by the shorter lifetime, which is 1e-9 seconds.

Wait, no—maybe the time available is the same for both. Because the measurement time needs to be longer than the lifetimes to resolve them? No, that doesn't seem right. I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall the energy-time uncertainty relation.

The uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, if Δt is the time during which the state is measured, then the uncertainty in energy is at least ħ/(2Δt). To resolve two energy levels, the difference between their energies (ΔE) must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or perhaps just larger than the individual uncertainty of each? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum energy difference that can be resolved is determined by the uncertainty in energy, which is ħ divided by the measurement time. So if the measurement time is, say, the longer of the two lifetimes, perhaps. Or maybe the shorter time, because the first state disappears faster.

Wait, wait, another approach: the energy difference ΔE must be such that the corresponding measurement time is longer than the time needed to resolve ΔE. So, the time resolution Δt is given by the lifetimes of the states. Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to think of the actual formula. The energy uncertainty is approximately ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime. So for the first state, τ1 = 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 ≈ 1e-34 J·s / 1e-9 s = 1e-25 J. Converting J to eV: 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. So 1e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.25e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s: ΔE2 ≈ 1e-25 J / 1e-8 s? Wait, no. Wait, τ2 is 1e-8, so ħ/ τ2 is 1e-34 / 1e-8 = 1e-26 J. Then in eV: 1e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.25e-8 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. So, the energy uncertainties are approximately 6.25e-7 eV and 6.25e-8 eV. Now, to resolve the two energy levels, the difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the peaks would overlap, and you can't distinguish them.

So, ΔE_diff = E2 - E1. We want ΔE_diff > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So, ΔE_diff > 6.25e-7 + 6.25e-8 = approximately 6.875e-7 eV.

But wait, let's compute the numbers more accurately.

Calculating ΔE1: ħ = 1.055e-34 J·s.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = 1.055e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.055e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J → 1.055e-25 / 1.602e-19 = ~6.59e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.055e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.055e-26 J → 6.59e-8 eV.

So ΔE_diff needs to be larger than 6.59e-7 + 6.59e-8 = approximately 7.25e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 = 1e4 *1e-8 → way larger than 7e-7. So 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV.

Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, 7.25e-7 eV is 0.725e-6 eV. So 1e-4 eV is much larger than that. So option C would satisfy ΔE_diff > 7e-7 eV.

Option D is 1e-8 eV. That's 0.01e-6 eV, which is smaller than 7.25e-7 eV. So it's not enough.

So the only option that satisfies ΔE_diff > 7e-7 eV is option C: 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but let me think again. If the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than the required 7e-7 eV, then that would make them clearly distinguishable. So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy uncertainty, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). For distinguishability, the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the energy uncertainties of the two states:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate energy uncertainties
For the first state with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
The energy difference must satisfy:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} > 6.59 \times 10^{-7} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} = 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is also much smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.01 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the requirement is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
