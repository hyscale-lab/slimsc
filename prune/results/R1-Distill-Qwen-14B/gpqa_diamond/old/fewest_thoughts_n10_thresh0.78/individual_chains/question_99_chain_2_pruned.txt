Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, and I need to figure out which one matches the given spectra.

Let me start by looking at the FTIR data. The first peak mentioned is a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in IR are often due to O-H stretching or maybe N-H. Since the options all have a COOH group (which is a carboxylic acid), the broad peak is probably from the O-H in the carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretches that are usually broad because they can hydrogen bond extensively.

The second peak in the FTIR is a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a key region for carbonyl groups (C=O). So, the compound has a carbonyl, which fits with the carboxylic acid group as well. So, FTIR tells me that the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Now, moving on to the 1H NMR. The question states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. That means there are no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens in the molecule. Looking at the options, all of them are saturated, so that makes sense. No alkenes here.

In the NMR, there are several signals. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, complex splitting. I think this refers to coupling between multiple neighboring protons. Let me recall: each splitting indicates how many neighboring Hs there are. For example, a doublet means each proton is split by one neighboring set, a triplet by two, etc.

Let's think about each option's structure and how the protons would split in NMR.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So, the structure is like CH2CH2 groups attached to a central carbon. Wait, more accurately, it's a central CH connected to two ethyl groups and a CH2COOH. The central CH would have neighboring groups. Let me visualize the structure: maybe something like (CH3CH2)2CHCH2COOH. Wait no, option A is CH3-C-(C2H5) and another CH connected to another C2H5 and a CH2COOH. So, the central part is two CH groups, each attached to an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it. For option A: the structure is (CH3)(C2H5)C-H and another (CH3)(C2H5)C-H connected by a CH2 to COOH. So, the central part is two CH groups, each attached to two ethyl groups. So each CH has two adjacent CH groups?

Wait, maybe the structure is like this: the molecule has a central part where two CH groups are each attached to two ethyl groups and connected to a CH2COOH. So the structure is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

Wait, perhaps it's more like:

The central part is a geminal di-substitution, but no, each CH is attached to an ethyl group and another CH group. So each CH is connected to two ethyl groups and one more CH.

Wait, maybe the structure is: the molecule is (CH2CH3)2CH-C(H)(CH2CH3)CH2COOH? I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe looking at the other options first would help.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. Hmm, the structure would be CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5) connected to another C(H)(C2H5) and then COOH. So, the two middle CHs are each attached to an ethyl group and also connected to each other. So, the structure is:

CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

Wait, that makes the two CH groups each attached to an ethyl and connected to each other. So the two CH groups are adjacent, each bearing an ethyl.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So, here, each CH is connected to a methyl group. So, the structure would be CH3-C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - CH2COOH. So each CH has two methyl substituents and is attached to another CH group.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the structure is CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3) connected to another C(H)(CH3) and then COOH. So, the two CH groups each have a methyl and an ethyl group, and are adjacent.

Now, the NMR signals. The key is to find which structure produces the splitting patterns described.

The first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's a complex splitting. Let me break down the terms. A quartet (four peaks) comes from coupling with three equivalent protons. A triplet (three peaks) comes from coupling with two equivalent protons. A doublet (two peaks) comes from coupling with one proton.

So, each splitting is due to neighboring Hs. But how do these combine? Let's think of it as a multiplet built from several couplings.

Wait, the first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, the splitting order is quartet (coupled with three Hs), then triplet (coupled with two Hs), then doublet (coupled with one H). Or maybe the order is different. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from multiple neighboring groups.

Alternatively, the splitting could be the result of being next to multiple sets of protons. For example, if a proton is next to two sets of neighboring protons, each with different coupling constants, the splitting can become a doublet of triplets, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a proton that is adjacent to multiple non-equivalent protons, leading to multiple splits.

Wait, another approach: let me think about the number of neighboring Hs each proton in the structure would have.

Looking at the structures:

Option D: The structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the two central CH groups are each attached to a CH3 and a CH2CH3.

Wait, no. For option D, each CH is attached to a CH3 and a CH2CH3 (from the CH2CH3 group). Wait, no, looking again: the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, each CH is attached to a CH3 and another CH group.

Wait, perhaps each CH is attached to two other CH groups and one methyl. Wait, maybe not. Let's imagine the structure: the two CHs are connected via a single bond. Each CH is attached to a CH3 and another CH. So the structure is:

CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, so the middle part is CH(CH3) connected to another CH(CH3). So each of these CH groups is adjacent to the other CH and a methyl. So, each CH has two neighboring protons from the adjacent CH group.

Wait, each CH has two protons on the adjacent CH. So each H on a CH is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH.

So, for each H on a CH, they would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH group. That would lead to a
