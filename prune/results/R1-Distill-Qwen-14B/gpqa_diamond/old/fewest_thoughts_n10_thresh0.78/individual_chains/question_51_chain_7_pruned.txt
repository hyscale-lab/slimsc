Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says: If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, calculate the net potential energy of this system. The options are A through D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially grounded ones, the charges redistribute in a certain way. So, a conducting sphere grounded implies that any excess charge on it will flow to the ground, right? Or wait, no, actually, if it's a conductor, the charges would reside on the surface. But if it's grounded, any change in the charge would result in electrons coming from the ground to balance it.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about this differently. The sphere is conducting and grounded, so its potential is zero. Because any conductor in electrostatic equilibrium has its surface at a constant potential, and if it's grounded, that potential is zero.

So, the setup is: we have a charge q placed outside a conducting sphere of radius R, which is grounded. The charge q is at a distance d from the center of the sphere. We need to find the potential energy of the system.

Potential energy in such cases is usually the work done to bring the charges together. But since the sphere is grounded, it can't have any net charge, right? Wait, no. Wait, does the sphere remain neutral? Or does the presence of charge q induce charges on the sphere?

Wait, no, because it's a conductor. So when you place
