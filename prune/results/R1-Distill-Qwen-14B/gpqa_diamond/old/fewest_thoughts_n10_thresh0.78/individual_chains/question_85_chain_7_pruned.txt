Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's temperature and the planet's distance from the star. But wait, how exactly?

Let me read the question again. There are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Both planets are detected via transit and RV methods, meaning we know their masses and probably their orbital periods.

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and radius 1.3 Earths. Both orbits are circular. Interesting. Now, the question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

So, equilibrium temperature formula... I think it's T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ), where A is the albedo. Since both have the same albedo, A cancels out in the ratio.

So the ratio T1/T2 depends on sqrt(R_s/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_s/(2a2)) ), which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1).

But wait, how do I find a1 and a2? The question gives us RV shifts. The RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The shift is related to the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis (distance). How?

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by (v sin i), but for circular orbits, i is 90 degrees, so sin i is 1. K is approximately ( (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * ( (1/(1 + M_p/M_star)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P/(2π)) )^(1/3) )

But wait, that's complicated. Alternatively, I remember the approximate formula for the RV semi-amplitude:

K ≈ ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(-1/3) ) * ( (1/(2π G)) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But maybe there's a simpler way. Since both planets are causing RV shifts, the ratio of their velocities (semi-amplitudes) relates to (M_p/(P^2)) )^(1/3), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, considering that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) )) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(-1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the Doppler shift caused by each planet. The shifts are given in Angstroms for the [OI] line at 6300 Å. So, shift1 is 0.03 Å and shift2 is 0.04 Å. But wait, how does the RV shift relate to the planet's velocity?

The Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is approximately v/c. So, Δλ = (v/c) * λ. So, v = (Δλ) * c / λ.

Wait, but in the question, the shifts are given as 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for the same line [OI] at 6300 Å. So, the velocities would be:

v1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) * c 

Wait, let me compute that. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So, v1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) * 3e8 m/s.

Simplify: 0.03 / 6300 = 1e-5 / 210 = approx 4.76e-7

Multiply by 3e8: 4.76e-7 * 3e8 = approx 142.86 m/s.

Similarly, v2 is (0.04 / 6300) * 3e8.

0.04 /6300= 4e-5 /630= ~6.349e-6.

Multiply by 3e8: 6.349e-6 *3e8 = 190.47 m/s.

So, Planet1 induces a velocity of ~142.86 m/s, Planet2 ~190.47 m/s.

Now, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass and the orbital period. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (2π)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

But for circular orbits, e=0, so that part is 1. Also, since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, simplifying, K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)^(1/3) )

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G / (c P))^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so K ≈ (2π G / (c P))^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Alternatively, for the same star, K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3) ) ), given that M_p is much less than M_star.

Wait, but in this problem, both planets are orbiting the same star, so M_star is same. But I don
