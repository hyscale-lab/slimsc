Okay, so I've got this question here about a scientific experiment involving gene constructs and protein expression. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

So the setup is that someone has identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental fate by using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. 

The vector has two ORFs: the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Wait, I remember that IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so that the second gene can be expressed without needing the first to be translated first. 

There are stop cassettes in between. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh right, these are different loxP sites so that when Cre is present, it will only excise the stop cassette for the gene it's supposed to. So, if you use Cre, which recognizes loxP sites, then in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette for the ligand would be excised, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be co-expressed. Similarly, if the Cre used is specific for another site, like lox2272, it would excise that stop cassette for the receptor and eGFP.

Wait, but the question says they have a bicistronic vector. So without Cre, the first gene (ligand) is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, so it's transcribed. The second gene, receptor, is under IRES, which is after the first ORF. So in the absence of Cre, the expression would be ligand with mCherry and receptor with eGFP, but with some possible read-through or leaky expression from the IRES.

But wait, the stop cassettes complicate that. So normally, without Cre, the ligand and mCherry would not be expressed because the stop cassette is in between. Oh, because the stop cassette would prevent the ligand from being expressed unless the loxP sites are excised. No, wait, the vector is designed so that the ligand ORF is before the stop cassette. So, the CBA promoter drives the transcription of the ligand ORF, but after the ORF is the stop cassette. So without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent the translation of the ligand ORF. Similarly, for the receptor, the IRES would drive the translation of the receptor ORF, but then the stop cassette would prevent eGFP from being expressed. So, unless Cre is present, the ligand and receptor would not be expressed. Because the stop cassettes are in between the ORFs and the fluorescent proteins.

Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. The ligand's ORF is at 5', followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop), then mCherry. So when Cre is present, it would excise the loxP-stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be co-expressed. Similarly, the receptor ORF is after the IRES, then a stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP. So, to express the receptor and eGFP, you need the
