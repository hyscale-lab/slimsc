Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are.

Hmm, first, let me try to visualize the structure. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, the "d" probably stands for deuterium. Oh right, benzene rings can have deuterium substitution. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Let me draw that in my mind: Bromine is on one carbon, and the next carbon (position 2) has a deuterium instead of a hydrogen.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, especially with benzene rings, it might be involved in some kind of elimination or perhaps a substitution reaction.

Wait, but wait a second. If the ring has a bromine and a deuterium, maybe the reaction involves removing the bromide or the deuterium? Or perhaps it's about elimination. Let me think: NaNH2 is a strong base, so it could deprotonate something. But where?

So, considering the structure, the bromide is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. Benzene rings are symmetric, so maybe the positions are numbered in a way that positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the bromine and the deuterium are on adjacent carbons.

In such a setup, if the base (like NaNH2) abstracts a proton, which one would it take? Wait, but the substituents are bromine and deuterium. Oh, wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So perhaps the deuterium is in place of a hydrogen, making that position less acidic? Or maybe it's still acidic but less so than other positions.

But wait, in aromatic rings, the acidity of protons can vary depending on the substituents. Bromine is a meta-directing group. So, perhaps the proton next to bromine (ortho position) is more acidic because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the bromine.

Wait, but wait, in this molecule, the positions adjacent to bromine would be position 2 and position 6. Oh, wait, in benzene, position 1 is bromine, position 2 is deuterium, so position 6 would be another position. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me number the ring. Let's imagine a benzene ring with six positions. Position 1 has Br, position 2 has D (deuterium), so the positions go 1 (Br), 2 (D), 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, the next positions around the ring would be 3 and 6. Wait, if the ring is numbered such that Br is at 1, then the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Since position 2 has D, then position 6 would be a hydrogen.
