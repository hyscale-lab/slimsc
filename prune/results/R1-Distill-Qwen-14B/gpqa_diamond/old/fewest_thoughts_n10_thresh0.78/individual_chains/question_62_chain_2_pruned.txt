Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out what the structure of the target molecule looks like. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, I think that's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent where one of the methyl groups (maybe on C1) is substituted by another cyclohexyl group, and there's an aldehyde group attached as well. Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. The main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached at position 1. Then, at position 1, there's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached. So, more specifically, the substituent is a methyl group that has a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached to it.

Wait, no, maybe the substituent is on the same carbon as the aldehyde. Let me think: the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane, and the substituent is on carbon 1. The substituent is a methyl group that's attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at carbon 1, and the same carbon also has a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached. Wait, but that would make that carbon a quaternary center. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure right.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond, so maybe a substituent like -Câ‰¡CH attached). So, the starting structure is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group.

The question is about the reagents needed
