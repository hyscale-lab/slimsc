Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that the metric tensor describes the geometry of the spacetime, and in this case, it looks like a 2-dimensional metric because it's only got dx and dy terms. Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is like a surface with constant negative curvature, right? It's a solution to the Einstein field equations in some cases, maybe for certain energy-momentum tensors.

So, the area of the pseudosphere... I think the standard pseudosphere has infinite area because it's a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape that extends infinitely. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. I should probably calculate this.

The metric is written in terms of x and y, which probably are coordinates on the plane. Let me see the form. The coefficient of dx² + dy² is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Wait, that denominator looks a bit familiar. If it's (4 - x² - y²), that's similar to the expression in the metric for a sphere, but wait, for a sphere, the metric is often expressed with a denominator involving (1 - (x² + y² + z²)/R²) or something. But here, it's in 2D, so maybe it's a different kind of surface.

Wait, the denominator 4 - x² - y² suggests that the radius of some sort is 2, since 4 is 2 squared. So r=2, which matches the question's pseudosphere radius r=2.

But I'm trying to figure out the area. The area element in metric terms is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since it's a 2D metric, and the only terms are dx² and dy², the metric tensor is diagonal. So the determinant would be (32/(4 - x² - y²))²? Wait, no, because the metric is g_{xx} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_{yy} is the same. So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))², where r² = x² + y². Wait, but r here is the radial coordinate, right? Not the same as
