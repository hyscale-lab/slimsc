Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200°C without air. This caused a mixture of gases to form. These gases were passed through three tubes. Tube 1 had anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, which probably absorbs moisture. Tube 2 was Ca(OH)2 solution, which would react with certain gases. Tube 3 had red-hot copper. The results were:

- Tube 1 gained 3.60 g. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb water vapor because it's very hygroscopic. So the increase in mass here suggests that the gas passed through was water vapor. So the gas that entered tube 1 was H2O, which was absorbed, increasing the mass by 3.60 g.

- Tube 3 gained 0.80 g, and since it's copper that's heated, I think it's reacting with another gas. Copper usually reacts with oxygen or maybe sulfur dioxide. But wait, the product is CuO. So probably the gas was H2O again? Wait, no, because if it's red-hot copper, maybe it's reacting with CO or something else. Or maybe it's H2O. Let me think. If the copper is hot, maybe it can react with water in a different way. Oh wait, red-hot copper might react with water to produce hydrogen and copper oxide. The reaction is 2 Cu + 2 H2O (steam) → 4 H2O (no, wait, that's not right). Wait, no, the reaction under heat is 2 Cu + 2 H2O → 2 CuO + H2↑. So, if the gas was H2O, then the copper would react and produce CuO, which would explain the mass gain. The mass of tube 3 increased by 0.80 g, so that's the mass of CuO formed.

- The second tube, which is Ca(OH)2 solution, didn't change weight. So the gas passing through it didn't react with the solution. Ca(OH)2 reacts with certain gases, like CO2, NH3, HCl, etc. If it didn't react, the gas must be something that doesn't react with it. So possible gases could be H2, N2, O2, maybe others.

After passing through these tubes, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So gas C is 0.1 moles.

Let me summarize the gases:

- Tube 1 absorbed H2O, so the initial gas had H2O, which was 3.60 g. Let's compute the moles of H2O: 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.

Wait, but the problem states that
