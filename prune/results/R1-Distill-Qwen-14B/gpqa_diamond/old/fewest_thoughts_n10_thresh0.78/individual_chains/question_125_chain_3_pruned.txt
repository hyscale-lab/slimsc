Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see... The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that in such a system, the particle experiences a restoring force like a spring, following Hooke's law.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with different energy expressions and degeneracy numbers.

Hmm. I think I need to recall the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, no, more accurately, for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy is given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total quantum number. Or wait, another approach: each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number, say n_x, n_y, n_z. Then the total energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, I think in spherical coordinates, the energy depends on the principal quantum number n, which is n = n_r + l + something? No, maybe that's for hydrogen-like atoms. Wait, for the harmonic oscillator in 3D, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the three quantum numbers.

Wait, let me get this straight. In 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer, and n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each n_x, n_y, n_z is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). So the energy levels are equally spaced with spacing ħω, starting from the ground state at (3/2) ħω (n=0: 0+0+0=0), then first excited state is n=1 (could be any one of n_x, n_y, or n_z being 1), which would be (1 + 3/2) ħω = 5
