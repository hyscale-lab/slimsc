Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about binary star systems, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing binaries, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, from spectroscopic observations, we get the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass here is the sum of the two stars in each system.

Hmm. I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocities are related to the masses of the stars. The more massive star will have a smaller velocity because it's more massive and thus orbits more slowly. Or wait, no: the less massive star has a higher velocity because it's moving more in response to the more massive one. Or wait, I think the mass is inversely proportional to the velocity. Like, if one star is more massive, its velocity is smaller. So the ratio of their masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of their velocities.

Wait, more accurately, the masses are inversely proportional to their velocities. Because of the center of mass. So, M1/M2 = v2/v1, where v1 is the velocity of star 1 and v2 is the velocity of star 2.

But wait, in this problem, each system has two stars, and their RV amplitudes are given. So system_1 has star A with 10 km/s and star B with 5 km/s. System_2 has star A' with 15 km/s and star B' with 10 km/s.

Wait, but the system's total mass is M1 = M_A + M_B for system_1, and M2 = M_A' + M_B' for system_2. We need to find (M1)/(M2).

So, how do I relate the velocities to the masses?

I recall that in a binary system, the masses are inversely proportional to their velocities. So for each system, M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A.

Wait, let me think about it again. The center of mass is stationary, so M_A * v_A = M_B * v_B. So M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A.

Right, so for system_1: M_A1 / M_B1 = v_B1 / v_A1. Their velocities are 10 and 5, so M_A1 / M_B1 = 5/10 = 1/2. So M_A1 is half the mass of M_B1.

Similarly, system_2: the velocities are 15 and 10. So M_A2 / M_B2 = 10/15 = 2/3. So M_A2 is 2/3 the mass of M_B2.

But wait, how do I find the total mass of each system? Because I need to compute M1 = M_A1 + M_B1 and M2 = M_A2 + M_B2.

For system_1: Let me express M_A1 as (v_B1 / v_A1) * M_B1. Wait, no: M_A1 = (v_B1 / v_A1) * M_B1. So M_A1 = (5/10) M_B1 = 0.5 M_B1. So total mass M1 = M_A1 + M_B1 = 0.5 M_B1 + M_B1 = 1.5 M_B1.

Similarly for system_2: M_A2 = (v_B2 / v_A2) * M_B2. v_B2 is 10, v_A2 is 15. So M_A2 = (10/15) M_B2 = (2/3) M_B2. So M2 = M_A2 + M_B2 = (2/3 M_B2) + M_B2 = (5/3) M_B2.

Now, to find the ratio (M1)/(M2), which is [1.5 M_B1 ] / [ (5/3) M_B2 ].

But wait, I don't know the relationship between M_B1 and M_B2. I think I missed something. Because each system's orbital period is given, which is the time between eclipses. I remember that the period relates to the masses and the size of the orbit. Oh, Kepler's third law comes into play here. But wait, wait, perhaps the periods are the same as the orbital periods? Because the eclipses happen when the stars are in their line of sight, which depends on their orbital period.

Wait, Kepler's third law for binary systems. The formula is (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a³, where a is the separation between the two stars. But I don't know the distances a for each system, but maybe I can relate the periods to the velocities.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the mass function. Wait, the mass function for a spectroscopic binary is given by (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = ( (K1^3 P) )/(2π G ), where K1 is the semi-amplitude of the velocity of star 1, and P is the orbital period.

But wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. I remember that the mass function allows determining the mass ratio (q = M2/M1), but perhaps here, since we have both stars' velocities, we can determine the masses more directly.

Wait, but in the case of a binary system, if we have the velocities of both stars, we can find the mass ratio. Because (M1/M2) = (v2/v1), as per the center of mass equation. So M1 = M2 * (v2/v1). Since M1 + M2 is the total mass, and v1 and v2 are the velocities of each star.

Wait, let me write that again. From the center of mass condition, M1 v1 = M2 v2. So M1/M2 = v2 / v1.

In system_1, the velocities are 10 km/s (v1) and 5 km/s (v2). So M1_system1 = (v2/v1) * M2_system1. So M1 = (5/10) M2 = 0.5 M2. So total mass M1_total = M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, but no, that's within system_1. So for system_1, each star has a mass ratio M1 : M2 = v2 : v1 = 5:10 = 1:2. So M1 = (1/3) of the total mass, M2 = (2/3) of the total mass? Wait, no, because M1 + M2 = M_total, and M1 = (v2 / (v1 + v2)) * M_total. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of mass fractions.

Actually, if M1 v1 = M2 v2, then M1/M2 = v2/v1.

So for system_1: v1 = 10, v2 =5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 1/2. So M1 is half of M2. Therefore, M1 = (1/2) M2. So the total mass M1_total = M1 + M2 = (1/2 M2) + M2 = (3/2) M2.

Similarly, for system_2: v1 =15, v2=10. So M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3. So M1 = (2/3) M2. So M2 is M2, and M1 is (2/3) M2. So total mass M2_total = (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2.

Wait, but wait: Wait, in system_2, the velocity of star A is 15, and star B is 10. So the mass ratio M_A / M_B = (v_B)/(v_A) = 10/15 = 2/3. So M_A = (2/3) M_B. So M_A + M_B = (5/3) M_B, which is the total mass of system_2.

Wait, but system_1's total mass is (3/2) M2, where M2 is the mass of the larger star in system_1. Hmm, but I'm not sure if this approach is correct because I'm not considering the period.

Wait, I think the problem is that the periods are given, and I need to relate that to the masses. Because the velocity semi-amplitudes depend on the mass of the companion and the orbital period.

I remember that the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )

But perhaps that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, using the mass function.

Wait, the mass function f(M) is given by:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = (K1^3 P) / (2 π G )

But since we have both K1 and K2 for each system, perhaps we can find the mass ratios.

Wait, no, in each system, both stars' velocity amplitudes are given. So for system_1, K1 =10, K2=5, and period P1=2 years. For system_2, K1=15, K2=10, and P2=1 year.

But I think the mass ratio can be determined from the velocity ratio because of the center of mass condition. So for each system, the mass ratio is (v2/v1), so the mass of each star is proportional to the velocities.

Wait, yes. So for system_1, the mass ratio q = M1/M2 = v2/v1 =5/10=1/2.

So system_1: M1 = 0.5 M2. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Similarly, system_2: M1 = (10/15) * M2 = (2/3) M2. So total mass M2_total = (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2.

Wait, but wait, M2 in this case is the mass of the companion. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to express the masses in terms of each other.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass function, but considering that the period is the same for both stars in a system.

Wait, maybe I can calculate the mass function for each star in each system and then find the total mass.

Wait, but maybe the period isn't necessary for this problem. Because we're given the velocities of both stars, so perhaps the mass ratio is known, and the actual masses can be found if we consider the period.

Wait, but without knowing the inclination angle (i), it's hard to get the actual masses, but since both systems are eclipsing, i is 90 degrees (edge-on), so sin i =1. So the mass function can be used.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the relation between the velocities and the masses, and then use Kepler's law to relate the period and the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the total masses of the two systems.

Wait, let me think again. For each system, the total mass is the sum of the two stars. The velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So for system_1:

M1 (star 1) = 10 km/s, M2 (star 2) =5 km/s.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The velocities are the semi-amplitudes, which are related to the masses. So, for system_1:

M1 = (v2 / (v1 + v2)) * (M1 + M2)

Wait, no, perhaps better to think in terms of the ratio.

Let me consider that M1 / M2 = v2 / v1.

So for system_1: M1/M2 = 5/10 = 1/2. So M1 = 0.5 M2.

Total mass M1_total = M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 =1.5 M2.

Similarly, for system_2: M1 (star A) =15, M2 (star B)=10.

So M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3. So M1 = (2/3) M2.

Total mass M2_total = M1 + M2 = (2/3) M2 + M2 = (5/3) M2.

Now, how to find the ratio of the total masses of the systems.

We need (M1_total) / (M2_total) = [1.5 M2_system1 ] / [ (5/3) M2_system2 ].

Wait, but wait. M2_system1 and M2_system2 are the masses of the more massive stars in each system. But we don't know their actual values. So perhaps I'm missing a relation that connects the periods and the masses.

I remember that the orbital period is related to the mass of the system and the separation using Kepler's third law. The formula is (M1 + M2) * P² = (4 π² a³) / G, where a is the semi-major axis.

But without knowing a for each system, I can't directly find the masses. But perhaps I can find the ratio of the masses using the periods and the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, considering that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / [ ( (M1 + M2) )^(2/3) ) ] * (1 / (P^(1/3) c ) )

But since i is 90 degrees for eclipsing binaries, sin i =1.

So for each star, K1 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M2 ) / [ (M_total )^(2/3) ) ] * (1 / (P^(1/3) c ) )

Similarly, K2 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M1 ) / [ (M_total )^(2/3) ) ] * (1 / (P^(1/3) c ) )

So for system_1, K1 =10, K2=5, P1=2.

Let me write for system_1:

K1 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2 / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ) * 1/( (2 years)^(1/3) c )

Similarly,

K2 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * M1 / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ) * 1/( (2 years)^(1/3) c )

So K1/K2 = (M2 ) / (M1 )

Which we already found equals 5/10=1/2. So that's consistent with our earlier mass ratio.

But perhaps I can find the ratio of the total masses of the two systems.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the ratio of the masses of the two systems.

Let me think about the ratio of M_system_1 to M_system_2.

For system_1:

K1 =10, P1=2 years.

For system_2:

K1=15, P2=1 year.

But wait, the K's are for each star. So in system_2, K1 is 15 (for star A), and K2 is 10 (for star B).

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each star's K in terms of the system parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass ratio (system_1 mass)/(system_2 mass) using the velocities and periods.

Let me think about the formula for K.

In system_1:

K1 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / [ (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ] * (1) / ( (P1)^(1/3) c )

Similarly, for system_2:

K1' = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M2' sin i) / [ (M1' + M2')^(2/3) ) ] * 1/( (P2)^(1/3) c )

But since both systems are eclipsing, sin i is 1 for both.

So for system_1, K1 =10 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2 / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) * 1/( (2)^(1/3) c )

Similarly, K2=5 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * M1 / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) * 1/( (2)^(1/3) c )

Dividing K1 by K2 for system_1:

10/5 = (M2) / (M1)

Which we know is 2 = M2/M1. So M2 = 2 M1.

Which makes sense, since earlier we found M1 =0.5 M2.

So M_total for system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 =3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2:

K1'=15 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2' / ( (M1' + M2')^(2/3) ) * 1/( (1)^(1/3) c )

K2'=10 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * M1' / ( (M1' + M2')^(2/3) ) * 1/( (1)^(1/3) c )

Dividing K1' by K2':

15/10 = (M2')/(M1') => 3/2 = M2'/M1' => M2' = (3/2) M1'

So M_total for system_2 is M1' + M2' = M1' + (3/2 M1') = (5/2 M1').

Now, let's express each system's total mass in terms of M1 (for system_1) and M1' (for system_2).

For system_1: M1_total =3 M1.

For system_2: M2_total = (5/2) M1'.

Now, I need to relate M1 and M1' to find the ratio M1_total / M2_total.

But how?

Let me look at the formula for K again. Let's write it in terms of M1 and M1'.

For system_1:

K1 =10 = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M2 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) * 1/( (2)^(1/3) c )

But M2 =2 M1, so M1 + M2 =3 M1.

So,

10 = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (2 M1) / ( (3 M1)^(2/3) ) * 1/( (2)^(1/3) c )

Simplify:

10 = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * 2 M1 / ( (3^(2/3) (M1)^(2/3) ) ) * 1/(2^(1/3) c )

Simplify the exponents:

(2 pi G)^(1/3) is a constant.

The M1 terms:

2 M1 / (M1^(2/3)) ) = 2 M1^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2 M1^(1/3)

So,

10 = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * 2 M1^(1/3) / (3^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) c )

Similarly, let's write the same for system_2.

In system_2, K1'=15:

15 = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * M2' / ( (M1' + M2')^(2/3) ) * 1/( (1)^(1/3) c )

We know M2' = (3/2) M1', and M1' + M2' = (5/2) M1'.

So,

15 = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (3/2 M1') / ( (5/2 M1')^(2/3) ) * 1/(1 * c )

Simplify the M1' terms:

(3/2) M1' / ( (5/2 M1')^(2/3) ) = (3/2) M1'^(1) / ( (5/2)^(2/3) M1'^(2/3) ) )

Which is (3/2) / (5/2)^(2/3) ) * M1'^(1 - 2/3) ) = (3/2) / (5/2)^(2/3) ) * M1'^(1/3)

So,

15 = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (3/2) / (5/2)^(2/3) ) * M1'^(1/3) / c

Now, let me write the expressions for system_1 and system_2.

For system_1:

10 = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * 2 / [3^(2/3) * 2^(1/3)] ) * M1^(1/3) / c

For system_2:

15 = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (3/2) / (5/2)^(2/3) ) * M1'^(1/3) / c

I can write each equation as:

10 = A * (M1)^(1/3) / c

15 = B * (M1')^(1/3) / c

Where A and B are constants that include (2 pi G)^(1/3) and other terms.

But to find the ratio of M1_total to M2_total, which is 3 M1 / (5/2 M1') = (6/5) (M1)/(M1').

So, if I can find M1 / M1', I can find the total mass ratio.

Let me take the two equations.

Let me denote:

Equation 1: 10 = A * (M1)^(1/3) / c --> M1^(1/3) = 10 c / A

Equation 2: 15 = B * (M1')^(1/3) / c --> M1'^(1/3) = 15 c / B

So, the ratio M1 / M1' = [ (10 c/A )^3 ] / [ (15 c/B )^3 ] = (10^3 B^3 ) / (15^3 A^3 ) ) * (c^3)/(c^3) ) = (1000 B^3 ) / (3375 A^3 ) )

Simplify 1000 / 3375 = 8/27 (since 1000=10^3, 3375=15^3= (3*5)^3= 3^3 *5^3; 1000/3375 = (2^3 *5^3) / (3^3 *5^3) )= 8/(27*1) )= 8/27.

Wait, no: 1000 /3375 = 1000 ÷ 3375. Let me compute it as a fraction. 1000/3375 = (1000 ÷ 125) / (3375 ÷ 125) )= 8/27.

So the ratio becomes (8/27) * (B^3)/(A^3).

So, M1 / M1' = (8/27) * (B^3 / A^3 )

Now, let's compute A and B.

A is (2 pi G)^(1/3) * 2 / (3^(2/3) 2^(1/3) )

Wait, looking back at system_1's equation:

A = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * [2 / (3^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) ) ]

Let me compute the constants:

(2 pi G)^(1/3) is a common factor in both A and B. Let me denote C = (2 pi G)^(1/3).

So,

A = C * [2 / (3^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) ) ]

Similarly, for B:

B = C * [ (3/2) / ( (5/2)^(2/3) ) ) ]

Let me compute the terms inside.

First, for A:

2 / (3^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) )

= 2^(1) / (2^(1/3) ) ) * 3^(-2/3 )

= 2^(2/3) * 3^(-2/3 )

= [2^2 / 3^2 ]^(1/3 ) = (4/9)^(1/3 )

So, A = C * (4/9)^(1/3 )

For B:

(3/2) / ( (5/2)^(2/3) )

= (3/2) * (5/2)^(-2/3 )

= 3/(2) * (2/5)^(2/3 )

= 3 * (2/5)^(2/3) / 2

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as: 3/(2) * (2^(2/3) )/(5^(2/3) )

= 3 * 2^(-1 + 2/3) ) / 5^(2/3 )

= 3 * 2^(-1/3) ) / 5^(2/3 )

So, B = C * [3 * 2^(-1/3) ) / 5^(2/3) ]

So now, A = C*(4/9)^(1/3 ), B = C*(3/(2^{1/3} 5^{2/3}) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write A^3 and B^3 in terms of the constants.

A^3 = [C * (4/9)^(1/3 ) ]^3 = C^3 * (4/9 )

Similarly, B^3 = [ C * (3)/(2^{1/3} 5^{2/3} ) ) ]^3 = C^3 * (27) / ( (2^{1/3})^3 * (5^{2/3})^3 )

= C^3 * 27 / (2^1 *5^2 ) )

= C^3 * 27 / (2 *25 )

= C^3 * 27/(50 )

So, the ratio (B^3)/(A^3 ) = [27/(50 C^3 ) ] / [ (4/9) C^3 ]

Wait, no: A^3 = C^3 * (4/9 ), B^3 = C^3 * (27/50 )

So, B^3 / A^3 = (27/50 ) / (4/9 ) ) = (27/50 ) * (9/4 ) ) = (243)/(200 )

So, putting it all together,

M1 / M1' = (8/27) * (243/200 ) )

Compute that:

8/27 * 243/200 = (8 * 243) / (27 *200 )

Simplify 243 /27 =9.

So, (8 *9 ) /200 =72/200= 9/25=0.36.

So, M1 / M1' =0.36.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 0.36 is less than 1, which would mean system_1's M1 is smaller than system_2's M1'. But I thought system_1's stars have lower velocities, so perhaps lower masses. Hmm.

But wait, our ratio M1/M1' is 0.36, so M1_total is 3 M1, and M2_total is (5/2) M1'.

So, the ratio (M1_total) / (M2_total) = (3 M1 ) / [ (5/2) M1' ) ] = (3 * 2/5 ) * (M1/M1' ) )

= (6/5 ) *0.36 = (6/5)*0.36 = (6 *0.36 )/5 =2.16/5=0.432.

Wait, that's approximately 0.432. Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option D is ~0.7. So 0.432 is close to 0.4, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I'm a bit uncertain.

Wait, let's recap:

We found that the ratio M1 (star1 in system1) to M1' (star A in system2) is 0.36.

So, system_1's total mass is 3 M1.

System_2's total mass is (5/2) M1'.

The ratio of the total masses is (3 M1) / ( (5/2) M1' ) ) = (3 * 2/5) * (M1/M1') ) = (6/5) * 0.36 = (6/5)*0.36= (1.2)*0.36=0.432.

Which is approximately 0.43, which is option A.

But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2.

Wait no, the question is "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?"

Wait, so if system_1's total mass is 0.43 times that of system_2, that would mean system_1 is less massive. But the options don't include 0.43 as a higher factor. Wait, actually option A is ~0.4, which would mean system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2, so system_2 is more massive.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?"

If the ratio is 0.43, that would mean system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2, so it's less massive. So system_1 is about 0.43 times the mass of system_2, which would make system_2 more massive by a factor of approximately 2.33.

But the question is phrased as how much more massive system_1 is than system_2. If the ratio is less than 1, that would imply system_1 is less massive. So the factor would be 0.43, which is option A.

Wait, but the options provided are:

A) ~ 0.4

B) ~ 0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

So 0.43 is closest to option A.

Wait a minute, but in our calculation, the ratio is M1_total / M2_total = 0.432, which is about 0.43. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the earlier steps. Let me recheck.

Wait, when I computed (B^3)/(A^3), I had:

A^3 = C^3 * (4/9 )

B^3 = C^3 * (27/50 )

So, (B^3)/(A^3 )= (27/50 )/(4/9 ) = (27/50 )*(9/4 )= (243)/(200 )

So, 243/200 =1.215.

So,

M1/M1' = (8/27 ) *1.215 = (8/27 ) * (243/200 )

Wait, 8/27 *243 =8 *9=72.

72/200=0.36.

Ah, yes, that's correct. So M1 =0.36 M1'.

Thus, the ratio of the total masses is (3 M1 )/(5/2 M1' ) )= (3 * 2 )/(5 ) * (M1/M1' ) = (6/5)*0.36= (1.2)*0.36=0.432.

Which is approximately 0.43, so option A.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data:

### Key Information:
1. **System Properties**:
   - **System_1**: Period \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \), radial velocity amplitudes \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \).
   - **System_2**: Period \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \), radial velocity amplitudes \( K_1' = 15 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( K_2' = 10 \, \text{km/s} \).

2. **Mass Ratios**:
   - From the center of mass condition, the mass ratio \( M_1/M_2 \) in a binary system is inversely proportional to the velocity ratio \( v_2/v_1 \). Thus:
     - For **System_1**: \( M_1/M_2 = K_2/K_1 = 5/10 = 1/2 \). Total mass \( M_{\text{total,1}} = M_1 + M_2 = 3M_1 \).
     - For **System_2**: \( M_1'/M_2' = K_2'/K_1' = 10/15 = 2/3 \). Total mass \( M_{\text{total,2}} = M_1' + M_2' = (5/3)M_1' \).

3. **Mass Ratio of the Systems**:
   - The ratio of the total masses is:
     \[
     \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{3M_1}{(5/3)M_1'} = \frac{9M_1}{5M_1'}.
     \]
   - To find \( M_1/M_1' \), we use the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes and masses. After detailed calculations, it is determined that \( M_1/M_1' \approx 0.36 \).

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Substituting \( M_1/M_1' \approx 0.36 \) into the mass ratio:
     \[
     \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{9(0.36)}{5} \approx 0.432.
     \]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately \( 0.43 \) times as massive as system_2. Among the given options, the closest value is **0.4**.
