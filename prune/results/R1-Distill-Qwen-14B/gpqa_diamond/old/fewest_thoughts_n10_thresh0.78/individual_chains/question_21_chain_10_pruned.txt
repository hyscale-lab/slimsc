Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about isomers, tautomerism, and optical isomerism. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question has two parts: part A and part B. I'll tackle them one by one.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione?

Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bonding electron, usually in carbonyl compounds. It often occurs in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups because the hydrogen can shift between them. For example, in beta-diketones, tautomerism can happen, converting them into enones or something similar.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic quinone structure. I remember that quinones can have keto forms and can tautomerize. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups opposite each other. Wait, but do they allow for tautomerism? Let me think. In para-benzoquinone, the structure is with two ketone groups across from each other. For tautomerism, you usually need a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl. Benzoquinone has oxygens, so maybe the structure is similar to a diketone. Does that allow for enol formation?

Wait, another thought: if a compound has two adjacent carbonyl groups, tautomerism is possible. But benzoquinone's carbonyls are para, not adjacent. So maybe they can't tautomerize because the necessary hydrogen isn't in the right position. Or perhaps the structure allows for some conjugation that enables tautomerism. Not entirely sure, but I'll mark this for now.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: this has three carbonyl groups, each separated by one carbon. So positions 1, 3, and 5 are ketones. Wait, but in a six-membered ring, 1 and 3 are two apart, so maybe they are adjacent? Let me visualize the ring. No, 1,3,5 would be every other carbon in the ring, making each adjacent to the next but not directly next. So each ketone is across one carbon from the next. Wait, but if it
