Okay, I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. So, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are different propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

First, I'll recall what these structures look like. Acetate esters generally have the structure R-OAc, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. The acetate group is OAc- which is O-CO-OCH3, wait no, acetate is CH3COO-. So in the ester, it's R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Acetate esters are R-O-CO-OCH3? Hmm, wait, acetate is the ester from acetic acid. So the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait. Wait, wait. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. So an acetate ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. Because when acetic acid donates the acyloxy group, it's the acetate, so the ester is R-O-COCH3. So the structure would be R-O-CO-CH3. So the acetate group is OAc, which is O-CO-CH3.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure. The general structure for an ester is R-O-CO-R', where R is an alkyl or alkenyl, and R' is the acyl part. In acetate esters, R' is acetyl (CH3CO-), so R-O-CO-CH3. So for example, propyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH2CH3.

Now, the options given are propenyl and butenyl acetates. So propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3? Or maybe CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, propenyl has three carbons in the R group. Propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but the position of the double bond varies between cis and trans.

Wait, the options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-butenyl acetate. So propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, the double bond in propenyl is between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But butenyl would be four carbons with a double bond. So butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc or CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc, depending on where the double bond is. Wait, but the butenyl would have the double bond between C1 and C2 or between C2 and C3. For butenyl, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (cis or trans). Wait, but butenyl is four carbons, so the double bond can be at positions 1-2 or 2-3.

Wait, but wait, the possible structures are propenyl (three carbons, double bond between C1 and C2) and butenyl (four carbons, double bond between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3). So for the options, it's either propenyl or butenyl acetate.

Now, the NMR data provided is:

1H NMR: 7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d)

Let me think about the possible structures and their NMR spectra.

First, looking at the acetate group. The OAc group has a CH3 attached to the carbonyl. The CH3COO- group. In the NMR, the acetate's methyl group is usually a singlet because it's attached to the carbonyl and has no neighboring hydrogens. In the data, there's a singlet at 2.1 ppm, which integrates for 3H. That fits with the OAc group's methyl. So that's correct.

Now, the other groups. Let's think about propenyl and butenyl.

In propenyl acetate: The structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Alternatively, depending on the position of the double bond, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but for propenyl, the double bond is between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the ester is OAc attached to CH2CH2CH2, but
