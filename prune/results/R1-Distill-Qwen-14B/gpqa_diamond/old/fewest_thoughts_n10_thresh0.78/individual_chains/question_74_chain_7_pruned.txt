Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a single atom, and we're monitoring it right after obtaining it. We know from experiments that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. The question is asking what the probability is that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Hmm, wait a second. So, the initial probability is given for 100 minutes, and now we're looking beyond that because 50 minutes have already gone by. So, total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, no, the next 150 minutes is starting from the current time, so 50 minutes have passed, and we're looking at the next 150. So the total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150, not up to 200.

Wait, no. Because I think the initial statement says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that it decays any time before 100 minutes. Now, after 50 minutes, it hasn't decayed yet, and we're looking at the next 150 minutes, so from 50 to 200 minutes. So, the question is, given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the probability it will decay between 50 and 200 minutes.

Wait no, the question says, 'the next 150 minutes' so that's 50 to 200 minutes.

But radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? So the probability of decay is independent of the time that has already passed. So the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes shouldn't affect the probability in the next 150. But wait, that's not correct because the decay follows an exponential distribution, which is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same as if it had just started. Or wait, no, because the time already elapsed is part of
