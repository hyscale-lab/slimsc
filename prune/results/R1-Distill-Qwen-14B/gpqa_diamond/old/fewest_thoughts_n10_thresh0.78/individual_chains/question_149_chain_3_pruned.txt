Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly right, except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason. So, the peaks aren't from coupling with another proton.

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature, there are two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule. So, the mass is the same, but there are two peaks. Hmm, the same mass but different in some way.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would likely have a different mass. If the mass spec shows the same mass, it's probably not a precursor. Plus, the NMR might show different peaks, but the problem says the NMR is consistent except for two same alpha-protons. So maybe A is not the right choice.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they would have the same physical properties except for how they interact with chiral environments. In NMR, if the sample isn't chiral (like in a racemic mixture), sometimes the peaks can split due to diastereotopic protons. Wait, but in an achiral environment, maybe the two enantiomers would look the same. But wait, in NMR, if the compound is a racemic mix, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, the alpha-protons might be equivalent. But in this case, why two peaks? Also, if the compound is a racemic mixture, would the LC-MS see two peaks? Maybe, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the molecule has a chiral center, the enantiomers would have the same mass but different chromatographic behavior. But wait, the NMR of enantiomers would show the same peaks unless something else is causing splitting. But the question says the two peaks are from the same alpha-proton. So if it's enantiomers, maybe the protons are in different environments but appear as separate peaks. Or perhaps because the molecule is not separating but something else is happening.

Option C: Double coupling during amide formation. I'm not sure what 'double coupling' means here. Maybe if two different coupling partners cause splitting, but the question says coupling can be ruled out. So probably not C.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. But wait, the question says the NMR is consistent except for two peaks for the same alpha-proton. If the diastereomers have the same alpha-proton environment, maybe those protons would split into two sets. But wait, if they're diastereomers, the protons might be in different environments, leading to different shifts. But the problem states that the two peaks have similar shifts. That might not fit perfectly. Alternatively, if the diastereomers are in a situation where the alpha-proton's environment is almost the same, perhaps leading
