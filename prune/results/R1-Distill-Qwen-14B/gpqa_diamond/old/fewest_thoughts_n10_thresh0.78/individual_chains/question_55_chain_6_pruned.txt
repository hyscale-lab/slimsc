Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is. The options are all some sort of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. Hmm. Let me think about what each of those structures would look like and how their NMR spectra would appear.

First, I remember that NMR can give a lot of information about the structure, especially the coupling patterns. Let's look at the given data:

The 1H NMR shows peaks at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets?), 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet), and 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet). 

Wait, the singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably the acetate group's methyl. Acetate is OAc, which is a CH3COO- group, right? So that makes sense. The singlet suggests it's not split by any neighboring protons because it's attached to the oxygen and maybe in an environment where there's no splitting—like being next to an electronegative atom which deshields but doesn't split.

Now, the other signals. Let's think about the vinyl groups. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, so probably a trans coupling in a double bond. Because for double bonds, trans coupling (like in a trans double bond) would have larger J values, around 15-16 Hz. So that suggests maybe a trans configuration.

Wait, but we also have a peak at 5.5 ppm. That's lower field than the 7.0. Hmm. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I might have gotten this wrong. In alkenes, the protons on the end of the double bond are usually upfield or downfield depending on their substitution. For example, in a trans double bond, the protons would be trans, so each would couple with the other, maybe.

Wait, let me think about propenyl acetate. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc or something like that. Or wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH3. But in this case, it's attached as an ester, so it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that would be acrylate maybe. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2CHCH2, so perhaps it's CH2CH2-OAc? Wait, no—maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the possible structures. Let's see:

Option C is Cis-propenyl acetate. Propenyl would mean three carbons with a double bond. So the structure would be CH2CH2-OAc, but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, when propenyl is attached to the acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, that's propenyl, so it's
