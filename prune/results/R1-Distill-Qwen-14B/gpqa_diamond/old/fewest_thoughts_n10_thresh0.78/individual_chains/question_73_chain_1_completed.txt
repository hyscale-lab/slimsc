Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, they're moving in the same direction. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I remember that when dealing with velocities, you can't just subtract them normally because at high speeds, you need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, because of the way relativity works, velocities don't just add up linearly.

Wait, so the relative speed isn't just 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c? Because that's what I might have thought initially, but that's probably not correct when dealing with such high speeds. Oh wait, but 0.1c is still a significant fraction of the speed of light, so maybe relativistic effects are still important here. Let me think about the formula.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait no, wait. Actually, when you're in one frame and another object is moving at u, and you're moving at v relative to that frame, the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, but I'm a bit confused about which direction. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be the difference between their speeds divided by that denominator factor.

Wait, let me confirm. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. Plugging in, that would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute that.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator: (0.3c²)/(c²) = 0.3, but wait, no. Wait, 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3, so it's 0.3 c²? No, wait. (0.6c * 0.5c) = 0.3 c², and that's divided by c². So 0.3 c² / c² = 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 = (0.1/0.7) c ≈ 0.142857 c ≈ 0.143c. So around 0.14c. Wait, looking at the options, option C says 0.14c relative speed, and option D also has 0.14c. So the relative speed part is either C or D.

Now, the other part of the question is the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity is the sum of the energies of each astronaut. The energy of each is gamma * m c squared.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = 1/(sqrt(3)/2) )= 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². So that's about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc^2, and option B has 4.96. So the energy part points to option C.

Wait, but let's double-check. Let me redo the gamma calculations more accurately. For the first astronaut: v=0.6c. So (v/c)² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. Correct. So E1=1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: v=0.5c. (v/c)^2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 is 1.1547 *3m c² = approximately 3.464 m c².

Sum: 2.5 +3.464 =5.964 m c². So 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

So, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking back at the options:

Option C: v_rel = 0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.

Option D: same speed, E=5mc². So the correct answer must be C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts moving in the same direction:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]
Here, \(u = 0.6c\) and \(v = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]
Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut
- Mass: \(2m\)
- Speed: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\)

#### Second Astronaut
- Mass: \(3m\)
- Speed: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2\)

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
