Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because Gaussian states are easier to handle, but non-Gaussian ones are necessary for certain quantum computations and simulations.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. I know that |alpha> is a coherent state, and |-alpha> is its phase-conjugate. Coherent states are Gaussian states, right? But when you superpose them, especially with a phase factor, you can get a non-Gaussian state.

The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha^2)). Wait, so N depends on phi and alpha. Let me plug in phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Phi is -pi/4, so let's compute sin(2*phi). 2*phi would be -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. So sin(2phi) = -1. Then, exp(-2 alpha^2) with alpha=0.5 would be exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So sin(2phi)*exp(-2 alpha^2) is -1 * 0.6065 ≈ -0.6065. Then 1 + (-0.6065) = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is normalized as (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / 0.6275.

Wait, but I'm supposed to calculate the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is delta_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the reference Gaussian state.

I think the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (REG) is a measure comparing the non-Gaussian state rho to a Gaussian state tau. So to compute this, I need the density matrices of rho and tau.

But wait, rho is the density matrix of the given state. So rho would be |psi><psi|. Let's compute rho
