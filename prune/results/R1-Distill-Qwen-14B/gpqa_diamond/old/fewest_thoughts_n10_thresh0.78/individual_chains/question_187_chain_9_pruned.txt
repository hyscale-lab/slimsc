Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about ESPRESSO.

ESPRESSO is a spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), right? It's designed for high-resolution spectroscopy. Oh wait, I remember reading that it has a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) capability, especially useful for studying exoplanets and stellar dynamics.

The question is about detecting stars based on a certain S/N per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The threshold is S/N of at least 10. So, the key here is figuring out which stars meet or exceed this S/N.

I think the first thing I need to understand is what factors affect the S/N of a spectrograph. I remember that S/N improves with more photons collected, which depends on the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the spectrograph's efficiency.

The formula for S/N ratio is something like S/N = (number of photons)^(1/2). So, the brighter the star (lower magnitude), the higher the S/N. Also, exposure time is a factor—if you double the time, you get sqrt(2) times higher S/N.

Wait, but ESPRESSO's performance probably depends on the instrument's characteristics. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is known for its high efficiency. Let me think about the parameters. ESPRESSO is installed on the VLT, which has an 8-meter telescope. The VLT's light-gathering area is big, so that's good for collecting photons.

I think the VLT has a large mirror, so it can gather a lot of light. But the exact numbers I'm a bit fuzzy on. Oh wait, the area of a circular mirror is πr², so for an 8m mirror, the radius is 4m. Area is π*(4)^2 = 16π m², which is approximately 50.27 m². But I'm not sure if that's directly needed here.

The stars given in the options have varying distances and absolute magnitudes. Absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude a star would have at 10 parsecs. So, I need to calculate the apparent magnitude (m) for each star to determine their brightness as seen from Earth.

The formula for converting absolute magnitude to apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log₁₀(d), where d is the distance in parsecs. Wait, no, the formula is m = M + 5 log₁₀(d/10), which simplifies to m = M + 5(log₁₀ d) - 5.

So m = M + 5 * (log₁₀ d) -5.

Let me compute each star's apparent magnitude:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a bright star. According to my memory, Canopus has an apparent magnitude around -0.7, but I'm not certain. Let me double-check. Oh, actually, Canopus is about magnitude -0.7. So m is about -0.7.

b) Polaris: Polaris is the North Star. Its apparent magnitude is around 2.0. So m ≈ 2.

c) Star with M=15 mag, distance 10 pc. So d=10, so log₁₀(10)=1. m = 15 +5*1 -5 = 15+5-5=15. Oh wait, that can't be right. Wait, I'm mixing up the formula. Wait, M is absolute magnitude. So, when d=10pc, m = M, because m = M +5 log₁₀(d/10) → d=10, log is 1, so m = M +5*(1) -5? Wait, no:

Wait the formula is m = M +5*(log₁₀ (d) -1). So for d=10, log is 1, so m = M +5*(1-1)= M. So for option c, M=15, d=10 → m=15.

d) Same M=15, but d=200 pc. So log₁₀(200) is about 2.301. So m =15 +5*(2.301-1) → 5*(1.301)=6.505. So m=15+6.505=21.505. That's a very faint star.

e) M=15, d=5pc. So log₁₀(5)=0.699. m =15 +5*(0.699 -1) → 5*(-0.301)= -1.505. So m=15-1.505=13.495.

f) M=15, d=50 pc. log₁₀(50)=1.69897. So m=15 +5*(1.69897 -1)=15+5*(0.69897)=15+3.49485= ~18.495.

So the apparent magnitudes are:

a) m ≈ -0.7 (bright)
b) m ≈ 2.0 (moderate)
c) m =15 (faint)
d) m≈21.5 (very faint)
e) m≈13.5 (moderately faint)
f) m≈18.5 (fainter than e but brighter than c and d)

Now, knowing that, the next step is to determine which stars have an S/N ≥10 when observed for 1 hour.

But how does the apparent magnitude relate to S/N? I think the S/N depends on the flux of the star. The flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4*m), because each magnitude step is a factor of sqrt(100) in brightness (since each mag is 2.512 in flux, which is ~100^(1/5)). So the formula is F = F0 * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m0 is some reference magnitude.

But I'm not exactly sure about the reference. Alternatively, I know that the S/N ratio for a star can be calculated using the formula:

S/N = (N_phot
