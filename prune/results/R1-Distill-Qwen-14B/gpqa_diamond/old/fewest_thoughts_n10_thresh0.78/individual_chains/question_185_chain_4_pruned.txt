Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Let me see. The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Oh wait, right, sigma is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. 

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, each being 2x2 matrices. The dot product sigma.n would be sigma_x n_x + sigma_y n_y + sigma_z n_z. And since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So the Hamiltonian H is epsilon multiplied by this sum. Let me think about the properties of the Pauli matrices. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues of plus and minus 1. Oh wait, wait. Because when you have an operator like sigma.n, which is a linear combination of Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues would just be plus and minus the magnitude of that combination.

Wait, but wait. The Pauli matrices are each traceless and have determinant -I. But more importantly, any linear combination like sigma.n when multiplied by a scalar would have eigenvalues as plus and minus the coefficient times the magnitude. Oh, but wait, the sum sigma.n is a matrix, and the eigenvalues are sqrt( (n_x)^2 + (n_y)^2 + (n_z)^2 ) multiplied by 1, but since n is a unit vector, that sum is 1. So sigma.n has eigenvalues +1 and -1. 

So the Hamiltonian H is epsilon times sigma.n. So the eigenvalues of H would be epsilon multiplied by the eigenvalues of sigma.n. So that's epsilon * 1 and epsilon * (-1). So the eigenvalues are +epsilon and -epsilon. 

Looking at the options, option B says +epsilon and -epsilon. Option C has hbar over 2, but I don't think hbar is involved here. Because the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues +/-1, right? So when multiplied by a scalar, the eigenvalues just scale by that scalar.

Wait, but wait again. Oh, because the Pauli matrices are each multiplied by n components, but the sum sigma.n has eigenvalues +/-1 because it's a unit vector direction. So when multiplied by epsilon, the eigenvalues become +/- epsilon. So the correct answer should be option B.


The Hamiltonian operator is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The dot product \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, specifically \( \sigma_x n_x + \sigma_y n_y + \sigma_z n_z \), weighted by the components of the unit vector \( \vec{n} \). 

The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices \( \sigma_x \), \( \sigma_y \), and \( \sigma_z \) are \( \pm 1 \). For a general linear combination \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), the eigenvalues are \( \pm 1 \) because \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, ensuring that the magnitude of the combination remains 1. 

When the Hamiltonian \( H \) is scaled by \( \varepsilon \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) become \( \pm \varepsilon \). This is because the eigenvalues of a scalar multiple of an operator are simply the eigenvalues of the operator multiplied by the scalar. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( +1, -1 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \), not 1.
- **Option B**: \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \) is correct, as derived above.
- **Option C**: \( +
