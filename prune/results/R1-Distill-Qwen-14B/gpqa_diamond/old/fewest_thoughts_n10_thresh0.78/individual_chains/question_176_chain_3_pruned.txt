Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, but usually quantum states are represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized, right? Let me check: the components are -1, 2, and 1. So the vector is (-1; 2; 1). To find the norm, I'll square each component and add them up. 

So, (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. So total is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh wait, so the norm squared is 6. That means the state isn't normalized. So I should probably normalize it first. Right, because in quantum mechanics, states must be normalized (their inner product with themselves is 1).

Wait, but maybe the problem assumes it's already normalized. Or maybe I should proceed with the given vector as is, but I'm not sure. Hmm, but for probabilities, we usually need the state to be normalized. Because when calculating probabilities, the sum should be 1. Let me think â€” in any case, since the problem gives us a state vector, perhaps I should normalize it first. So to make it a unit vector, I'll divide each component by sqrt(6). So the state vector becomes (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Next, the operators for P and Q are given. The operator P's matrix is:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, wait, that seems a bit unusual. Let me write it out:

P = [
