Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B for each, then match them with the options provided. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different possibilities for A and B.

Let me start by breaking down the first reaction.

Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + THF, KH, H+ → A

Hmm. Okay, so the starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom—in this case, the spiro atom is the one where the two rings meet, probably the carbon where the two rings are joined.

The reaction conditions are THF (tetrahydrofuran) solvent, with potassium hydride (KH) and then H+ added. Wait, no, wait—the reagent is written as KH and H+. I'm a bit confused. Wait, I think maybe the reaction is done in THF with KH, and then an acid workup is done. Or perhaps it's a two-step process. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses a strong base like KOtBu or something else, but here it's KH. Hmm.

Wait, I think I've heard that when you use a strong base like KH in THF, it's often for deprotonation. But in this case, our starting alcohol is a secondary or tertiary alcohol? Let's see. The structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the spiro is between a 3-membered and a 5-membered ring? Or wait, the spiro notation is [n.m], so the spiro is between a 3-membered and a 5-membered ring. So the molecule probably has two rings connected at one carbon.

Wait, the structure might look like this: the spiro has a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring. The 1-vinyl group is attached to the spiro carbon. The 5-en indicates a double bond at position 5. So the molecule is a bicyclic structure with a vinyl group and an alcohol group on the same carbon.

Wait, the starting molecule is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So it's a nine-membered compound? Wait, no, the spiro indicates the number of atoms in each ring. So spiro[3.5]non- would be a nine-membered molecule with a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring connected by a spiro atom. So the structure would be a bridge between two rings, with the spiro carbon connected to the vinyl group and the OH group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a bicyclic system. But the exact structure might not matter as much as the reaction's outcome.

Reaction conditions: THF, KH, H+.

KH is a strong base, so I'm thinking of deprotonation. Where would the acidic proton be? The -OH group is an
