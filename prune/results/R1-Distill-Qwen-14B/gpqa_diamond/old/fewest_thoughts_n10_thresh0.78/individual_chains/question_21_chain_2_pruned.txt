Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answers. Let me go through it step by step.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the actual question is about two parts: part A and part B. Let me parse each part carefully.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism. Hmm, what's tautomerism again? Oh right, it's when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a connectivity, like between enol and keto forms. So, tautomerism requires the presence of adjacent double bonds or something similar, right? Or wait, no, wait—tautomerism usually occurs when there's a hydrogen that can move from one position to another, like in ketones and aldehydes when they have alpha hydrogens, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but in this case, both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione are cyclic ketones. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Benzoquinone can exist in two forms: para and ortho. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. So, for tautomerism, a compound needs to have an acidic alpha hydrogen. Because when a hydrogen is alpha to a carbonyl, it can tautomerize.

Wait, wait—tautomerism is a type of isomerism where a hydrogen and a double bond shift place. So, for example, a keto form (like a carbonyl group) can tautomerize to an enol form if there's an adjacent hydrogen. So, if a compound doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, it can't tautomerize.

So, let's look at the two compounds:

1. Benzoquinone: That's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. The structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, no, actually benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Wait, but benzoquinone is either para or ortho. For example, in para-benzoquinone, the two ketones are across from each other. So, each carbonyl is at positions 1 and 4 (para) or 1 and 3 (ortho). Now, each ketone is O=C-R. But in this case, the carbonyl carbons are part of the aromatic ring, so each is connected to two benzene carbons and an oxygen. Wait, but in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one hydrogen (if not substituted). So for benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at a position where the adjacent carbons have hydrogen atoms. So, the carbonyl groups are attached to the benzene ring, and each carbonyl carbon is connected to two benzene carbons and an oxygen. So, wait, does this give them alpha hydrogens?

Wait, the alpha position is the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. For a benzene ring, each carbonyl group is at position 1 and 3 or 1 and
