Hmm, okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. So the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. I remember orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? 

Wait, the solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both of these are phosphoric acid salts. Phosphoric acid is H3PO4, and it has three dissociation steps with given Ka values. 

So first, I think about what each salt dissociates into. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it should dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. The H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. 

Then, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the formula. The formula Na2HPO4 would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. Right, HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion.

But wait, both of these are in the same solution. So when they're mixed, don't they form a buffer solution? Because you have a weak acid and its conjugate base. 

Wait, let me think. H3PO4 can lose three protons, but in this case, H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (since it's H3PO4 losing a proton to become H2PO4^-), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-. So in this solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. So that forms a buffer between the second and third dissociation steps. 

So the pH of the solution should be determined by the second dissociation, because we have H2PO4^- acting as a weak acid and HPO4^2- as its conjugate base. The relevant Ka would be Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. 

Wait, but the question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Hmm, but orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-? But in solution, wouldn't that require more deprotonation than HPO4^2- can provide? Because HPO4^2- is from H2PO4^- losing a proton. To get PO4^3-, HPO4^2- would have to lose another proton. But the given Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is really small, so PO4^3- concentration would be very low.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-, but in solution, under normal circumstances, most of the phosphate species would be HPO4^2- or H2PO4^- depending on pH. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the concentration of PO4^3- ions present in the solution. So, to find that, I need to consider the third dissociation step.

But since the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is determined by the second dissociation. So the concentration of H+ would be related to the second Ka, which is 6.2e-8.

Wait, perhaps using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. Let's see: the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates pH to the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base and the acid. So for the second dissociation, the acid is H2PO4^- and the conjugate base is HPO4^2-.

So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But wait, the question is about PO4^3- concentration. So how do I get that from the solution?

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the distribution of the phosphate species. The phosphate exists in various forms:

H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-.

At pH around pKa2, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But to find the concentration of PO4^3-, I need to consider the third dissociation step. The third Ka is Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So the reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

At pH determined by the buffer solution, which is around pKa2, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because Ka3 is so small.

Wait, but to calculate the exact concentration, maybe I can use the Ka3 expression. Let me think.

The concentration of PO4^3- would be [HPO4^2-] * Ka3 / [H+].

But I need [H+]. From the buffer solution, I can find [H+] using the pH from the Henderson equation.

So first, calculate the pH.

But wait, how much of each salt do we have? The solution has 200 cm^3 (which is 0.2 liters) and contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O.

I need to find the molarity of each in the solution.

So first, calculate moles of each.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass (g) / molar mass. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

Let me compute that: 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007335 mol.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.

1 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005607 mol.

So in the solution, [H2PO4^-] is 0.007335 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036675 M.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.005607 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028035 M.

Wait, but wait, when you have KH2PO4, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So, applying the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So pH = 7.207 + log(0.028035 / 0.036675)

Calculate the ratio: 0.028035 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) is approximately -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092.

Now, knowing pH, we can find [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.092) ≈ 8.27e-8 M.

Now, to find [PO4^3-], we can use the third dissociation equation:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

The expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

So rearranged, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] ) / [H+]

We have [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.028035 M, [H+] ≈ 8.27e-8.

Plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * 0.028035 / (8.27e-8)

Let me compute that.

First, 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 5.0463e-14.

Then, divide by 8.27e-8: 5.0463e-14 / 8.27e-8 ≈ 6.107e-7.

Wait, but wait, that would give me about 6.1e-7 M. But looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is about 3.97e-7. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Let me recheck the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid])

base is HPO4^2-, acid is H2PO4^-.

So [base] is 0.005607 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028035 M.

[acid] is 0.007335 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036675 M.

Ratio = 0.028035 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.7643.

Log(0.7643) is, let's compute it more accurately. Let's see: log(0.7) is about -0.15, log(0.76)= about -0.118.

Wait, maybe using a calculator approach. 10^(-0.115) is around 0.77, which matches our ratio. So the calculation is correct.

So the pH is about 7.092.

Then [H+] is 10^(-7.092) = approximately 8.27e-8 M.

Now, for PO4^3-:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] ) / [H+]

Ka3 is 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028035 M, [H+] is 8.27e-8.

So compute the numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 5.0463e-14.

Denominator: 8.27e-8.

5.0463e-14 / 8.27e-8 = ?

Let me compute 5.0463e-14 / 8.27e-8.

That's (5.0463 / 8.27) * 1e-6.

5.0463 / 8.27 ≈ 0.6099.

So 0.6099e-6 = 6.099e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.10e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7. That's close, but not exactly the same.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the moles.

Wait, let me recheck the moles.

KH2PO4: Mw=136.09 g/mol.

1.00g / 136.09 g/mol = approximately 0.0073347 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw=177.99 g/mol.

1.00g / 177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005607 mol.

So yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L, so concentrations are 0.036675 and 0.028035 M, which I used correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the pH calculation.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8. pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) ?

Wait, pKa is -log(Ka) => pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = 7.207.

So Henderson equation is pH = 7.207 + log(0.7643).

Compute log(0.7643) accurately.

Let me calculate log(0.7643):

I know that log(0.7) is -0.1549, log(0.76) is about -0.1179, log(0.7643) is maybe around -0.115.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

We can use the Taylor series or a logarithm table. Alternatively, since 10^(-0.115) is approximately 0.77, which is close to 0.7643, so it's about 0.7643, so the log is about -0.115.

So pH is 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.092) = approximately 8.27e-8 M.

Wait, perhaps a more precise value of [H+] would help.

Wait, 7.092 pH is same as 10^(-7.092) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092).

10^(-0.092) is approximately 0.825.

Because 10^(-0.1) ≈ 0.794, 0.092 is a little less than 0.1, so maybe around 0.825.

So [H+] is 8.25e-8 M.

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, let me compute 10^(-0.092).

Using natural logs: ln(10^x) = x * ln(10).

But perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, I can think that 10^0.092 is about 1.238.

Wait, wait, no. 10^0.09 is around 1.228. Because 10^0.1 is about 1.2589.

Wait, 10^0.09 is approximately 1.228, so 10^(-0.09) is 1/1.228 ≈ 0.814.

Wait, but wait, the exponent is -0.092, so 10^(-0.092) ≈ 0.814 * (10^(-0.002)).

10^(-0.002) is about 0.995.

So approximately 0.814 * 0.995 ≈ 0.810.

So [H+] is 1e-7 * 0.810 ≈ 8.10e-8 M.

Wait, perhaps that's more accurate.

So [H+] = 8.10e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] ) / [H+]

Ka3=1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] = 0.028035 M, [H+] =8.10e-8.

So numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 5.0463e-14.

Denominator:8.10e-8.

So 5.0463e-14 / 8.10e-8 = (5.0463 /8.10) e-6.

5.0463 /8.10 ≈0.623.

So 0.623e-6 → 6.23e-7 M.

Ah, that's approximately 6.23e-7, which matches option A: 6.24e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, let me recompute that division more accurately.

5.0463e-14 / 8.10e-8 = (5.0463 /8.10) *1e-6.

5.0463 /8.10 → let me compute 5.0463 ÷8.10.

8.10 × 0.623 = 5.0463.

Yes, because 8.10 × 0.6 =4.86, 8.10 ×0.62= 5.022, 0.623 ×8.10= 5.0463.

So yes, 0.623.

So 0.623e-6 =6.23e-7.

So the concentration is approximately 6.23e-7 M, which matches option A: 6.24e-7 M.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B)5.48x10^-7 

C)2.81x10^-7 

D)3.97x10^-7 

So yes, the answer should be A.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts, KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, in water. These salts form a buffer solution involving H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), governing the pH of the solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to calculate the pH:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
\[
\frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007335 \, \text{mol}
\]
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
\[
\frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005607 \, \text{mol}
\]

- Concentrations in 0.2 L:  
\[
[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.007335}{0.2} \approx 0.036675 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005607}{0.2} \approx 0.028035 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log\left(\frac{0.028035}{0.036675}\right)
\]
\[
\frac{0.028035}{0.036675} \approx 0.764, \quad \log(0.764) \approx -0.115
\]
\[
\text{pH} \approx 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [H⁺] from pH
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.27 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Use the third dissociation constant to find [PO₄³⁻]
The third dissociation of phosphoric acid is:
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]
The expression for \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \) is:
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]
Substitute values:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028035)}{8.27 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0463 \times 10^{-14}}{8.27 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.11 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.11 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option **A** (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).

**Answer: A**
