Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reagents. Let's break it down.

First, I need to visualize the target molecule: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the structure has a benzene ring with substituents. Let me draw it out mentally. The benzene ring has a nitro group (-NO2) at the para position and a bromine at the meta position relative to each other. Also, there's a ketone group (ethanone) attached to the ring.

Wait, no, ethan-1-one means the carbonyl is directly attached to the benzene. So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Let me think: numbering the benzene ring, if the ketone is at position 1, then the nitro group is at position 3, and the bromine at position 5. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ketone), 3 (nitro), and 5 (bromo). Wait, but the way the question is phrased is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl. So phenyl group with Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

Wait, another way: the substituents on the benzene ring are a bromine and a nitro group in the meta positions relative to each other. But wait, how does the ethanone fit in? Because ethan-1-one would be a benzene ring with a ketone attached as a substituent. So the ketone is at position 1, then the nitro is at position 3, and the bromine at 5? Or is the ketone at position 2, so the nitro is at position 4 and bromine at position 6? Wait, perhaps I should draw this out.

But maybe I should think about the synthesis steps. Since benzene is the starting material, I need to add substituents in a way that positions them correctly.

So, the target molecule has three substit
