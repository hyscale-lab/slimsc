Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons. Hmm, let's read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question says that the two nucleons (NN) are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Then, Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum? Or wait, maybe S here refers to the spin quantum number, but I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, the question says the equation involves T, S, and L as the quantum numbers of the final state. So for the final state after emission, the isospin T must equal S plus L plus 1 modulo 2.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So from the equation, 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. Let me rearrange that: S + L = -1 mod 2, which is the same as S + L = 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd. So S and L must be of opposite parity. If S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.

The question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are various transitions, each showing the initial state (1S0) and the emitted particle's state, like 7D1 + p, etc., where the lowercase letters are the angular momentum states of X.

Wait, wait. The initial state is 1S0, which means S=0 (because it's S state), L=0 (because it's 1S0, which is L=0). Wait, no: the notation is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 means 2S+1=1 → S=0, L is denoted by the letter S, which is L=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, so J=0.

When they emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is -1. Now, in parity conservation, the product of the parity of the initial state and the parity of X must equal the parity of the final state. Because parity is a multiplicative quantum number.

But wait, the parity of the NN system before emission is... Let me think. For two nucleons, the parity is given by (-1)^L, where L is their orbital angular momentum. Initially, the state is 1S0, so L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

After emitting X, the parity of the final state (the new NN state) times the parity of X should equal the initial parity. So initial parity is +1. So final parity * X parity = initial parity. So final parity * (-1) = +1 → final parity is -1.

So the final state (the new NN) should have parity -1. The parity of the final state is given by (-1)^L_final, so (-1)^L_final = -1 → L_final must be odd. So L_final is an odd integer, like 1,3,5 etc.

Now, going back to the Pauli statistics condition: T = S + L + 1 mod 2. We know T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity.

In the final NN state, what are S and L? Let me think: the total spin S of the NN system, and their orbital angular momentum L. The total angular momentum J is given by the coupling of S and L. But in this equation, S and L are the spin and orbital quantum numbers, not the total J.

So for the final NN state, their spin S can be either triplet (S=1) or singlet (S=0), but that depends on the initial state and the process. Wait, initially, the state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0. So after emitting a particle (which would likely change their spin and orbital configuration), what are the possible S and L?

Wait, the emission of a particle usually involves some interaction, perhaps via a pion (since X has parity -1, and pions have intrinsic parity -1. So perhaps X is a pion, which has spin 0, L for the pion is whatever, etc. But the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1, so maybe it's a pion or something like that.)

But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's focus on each option and apply the constraints.

Each option shows the initial state (1S0) and the emitted particle's state. So the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. The emitted
