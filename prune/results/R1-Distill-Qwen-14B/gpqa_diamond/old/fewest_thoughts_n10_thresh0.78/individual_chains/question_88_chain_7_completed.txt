Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the setup is that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. Then they delivered these to mice via oral gavage. So, the mice swallowed this stuff. But then, when they did in vivo imaging, they saw that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Oh right, the stomach has a lot of acid, which can break down proteins, including maybe the GFP-tagged proteins. So that makes sense why some fluorescence would be destroyed there.

Then, some of the proteins were entangled in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Wait, secondary lymphoid organs include things like Peyer's patches, which are in the intestines. So the proteins didn't get to the lymphoid tissues because they got stuck in the mucus. But wait, the question says they did identify the fluorescent Peyer patches. So they found the patches and isolated the proliferating cells. So maybe the proteins did get there somehow. Or perhaps the GFP was on the capsid, and the immune system is responding.

They sequenced the variable heavy chain gene of those cells and saw high variability. High variability in the variable regions usually points to something like an immune response where B cells are diversifying their antibodies. Because when B cells are activated, they undergo certain processes to diversify their receptors.

The options are A to D. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Somatic hypermutation. I remember that this occurs in B cells during the immune response, especially after the initial encounter with an antigen. It's a process where the variable regions of the B cell receptors (antibodies) undergo mutation, increasing diversity. This happens in the germinal centers after T cell help.

Option B: Complement activation. That's part of the immune response, but I don't think it directly causes variability in the variable regions. Complement proteins like C3b help tag pathogens for destruction, but it's more about marking and opsonizing rather than creating diversity.

Option C: Class switching recombination. This is when B cells change the class of antibody they produce (like from IgM to IgG or IgA). It involves recombination at the heavy chain locus, but it doesn't increase the diversity of the variable regions themselves. It's more about the type of antibody produced.

Option D: VDJ recombination. Oh, that's during the initial development of B cells in the bone marrow. The V, D, J segments are joined to form the variable region of the heavy chain. This process is crucial for generating diversity but occurs during the maturation of B cells in the bone marrow, not in response to an antigen. So in this case, the high variability observed is after the mice encountered the rotavirus, so it's probably not VDJ again.

So the question is about what's happening after the rotavirus is taken up. The experiment shows that the GFP was in the Peyer's patches, which are sites where immune responses happen. They isolated proliferating cellsâ€”probably B cells that are activated. When B cells are activated, they go through somatic hypermutation to increase the diversity of their antibodies, allowing for a more specific and stronger immune response.

So the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes must be due to somatic hypermutation. That points to option A. The other options don't fit because they either occur earlier (VDJ) or are about different aspects (complement, class switching doesn't add variability in variable regions).


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Stomach acid destroys some fluorescence, while others are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Despite this, fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, and proliferating cells are isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene of these cells reveals high variability.

The key to interpreting this result lies in understanding the immune response. High variability in the variable heavy chain gene is characteristic of an adaptive immune response, specifically B cell activation. Among the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in activated B cells during the immune response, increasing the diversity of their antibodies. It fits the observed high variability in the variable regions of the heavy chain gene.
- **B) Complement activation**: While complement proteins like C3b play a role in marking pathogens for destruction, they do not directly increase variability in the variable regions of antibodies.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not increase variability in the variable regions themselves.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This process generates diversity during B cell development in the bone marrow, not in response to an antigen. It occurs earlier in immune development and does not explain the observed variability after rotavirus exposure.

Given the context of antigen exposure and the observed variability, the most likely process is **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in response to an antigen to enhance antibody diversity. 

Answer: A
