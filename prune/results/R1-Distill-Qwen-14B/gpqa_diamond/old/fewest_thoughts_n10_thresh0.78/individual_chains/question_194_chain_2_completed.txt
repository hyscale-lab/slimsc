Okay, I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Let me try to think through it step by step.

So, each spin S can be either +1 or -1. The system has three spins: S1, S2, S3. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). But wait, the energy depends on the product of the spins. So each term in the energy is a product of two spins, and all three such terms are summed.

Let me list all possible states. Each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I'll need to calculate the energy for each state and then sum exp(-βE) for all.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 cases. Because the energy expression is symmetric in all the spins. Maybe we can group the states by their energy.

Let me consider the possible values of each term S_i S_j. Since each S is +1 or -1, the product can be +1 or -1. For each pair, S_i S_j can be 1 or -1. But the energy depends on the sum of these three products.

Wait, the energy E is -J times the sum of the three pairwise products. So E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

Let me define H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J H. So, Z = sum_{all states} exp( β J H ), because exp(-β E) is exp(β J H).

Wait, because E = -J H, so -β E = β J H. So each term in the sum is exp( β J H ), where H is for that state.

So I need to find all possible values of H and how many states give each H.

What are the possible values of H?

Each term in H can be +1 or -1. So H is the sum of three terms each ±1. So H can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, let's see: each term S_i S_j is +1 if the two spins are the same, and -1 if different.

Let me think about all possible combinations.

Case 1: All three S_i S_j terms are +1. That would mean all pairs are the same. So S1 = S2 = S3. Either all +1 or all -1. So how many states in this case?

If all S's are +1: one state. All S's -1: another state. So two states.

In this case, H = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. So H=3 occurs in 2 states.

Case 2: Two of the terms are +1, one is -1.

Wait, let me think. Suppose S1 S2 =1, S1 S3=1, S2 S3= -1. Then H=1+1-1=1.

Wait, but what's the condition for that?

If S1 S2 =1, S1 S3=1, then S2=S1 and S3=S1. So S2 = S3. But then S2 S3 =1, not -1. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, if S1 S2 =1, then S2 = S1. Similarly, S1 S3=1 means S3=S1. So S2 = S3. So S2 S3= S1^2 =1. So in this scenario, all three products are 1. So that's the first case, H=3.

Hmm, so maybe I should think about the possible values of H in another way.

Another approach: the number of +1 terms in H.

Each term S_i S_j is 1 if the two spins are the same, -1 otherwise. So for three terms, how many can be +1?

If all three are same, like all +1, then H=3.

If two are same and one different, then H=1.

Wait, no. Let's think: Suppose two terms are +1, one is -1.

Wait, if two terms are +1, how does that affect the third term?

Wait, let's say S1 S2 =1, S1 S3=1. Then S2=S1 and S3=S1. Then S2 S3 = S1^2 =1. So all three terms are +1. Hence, H=3.

Wait, so if two terms are +1, the third must also be +1. So perhaps the only possible H values are 3, 1, or -3, but wait: is H=1 possible?

Let me think of a configuration where H is 1. That would require the sum of the three terms to be 1. So two terms are +1, one is -1. But as above, that's not possible because if two terms are +1, the third must be +1 as well.

Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Let me think of specific spin configurations.

Wait, another approach: Let's enumerate all possible spin states and calculate H for each.

There are 8 possible states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

Then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. H=3.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2=1. S1S3= -1. S2S3= -1. So H=1 -1 -1 = -1.

Wait, H=1 -1 -1 = -1. So H=-1.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2=-1. S1S3=1. S2S3=-1. H= -1 +1 -1 = -1.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2=-1. S1S3=-1. S2S3=1. H= -1 -1 +1 = -1.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

S1S2=-1. S1S3=-1. S2S3=1. H= -1 -1 +1 = -1.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2=-1. S1S3=1. S2S3=-1. H= -1 +1 -1 = -1.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2=1. S1S3=-1. S2S3=-1. H=1 -1 -1 = -1.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

All products are 1. H=3.

Wow, so looking at all 8 states:

Only two states have H=3 (all same spins). The other six states have H=-1? Wait, no: looking at each state:

Wait, let me double-check.

Wait state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. S1S2=1. S1S3=-1. S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1.

State3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Products: -1, 1, -1. Sum= -1+1-1 = -1.

State4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Products: -1, -1, 1. Sum=-1-1+1=-1.

State5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1. Products: -1, -1, 1. Sum=-1-1+1=-1.

State6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Products: -1, 1, -1. Sum=-1+1-1=-1.

State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Products: 1, -1, -1. Sum=1-1-1=-1.

State8: All -1. So H=3.

Wait, so in all 8 states, only states 1 and 8 have H=3. The rest six states have H=-1.

Wait, what about state 2: H=-1. So in all, H can be 3 (two states) or -1 (six states). So H can't be 1 or -3.

Wait but earlier I thought maybe H=1, but it seems in our enumeration, H is either 3 or -1.

Wait, what if I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check each state again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of H for state 2.

State2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

So S1*S2 = +1. S1*S3 = -1. S2*S3 = -1.

H = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = 1-2 = -1. Correct.

State3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1 S2 = -1. S1 S3 = +1. S2 S3 = -1. So sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.

Hmm, seems correct.

Wait, what about the case where H=1? Because maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about other possible H values. Let me think of another approach. Let me consider the number of +1 terms in H.

Each term is S_i S_j. So each term is 1 if the two spins are the same, -1 otherwise.

The sum H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me denote the number of same pairs as n. So n can be 0,1,2,3.

Each same pair contributes +1, each different contributes -1.

So H = n *1 + (3-n)*(-1) = n - (3 -n) = 2n -3.

So possible H values are:

n=3 → H=3.

n=2 → H=1.

n=1 → H= -1.

n=0 → H= -3.

So H can be 3,1,-1,-3.

But in our earlier enumeration, we only saw H=3 and H=-1. So where are the states with n=2 and n=1 and n=0?

Wait, that suggests that maybe our initial analysis is missing something. Let me re-examine the spin states.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the initial state analysis. Because according to H = 2n -3, H can be 3,1,-1,-3.

So let's reevaluate the states.

Let me think: a state with H=1 would have two same pairs and one different pair.

Wait, for example, S1 and S2 are same, S1 and S3 same, but S2 and S3 different.

Wait, S1 and S3 same implies S3 = S1. S2 same as S1 implies S2=S1. So S2 and S3 are same, so S2 S3=1. But that would give n=3, H=3.

Hmm, that can't be, so perhaps such a state isn't possible. Because if two pairs are same, the third is also same.

Wait, so perhaps for three spins, if two pairs are same, the third must also be same. Because spins are transitive: S1=S2 and S2=S3 implies S1=S3.

Wait, that's right. So in three spins, if two pairs are same, all three spins must be the same. So n=3.

Hence, n=3 → H=3, and n=2 cannot happen. Because if two of the pairs are same, the third must be same.

So in our system, the possible H values are only 3, -1, and -3? Or wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, n=2: two same pairs, so for example S1=S2, S2=S3, but that implies S1=S3. So H would be 3. So n=2 is not possible because it would require S1=S2 and S2=S3, leading to all three same.

Wait, maybe the conclusion is that n can only be 3 or 1 or 0? Because for n=2, it's impossible. So H can only be 3 (n=3), -1 (n=1), or -3 (n=0)?

Wait, but according to the earlier approach, H = 2n -3. So if n=3 → H=3, n=1 → H= -1, n=0→ H=-3.

But according to the spin states, I only found H=3 and H=-1 so far. So where would H=-3 come from?

Wait, H=-3 would occur when all three terms are -1. But when would that happen?

Each term S_i S_j = -1 implies S_i != S_j.

So for all three pairs to be different, each spin must be different from the others. But that's impossible with three spins.

Because if S1 != S2, S1 != S3, and S2 != S3, then we have S1, S2, S3 all different. But each spin is either +1 or -1. So it's impossible to have all three spins different. Because with three spins, you can have at most two different values. So H=-3 is impossible.

Wait, so n=0 is impossible. So H can't be -3.

Similarly, can n=2 be possible? Because if two pairs are same, the third must be same, making n=3, as earlier.

So the only possible H values are 3 and -1.

Wait, but according to our earlier enumeration, all states except the all +1 and all -1 have H=-1.

So, in the 8 possible states, two have H=3, and six have H=-1.

Thus, for the partition function Z, each state contributes exp( β J H ). So:

Z = sum_{all states} exp( β J H )

Which is:

Z = 2 * exp( β J *3 ) + 6 * exp( β J*(-1) )

But wait, wait: H is the sum, which is 3 or -1. So each state with H=3 contributes exp(3 β J ), and each H=-1 contributes exp(-β J).

So the calculation is:

Z = 2 * e^{3 β J} + 6 * e^{- β J}.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see.

Option A: Z=2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ}

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}

Option C: 2e^{2Jβ} +6e^{-2Jβ}

Option D: 6e^{2Jβ}+2e^{-2Jβ}

So our Z is 2 e^{3βJ} +6 e^{-β J }, which matches option B.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought H can be 3 and -1, so exponents are 3β J and -β J.

So the correct partition function would be option B: Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to compute H is for each state.

Wait, let's make sure that H is indeed 3 for two states and -1 for the rest.

Yes, from the earlier state analysis, that's correct.

So the partition function is as in option B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the given system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Understanding the Energy Expression
The energy depends on the sum \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \). Each term \( S_iS_j \) can be \( +1 \) (if \( S_i = S_j \)) or \( -1 \) (if \( S_i \neq S_j \)). Thus, \( H \) can take the values \( 3, 1, -1, -3 \), depending on the spin configuration.

### Step 2: Enumerating Possible States
There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible spin states. By analyzing all states, we find:
- **Two states** (all spins \( +1 \) or all spins \( -1 \)) have \( H = 3 \).
- **Six states** have \( H = -1 \). This occurs when two spins are the same, and one is different.

### Step 3: Partition Function
The partition function is given by:
\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E} = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{\beta J H},
\]
where \( E = -JH \). Substituting the possible values of \( H \):
- For the two states with \( H = 3 \), each contributes \( e^{3\beta J} \).
- For the six states with \( H = -1 \), each contributes \( e^{-\beta J} \).

Thus:
\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}.
\]

### Step 4: Matching with Options
Comparing this result with the given options:
- **Option A:** \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect signs in exponents).
- **Option B:** \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct).
- **Option C:** \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect exponents).
- **Option D:** \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect exponents and coefficients).

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
