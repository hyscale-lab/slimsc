Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I should probably use the Boltzmann equation here because it relates the population of energy levels to temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) ). Right, where n_i and n_j are the number densities of the two energy levels, g_i and g_j are their statistical weights, E_i and E_j are their energies, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, so E_i - E_j = ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. The problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So, the ratio n_1/n_2 is 2, assuming the same transition or something.

Wait, but wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Hmm. So for the same energy level, the excitation is higher in star_1. So (n_i)_1 / (n_i)_2 = 2? Or maybe the ratio of the excited states to the ground state? I think the way the problem is phrased, it's the ratio of the populations of the excited level relative to the ground or another level. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So, for each star, we can write the ratio of excited to ground state as:

For star 1: (n_i^1 / n_j^1) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )
For star 2: (n_i^2 / n_j^2) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

But wait, if the energy levels are the same for both stars, then ΔE is the same. And assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars (since it's the same element, same energy levels), the ratio of the ratios would be:

(n_i^1 / n_j^1) / (n_i^2 / n_j^2) ) = [ exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ) ]

The (g_i/g_j) terms will cancel out because they are same for both stars.

So, (n_i^1 / n_j^1) = (n_i^2 / n_j^2) ) * [ exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ) ]

But the problem says that star_1 has twice as excited, so (n_i^1 / n_j^1) = 2 * (n_i^2 / n_j^2)

So, putting that in:

2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Simplify the exponentials: this becomes exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) )

So, 2 = exp( (ΔE/k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ]

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) )

Wait, let's compute 1/T2
