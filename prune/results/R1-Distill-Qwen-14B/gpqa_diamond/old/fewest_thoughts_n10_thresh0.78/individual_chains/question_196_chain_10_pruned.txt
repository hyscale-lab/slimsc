Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, so the question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but relativity complicates things because as speeds approach the speed of light, the relativistic effects become significant.

Wait, the problem states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So, it's a harmonic oscillator, but taking into account relativistic effects. I think in the relativistic case, the equation of motion must involve the Lorentz factor, which affects mass and energy.

In classical mechanics, the maximum speed v_max would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy (1/2)mv². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, we're in the relativistic case here, so that's probably not the right approach.

Relativistic dynamics involves the total energy. The total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in relativity, kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

The potential energy in the relativistic case is still (1/2)kx², I think, because Hooke's law is F = -kx, so potential is the integral of that. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point, x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic. So the total energy E should be (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, the total energy is also gamma * m c squared. So E = gamma m c² = (1/2)k A². Wait, is that right? Or does the potential energy contribute to the total energy differently?

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. No, wait, in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic. So E_total = gamma m c². But in this case, the oscillator's potential energy is (1/2)kA². So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that at maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero because the speed is zero there. Then, as the oscillator moves towards the equilibrium point, it converts potential into kinetic. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². It's more involved.

So, the total mechanical energy E should be equal to the potential energy at maximum displacement, which is (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is all kinetic, which would be (gamma - 1) m c², since KE = (gamma - 1) m c².

Wait, so setting E = (gamma - 1) m c². But E is also (1/2)kA². So (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A². Let's write that equation:

gamma m c² - m c² = (1/2)k A².

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and we're looking for v_max, which occurs when the kinetic energy is maximum. So the maximum velocity is when all the potential energy has been converted to kinetic, which happens at x=0.

But wait, the total energy E is (1/2)kA², so:
