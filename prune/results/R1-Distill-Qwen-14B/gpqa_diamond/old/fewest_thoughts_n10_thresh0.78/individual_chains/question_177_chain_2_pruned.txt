Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, that must be about their peak emission wavelengths. Oh right, blackbody radiation and all that. Remember, the peak wavelength is related to temperature by Wien's Law.

So, Wien's Law is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If both stars have the same lambda_max, then their temperatures must be the same because b is a constant. Wait, but wait—the question says they appear brightest at the same wavelength. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but the problem is about their luminosities. Luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I remember is L = 4πR²σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, luminosity depends on R squared times T to the fourth power.

So, if both stars have the same temperature, L would be proportional to R squared. Because T is the same, so T^4 is same for both. So let's see:

Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So, L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) )

But T1 = T2, so T terms cancel out. So L1/L2 = (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25. So that's a factor of 2.25.

But wait, the options have 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35. So option A is 2.25, but wait, the problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that
