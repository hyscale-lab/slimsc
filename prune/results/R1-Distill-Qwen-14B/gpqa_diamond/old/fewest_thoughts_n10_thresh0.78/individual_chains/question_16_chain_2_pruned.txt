Okay, so I've got this question here about optical activity in different organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but let's think this through step by step. The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. The options are A to D, with the numbers varying.

First, what's optical activity again? Oh right, a compound is optically active if it has chiral centers, meaning it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, it might have some other form of asymmetry, like a plane of asymmetry, but typically, for these types of problems, we're focusing on chiral centers.

So, let's analyze each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   - Structure: The molecule is an alkene with substituents on the double bond. Let me visualize it. But-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, substituents are Cl on C1 and CH(CH3) on C2. Wait, wait. No, wait. The formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So, the structure is Cl-C double bond to CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace a hydrogen on C1. So, C1 is Cl, C2 is CH2, but wait, no, wait. Let me get that right.

   Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to C1. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond? No, I'm getting confused. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is Cl attached to C1, meaning the structure is Cl-C double bond to CH2-CH2CH3? Or wait, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to a spÂ² hybridized carbon because it's the double bond.

   Oh wait, but the compound is
