Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of IUPAC nomenclature. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. Also, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Additionally, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile group.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. First, I need to imagine the benzene ring and the positions of these substituents. Remembering that in IUPAC naming, the parent compound is the benzoic acid because it has the highest priority. So the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid group as position 1.

Wait, no, actually, the numbering starts so that the functional group with the highest priority gets the lowest possible number. Carboxylic acid is functional group number 1, so it should be at position 1. So the substituents are numbered relative to that.

So, the substituents are:

- Carboxylic acid (COOH) at position 1 (I think that's the starting point).
- Carbaldehyde (CHO) is meta to the COOH. So meta would be three positions away? Wait, in a benzene ring, meta is two positions apart. Wait, wait, the numbering... Let me think, if COOH is 1, then meta would be position 4? Because benzene has six positions. 1, then 2,3,4, etc. If substituents are meta to each other, they are separated by two carbons. So 1 and 3 are meta? No, wait, that's meta. Wait, no, wait, adjacent is ortho (1 and 2), next is meta (1 and 3), and opposite is para (1 and 4). Oh, right, so meta is positions 3 and 5 relative to 1.

Wait, wait, maybe I should draw a benzene ring, but since I can't, I'll visualize it.

COOH is at position 1. The other substituents—carbaldehyde, cyano group—are meta to each other and to COOH? Wait, the question says the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. Hmm. So each of these three substituents is meta to the other two. So all three are in a way, each two positions apart from each other.

Wait, that might not be possible. Let me think. If COOH is at position 1, then the carbaldehyde would be at position 3 (since meta to 1 is 3), and the cyano group would be at position 5 (meta to 3). Then, 5 is meta to 1? Because 1 to 5 is four positions apart, which is across the ring. Oh wait, no, 1 and 5 are actually para to each other, right? Because in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are para, 2 and 5, 3 and 6. So if COOH is at 1, then 4 is para. So that can't be. Wait, maybe I've got the wrong arrangement.

Wait, let me think. All three groups (COOH, CHO, CN) are meta to each other. So each pair is meta. So if COOH is at position 1, then CHO must be at position 3 (meta to 1). Then, the CN group must be meta to both 1 and 3. So from position 3, meta is position 6. So position 6 would be meta to 3. But is position 6 meta to 1? 1 and 6 are adjacent? No, 1 is position 1, 2 is next to it, 3 is next. So 6 is ortho to 1. Wait, that's not right. Because position 6 is next to position 1. So if COOH is at 1, and CN is at 6, then 6 is ortho to COOH, which doesn't fit. So that can't be.

Hmm, maybe I've got the wrong initial positioning. Let's think again. Perhaps the three substituents (COOH, CHO, CN) are all meta to each other, meaning each is meta to the other two. So if COOH is at 1, then CHO has to be at 3, and CN at 5. Wait, but 5 is two positions away from 3 (positions 3,4,5), so that's meta. And 5 is across from 1 (positions 1 and 5 are four apart, which is para). Wait, no, in benzene, positions 1 and 5 are actually two positions apart in the other direction, but it's still the para position. Wait, no, because in a six-membered ring, positions 1 and 4 are para. So 1 is opposite 4, 2 opposite 5, 3 opposite 6.

So if COOH is at 1, then to have substituents at positions that are meta to it, those would be 3 and 5? Wait, because 1 and 3 are meta, and 1 and 5 are also meta. So then, if COOH is 1, CHO is at 3, and CN is at 5, then all three are meta to each other. Because 3 and 5 are two positions apart (meta) and both are meta to 1.

Wait, but 3 and 5 are across from each other? No, 3 and 5 are, wait
