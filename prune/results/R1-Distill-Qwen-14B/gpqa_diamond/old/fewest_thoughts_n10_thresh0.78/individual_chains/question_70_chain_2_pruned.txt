Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question describes a series of reactions involving compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The final question is about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm. First, I think I need to figure out what each compound is based on the reactions given. Let me break down each reaction.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I know that when elements combine, especially in stoichiometric ratios, it can form compounds like metal oxides. Bright red products often make me think of something like copper(II) oxide, which is black, or maybe something else. Wait, another bright red compound I remember is lead(II,IV) oxide (Pb3O4), but that's more like a mixture. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate or sulfate? Or perhaps a transition metal oxide.

Wait, 8 equivalents. That might hint at the ratio of the elements. For example, if B is oxygen (O2), then 8 moles of O2 reacting with A would form something like A O4? Or maybe A is a metal, and the oxide has a formula like MO, but 8 O2 per A would be a lot. Wait, perhaps A is copper (Cu), and B is sulfur trioxide (SO3) maybe? Or maybe B is something else.

Alternatively, if A is sodium (Na), and B is chlorine (Cl2), then 8 Cl2 molecules reacting with Na would form NaCl, but that's not a red product. Hmm. Maybe the bright red product is something like Fe3O4? No, that's black. Or perhaps it's a different metal. Wait, maybe the product is a sulfide? But sulfides are usually black or another color. Hmm, not sure yet.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E is a product, so maybe it's something like a toxic gas or a strong acid? Or maybe a highly reactive compound. Alternatively, if C is a metal oxide, D could be a non-metallic gas like H2S or something else. Wait, D is a gas, so maybe H2, O2, Cl2, etc.

Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C (the oxide) reacts with water, it forms an acid. For example, if C is a metal oxide, then it would form a corresponding base. But wait, F and G are acids, so C must be a non-metal oxide. Typically, non-metal oxides react with water to form acids. So C is probably a non-metal oxide, like SO3 or something else.

Wait, if C is SO3, then reacting with water would form H2SO4 (a strong acid) and another acid? Wait, no, SO3 plus water is H2SO4, which is a strong acid. So maybe F is H2SO4 and G is something else. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed oxide that upon hydrolysis yields two different acids. For example, if C is Pb3O4, which upon reaction with water could form PbO2 and Pb(OH)2, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, another thought. If C is a sulfate, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite, but that might not fit.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the reactions again.

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)

Reaction 2: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A (reformed) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)

Hmm. So when C reacts with water, it gives back A. So A is being reformed, which suggests that A is an element that's part of C's structure. So perhaps A is a metal, and C is its oxide. Wait, but then in reaction 3, when C reacts with water, you get A back and two acids. That would mean that the oxide is of a metal that forms two different oxyacids when reacted with water. Wait, but metals typically form bases, not acids. So perhaps C is a non-metal oxide.

Wait, for example, if C is CO2, but CO2 reacting with water gives H2CO3 (carbonic acid), which is a weak acid. But we need two different acids, F and G. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a trioxide. Let's think: for example, if C is SO3. So SO3 (which is a liquid at room temp, but maybe under certain conditions it's gaseous?), but in reaction 3, SO3 + H2O → H2SO4, which is a strong acid, but that's one acid. So where does the other acid come in?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. For example, perhaps it's a compound like Pb3O4, which is a mixture of PbO and Pb2O3. When Pb3O4 reacts with water, it might produce PbO2 and Pb(OH)2, but I'm not sure about the products.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a diacid anhydride. For instance, if C is something like (HPO3), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite, but that's not leading me anywhere.

Wait, let me think about reaction 3 again. C plus water gives back A plus two different acids. So A must be a component of C but in a different form. For example, if C is a compound like H2SO4·H2O (but that's not an oxide). Alternatively, suppose C is a trioxide, and upon hydration, it forms two different acids. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps C is a metal oxide. Let's say C is FeO. Then, when FeO reacts with water, it would form Fe(OH)2, which is a base, not an acid. That doesn't fit. So maybe C is a non-metal oxide.

Wait, maybe C is P4O10, which is a phosphate anhydride. When it reacts with water, it forms H3PO4 (phosphoric acid), which is a weak acid. But that's only one acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a compound like SO3. Then, when SO3 reacts with water, it forms H2SO4, a strong acid. But again, only one acid. So that doesn't fit reaction 3, which requires two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed oxide that upon hydrolysis gives two different acids. For example, consider something like P4O6, which is a diphosphorus trioxide. Reacting with water gives H3PO3 and H3PO4? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound like As2O3, which when reacted with water gives H3AsO3 and H3AsO4, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. But carbonates typically form only one acid when reacted with water.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the reactions again.

Reaction 1: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. If B is O2, then 8 equivalents would mean that the formula of C could be A with an oxide with a high O content. For example, if A is copper (Cu), and B is O2, then Cu + O2 → CuO. But CuO is black, not bright red. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe B is another element. Let me think about a reaction where a metal reacts with a gas to form a bright red product. For example, maybe PbO2 is dark red, but I'm not sure. Another thought: maybe A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas, like Cl2. Then, 8 Cl2 molecules would react with A to form a chloride. But what chloride is bright red? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another possibility. Let's think about the reaction where solid A is sodium (Na), and B is chlorine (Cl2). Then, 8 equivalents of Cl2 would result in NaCl, but that's a white solid, not red.

Hmm. Maybe A is a metal and B is a compound gas. Alternatively, maybe B is SO3.

Wait, let me think about Reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So if C is a trioxide, perhaps when it reacts with water, it forms two different acids. For example, H2SO4 (strong) and H2SO3 (weak). But that would require C to be SO3, but how does SO3 react with water? It forms H2SO4, but that's a single acid. Wait, maybe C is a different compound.

Wait, another idea: what if C is a mixed oxide like Fe3O4. Fe3O4 is a magnetic black powder. When
