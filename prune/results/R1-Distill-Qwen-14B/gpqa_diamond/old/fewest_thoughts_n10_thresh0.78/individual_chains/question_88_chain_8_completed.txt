Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. I'm a bit new to immunology, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

The question says that inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP. They're delivered to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw that some GFP was destroyed by stomach acid and some got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They identified fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability. The question is asking which process is happening here.

Hmm, so I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, right? They're involved in immune responses, especially in the mucosal immune system. So when something is tagged and ends up there, it's probably triggering an immune response, especially since they're isolating proliferating cells.

The key here is the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. I think that has to do with the immune system's way of generating diversity in antibodies. So which processes create variability in the antibody genes?

Let me recall: during B cell development, the initial formation of the B cell receptor (BCR) involves VDJ recombination. V refers to variable segments, D for diversity, and J for joining. This happens in the bone marrow, I think, during the early stages. This process creates a diverse array of antibodies from the start.

But after that, when an antigen is encountered, the B cells undergo somatic hypermutation. This process introduces more mutations in the variable region, increasing the diversity of the antibodies. This is a type of error-prone DNA replication that happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, like the spleen and lymph nodes. So the cells in the Peyer patches that are proliferating are probably in a germinal center-like environment.

Wait, but Peyer patches themselves contain structures similar to those in other lymphoid tissues. Germinal centers are where B cells proliferate and undergo these processes. So the cells isolated are likely activated B cells undergoing this hypermutation.

Looking at the options: 

A) Somatic hypermutation. That fits because it's a process that happens after initial VDJ recombination, adding more variability.

B) Complement activation. That's more about the actual destruction of pathogens, not about gene variability.

C) Class switching recombination. That's about changing the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), which doesn't affect the variable regions as much.

D) VDJ recombination. That's the initial setup, happens during B cell development, not in the response after antigen exposure.

So the process here is somatic hypermutation, which creates the high variability observed in the variable heavy chains after the immune response is triggered.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP fluorescence was observed in Peyer patches, which are specialized structures in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. These patches are known to play a role in mucosal immunity. The isolated proliferating cell population, likely B cells, showed high variability in their variable heavy chain genes after sequencing.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that increases antibody diversity. VDJ recombination occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes the initial diversity of B cell receptors. However, this process does not occur in response to antigen exposure. Instead, somatic hypermutation is the process responsible for introducing additional mutations into the variable regions of antibody genes after an antigen is encountered. This error-prone DNA replication occurs in germinal centers, such as those found in lymphoid tissues like Peyer patches, and is consistent with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

Complement activation (Option B) is unrelated to genetic variability and instead involves the destruction of pathogens. Class switching recombination (Option C) alters the antibody isotype but does not affect the variable regions. Therefore, the correct process taking place is somatic hypermutation.

Answer: A
