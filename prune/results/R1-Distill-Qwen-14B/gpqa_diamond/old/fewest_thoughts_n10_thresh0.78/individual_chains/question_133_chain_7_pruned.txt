Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through the steps.

The problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. We're given a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are provided: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C, and we're given the three Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5x10^-3, Ka2 is 6.2x10^-8, and Ka3 is 1.8x10^-12.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-. So I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution.

Wait, but the salts provided are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. These are different phosphate species. Let me think about their dissociation.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). In solution, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. When dissolved, it should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These can interconvert based on the pH of the solution. The question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Because HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-, but that's the third dissociation step. So that's governed by Ka3.

So, let's think about the system. We have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. Since both are present, the solution might form a buffer. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the two salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Let me calculate their moles first.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007348 mol.
