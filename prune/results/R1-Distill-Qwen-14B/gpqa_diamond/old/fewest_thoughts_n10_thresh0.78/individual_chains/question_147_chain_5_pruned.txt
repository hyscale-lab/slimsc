Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. The process given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Oh wait, wait, the particles are anti-proton and proton annihilating each other. I think when particles and their antiparticles annihilate, they convert their mass into energy, probably in the form of other particles. So the products here are these A⁺ and A⁻ particles. 

The question says that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, right, when something is moving slowly, that usually means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe I can approximate it as being at rest? Or perhaps I should consider that its velocity is non-relativistic. Wait, but the problem states it's moving slowly, which might imply that we can treat it with non-relativistic equations, but I'm not sure yet.

The given mass-energy of A is 300 MeV. So m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of the particle A. Let's think about conservation laws here. Since the initial system is a proton and an antiproton, their rest masses are each about 938 MeV/c². Wait, yes, the proton mass is approximately 938 MeV/c², so the rest energy of the proton is about 938 MeV, same for the antiproton. So their combined rest energy is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV.

Wait, but in the annihilation, they produce four particles, two A⁺ and two A⁻. Each A has a mass of 300 MeV, so the total rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. Oh, but wait, that's less than the initial rest mass. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because in particle reactions, the total energy must be conserved, including rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So maybe the initial particles have a lot of kinetic energy, or perhaps the A particles are moving, so their kinetic energy plus their rest mass equals the initial total energy.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the initial kinetic energy isn't that high. Or perhaps the antiproton's speed is negligible compared to the speed of light, so we can approximate its kinetic energy as (1/2)mv². But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial total energy is approximately the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. So the initial energy would be m_p c² + m_p c² (since the antiproton has the same mass as the proton) which is 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. The products, as I thought earlier, have a rest mass of 1200 MeV. So the initial rest energy is higher than the rest energy of the products, which means the products must have some kinetic energy as well.

But wait, if the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton, when they annihilate, they produce other particles. But in this case, the product is four particles. So the initial total energy is the sum of the rest energy of the proton and the total energy of the antiproton.
