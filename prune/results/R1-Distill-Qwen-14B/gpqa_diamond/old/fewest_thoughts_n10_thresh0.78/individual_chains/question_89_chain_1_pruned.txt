Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break it down step by step.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The IR spectrum has a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Okay, so I'm thinking about the reaction. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with a strong base like KOH, it's likely an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. So when KOH is added, it should abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bicyclic compound. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, very rigid. So the molecule is a bridged bicyclic compound with two bromines on adjacent bridgeheads. When KOH is added, it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, which should form an alkene. But wait, each Br is on a bridgehead. So eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond between the bridgehead carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different elimination. Since two bromines are present, perhaps it's a double elimination. So maybe the product is an allene or some kind of conjugated diene. But wait, in adamantane, the bridged structure would make the positions of the Brs such that elimination would form a bridgehead double bond, which is not allowed because of Bredt's rule. Bredt's rule states that double
