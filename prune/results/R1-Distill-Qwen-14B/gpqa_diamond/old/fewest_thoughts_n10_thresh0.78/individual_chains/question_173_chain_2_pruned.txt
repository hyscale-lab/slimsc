Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is: An electron is moving with speed v = 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its location is Δx = 0.1 nm. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. The options are given as A to D with different exponents of 10.

Hmm, I remember that this has to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other.

The formula I remember is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, actually, the exact form might be Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, but sometimes people use the approximation where it's just ħ, like ΔxΔp ≈ ħ. I think for this problem, maybe the exact factor won't matter because it's asking for an estimate, so I can approximate.

But wait, the question is about the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. How does that tie in? I think energy and momentum are related through the kinetic energy formula. Since the electron is moving, its kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But the uncertainty in energy ΔE probably relates to the uncertainty in momentum Δp. Because the energy of a particle is connected to its momentum via E = p²/(2m), where m is mass.

So, using the uncertainty principle, I can find Δp, and then relate that to ΔE. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's find Δp. From the uncertainty principle, Δx * Δp ≈ ħ. So Δp ≈ ħ / Δx.

What's the value of ħ? I remember that Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, so ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.055 x 10^-34 J·s. But when doing order-of-magnitude estimates, sometimes people use 10^-34 for simplicity.

Δx is given as 0.1 nm. Since 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters.

So plugging in the numbers:

Δp ≈ ħ / Δx ≈ (1e-34 J·s) / (1e-10 m) = 1e-24 J·s/m, which is equivalent to 1e-24 kg·m/s.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check the units. ħ has units of J·s. Divided by meters (Δx in m) gives J·s/m. But J is kg·m²/s², so J·s/m is (kg·m²/s²) * s / m = kg·m/s. Yes, which is kg·m/s, which is the unit of momentum (p). So the calculation looks correct.

Now, the next step is to relate the momentum uncertainty Δp to the energy uncertainty
