Okay, so I've got this question here about a textile dye emitting light with a specific energy, and I need to figure out what color it absorbs. Hmm, let me think. I remember something about the energy of light and how it relates to the colors of the spectrum.

Wait, when a compound emits light, it's usually because it absorbed some other light and then re-emits. Oh right, that's fluorescence or something like that. So the dye emits light of a certain energy, which means it must have absorbed light of a higher energy, right? Because when electrons get excited, they drop from a higher energy state to a lower one, emitting a photon. So the absorbed light must be higher in energy than the emitted one.

The energy given here is 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color corresponds to that energy. I remember the relationship between energy and wavelength is E = hc/λ. And since colors are related to wavelengths, I can use that to find the wavelength.

Let me recall the constants. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. But wait, converting electron volts to joules is a bit tricky. Oh right, 1 eV is equal to 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So I can use that to convert the energy.

So E is 2.3393 eV. Converting to joules: 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 3.745e-19 J.

Now plug into E = hc/λ. So rearranged, λ = hc/E.

Calculating hc: 6.626e-34 * 3.0e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide that by E (3.745e-19 J) to get λ: 1.9878e-25 / 3.745e-19 ≈ 5.305e-7 meters. Wait, 5.3e-7 meters is 530.5 nanometers. That's in the visible spectrum.

What color is around 530 nm? I remember the colors go roughly: violet is about 400-450 nm, blue 450-500, green 500-570, yellow 570-600, orange 600-630, red 630-700. So 530 is in the green range. But wait, the question is about the absorbed light, not the emitted. Because the dye emits at 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green), that means it absorbed higher energy (shorter wavelength) light.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. When a molecule absorbs light, it's the energy that causes an electron to jump from a lower to a higher energy level. Then, when it emits, it releases a photon of lower energy than what was absorbed. So if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV (5
