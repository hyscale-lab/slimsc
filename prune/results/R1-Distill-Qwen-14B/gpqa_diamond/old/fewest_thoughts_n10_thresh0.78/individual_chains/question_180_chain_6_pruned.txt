Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e. So, 2 times the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. They also have negligible mass, so I don't have to worry about things like kinetic energy from their movement, I guess.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are A to D, with some very small numbers and one bigger number, D.

Hmm, so I think this is a potential energy problem. Because in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges depends on their positions. Since the particles are identical and have the same charge, I probably need to compute the potential energy between each pair and sum them all up.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P, so it's stationary. The other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of those 12 is at a distance of 2m from P, which is where the 13th charge is.

So, the system has two types of interactions: between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 charges, and between each pair of the 12 charges at 2 meters apart from each other? Wait, no, because the 12 are constrained at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other might not be specified. Hmm, but the problem says each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but I don't know how they are arranged around P. Are they all on a sphere of radius 2m? Or arranged in some way that the distance between any two is known?

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the arrangement of the 12 charges around point P. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are very far apart compared to 2m, so that the distances between them are much larger than 2m, making the potential energy between them negligible. Or maybe the problem is considering that the 12 charges are equally spaced on a sphere, but without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to compute their mutual distances. 

But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, so maybe the minimum potential energy occurs when the charges are as far apart as possible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum is when they are all placed symmetrically, but I'm not certain. Since the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, perhaps the 12 are all at 2m from P but the distances between each other are considered to be very large, so their mutual potential energies can be ignored. Or maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12.

Wait a minute, let me think again
