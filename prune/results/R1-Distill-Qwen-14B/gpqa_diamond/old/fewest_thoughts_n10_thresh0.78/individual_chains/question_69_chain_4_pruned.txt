Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber at CERN. Hmm, I need to figure out the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. Let me try to break this down.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime (tau_0) is 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are all different resolutions, measured in meters, so I think I'm looking for a length here.

Wait, proper lifetime is tau_0. But when particles are moving, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Oh right, that's the gamma factor. So the lifetime observed is tau = gamma * tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²), I think. Since E is given, and m is the rest mass, which is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, energy E is 27 GeV. So gamma would be E/(m c²), but wait, c squared is in units that matter here. Wait, in particle physics, energies and masses are often given in GeV and GeV/c². So m c² is 3.41 GeV (since mass is 3.41 GeV/c², multiplied by c² gives GeV). So gamma is E / (m c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.91. Let me compute that more accurately: 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 * 7 is 23.87, 3.41*8 is 27.28, which is a bit over 27. So approximately 7.91.

So gamma is about 7.91. So the observed lifetime tau is gamma * tau_0. Tau_0 is 8e-16 s. So tau ≈ 7.91 * 8e-16 = around 6.328e-15 seconds. Wait, 7.91 * 8 is about 63.28, so 63.28e-16 = 6.328e-15 s.

Now, the next part is about the resolution needed. The resolution is the minimum distance that can be detected. I think this relates to the speed of the particles and the lifetime. Because the decay products will travel some distance before the detector can register the decay.

In the lab frame, the X⁰ is moving with some velocity, and when it decays, the decay products (Y and Z) will move as well. But in the bubble chamber, the time it takes for the decay to be observed depends on the speed and the lifetime. The distance the particle travels before decaying is x = v * tau. But wait, since the lifetime is longer due to gamma, the distance would be longer.

Wait, but the proper lifetime is tau_0, so the lab
