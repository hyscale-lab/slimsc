Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, so the field is f(r) = 1/r² in the radial direction. So in vector form, that's f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, right? Because it's only radial. And we're integrating the divergence of this field over the volume of a sphere.

Hmm, divergence... I remember that divergence measures how much the field is spreading out or converging at a point. For a vector field that's radial and depends only on r, I think there's a formula for the divergence in spherical coordinates.

Oh right, for a vector field that's purely radial and depends only on r, the divergence is given by (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r), where f_r is the component in the radial direction. So in this case, f_r is 1/r², so let me plug that in.

So, ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ].

Simplify inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So the divergence of this field is zero everywhere except possibly at the origin. But the origin is a point, and in integration, points don't contribute anything. So the integral over any volume except the origin would be zero.

But wait, wait. Let me think. The field is f(r) = 1/r² r̂, which is the same as the electric field of a point charge, right? Or wait, no, the electric field for a point charge is proportional to 1/r², but that's for a charge at the origin. So for a charge q, E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/r²) r̂. So the divergence of E is zero except at r=0, which is
