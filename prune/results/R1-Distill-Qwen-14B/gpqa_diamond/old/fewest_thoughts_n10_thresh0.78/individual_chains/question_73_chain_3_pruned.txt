Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think it through step by step.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m and are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the same direction (positive x-axis). I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical addition; you have to use Einstein's velocity addition formula. Oh wait, right, because at high speeds, classical mechanics don't apply anymore. So for their relative speed, I can't just subtract 0.6c -0.5c and get 0.1c. That's probably a common mistake. I need to use the relativistic formula.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, u is the velocity of the second object from the first's frame, right? Wait, no, I think I might have the formula wrong. Let me recall it correctly. The correct formula for the relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, but I need to get u and v correctly. Let me think: if astronaut A is moving at speed v, and astronaut B is moving at speed u, then from A's frame, B's speed is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). Oh, because according to A, B is moving at (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²).

Wait, so astronaut A is at 2m moving at 0.6c, astronaut B is at 3m moving at 0.5c. So in the rest frame of astronaut A, what is the speed of astronaut B? Because we're looking for the relative speed, which would be the speed of one as seen from the other. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?

So in this case, u is 0.5c (B's speed in the lab frame) and v is 0.6c (A's speed in the lab frame), right? So substituting into the formula: (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c
