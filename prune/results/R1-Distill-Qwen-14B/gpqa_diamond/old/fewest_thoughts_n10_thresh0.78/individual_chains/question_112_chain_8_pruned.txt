Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about an electron state described by |alpha>, and we have to find probabilities and the average value of a certain operator. Let me read the problem again.

So, the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. Wait, proportional, so I guess it's not normalized yet. I'll need to normalize it first, right? Because probabilities come from squared magnitudes, so I must find the normalization factor.

The operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me consider the basis states. The up and down states are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin, so the basis is |up> and |down>. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, the operator's matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, else 0. Oh, that's a bit like an off-diagonal matrix. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal (i≠j) are ħ/2. So the matrix looks like this:

[  0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0  ]

Hmm, that's a spin operator perhaps? Or maybe similar to an X or Y operator, but scaled. Let's think about it. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is similar but scaled by ħ/2. Maybe it's (ħ/2) times sigma_x or sigma_y? Because sigma_x has 1s off-diagonal.

But more importantly, I'm supposed to find the probability of measuring the eigenstates of this operator. Wait, the operator's eigenstates are different from the up and down states, right? Because the up and down are eigenstates of S_z. So, I need to find the eigenstates of this operator A, and then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates. Because the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes in those eigenstates.

Alternatively, the operator A is given, so perhaps I can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Then, the state |alpha> can be expanded in terms of these eigenvectors, and the probabilities are the squares of the coefficients.

Wait, but another approach. The operator A is given, so perhaps I can find the expectation value directly, but the question also asks for the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. So maybe I should first find the eigenstates of A.

Let me try that. Let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The matrix A is:

0   ħ/2
ħ/2 0

To find the eigenvalues, solve det(A - λI) = 0.

So the determinant is:

( -λ ) ( -λ ) - ( ħ/2 )^2 = 0

That's λ² - (ħ² /4 ) = 0 → λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Now, the eigenvectors.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0.

[ -ħ/2  ħ/2 ] [a]   [0]
[ ħ/2  -ħ/2 ] [b]   [0]

So, the equations:

-ħ/2 * a + ħ/2 * b = 0
ħ/2 a - ħ/2 b = 0

Which simplifies to a = b.

So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [1, 1]^T. But we can normalize it. The eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 1] for λ=+ħ/2.

Similarly, for λ=-ħ/2:

(A + λ I) v = 0

[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [a]   [0]
[ ħ/2  -ħ/2 ] [b]   [0]

The equations:

(ħ/2)a + (ħ/2)b =0 → a + b =0
(ħ/2)a – (ħ/2)b =0 → a - b =0

From first equation: a = -b
From second: a = b → So a = b =0? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, for λ=-ħ/2, the matrix is A - (-ħ/2) I = A + (ħ/2) I.

So the matrix becomes:

0 + ħ/2   ħ/2 → [ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
ħ/2       0 + ħ/2 → [ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]

Wait, perhaps I should write it properly.

Wait, for λ = -ħ/2, the matrix is:

A - λ I = [ 0 +
