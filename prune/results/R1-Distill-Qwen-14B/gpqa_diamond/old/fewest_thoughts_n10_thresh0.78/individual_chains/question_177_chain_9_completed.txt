Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, wait, the wavelength at which a star appears brightest is related to its temperature, right? Oh right, that's Wien's Law. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because Wien's Law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same, T must be the same.

But wait, wait a second. The stars are moving with radial velocities of 0 and 700 km/s. How does that affect their observed wavelengths? Oh, right, that's the Doppler effect. Because Star_2 is moving towards us (since radial velocity is positive, I think, but wait, no—radial velocity is 700 km/s. Wait, the radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. If Star_2 has a higher velocity, does that affect its observed wavelength? Because when a star moves towards us, the light is blueshifted, and when it moves away, it's redshifted. Oh wait, but the problem says they found the same wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So maybe when considering the Doppler shift, the observed temperatures are the same.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me structure this.

First, the problem says that the stars' peak wavelengths are the same. But we have to consider their velocities because of the Doppler effect. So the observed temperature would be different from the intrinsic temperature due to their velocities.

Wait, but the problem says, "they are the same." So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. But each star's intrinsic temperature would be different because of their velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rest frame of the stars, before any Doppler shifting. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read that part again.

"Astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed λ_max is same for both. So we need to account for the Doppler shift in each star's spectrum.

Wait, but wait: if the stars have different velocities, their observed λ_max would differ unless their intrinsic temperatures and velocities are adjusted accordingly.

Let me think about this. The intrinsic temperature T affects λ_max via Wien's law. But if the star is moving towards us, its observed λ_max would be shorter (blueshifted), and if moving away, longer (redshifted). So the observed λ_max is influenced by both the intrinsic temperature and the Doppler shift.

So the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but wait, no, that's relativistic Doppler shift, but if the velocities are not too high, maybe we can approximate it as (1 + v_r/c), but wait, the velocities here are 0 and 700 km/s. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 km/s is about 0.23% of c. So maybe using the non-relativistic approximation would be acceptable. Wait, but the Doppler effect for wavelength is given by (λ_observed - λ_rest)/λ_rest = v_r / c. So for Star_1, v_r is 0, so λ_obs = λ_rest1. Star_2 has v_r =700 km/s, which is about 0.00233c. So the Doppler shift should be considered.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed λ_max are the same. So for both stars, the observed λ_max is the same, but their intrinsic (rest) λ_max (and hence temperatures) would be different.

So, let's denote:

For Star_1: v1 = 0 → Doppler factor is 1. So observed λ1 = λ1_rest.

For Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s. Let me compute the Doppler shift. Using the relativistic formula for Doppler shift in terms of wavelength: λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but if v is much smaller than c (which it is here), we can approximate this as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c). Wait, no—actually, for small v, the approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c) when the source is moving away (v positive). Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If a star is moving towards us (v positive), then the observed wavelength is shorter than the emitted. So the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c). Wait no, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the standard Doppler shift formula for light when the source is moving towards the observer is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c. Alternatively, for small beta, this can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 - beta), because sqrt((1-beta)/(1+beta)) ≈ (1-beta) when beta is small.

Wait, let me think. Let's use the exact formula first. For sources moving towards us (v positive), the observed wavelength is shorter. So the formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ). Alternatively, the observed frequency is higher, so the exact formula for frequency is f_obs = f_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ). Hmm.

But perhaps a better approach is to relate the observed peak wavelength to the rest frame using the Doppler shift. Since the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, let's denote this observed λ as λ_0. So,

For Star_1: λ_0 = λ1_rest (since v1 = 0)
For Star_2: λ_0 = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ) ), since Star_2 is moving with velocity v2 (700 km/s) towards us (assuming positive v is towards us; wait, wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700. Wait, radial velocity can be positive or negative depending on direction. Let me check: the problem says, "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." So Star_1 has radial velocity 0; Star_2 has 700 km/s. So what direction is that? Radial velocity is positive if moving away, or towards? Typically, radial velocity is positive when moving away from the observer. Wait, no, wait, the definition can vary. But generally, a positive radial velocity indicates moving away. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: if a star is moving toward us, the observed wavelength is blueshifted, so the observed λ is less than emitted. The radial velocity would be negative if moving towards us, positive if moving away. Or depends on the convention. Oh, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that radial velocity is the component along the line of sight, and positive is moving away, negative is moving towards. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that would be moving away at 700 km/s. So, v = +700 km/s.

Wait, but in that case, the observed wavelength would be redshifted. Because the star is moving away, so the light is redshifted. So the observed λ would be longer than λ_rest. So for Star_2, λ_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), where beta = v/c = 700/(3e5) ≈ 0.002333.

But wait, let me get this right. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) )?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the Doppler shift formula. Alternatively, the exact formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) . 

So for Star_1, v = 0: λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

For Star_2, v = +700 km/s, so λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + 700/(3e5)) / (1 - 700/(3e5)) )

Since 700/(3e5) is approximately 0.002333, which is small, we can approximate this as λ2_obs ≈ λ2_rest * (1 + (v/c)).

Wait, but wait, let me compute this.

Let me compute sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) for beta = 0.002333.

Let me compute (1 + beta) = 1.002333, (1 - beta) = 0.997667.

So (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ 1.00468. Taking the square root gives approximately 1.00234.

So sqrt( (1+beta)/(1 - beta) ) ≈ 1 + beta, because for small beta, this is approximately 1 + beta.

So λ2_obs ≈ λ2_rest * 1.00234.

But the problem states that both λ1_obs and λ2_obs are the same. Let's denote this as λ0.

So for Star_1:

λ0 = λ1_rest.

For Star_2:

λ0 = λ2_rest * 1.00234.

So λ2_rest = λ0 / 1.00234 ≈ λ0 * (1 - 0.00234) ≈ λ0 (0.99766).

Wait, but wait, this is an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate it precisely.

But let's proceed. Since λ1_obs = λ2_obs = λ0.

So, λ1_rest = λ0.

λ2_rest = λ0 / ( sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

Which is λ0 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) )

Because λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), so λ_rest = λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So, λ2_rest = λ0 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Compute sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) for beta=0.002333.

(1 - beta) ≈ 0.997667, (1 + beta) ≈ 1.002333.

(0.997667)/(1.002333) ≈ 0.99533.

Take the square root: sqrt(0.99533) ≈ 0.99766.

So λ2_rest ≈ λ0 * 0.99766.

Wait, but wait, Star_1's λ_rest is λ0, and Star_2's λ_rest is approximately 0.99766 * λ0. So Star_2 is at a higher temperature than Star_1, because λ_rest is inversely proportional to temperature.

Wait, no. Because Wien's law says λ_max = b / T, so if λ_rest is smaller, T is higher. So Star_2 has a higher temperature.

Wait, Star_2's λ_rest is λ2_rest = λ0 * 0.99766. Which is slightly less than λ0. So its temperature T2 is higher than T1's T1, as T is inversely proportional to λ_rest.

Wait, but let's compute the ratio of the temperatures.

For Star_1: T1 = b / λ1_rest = b / λ0.

For Star_2: T2 = b / λ2_rest = b / (λ0 * 0.99766) ≈ (b/λ0) / 0.99766 ≈ T1 * 1/(0.99766) ≈ T1 * 1.00234.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.00234.

So T2 is about 0.23% higher than T1.

Wait, but this is a very small difference. Maybe the problem is assuming that the Doppler shift is negligible, and the temperatures are the same, but I'm not sure. Because otherwise, the problem becomes more complicated. But let's proceed with the given data.

But maybe the question is not considering the Doppler shift for the temperature? Or perhaps it's intended that the rest wavelengths are the same, so the temperatures are the same. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So we must include the Doppler effect in our calculations.

Wait, the problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies, so their luminosity depends on their radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) ) = ( (1.5 R2 )² / R2² ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Simplify R part: (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1 / T2)^4.

But from earlier, T2 ≈ 1.00234 T1. So T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.00234 ≈ 0.99766.

So (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.99766)^4 ≈ approx 0.9906.

So 2.25 * 0.9906 ≈ 2.228.

But looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which would fit.

Wait, but that's under the assumption that T2 is about 0.23% higher than T1.

But wait, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Let me re-express this.

Wait, perhaps I should model it more accurately. So let's compute T2 and T1.

We have λ0 = λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, λ0 is the observed λ_max for both, which is the same.

So λ1_rest = λ0.

λ2_rest = λ0 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Then, T1 = b / λ1_rest = b / λ0.

T2 = b / λ2_rest = b / (λ0 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1+beta) )) )

= (b/λ0) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

= T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But beta is 700/(3e5) = 7e2 /3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0233333.

Wait, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. Wait, no: 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s. Speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s.

So beta = 7e5 m/s / 3e8 m/s = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(3e3) ≈ 0.00233333.

So beta is 0.00233333.

So (1 + beta) = 1.0023333, (1 - beta) = 0.9976667.

So (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ≈ 1.0046668.

So sqrt(1.0046668) ≈ approx 1.002332.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002332.

So T2 is about 0.233% higher than T1.

So the ratio T1/T2 = 1 / 1.002332 ≈ 0.99767.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4.

Calculating that:

0.99767^2 ≈ 0.99535.

0.99535^2 ≈ approximately 0.9907.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So the ratio L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Looking at the options: option D is ~2.23, which is the closest.

So the answer would be D) ~2.23.

But let me think again: did I account for all factors correctly? The problem states that the stars' luminosities are being compared, and under the black body assumption.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Doppler effect should be considered when calculating the observed flux, but the problem is about their intrinsic luminosities. Because luminosity is an intrinsic property, while observed flux depends on distance and Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity, so that would be the intrinsic luminosity, not the observed flux. So maybe the Doppler effect doesn't affect the calculation of their intrinsic luminosities.

Wait, this is getting a bit tricky. Let's think about what the luminosity depends on. Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, which depends on R and T. The observed flux depends on L, distance, and Doppler factors.

Wait, but the problem says the stars are observed to have the same λ_max. So that is the observed λ_max. So it's the observed wavelength, which would be influenced by the Doppler shift.

But when calculating their intrinsic luminosities, we need their intrinsic R and T.

So, to find L1 and L2, we need R and T for each star in their rest frame.

We have R1 = 1.5 R2.

We have T1 and T2. But they have different observed λ_max, which are the same.

So as before, λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), where beta is v/c, and v is the radial velocity.

Wait, but for Star_1, v1 = 0 → lambda_1_rest = lambda_obs.

For Star_2, v2 = 700 km/s (assuming it's moving away, so positive v), so lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ).

But lambda_1_rest = lambda_obs = same as lambda_2_obs.

So lambda_2_rest = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So, T1 = b / lambda_1_rest = b / lambda_obs.

T2 = b / lambda_2_rest = b / (lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )) )

= (b/lambda_obs) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

= T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which, as before, is approximately 1.00233.

So the ratio of L1 to L2 is (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

R1 = 1.5 R2 → (1.5)² = 2.25.

T1 / T2 = 1 / [sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ] = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which is approximately 0.99767.

So (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we analyze the given data and apply the relevant physical principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius of Star_1: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
   - Mass of Star_1: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \)
   - Radial velocities: \( v_{\text{Star}_1} = 0 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_{\text{Star}_2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Observed peak wavelengths: \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_0 \)

2. **Relevant Physics**:
   - **Wien's Law**: \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) is inversely proportional to temperature \( T \).
   - **Doppler Effect**: For small velocities (\( v \ll c \)), the observed wavelength is related to the intrinsic wavelength by:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest}} (1 + \frac{v}{c})
     \]
   - **Luminosity of a Black Body**: \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Analysis:
#### Step 1: Relating Observed and Intrinsic Wavelengths
For Star_1:
- Since \( v_1 = 0 \), the observed wavelength equals the intrinsic wavelength: \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_0 \).

For Star_2:
- The observed wavelength is redshifted due to its radial velocity (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)):
  \[
  \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}}{1 - \frac{v_2}{c}}}
  \]
  Using \( v_2/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.00233 \), the Doppler factor becomes:
  \[
  \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.00233}{1 - 0.00233}} \approx 1.00234
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} = \frac{\lambda_0}{1.00234} \approx 0.99766 \lambda_0
  \]

#### Step 2: Relating Temperatures
From Wien's Law, \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \). Therefore:
\[
T_1 = \frac{b}{\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}} = \frac{b}{\lambda_0}, \quad T_2 = \frac{b}{\lambda_{\text{rest,2}}} = \frac{b}{0.99766 \lambda_0}
\]
The temperature ratio is:
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{1}{0.99766} \approx 1.00234
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.00234} \approx 0.99767
\]

#### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity of a black body is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \). The ratio of the luminosities is:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]
Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 0.99767 \):
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 (0.99767)^4
\]
Calculating each term:
- \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \)
- \( (0.99767)^4 \approx 0.9907 \)

Thus:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.228
\]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \( 2.23 \) times greater than that of Star_2. The closest option is:

**Answer: D**
