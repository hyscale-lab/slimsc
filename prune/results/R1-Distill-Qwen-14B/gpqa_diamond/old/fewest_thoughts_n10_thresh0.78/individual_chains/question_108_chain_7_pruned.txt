Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm. I remember that paramagnetism is related to the magnetic properties of atoms when an external magnetic field is applied, usually involving electrons' spins.

The magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, which probably means it's pointing along the z-direction. The value of B is given as 1 Tesla, which is a pretty strong magnetic field, but I'm not entirely sure how that factors in.

The problem mentions small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, m is usually associated with the orientation of the orbital angular momentum, right? But since the question is about paramagnetic coupling, which involves the spin magnetic quantum number, perhaps s, not m. Or maybe it's about the spin-orbit coupling. Hmm, wait, no, paramagnetism is about the electron's spin in a magnetic field.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term usually refers to the interaction energy between the electron's magnetic moment and the external magnetic field. The formula for that is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, μ is proportional to its spin, so it's μ = γ S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.

So the paramagnetic term would be proportional to S·B. Now, I'm trying to find the expectation value of this Hamiltonian term, ⟨H⟩. So it's ⟨S·B⟩. Since B is along Oz, this simplifies to ⟨S_z⟩ multiplied by B, times some constants.

Wait, but the spin magnetic quantum number is s_z = (ħ/2) m_s, where m_s can be ±1/2. So the expectation value for S_z in an eigenstate would be (ħ/2) m_s. So putting that into ⟨H⟩, it would be proportional to m_s * B.

But wait, the problem says "small values of m". Wait, m here would be the orbital magnetic quantum number, which can range from -l to +l in integer steps. But in param
