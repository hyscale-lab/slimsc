Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The star has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. The second planet has a radius 2.5 times Earth's and we need to find the maximum orbital period so that it can exhibit both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Hmm, I remember that for a planet to transit in front of its star, it must pass directly between us and the star. The transit happens when the planet's orbit, as viewed from Earth, is edge-on. The impact parameter is the distance (in units of the star's radius) from the center of the star to the planet's path when transiting. If the impact parameter is zero, the planet transits directly across the center.

But wait, the problem says the first planet has an impact parameter of 0.2. So it doesn't transit exactly through the center. But since it's transiting, the impact parameter must be less than the sum of the star and planet's radii? Or wait, maybe the impact parameter is how close the planet's path comes to the star's center. Oh, right, the impact parameter is the distance from the star's center to the planet's path during transit. So a lower impact parameter means a closer approach.

Wait, but the transit condition is that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it can pass in front of the star from our viewpoint. So both planets must be in the same orbital plane, which I think they are, so they share the same inclination. So if the first planet transits, the second one might as well, but the question is about the orbital periods.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum orbital period for the second planet so that it can both transit and experience occultation. Oh, occultation is when the planet passes behind the star from our view. So both events require that the planet's orbit is such that it can pass in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star as seen from Earth.

Wait, but what determines whether a planet can transit or occultate? The alignment of the orbital planes, but since they share the same plane, that's already satisfied.

I think the key
