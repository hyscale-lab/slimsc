Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what's given. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's written as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. So, putting it together, A_y would be c multiplied by S.

Wait, the operator A_y is essentially a scaled version of S. So, since c is a scalar, the matrix A_y will just be c times each element of S. Let me write out what A_y looks like.

So, S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Multiplying by c = h/(4π), A_y becomes:
[ 0    -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))    0 ]

Hmm, that's the matrix form of A_y.

The problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y, and then determine which statement among the options is correct.

Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0. So, let's set that up.

The matrix (A_y - λI) would be:
[ -λ    -i c ]
[ i c    -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - (i c)(i c) = λ² - (i c)*(i c). Wait, (i c)*(i c) is (i^2)(c^2) = (-1)(c²). So the determinant is λ² + c². Setting this equal to zero gives λ² = -c² → λ = ±i c.

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are imaginary numbers, λ = i c and λ = -i c. So their real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are ±c.

Given that c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are ±i h/(4π). So looking back at the options, let's see.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because our eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So the real parts are zero, not ±h/(4π). So A is wrong.

Option B: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real ±1. Let's compute c. c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ±i h/(4π). Let me see if this matches. If h is Planck's constant, which is usually written as ħ = h/(2π). Wait, wait. Oh wait, h is the Planck constant, and ħ is h/(2π). So c is h/(4π) = ħ/(2). So c = ħ/2. Then, the eigenvalues are ±i ħ/2. So their imaginary parts are ± ħ/2, and the real parts are zero.

But looking at option B, the eigenvalues are imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't match. Unless the units are being considered differently, but perhaps in this problem, the eigenvalues are being expressed in terms of ħ? Let me think.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have eigenvalues in units of ħ. The Pauli matrices, which S resembles, have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Wait, yes, but S here is given as a matrix. Let me think about S.

Wait, S is a 2x2 matrix. So S must be σ_y, the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 when scaled by ħ/2. Wait, no. The Pauli matrices are usually written as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And the spin operators are (ħ/2) σ_i. So for example, S_y
