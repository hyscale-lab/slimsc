Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's try to figure this out.

Alright, the question says there are five exoplanets with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance and their periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1 has the shortest period, then Planet_2 is double that, Planet_3 is 2.5 times, Planet_4 is 3.5 times, and Planet_5 is 5 times Planet_1's period.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. And all planets have the same albedo. So, same reflectivity. The options are A to D with various ratios.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature (T) is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo)/ (1 + e) )^0.5. But wait, since all albedos are the same and the orbits are circular (e=0), the albedo and e terms are the same for all and can be ignored for the ratio.

So, the key factor is the distance 'a' from the star. The formula simplifies to T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). Because if you rearrange the equation, a is proportional to (T_star^2 * R_star)/(T^2). Wait, no, let's think again.

The equilibrium temperature formula when considering only the star's temperature and the planet's distance is T = T_star * (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4). Wait, no, maybe I should recall the more simplified version. Oh right, for a star with radius R_star and temperature T_star, the flux at distance a is F = (L)/(4πa²) = (σ T_star^4) * (4π R_star^2)/(4π a²) ) = σ T_star^4 (R_star^2 / a^2). So F = (σ T_star^4) (R_star^2 / a^2). Then the planet absorbs this, but the equilibrium temperature is when the absorbed energy equals the emitted. The planet's cross-section is π R_planet^2, and the emitted is 4π
