Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. It has a structure that's a bicyclic monoterpene, I think it's a bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane derivative. Wait, no, limonene is actually a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So, it's a cyclic structure with two rings. The (R) configuration means it's the enantiomer that's the (+) form.

The reaction conditions are a methanol solution with Pd/C under hydrogen. So, hydrogenation. When limonene is hydrogenated, the double bonds get hydrogenated. Limonene has a couple of double bonds, but wait, no, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with one double bond. So, hydrogenation would add hydrogen across that double bond. Since it's using Pd/C and H2, it's catalytic hydrogenation. So, the major product after one equivalent of H2 is consumed would be the hydrogenated limonene, which is called carvone? Wait, no, carvone is another terpene. Maybe it becomes cyclohexane derivative.

Wait, no, limonene's structure is more like menthol's parent. The structure is a bicyclo ring. So, when you hydrogenate limonene, you add hydrogen across the double bond, turning it into a single bond. So the product would be a cyclohexane derivative. Let me think, limonene is (R)-configuration, so hydrogenation would lead to a saturated compound. Also, the reaction is done in methanol, which is a solvent, but I don't think it's a catalyst in this case.

So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene, which is a cyclohexane derivative. After hydrogenation, the structure would have a cyclohexane ring with substituents. Wait, limonene is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So, when hydrogenated, it becomes bicy
