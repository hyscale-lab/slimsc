Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the expectation value of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑> + sqrt(3)/2 |↓>. Wait, I remember that |↑> and |↓> are eigenstates of σ_z, the Pauli z-matrix. Oh right, σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑> and |↓> respectively.

The operator we're looking at is 10σ_z +5σ_x. And we need to find the expectation value of this operator. Oh, expectation value. So the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, right? So I can split this into two parts: ⟨10σ_z⟩ and ⟨5σ_x⟩. That should make it easier.

First, let's compute ⟨σ_z⟩. Since the state is a superposition, I can write it as ψ = a|↑> + b|↓>, where a is 0.5 and b is sqrt(3)/2. The expectation value of σ_z is |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1). Let me calculate that.

|a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So ⟨σ_z⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So the expectation of 10σ_z is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now for ⟨σ_x⟩. Hmm, σ_x is the Pauli x matrix, which I remember has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but it's not diagonal. Oh wait, because σ_x is the spin in the x-direction, which is a bit more complicated than σ_z. The expectation value of σ_x is a bit trickier because it's off-diagonal.

Wait, the state ψ is given in the σ_z basis. So I need to compute ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩. Let's write out the state in vector form. |↑> is [1, 0]^T, and |↓> is [0,1]^T. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I compute ψ† σ_x ψ, it's like ψ^dagger multiplied by σ_x multiplied by ψ. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, I remember that for a spin-1/2 system, the expectation of σ_x is (2 Re(a*b*)) / (|a|^2 + |b|^2). Wait, no, maybe another approach. Let me think in terms of matrix multiplication.

So, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so when we multiply σ_x with ψ, it becomes [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then, the inner product of ψ and this result is (0.5)(sqrt
