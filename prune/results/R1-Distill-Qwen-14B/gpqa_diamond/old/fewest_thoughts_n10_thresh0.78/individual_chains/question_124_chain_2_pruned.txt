Okay, so I need to figure out the Lorentz factor required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, maybe I don't need to calculate gamma directly here. The question is about how the particles' speed affects how far they travel before decaying.

The problem says that when the Lorentz factor is about 20, one third reach the detector walls. Now, the detector's radius is 30 meters. So, for the original case, gamma =20, and 1/3 of the particles make it to the walls.

Hmm, I think this has to do with the particles' mean lifetime and how far they can travel before decaying. The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. From the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

The maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is then its speed multiplied by its lifetime. So distance L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, but particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, so v is approximately c. So maybe I can approximate v ≈ c.

So L ≈ c * gamma * tau.

In the original case, the radius R is 30 meters. So for gamma=20, the average particles (1/3) reach R. So perhaps, the mean decay length is such that for 1/3 of the particles, their decay happens beyond R. Or wait, maybe it's that the distance they can travel on average is R when gamma is 20 and only 1/3 reach it. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, perhaps the fraction of particles that reach the detector walls depends on how much their decay length exceeds the detector's radius. So if the decay length is L, and R is 30 meters, then the probability that a particle's decay occurs inside the detector is 1 - (something), and the fraction that reaches the wall is the probability that they decay outside. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle decays after traveling a distance x is P(x) = e^(-x/L), where L is the mean decay length. So the probability that a particle travels at least R meters is
