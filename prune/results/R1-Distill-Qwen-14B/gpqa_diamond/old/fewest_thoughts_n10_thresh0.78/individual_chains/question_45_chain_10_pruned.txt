Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. We need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E, where E is given as pi squared h-bar squared over (2mL squared). So E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A, B, C, D with various combinations.

Hmm. So the particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions, right? So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That's crucial because it determines how the particles fill up the energy levels.

In a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of a single particle in the nth state is E_n = (n²) * E, since E is given as that base unit. Wait, because E is already (π²ħ²)/(2mL²), so each particle's energy is E multiplied by the square of their quantum number.

But wait, when you have multiple particles, especially identical fermions, they can't all occupy the same quantum state. So each state can hold a certain number of particles based on the spin.

In a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n, since there's no angular momentum (it's 1D, so l=0), but for spin-1/2, each state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So each energy level can have two fermions.

Wait, but for each n, the state is defined by n and the spin. So each n can have two particles: one with spin up, one with spin down.

So with four particles, we have to fill the lowest energy levels, each accommodating up to two particles, until all four are placed.

Let me think about the filling order. Ground state is the lowest possible energy, so we fill the lowest n first.

So the possible energy levels are E_1, E_2, E_3, etc.

Each E_n can hold two particles.

So for four particles:

First, fill n=1: two particles (since each n holds two with opposite spins).

Then n=2: another two particles. But wait, four particles: two
