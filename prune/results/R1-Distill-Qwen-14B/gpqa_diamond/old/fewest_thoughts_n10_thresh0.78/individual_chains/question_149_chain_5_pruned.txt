Okay, so I've got this question about a synthesized peptidic compound and some NMR and LC-MS data. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, the question says that the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly like what's expected, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts, equal integrals (so together 1H), and the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So, why would there be two peaks for the same proton?

Wait, spin-spin coupling usually leads to splitting, like a doublet or something. But the question says it's ruled out as the cause. So maybe it's not about coupling between protons but something else. Like maybe some kind of splitting from another source.

Then the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity at elevated temperature. Both have the same mass, which matches the expected molecule. So the mass is correct but there are two separate peaks. That suggests maybe two different forms of the same compound are present, but they're eluting at different times. But wait, same mass and same areaâ€”so maybe they're isomers or something else.

Looking at the options:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. Well, the LC-MS would show a higher mass for the precursor, right? Because the precursor would have a different molecular weight. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as the expected molecule. So this might not be the case. Unless the precursor is somehow losing something... Hmm, but I think that's less likely.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, and in a chiral environment, they'd show up as two peaks on a chiral column. But wait, the question says the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha proton. Enantiomers would have identical NMR spectra because the environment is the same. So the NMR wouldn't show extra peaks for the same proton. So B might not explain the NMR observation.

C) 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm a bit fuzzy on what double coupling means here. Wait, in amide bond formation, like in peptide synthesis, sometimes you can get different byproducts, but how would that lead to two peaks in NMR? Maybe if there are two different amide linkages or something. Alternatively, double coupling could refer to something like a side reaction where two bonds form in a way that creates a new stereocenter
