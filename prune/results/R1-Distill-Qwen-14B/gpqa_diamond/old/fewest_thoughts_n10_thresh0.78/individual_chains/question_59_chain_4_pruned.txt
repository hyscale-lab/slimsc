Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let's see what the question says exactly. 

The problem states that I have 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I need to determine the pH of the resulting solution after they're all mixed together.

Wait, mixing acids and bases. Oh, right, when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I should probably figure out the moles of H+ and OH- ions in each solution and see what's left after they react.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll calculate the moles of each component in each solution.

Starting with the acetic acid. It's a weak acid. Its formula is CH3COOH, which dissociates into H+ and CH3COO^- ions, but not completely. However, since I'm mixing it with strong acids and strong bases, perhaps the initial neutralization reactions will involve the H+ from the strong acids reacting with the OH- from the strong base.

Wait, but I should consider all the components. Let me list each solution's contribution to H+ and OH-.

1. Acetic Acid (CH3COOH): Each molecule can donate one H+. So moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters).

Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't completely dissociate, and I might need to consider that later after neutralization.

2. HCl: This is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl^- ions. Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L. Moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Each HCl gives one H+, so 0.08 moles H+.

3. Ba(OH)2: This is a strong base. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2 â†’ Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-. Molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So, OH- moles = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So the total solution volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

Now, the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH, and OH- comes from Ba(OH)2. But wait, the
