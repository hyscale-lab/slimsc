Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, there's a planet with Earth radius in a circular orbit around a star. The star has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. The planet's transit impact parameter is 0.2, and its orbital period is 3 days. Now, they want to know the maximum orbital period of a second planet that has 2.5 Earth radius. Both planets are in the same system, and the second planet's orbit is also circular and shares the same orbital plane. The second planet should exhibit both transit and occultation events.

Hmm, okay. I remember that transit events happen when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, and occultation (or eclipse) is when the planet passes behind the star, so the star blocks our view of the planet. For both events to happen, the orbital period of the second planet must be such that it's in the same orbital plane and that the alignment allows for both events.

Wait, but how does the orbital period of the first planet relate to the second? Oh, right, the question is about the maximum orbital period for the second planet. So, the second planet must have an orbital period that's longer than the first's, but not so long that the alignment doesn't happen.

Wait, no. Wait, the first planet is the one with period 3 days. The second has 2.5 Earth radius. So, the second planet's orbital period is what we're finding. But how does that affect whether it transits and occultates?

Wait, I think the key here is the concept of orbital periods and the alignment needed for transits and occultations. The transit occurs when the planet moves in front of the star, and occultation when it moves behind. For both to happen, the orbit must be such that the planet is moving in a way that both events are possible, which depends on the orbital period and the star's size.

Wait, perhaps it's about the Hill sphere or something else? Or maybe the synodic period. Hmm, maybe I should think about the transit condition. For a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be aligned such that the planet's path can cross our line of sight to the star. The impact parameter is the distance (in units of star's radius) from the center of the star that the planet's path is. If
