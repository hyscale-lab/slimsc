Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum states. The question gives a specific coupled angular momentum state as |1,1,2,-1>, and asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. 

Wait, I remember that each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number, which for a p orbital is l=1. So each particle has l1=1 and l2=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is given as 2, and m is -1. 

The state is |l1, l2, l, m> which is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total orbital angular momentum L is the sum of L1 and L2. The state is a coupled state, which means it's an eigenstate of L² and Lz. 

The problem is asking about the probability of measuring both electrons' Lz components as -ħ. That is, when we measure L1z and L2z, each should give -ħ. So the possible outcomes for each L1z and L2z are m1 * ħ and m2 * ħ, respectively. Because for a given l, m can range from -l to +l in integer steps. So for each electron in p orbital, m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

But wait, the state we're in is |l=2, m=-1>. So the total Lz is -1 * ħ. Since Lz = L1z + L2z, the sum must be -ħ. So in this state, the total m is -1. 

So the question is, what's the probability that when we measure L1z and L2z, both are -ħ. That would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. So their sum is -2, but our total m is -1. Hmm, that's a problem because -2 doesn't equal -1. So if both are -1, then the total would be -2, which doesn't match the m of the state.

Wait, that can't happen. Because the state is |m= -1>, so the sum of m1 and m2 must be -1. So if each m
