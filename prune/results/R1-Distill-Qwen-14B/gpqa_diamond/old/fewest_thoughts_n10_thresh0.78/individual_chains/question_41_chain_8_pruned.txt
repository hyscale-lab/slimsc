Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. The setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. They're asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, so I remember from my studies that when light travels through a medium, its speed depends on the medium's refractive index. The general formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, this is in the case where the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving, so I need to consider the motion of the medium as well.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on how relative velocities add up when it comes to light. Because, you know, according to special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. But this problem is about a glass medium moving and light inside it. So perhaps I should think about it in terms of relative velocities.

Let me break it down. Inside the glass, light's speed is c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So how does the glass's motion affect the observed speed of the light beam?

Wait, no. Because the light is already inside the glass. The glass's velocity is in the same direction as the light beam. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving towards them, which I suppose is the same direction as the light is moving. Or does it mean the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is coming towards the observer as well?

Wait, the problem states that the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving toward the observer. So both the beam and the glass are moving in the same direction, towards the observer lab frame.

Wait, no. Wait, if the beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving, then the beam's speed in the lab frame is what's being asked. Or is it the speed of the
