Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack everything. 

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, right? The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. 

The main point is that because the spots are on one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the brightness we observe changes periodically. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of the star causes a dip in brightness, which we can detect. But the question is asking, if the star wasn't spotted, what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness variation amplitude?

So, I need to compare the brightness change caused by the spots to the change caused by an exoplanet. The amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the area of the spot (or planet) relative to the star's area, and also the temperature difference because the spots are cooler.

Wait, right. The star's brightness is from its entire surface. When a spot is on the hemisphere facing us, it reduces the observed brightness because that part is cooler. Similarly, when a planet transits, it blocks some light, causing a dip. But the spot's effect is more about emitting less light, not blocking it. So the change in brightness from the spots is due to the difference in their temperature compared to the rest of the star.

Hmm, I remember that the flux from a star is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its temperature. So for each spot, the flux is lower. The total flux from the star without any spots would be higher than when the spots are visible.

The problem says the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so their temperature is 5000K. So each spot emits less flux. 

The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. Wait, filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the surface covered by spots. But here, it's only one hemisphere, so the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. Since the star is a sphere, the total surface area is 4πR². The hemisphere is 2πR², so 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the spots cover 0.4πR².

But wait, the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty. So
