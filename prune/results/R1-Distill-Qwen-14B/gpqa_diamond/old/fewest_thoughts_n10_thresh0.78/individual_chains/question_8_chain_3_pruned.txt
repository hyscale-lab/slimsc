Okay, so I've got a genetics problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about three genes—G1, G2, and G3—in white lupine plants. These genes are involved in resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've created knockout mutants for each gene and some double mutants. The resistance levels of these mutants are given, and I need to figure out their interactions.

Let me start by understanding what the data shows. The resistance levels are percentages of the control (wild-type) plants. So, 100% is the normal resistance, and lower percentages mean the plant is more susceptible.

Looking at the data:
- g1 (G1 knockout): 75% resistance. So, it's less resistant than wild-type but not as bad as some others.
- g2 (G2 knockout): 0% resistance. That's really bad—completely susceptible.
- g3 (G3 knockout): 50% resistance. So, it's worse than wild-type but not as bad as g2.
- The double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% resistance. Very susceptible.
  - g2g3: 0% resistance (same as g2 alone? Hmm.)
  - g1g2: 0% resistance.

The question tells us that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, maybe one gene is regulating others.

I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, gene A is epistatic to gene B if the phenotype of gene B depends on the presence of gene A. Also, pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, let me think about what each scenario implies. If knocking out a gene makes the plant more susceptible, that gene normally contributes to resistance. So, G2 is critical because its knockout (g2) leads to 0% resistance. G3 knockout is worse than G1 knockout, but not as bad as G2.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance. So, when G2 is knocked out, the double mutants with either G1 or G3 out also have 0% resistance. That suggests that G2 might be in a pathway upstream of both G1 and G3. Because if G2 isn't working, adding the knockout of G1 or G3 doesn't make it any worse—so both G1 and G3 are downstream of G2.

Wait, but in the double mutants, when G2 is present, like in g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways downstream of G2.

Let me think about the concept of epistasis. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of B depends on A. So, if you have a knockout in A and B, the phenotype is the same as just A being knocked out. Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of biochemical pathways.

Suppose a pathway where G2 produces an enzyme that activates G1 and G3. So, without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function. Let's see:

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, then without G2 (g2), both G1 and
