Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which exoplanet among options a to d has the highest density. The options are labeled A to D, each corresponding to one of the exoplanet descriptions.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So for each planet, I need to figure out its density and compare them.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known, right? Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet has the same mass and radius, so its density should be the same as Earth. So its density is 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, I'm confused. The question says the planet has a density of 5.5, so why is it an option? Oh, because the question is about which has the highest. So this planet's density is exactly 5.5. So same as Earth.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Wait, same composition as Earth means same average density, right? Because density is based on composition. If it's more massive but same composition, then what happens? Let's think. Mass is density multiplied by volume. So if it's five times more massive, but same density, the volume must be five times larger. But wait, the radius would be scaled by the cube root of the volume. So if volume is 5 times, radius is (5)^(1/3) times Earth's radius, roughly 1.7 times. But the key here is that the density is the same as Earth since composition is same. So density is 5.5 g/cm³.

Option d: A planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition, so same density as Earth. So 5.5 g/cm³ again.

Wait, but all options except a, b, c, d have the same density? That can't be. Wait, wait, let me read again.

Wait, no. Let me parse each option again.

Option a: Earth mass and radius. So density is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, but the density is given as 5.
