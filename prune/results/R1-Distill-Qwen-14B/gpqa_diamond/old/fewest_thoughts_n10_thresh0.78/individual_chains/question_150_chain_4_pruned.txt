Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and we need to figure out the structure, then determine the product after reacting with certain reagents.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula. C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a ring and double bonds or other structures.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm triplet (1H), that's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, like an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.

Next, 6.98 ppm doublet (2H), 6.51 ppm doublet (2H). Those could be aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Because the doublets are equal in area, perhaps two aromatic rings where the substituents are in the para position. Wait, but each aromatic region has 2H, so maybe each ring is para-substituted. So maybe it's diphenyl something.

The 6.27 ppm broad singlet (2H) might be something like an enol proton, or possibly some kind of diene or conjugated dienol. Or maybe it's an -OH group. But wait, OH protons are usually broad and could be downfield depending on the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like an allylic position.

The 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe an ether or a carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a methylene next to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester, but given the reagents, perhaps it's part of an aldehyde or ketone structure.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has an aldehyde group, two aromatic rings (each para-substituted), maybe a conjugated double bond. Let's try to sketch a possible structure.

Wait, the aldehyde is at a position such that the two protons next to it are coupled. So maybe the aldehyde is at the end of a conjugated chain. For example, something like CH2=CH-CHO, but with substituents or rings attached.

Looking at the NMR again, the triplet at 9.72 (1H) implies that the aldehyde proton is next to two protons which are equivalent. So the structure adjacent to the aldehyde must have two protons that are equivalent. Maybe a CH2 group next to the aldehyde.

Wait, that 3.66 ppm doublet is 2H, maybe a CH2 group. So if the aldehyde is at the end, like R-CH2-CHO, but then the coupling would be different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propenal system. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is an
