Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. So the question is about a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field, and how its magnetic moment oscillates when the field direction changes. Hmm.

Alright, let me start by recalling what I know. A spin-1/2 particle, like an electron, has spin angular momentum which can be up or down. The magnetic moment mu is related to the spin S by the gyromagnetic ratio gamma, so mu = gamma * S. Oh wait, but the problem says mu equals gamma multiplied by Sz, which is the z-component of the spin. So mu_z = gamma S_z.

The magnetic field is initially pointing along the +Z direction, and the particle is aligned with it. So I guess that means the particle is in the eigenstate of S_z when the field is on. But then the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. So the magnetic field direction is suddenly changed from +Z to +Y.

Wait, when the magnetic field is along a different direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu · B. Wait, because the energy is U = -μ·B. Oh right, so the Hamiltonian becomes H = -mu · B.

But since mu is gamma S, then H would be proportional to -gamma S · B. So let me write that more precisely. H = -gamma B S · n, where n is the direction of the magnetic field. Initially, n was along +Z, so H_initial = -gamma B S_z. But then it's turned off and another field along +Y is applied. So H_final = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the particle's moment after the field change. So the average of S_z as a function of time.

Hmm, okay. So after the field is changed, the system's Hamiltonian changes. The initial state was an eigenstate of S_z. Let's think about that. When the field was along Z, the particle was in an eigenstate of S_z, say |up> or |down>, which are eigenstates of
