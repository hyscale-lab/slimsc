Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is about an enamine reaction. Hmm, I remember enamine reactions involve the formation of a conjugated imine, and they're used in organic synthesis, especially for adding groups with good stereochemistry.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Wait, I'm a bit confused about that structure. Let me draw it out. So, ethanaminium means it's a secondary amine with a positive charge, right? The substituents on the nitrogen are methyl and pentan-2-ylidene. Oh, wait, pentan-2-ylidene is aCH2CH2CH2CH2 group attached to a double bond. So the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2CH2- attached to the N, along with a methyl group. And because it's (E), the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite.

So the starting material is an iminium ion. Now, the reaction is adding a reagent A to produce product B. The options give different reagents and products, so I need to figure out which sequence is correct.

Enamine reactions usually go through a few steps. I think the first step is the formation of the enamine, but wait, in this case, the starting material is already an enamine or an iminium. So perhaps the reaction involves deprotonation followed by some alkylation or something else.

Looking at the options, the reagents in the steps vary. Let's see the options:

Option A: Steps are LDA, DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+. Product is pentan-2-one plus N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Option B: Steps are LDA, then DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Same product as A.

Option C: Steps are LDA, DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Option D: Steps are LDA, then DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, but looking at the starting material, it's an iminium. So perhaps the first step is deprotonation to form an enamine.

Wait, LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong base. So maybe in the first step, LDA is used to deprotonate the iminium to form the enamine. Or maybe it's used for some other deprotonation.

Wait, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Let me think about the structure again. The iminium would have a positive charge, so maybe it's a protonated imine.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an iminium ion, which can be deprotonated by a base like LDA to form an enamine.

So step 1: LDA would deprotonate the iminium to form the enamine. Then, in step 2, maybe an alkylation occurs. Oh, because after deprotonation, you have a strong base, and perhaps you can add an alkylating agent like CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide).

Wait, so LDA is a strong base, so adding it would deprotonate the iminium to form the enamine. Then, in the presence of DME (which is a polar aprotic solvent, maybe as a co-solvent?), you add CH3CH2I. The enamine is a strong nucleophile, so it would attack the ethyl iodide, leading to alkylation.

After that, perhaps you quench the reaction with H3O+ (acid workup), which would hydrolyze the enamine back into a carbonyl compound and release the amine.

So let's think about the structure. The starting enamine is formed from the iminium. Let's imagine the structure.

Original substituents on the amine: methyl and pentan-2-ylidene. So when LDA deprotonates, the enamine is formed. Then, the enamine would attack ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group.

Wait, how does the alkylation work here? Enamine attacks the ethyl iodide, so the ethyl group would attach to the nitrogen? Or perhaps to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen.

Wait, let me think. The enamine has a structure like R2C=CR'-N+R2. Deprotonation would form R2C=CR'–N–R2 (but I'm not sure about the exact structure). When the enamine attacks an alkyl halide, the ethyl group would add to the adjacent carbon, perhaps via a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, the enamine acts as a nucleophile at the alpha position, so the ethyl group would add to the carbon next to the nitrogen.

Wait, perhaps it's a conjugate addition. So the enamine would attack the ethyl iodide, leading to an ethylation of the beta position.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's consider the overall reaction steps. After deprotonation with LDA, the enamine forms. Then, ethyl iodide would alkylate the enamine. After that, acid is added to hydrolyze the enamine.

The product would be a ketone. Because when the enamine is hydrolyzed, the conjugated amine part reverts to a carbonyl group. So, for example, the starting material has a pentan-2-ylidene group, which would become a pentan-2-one upon hydrolysis. But if there's an ethyl group added, the ketone's position might shift.

Wait, let's think about the starting enamine. Its structure is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2–N+(CH3)–CH2+? Hmm, maybe not exactly. The ethanaminium is CH3NH2+ with a CH2 group attached.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2–N+(CH2CH2CH3)CH3? No, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an iminium that, upon deprotonation, forms an enamine. Then, when ethyl iodide is added, the enamine would attack, adding an ethyl group to the adjacent carbon.

So if the starting enamine has a four-carbon chain (pentan-2-ylidene is five carbons?), maybe adding ethyl would make it longer.

Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no: pentan-2-ylidene is a substituent where the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2CH2CH2CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2– group. So the starting enamine is N-methyl-N-(CH2=CHCH2CH2) ethanaminium.

Then, when deprotonated with LDA, you form the enamine. Then, treating with ethyl iodide would add an ethyl group to the adjacent carbon (the alpha position). So the enamine's conjugated system would have the addition.

Upon hydrolysis, the enamine would form a ketone. So the product would be a ketone, perhaps at a different position.

Wait, so the starting material's enamine is CH2=CHCH2CH2–N–(CH3)–CH2+? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me try drawing it.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the ethanaminium part is CH3NH2+CH2? Or maybe it's N-methyl attached to an ethyl group with a positive charge.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The main chain is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- (pentan-2-ylidene) which is CH2=CHCH2CH2– attached to the ethanaminium, which is CH2–N+(CH3)(something). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this.

Let me think about the reaction steps.

Step 1: LDA is a strong base. It would deprotonate the iminium ion to form the enamine.

Step 2: Add ethyl iodide. The enamine is a strong nucleophile and would perform a conjugate addition (like Michael addition) to the ethyl iodide. So the ethyl group would add to the alpha carbon of the enamine.

Then, in the third step, H3O+ (acid) is added. This would protonate the enamine, leading to hydrolysis to form a ketone and release the amine.

So, the product B would be a ketone. Let's see what the options say.

Looking at the options again:

Option C and D have product as heptan-4-one. So that's a seven-carbon ketone at position 4.

Option A and B have pentan-2-one plus amine.

Wait, the starting material's enamine is based on a pentan-2-ylidene. So after adding ethyl group, perhaps the chain becomes longer.

Wait, the starting enamine has a five-carbon chain (pentan-2-ylidene). Adding ethyl (two carbons) would make seven carbons. So the ketone would be heptan-4-one.

Wait, let me think. If the enamine has a structure like R2C=CR'–N–R, adding an ethyl group to the alpha carbon would increase the chain length. So when hydrolyzed, the ketone would be at a certain position.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting enamine is from a four-carbon chain? I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is simply forming a new ketone by alkylation.

Wait, another approach: when an enamine reacts with an alkyl halide, the alkyl group adds to the alpha position of the enamine. Then, upon hydrolysis, the ketone is formed at that position.

So if the starting enamine's conjugated system is (CH2)3CH–, adding an ethyl group would make it (CH2)3CH–CH2–, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a ketone with an additional two carbons from the ethyl group. So starting from pentan-2-one (five carbons, ketone at position 2), adding ethyl would make it heptan-4-one. Let me see: pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. Adding two carbons further along would lead to heptan-4-one, which is (CH2)3COCH2CH2CH3? Or maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is heptan-4-one. So option C and D have product as heptan-4-one.

Now, looking at the reagent sequences.

Option C: Steps are LDA, DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. So four steps? Or is it steps (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+?

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product is pentan-2-one plus amine.

Option C: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

So in option C, the reagents are in three steps, same as A and others.

Wait, the starting material's enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Let me think about the structure again. The pentan-2-ylidene group is CH2=CHCH2CH2–. So the starting enamine has a four-carbon chain (since pentan-2-ylidene is five carbons?), but perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a ketone. For example, a secondary amine (like dimethylamine) reacts with a ketone to form an enamine. But in this case, the starting material is already an enamine or iminium.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an iminium ion, which is the protonated form of an enamine. So when LDA is added, it deprotonates to form the enamine.

So step 1: LDA deprotonates the iminium to form the enamine.

Step 2: The enamine attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position.

Step 3: Acid is added to hydrolyze the enamine, releasing the ketone and the amine.

So what's the structure of the ketone?

The starting enamine's structure is a pentan-2-ylidene group attached to the nitrogen. So when the ethyl group is added, perhaps the chain becomes longer.

Wait, the enamine's structure would be something like:

R2C=CR'–N–R''. So in this case, R is methyl, R' is CH2CH2CH2, and R'' is another methyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the product after alkylation and hydrolysis is a ketone with two more carbons than the starting material.

The starting enamine is derived from a five-carbon chain (pentan-2-ylidene), so adding two more carbons (from ethyl) would make it seven carbons in the ketone. So heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3. Wait, no, heptan-4-one is CH3CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3.

But wait, where would the ketone be? If the starting enamine was from a four-carbon chain (butyl), adding ethyl would make six carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the chain lengths wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the starting enamine is from a three-carbon chain. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

Option C and D have product heptan-4-one, which is a ketone in the middle of a seven-carbon chain. So positions 1-7: CH3CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is at position 4.

If the starting enamine is from a three-carbon chain, adding ethyl would make five carbons. But perhaps not.

Wait, the starting material's enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the pentan-2-ylidene is CH2=CHCH2CH2–, which is four carbons? No, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2=CHCH2CH2–, which is five carbons with the double bond at position 2.

Wait, no, wait. Pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2–, but that's only four carbons in the substituent. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terminology.

Pentan-2-ylidene would be (CH2)3CH–, but with a double bond. No, wait, the substituent is pentan-2-ylidene, which is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. So it's CH2=CHCH2CH2– as a substituent. So that's four carbons in the substituent, making the main chain perhaps ethanaminium part.

But I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should focus on the reaction steps.

So according to the reaction steps, the correct order is LDA, followed by DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have LDA first, then DME and other reagents in the same step.

Option A's steps: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Option C: same steps, product is heptan-4-one.

So if the product is heptan-4-one, that would mean the starting material's chain was longer. Alternatively, perhaps the initial enamine is from a four-carbon chain, and adding ethyl makes it six.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the number of carbons. The starting enamine is derived from a five-carbon chain (pentan-2-ylidene). When ethyl is added, it's two more carbons, making seven in total. So the ketone would be at position 4, making heptan-4-one.

So the product is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are LDA, DME, then ethyl iodide, then acid.

Looking at the options, option C says product is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Wait, but option D's reagents are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. So D's steps are LDA first, then in the same step, DME, ethyl iodide, and H3O+.

Hmm, which is correct?

In enamine synthesis, the typical steps are: form the enamine (deprotonation), alkylate, then hydrolyze. So the steps would be:

1. Deprotonate with LDA (a strong base) to form the enamine.

2. Add the alkylating agent (ethyl iodide) in a solvent like DME.

3. Acid workup to hydrolyze the enamine to the ketone.

So the reagents would be in the order of LDA, then ethyl iodide with DME, then H3O+.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C's reagents are (i) LDA + DME, (ii) ethyl iodide, (iii) H3O+.

So LDA is used in step (i) with DME. Then step (ii) is ethyl iodide. Step (iii) is H3O+.

Another possibility is that after deprotonation with LDA, the enamine is formed, and then in the same step (presence of DME), ethyl iodide is added. Then acid is added in the next step.

So the reagents are step (i): LDA, DME; step (ii): ethyl iodide; step (iii): H3O+.

Which matches option C and option A.

Wait, but option A's product is pentan-2-one plus amine, while option C's product is heptan-4-one.

If the starting enamine is from a five-carbon chain, adding ethyl would make seven carbons, leading to heptan-4-one.

So the correct option would be C, where product is heptan-4-one and the reagents are as per steps.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D's product is heptan-4-one, but the steps are (i) LDA, then (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. So all in the same step.

That doesn't seem right. Typically, each reagent is added in sequence after the previous step.

So the correct reagent sequence is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Which is option C's step sequence.

So the correct answer would be option C.


The reaction involves an enamine derived from (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The steps are as follows:

1. **Deprotonation with LDA**: Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is a strong base that deprotonates the iminium ion to form the enamine.
2. **Alkylation with CH₃CH₂I**: The enamine, being a strong nucleophile, undergoes alkylation with ethyl iodide (CH₃CH₂I). The ethyl group is added to the alpha carbon of the enamine.
3. **Hydrolysis with H₃O⁺**: Acidic workup hydrolyzes the enamine, regenerating the ketone and releasing the amine.

The starting material is derived from a pentan-2-ylidene group, which has five carbons. After alkylation with ethyl iodide, the chain length increases by two carbons, resulting in a seven-carbon ketone. The ketone is formed at position 4 of the seven-carbon chain, yielding heptan-4-one as the product.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** and **Option B** suggest the product is pentan-2-one, which is incorrect because the chain length increases due to alkylation.
- **Option D** lists the correct product (heptan-4-one) but combines all reagents in a single step, which is inconsistent with the typical sequential addition of reagents.
- **Option C** correctly identifies the product as heptan-4-one and provides the correct sequence of reagents: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH₃CH₂I; (iii) H₃O⁺.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
