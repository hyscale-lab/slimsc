Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid and has bridgehead positions. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two bridgehead carbons that are across from each other.

The first step is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. I'm thinking about elimination reactions here. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's causing an E2 elimination. When a vicinal dihalide reacts with a strong base, it typically forms an alkene. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules and form an allene or maybe a more substituted alkene. Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromo positions on adamantane—so when each Br is on adjacent carbons? No, wait, 1 and 3 are on adjacent bridgeheads, so elimination would form a double bond between those carbons. But adamantane's structure is such that each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads. So eliminating two Brs would form a bridgehead double bond, but wait, bridgehead double bonds are usually not allowed due to Bredt's rule. Hmm, Bredt's rule says that bridgehead alkenes are not stable because the structure isn't favorable. So maybe the product is something else.

Wait, another possibility is that each Br is on a different bridgehead, and elimination would form a bicyclic structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a cyclohexene ring or something similar.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. The NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Also, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. So perhaps there's a ketone formed.

Wait, when you have a dihalide treated with a strong base like KOH, sometimes you can get a dehydrohalogenation, but if the dihalide is on adjacent carbons, you'd form an alkene. But given the IR shows a carbonyl, maybe it's an oxidation product.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH and the base abstracts a proton, leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming a ketone. Because the starting material is a dihalide, perhaps it's undergoing a double dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Hmm, but how?

Wait, adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is a CH2 group. So, if the bridgehead carbons are each substituted with a Br, then perhaps when KOH is added, each bridgehead could lose HBr, forming a ketone. Because if you have a dihalide where each adjacent carbon has a Br, and after eliminating two HBr molecules, you'd form a carbonyl group.

Wait, let's think: if each bridgehead has a Br, and they're adjacent, perhaps they lose Br and form a double bond, but that would be a bridgehead double bond which is disallowed. Oh, but wait, maybe it's not a simple elimination. Maybe it's a ring-opening or some other process.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and upon treatment with KOH, each Br leaves, but that would require a good leaving group and a base. But then, after elimination, maybe it forms a ketone. Hmm, but how?

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a substitution reaction. But KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile, but in the presence of a dihalide, maybe it's doing an elimination to form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group, so when KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, each HBr is eliminated, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. So, if each Br is on a CH2, and they're adjacent, eliminating two HBr would form a ketone. So, for example, if you have Br-CH2-CH2-Br, eliminating two HBr would give O=C=O, which isn't right. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, and elimination leads to the formation of a bridgehead carbonyl. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, considering the NMR data after KOH treatment. The NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2
