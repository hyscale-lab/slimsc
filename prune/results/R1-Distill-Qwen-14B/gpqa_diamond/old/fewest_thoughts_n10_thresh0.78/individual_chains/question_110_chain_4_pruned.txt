Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's think through it.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star as observed from Earth, the apparent magnitude, determines whether a telescope can detect it. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs, so I need to find out which stars are bright enough for both.

The question gives me some key info: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait, wait. It says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, magnitude scale is counterintuitive. Lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17, it's magnitude 16 or lower. Because higher numbers mean fainter. So, for ESPRESSO, stars with V <=17 mag are observable.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. Which means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16. So for HIRES, V <=16. So, a star must have V <=16 to be seen by HIRES, and V <=17 to be seen by ESPRESSO. So the more restrictive condition is the HIRES one. The star must be bright enough for HIRES, which is V <=16.

But wait, looking back: the problem says stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO. Wait, actually, the question states that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because if a star's magnitude is brighter than 17, that would be magnitudes less than 17. Because if a star is 16 mag, it's brighter than 17. So, ESPRESSO can see stars up to magnitude 17. HIRES can see stars up to 16. So the star's apparent magnitude must be <=16 to be seen by both. Because if it's 17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't.
