Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. So, the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, on a system. The problem states that after measuring P, someone measures Q, and we need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. 

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for both operators P and Q to figure out the probabilities.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but usually, quantum states are represented as column vectors with complex numbers and normalized. But here, the elements are (-1, 2, 1). Let me check the normalization. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1. So, (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so it's not normalized. So the actual state vector is this vector divided by sqrt(6). So the state vector |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1). 

Next, I need to look at the operators P and Q. The matrix for P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), second row (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and third row (0,1/√2, 0). Hmm, I think I should write that matrix out. Let's see:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Wait, is this a Hermitian matrix? Let me check. The elements should be the complex conjugate transpose. Since all elements are real, it's symmetric, so yes, P is Hermitian. So P is a valid observable.

Then, operator Q has matrix elements:

Q = [ [1, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, -1] ]

That's diagonal, so its eigenvalues are 1, 0, and -1. So measuring Q can yield 1, 0, or -1. But the problem asks for the probability of getting -1 when measuring Q after P, but wait, the first measurement is P, then Q. So the order is important.

But wait, the way the problem is phrased: someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So probably, the measurement of P affects the state, and then Q is measured on the resulting state.

Wait, no. Because once you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of
