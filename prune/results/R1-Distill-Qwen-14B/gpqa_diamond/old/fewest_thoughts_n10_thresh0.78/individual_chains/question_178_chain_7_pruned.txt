Okay, so I have this question about the Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ-bar σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu], right? So that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. So this looks like some kind of interaction term between fermions (like electrons) and the electromagnetic field.

Wait, but wait, the standard Dirac Lagrangian for a fermion is L = i ψ-bar γ^μ ∂_μ ψ - m ψ-bar ψ, and the Maxwell term is F^2. So this interaction term must be something else, maybe a higher-order term or part of a different theory.

I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the dimensions of each part of the term and see what dimension κ must have so that the whole term is dimensionless (since the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units where ħ = c =1).

Let me recall that in 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension works as follows: the action S is dimensionless, and the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because dx^4 is dimensionless, and L has to have dimension 4 since ∫ L dx^4 is dimensionless.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4. So let's break down the term L_int.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ-bar σ_{μν} ψ multiplied by F^{mu nu}.

Wait, but wait, σ_{mu nu} is a product of gamma matrices, but it's antisymmetric, and the gamma matrices have a certain dimension. Let me think about the dimensions of each field and object.

F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor. F_{mu nu} = ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So A_mu has mass dimension 1 because each derivative ∂_mu has dimension 1, and F^{mu nu} would have dimension 2. Because, for example, the Maxwell term is F^2, which is (F^2) so (2)*(2) =4? Wait, no, wait. The Maxwell Lagrangian is -1/4 F^{mu nu} F_{mu nu}, so each F is dimension 2, so F^2 is dimension 4, which matches the Lagrangian's dimension.

So F^{mu nu} has mass dimension 2.

Now, ψ is a spinor field. The Dirac Lagrangian has
