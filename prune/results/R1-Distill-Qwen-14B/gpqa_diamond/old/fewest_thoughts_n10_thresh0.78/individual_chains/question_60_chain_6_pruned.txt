Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about an astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth at a speed very close to the speed of light, specifically 0.99999987c. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to figure out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options suggest the answer is either that the astronaut dies before reaching Earth, or one of the given years.

Wait, I remember that when you travel at speeds close to light speed, time dilation occurs. Time dilation is a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity where time passes slower for the moving observer compared to a stationary one. So from the astronaut's point of view, the trip should take less time than it would from Earth's perspective.

But wait, the question is specifically asking for the astronaut's experienced time, which is their proper time. Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of reference—in this case, the astronaut's ship.

So, I need to calculate the proper time for the journey. To do that, I should first find out how far the Large Magellanic Cloud is from Earth. I think the distance isn't given, but I remember that the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away. Let me check that... Yes, I'm pretty sure the average distance is roughly 160,000 to 180,000 light-years. I'll go with about 163,000 light-years as the distance (d).

Now, the speed of the spacecraft is v = 0.99999987c. I can calculate the time from Earth's frame of reference, which would be the distance divided by speed. So t_earth = d / v.

Let me compute that. d is 163,000 light-years, and v is almost c. So t_earth ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987). Since 0.99999987 is very close to 1, the denominator is almost 1, so t_earth is roughly 163,000 / 1 = 163,000 years? Wait, that can't be right because the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, which is just a hair under the speed of light. Oh wait, no—if you are going at a speed that's very close to c, the time from Earth's frame would still be about distance divided by speed. Since v is very close to c, the time would be about 163,000 light-years divided by a speed just under c. So, 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ around 163,000 + (163,000 * 0.00000013). 163,00
