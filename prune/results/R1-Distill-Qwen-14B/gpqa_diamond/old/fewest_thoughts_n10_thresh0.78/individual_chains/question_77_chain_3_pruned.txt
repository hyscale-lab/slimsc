Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow. The question is about two separate reactions, and I have to pick the major products A and B from the given options.

First, let's read the problem carefully.

The first reaction is: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene treated with BuLi and then H+. The product is A.

The second reaction is: 3,4,5,7,8,9-hexamethyl-1,11-dimethylene-2,6,10,11,11a,11b-hexahydro-1H-benzo[cd]indeno[7,1-gh]azulene heated to give B.

The options are A to D, each giving possible products A and B.

Hmm. Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A.

The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw this structure. So, the benzene ring has a substituent. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl.

Breaking it down: The substituent is an (oxy)methyl group attached to the benzene. The oxy group is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group.

Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. Let's see: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CHCH2CH2? No, wait: but-2-en is CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond at position 2. So, structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH=CHCH2? No, wait. Wait, but-2-en is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but that doesn't make sense. Wait, but the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH=CH-CH2-? No, wait, but for but-2-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2- with the substituent at the 1 position. So, the 1-yl means the substituent is on the first carbon. So, the structure is CH2-CH=CH-CH2, but with the substituent on the first carbon.

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:

The substituent is OCH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2?

Wait, no. Let's think again. The group is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl.

Wait, so the structure is OCH2 connected to a but-2-en-1-yl group which has a methyl branch at position 3.

So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH=CH-CH2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up here. Let me draw it as:

The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but wait, that would be but-1-en-3-yl. Hmm. Maybe I should count the positions.

But for but-2-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2-CH=CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense because but has four carbons. So, the correct structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- with the substituent on the first carbon. Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH=CH-CH2, but the substituent is on the first carbon. Wait, no, the but-2-en-1-yl group is -CH2-CH=CH-CH2-? No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:

The group is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no. Because but-2-en-1-yl is four carbons, with a double bond between C2 and C3, and the substituent (methyl) is on C3.

Wait, so but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH=CH-CH2, but with a methyl on C3. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2? No, wait, but that's but-3-en-1-yl
