Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. So, I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. The problem gives me the stability constants β1 to β4. Oh wait, stability constants are for different complexes, right? Let me see, Co(II) can form complexes with SCN- in different numbers, like [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3- and so on. The β values are the formation constants for each complex.

The given concentrations are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. So, the total cobalt is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate is 0.1 M.

I remember that the distribution of metal species in solution can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex and sum them up to find the percentage of each species.

Each β represents the formation constant for the nth complex. So, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, and β4 would be for [Co(SCN)_4]^4-? Or wait, maybe the index goes differently. Wait, the question says "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN- ions. So the complex we're interested in is the one with two SCN- per Co^2+.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex formed, then sum the fractions for each complex to get 100%. Then, the percentage we need is the fraction of the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex multiplied by 100.

The formula to find the fraction f_n of the nth complex is f_n = (β_n * [M] * [L]^n) / (1 + sum from k=1 to m of (β_k * [M] * [L]^k))), where [M] is the metal concentration, [L] is the ligand concentration, and m is the maximum possible complex.

Wait, but in this case, the metal is Co^2+ and SCN- is the ligand. So, the formation constants are for each step. Let me think: the formation of the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, has β1=9. The second, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, has β2=40, but wait, is β2 the second formation step? Or is it the overall constant for the complex up to that point? Oh, right, the stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the previous species. Or wait, no, sometimes β is the overall constant for the complex. I might need to clarify that.

Wait, no, the stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal
