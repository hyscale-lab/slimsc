Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about isomers, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers can be constitutional or stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different structures but the same formula, whereas stereoisomers are about the arrangement in space, like cis-trans or enantiomers.

The question has two parts, A and B.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Oh right, it's a type of isomerism where a proton moves from one atom to another, resulting in the same functional groups but a different structure. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a carbonyl group can tautomerize to an enol form. But for this to happen, there must be adjacent hydrogen atoms to shift.

Looking at the compounds:

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which has two ketone groups. Quinones often have conjugated carbonyl groups. But for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, benzoquinone, like 1,4-benzoquinone, has two ketone groups in para positions. The structure is O=C6H4=C=O. Each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. So each carbonyl group is connected to the ring, not to any hydrogens. Because the carbonyls are on the benzene ring, there are no adjacent hydrogens (like on a CH group) next to the carbonyl. So there's no possibility for enol tautomerism here. So benzoquinone can't show tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring at the 1,3,5 positions. Each carbonyl is attached to the ring. Each of these ketones is on a CH2 group? Wait, no. The structure is a six-membered ring with three ketones at positions 1,3,5. Each is O=C-. So each of these is in a position where, for example, the carbonyl is
