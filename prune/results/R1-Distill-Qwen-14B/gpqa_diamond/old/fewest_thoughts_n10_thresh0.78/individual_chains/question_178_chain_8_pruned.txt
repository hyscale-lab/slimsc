Okay, so I have this question about the Lagrangian and the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, I remember that σ matrices are antisymmetric and involve the commutators of the gamma matrices.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. I know that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must be dimensionless because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian has to have a mass dimension of 4 because the integral over four dimensions is dimensionless.

Wait, wait, no, the Lagrangian density itself has dimension 4. Because when you integrate over four spacetime dimensions, which have dimension 4, the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4 to make the action (dimensionless) as ∫ d^4x L.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So each term in L must have [term]_M = 4.

So for L_int = κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, each part's mass dimension adds up to 4.

Let me figure out the dimensions of each component:

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. The mass dimension of ψ is 3/2. Because a Dirac field in 4D has mass dimension 3/2. So \bar{ψ} is also 3/2.

σ_{μν} is made up of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, I think. Because they're part of the spinor representation and don't carry mass dimensions themselves. So σ_{μν} is just a product of gamma matrices, so dimensionless.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for the electromagnetic field (assuming this is QED, but wait, the sigma term... Oh wait, this looks like the interaction term in QED, but maybe it's a different theory. Hmm, but the field strength tensor F is for a gauge field, so A_mu. The field strength F^{μν} is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ plus some terms if it's non-Abelian, but since it's [γ,γ], I think it's Abelian, so F is two derivatives acting on A.

Wait, what's the mass dimension of F^{μν}? The gauge field A_mu has mass dimension 1. Because the field strength F is ∂μ Aν, and ∂ has dimension 1. So F has dimension [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2. Or wait, the dimension of F is the same as [∂μ Aν]. A_mu is dimension 1, ∂ is dimension 1, so F is 2.

Wait, let me double-check: The gauge field A_mu has a kinetic term like (∂μ Aν)^2. The term (∂μ Aν) has dimension [∂μ] (which is 1) times [Aν] (which is 1), so each derivative term in F is 2. So F^{μν} has mass dimension 2.

Putting it all together:

Each ψ is 3/2. So \bar{ψ} ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3.

σ_{μν} is dimensionless, so that doesn't add anything.

Then F^{μν} is 2. So the product \bar{ψ} σ ψ F would be 3 + 2 =5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by this product. So the term is κ * (3 + 2) =5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So:

[κ] + [ \bar{ψ} σ ψ F ] =4.

Wait, [κ] + (3 + 2) ) =4.

So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The term is κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ is 3/2. So \bar{ψ} ψ is 3
