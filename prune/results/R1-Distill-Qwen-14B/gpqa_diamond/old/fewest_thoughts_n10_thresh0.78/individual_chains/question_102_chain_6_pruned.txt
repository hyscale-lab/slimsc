Okay, let's try to figure out this question. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll walk through what I know.

So, the scenario is about a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. The setup involves a bicistronic vector with Cre-loxP cassettes. The main issue is that when they crossed the mouse model with SOX10-Cre, they didn't see a green signal, which should come from eGFP linked to the receptor.

First, I need to understand the construct. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) in one transcript. The ligand is first, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is second, with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is after an IRES element, which allows internal ribosome entry so that the receptor can be translated from the same mRNA as the ligand.

Stop cassettes are between ligand and mCherry (loxP-stop-loxP) and between receptor and eGFP (lox2272-stop-lox2272). So, without Cre, the ligand is expressed with mCherry, and the receptor is not expressed because the stop cassette blocks it. But when Cre is present, it should delete the stop cassettes. 

In the experiment, they transfected primary astrocyte culture and used Western blot with antibodies. They probably didn't see the eGFP because maybe the construct wasn't working, but the question is more about the mouse model. They made a mouse homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. The Cre should excise the stop cassettes in the cells where SOX10 is expressed, which is in neural crest-derived cells like Schwann cells and some glial cells.

The result was no green signal under the microscope. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on neighboring cells. But if the Cre is active, the receptor should be expressed in the same cells as the ligand. Paracrine might not prevent the eGFP expression. The question is about expression, not function.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If eGFP isn't reaching the cell surface, then you wouldn't see the fluorescent signal. But in Western blot, they probably used total protein, so the eGFP would be detected regardless of location. Unless the construct's stop is preventing expression... But in this case, SOX10-Cre should have removed the stop. Maybe the eGFP is not correctly expressed.

C) Missing enhancer for expression. The CBA promoter is strong, so maybe it's sufficient. The IRES is for the receptor. Without an enhancer, the receptor might not be expressed. But the construct was expressed in transfected astrocytes, so the promoter might be working. Wait, the question says that after transfection, they used antibodies against overexpressed proteins. So maybe the promoter is working. But in the mouse, perhaps the enhancer is needed for the endogenous expression.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is constitutive. The receptor is under the control of IRES, which is weaker. So maybe in the mouse, the receptor isn't being expressed because of the IRES or lack of a promoter? Or perhaps the construct isn't properly regulated.

D) Receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not correctly in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed. In the construct, the receptor is fused to eGFP. If the stop cassette isn't correctly removed, the eGFP might not be expressed. Alternatively, if the lox sites are not correctly recognized, the stop might remain. Or perhaps the reading frame is messed up.

Wait, the stop cassettes are between the ligand/mCherry and between the receptor/eGFP. So when Cre is active, it deletes the stop in the ligand region, allowing the ligand to be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor should be expressed with eGFP. So the eGFP should be after the receptor.

But if the stop isn't deleted correctly, the receptor won't be expressed. But the mouse is homozygous, so both alleles would have the same issue. The Cre is from SOX10, which is expressed in neural crest. So when the Cre is active, it should delete the loxP and lox2272 sites.

Wait, the loxP and lox2272 are different sites. LoxP is recognized by Cre, but lox2272 is a variant. So for the lox2272 cassette, you might need a different Cre, but I think standard Cre can cut lox2272 as well.

Wait, no. Lox2272 is a mutant site that is recognized by Cre but requires a longer sequence. So the same Cre would work for both. So when Cre is present, both stops should be deleted.

But if in the mouse model, SOX10-Cre is active, the stops should be removed. So why no eGFP?

Another possibility: the vector didn't integrate correctly, but the question says the mouse is homozygous, so it's in the genome.

Another angle: perhaps the IRES is not working. The IRES allows the receptor to be expressed after the ligand. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor won't be expressed. But in transfected cells, the ligand and receptor might both be expressed because the CBA promoter is strong. But in the mouse, maybe the IRES isn't active, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Wait, the construct is designed so that the ligand is under CBA, then an IRES, then the receptor. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand is expressed with mCherry, and the receptor is expressed with eGFP. If
