Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something to do with the event horizon and entropy. The question gives me the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole, and I need to find the order of magnitude of its entropy.

Alright, let's break this down. The problem states that the galaxy is at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs, and the angular size θ is 10^-17 degrees. I think the first step is to find the radius of the event horizon, because entropy of a black hole depends on its area, which in turn depends on the radius.

Wait, right! The formula for the entropy of a black hole is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. And A is 4πr², where r is the Schwarzschild radius. Oh yeah, the Schwarzschild radius R_s is (2 G M) / c². So putting it all together, entropy depends on the mass of the black hole because the area depends on R_s, which is proportional to mass.

But wait, how do I find the mass from the given angular size? Oh right, the angular size θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size of the object (the event horizon diameter, I think) divided by the distance to the object. So θ ≈ (2r) / d, where r is the radius of the event horizon. Because θ in radians is opposite over adjacent, so size over distance.

So let me write that down. θ (radians) ≈ (2r) / d.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees. I'll need to convert that to radians first. Oh right, to convert degrees to radians, multiply by π/180. So θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180).

So for θ = 1e-17 degrees, θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π / 180 ≈ roughly 1.745e-19 radians.

Hmm, let's compute that more accurately. 1e-17 degrees * (π rad / 180 degrees) = 1e-17 * π / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Yep.

So, 2r / d = θ_rad → r = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

Given that d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, what's a parsec? 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So plugging in the numbers:

r = (1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m) / 2.

Let me compute that. 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = let's see: 1.745 * 3.086 ≈ 5.377, and exponents are e-19 * e26 = e7. So 5.377e7. Dividing by 2 gives about 2.688e7 meters. So r is approximately 2.688e7 meters. Wait, that seems really small. Supermassive black holes are supposed to be much larger. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck. Let's compute 1e-17 degrees in radians.

1e-17 degrees * (π/180) → π is approx 3.1416, so 3.1416/(180) ≈ 0.0174533. So 1e-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.74533e-19 radians. That's correct.

Then, d is 1e10 parsecs. 1 parsec is about 3.0857e16 meters. So 1e10 *3.0857e16 = 3.0857e26 meters.

So 2r = θ_rad * d → r = (θ_rad * d)/2.

So (1.745e-19 rad) * (3.0857e26 m) = let's compute 1.745e-19 * 3.0857e26.

1.745 *3.0857 ≈ 5.38 (because 1.745 *3 is about 5.235, 1.745 *0.0857 is about 0.150, so total about 5.385).

Exponents: 1e-19 *1e26 = 1e7. So 5.385e7. Then divide by 2: r ≈ 2.6925e7 meters.

Wait, that's about 2.69e7 meters, or 26.9 million meters. Hmm, but a supermassive black hole's event horizon is usually on the order of millions to billions of kilometers
