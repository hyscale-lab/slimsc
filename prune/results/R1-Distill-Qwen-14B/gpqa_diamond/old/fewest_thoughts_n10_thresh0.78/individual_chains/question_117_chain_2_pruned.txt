Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question lists four compounds and asks which exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing some of the compounds.

First, I remember that optical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, occurs when a molecule has a chiral center—meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. Chiral centers have four different substituents attached to a carbon atom.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. Biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1', with nitro groups at 6 and 6', and carboxylate ester groups at 2 and 2'. Wait, so each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Let me visualize this. The central structure is a biphenyl, which is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on each ring. For each ring, the nitro is at position 6 and the ester at position 2. So, each ring has two substituents, each in a para position relative to each other? Wait, but each ring has two substituents. Wait, the numbering—on each benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are meta to each other, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Wait, but the key is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule might not be chiral. So, in this case, the two rings are each substituted with a nitro and a carboxylate group. Are the substituents arranged symmetrically? Because the molecule is symmetrical—like, the two rings are mirror images of each other with the substituents in corresponding positions. So, maybe the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. Or wait, maybe each ring is a mirror image, but the whole molecule isn't symmetric if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates asymmetry. Hmm, maybe I should think about whether the central bond allows for free rotation. Wait, biphenyls usually have a single bond, which allows rotation around it. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that can be mirrored when the rings rotate, then the molecule might not have a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so no net chirality. So, maybe compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule chiral, then it could. Alternatively, maybe each ring itself isn't chiral, but the arrangement makes the whole molecule chiral. I'm a bit confused here. Let's tentatively say that compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism because the arrangement is symmetric, but I'm not entirely certain. I'll come back to this.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Let me draw this: the central carbon is the one attached to the hydroxy group. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate would be CH2CH2COO- but that's not right. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the -OH is on the second carbon of the propane chain. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the one with the hydroxyl. Let's see: the central carbon (the second carbon of propane) is attached to -CH3, -OH, -COOCH3, and another CH2? Wait,
