Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic physics can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their speeds because of the effects of special relativity. I remember that you can't just use the classical velocity addition formula at high speeds. Instead, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Here, u and v are the speeds of the two objects relative to a common frame. So in this case, one astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the other at 0.5c. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be 0.6c minus 0.5c, but wait, that's only in classical terms. Relativistically, it's not that simple.

Let me plug in the numbers. Let's say u is 0.6c, and v is 0.5c. So the relative speed u' would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²]. Simplifying that denominator: (0.3c²) / c² is 0.3, so denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. The numerator is 0.1c. So u' is (0.1c)/(0.7) which is approximately 0.1428c, so around 0.14c. That would match one of the options.

Wait, but I should double-check. Oh, right, because it's the frame of one astronaut. Let me think, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.6 - 0.5)c / (1 - (0.6*0.5)/(c²)) )? No, wait, no, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So (0.6c - 0.5c)=0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.6*0.5 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is roughly 0.14c.

Now, for the total energy. The total energy of a relativistic object is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1
