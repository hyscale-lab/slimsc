Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So, a scientist is doing quantitative PCR, and he made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He used three technical replicates for each dilution. The efficiency was 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect, no loss each cycle. The RÂ² was 1, so that's a perfect correlation, meaning the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope was -3.3, I remember that the slope in qPCR is related to the efficiency. The formula is something like slope = log(E) / log(10) * (-1), I think. Wait, wait, no, wait. The standard formula for the slope in the linear part of a qPCR curve is slope = - (1 / log(E)) * (1 / log(10)), right? Because the equation is Ct = log(A0) / log(E) + intercept. Or wait, maybe it's Ct = (log(A0)) / (log(10)) * (1 / (100% efficiency is E=1, but wait, if E is 100%, then E=1, so log(E) is 0. Oh wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Wait, PCR efficiency E is usually expressed as a decimal. So 100% efficiency would be E=1.0, but wait, for the calculation, maybe when E is 100%, the equation is Ct = Ct0 + log(A0) * (1/log(E)) )? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

But the question says the efficiency is 100%, so E=1. Wait, but then log(E) is log(1) which is 0. So the slope would be undefined? Or perhaps the standard formula for the slope is (slope) = - (1 / log(E)) * (1 / log(10)), but if E is 1, then log(E) is zero, so slope would be -infinity, which doesn't make sense. But the given slope is -3.3. That can't be right if E is 100% because that would imply an impossible slope.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. Oh wait, another thought: the formula for the slope when efficiency is 100% (E=1) is actually slope = - (1 / ln(2)) * ln(10). Because when E=1, ln(1) is 0, but perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, when E is 100%, the calculation simplifies. Let me think again. Because when E is 1, each cycle doubles the DNA. So the relationship between Ct and the starting quantity is linear in log space. The formula is Ct = log10(A0) + Ct0. So the slope of the curve (in a plot of Ct vs log10(A0)) would be 1, but wait, in the problem the slope is -3.3. That doesn't fit. So maybe the scientist made a mistake in the
