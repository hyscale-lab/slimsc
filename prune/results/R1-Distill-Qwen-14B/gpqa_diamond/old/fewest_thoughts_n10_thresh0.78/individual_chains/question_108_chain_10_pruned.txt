Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis. The magnetic field has a value of 1 Tesla, and m is small, so I guess m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem asks to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is related to the Zeeman effect) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

First, I need to figure out what the paramagnetic coupling term is. I remember that the Zeeman effect deals with the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. The energy shift due to the magnetic field is given by the Zeeman term, which is something like ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * m * B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, but wait, paramagnetic coupling might be a bit different. Oh, right, paramagnetism arises from the magnetic moments of electrons due to their spin. The coupling term in the Hamiltonian for the magnetic interaction is H = -μ·B. For an electron, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -g_s μ_B S, where g_s is the spin g-factor (about 2) and S is the spin operator. So the paramagnetic term would be proportional to the magnetic field and the spin.

But wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is m, which is related to the orbital angular momentum. Oh, but for paramagnetism, it's more about the spin part. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The paramagnetic effect is due to the electron's spin in a magnetic field. So the coupling term is H = -μ·B = -g_s μ_B m_s B, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number, which can be ±1/2.

Wait, but the question says m is small. Oh, but wait, the orbital quantum number m can be -l, ..., +l. For a hydrogen atom, l can be 0,1,2,... etc. But if m is small, maybe it's near zero? Or maybe m is just considered as a small number, so the term would be small compared to other energies?

Hmm, but the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which is due to spin) with the transition energy ΔE. So the transition energy is the energy difference between two states in the hydrogen atom, like between energy levels. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think corresponds to the Balmer series, like the H-alpha line.

So first, I need to calculate the transition energy ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = - (μ_e c^2)/(2 n²), where μ_e is the electron mass, c is the speed of light. Alternatively, since the Rydberg constant R is about 13
