Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the oxidizing strength of oxygen in different solutions and its reaction kinetics in acidic versus basic conditions.

Hmm, I remember that in electrochemistry, the oxidizing power (or strength) of a substance is related to its standard electrode potential. The higher the potential, the stronger the oxidizing agent. Oxygen is involved in redox reactions, right? Like in the oxygen electrode, which is often used as a reference.

Wait, in basic solutions, the reaction for oxygen is probably O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^- with a standard potential around +0.40 V. In acidic conditions, the same oxygen would react as O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O, which I think has a higher standard potential, maybe around 1.23 V. Oh right! Because in acidic solution, the O2 is a stronger oxidant. So in basic solution, it's a weaker oxidant than in acidic.

So for the first blank, thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Wait, no. Wait, the statement says, "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." Oh, I think I got that backwards. Let me think again. The standard potential is higher in acidic, which means it's a stronger oxidant there. So in basic, the potential is lower, so it's a weaker oxidant. So the first blank should be "weaker".

Now, the second part is about kinetics. Kinetically, how does oxygen react in acidic versus basic solutions? Kinetics relates to reaction rates. I remember that in acidic conditions, the reaction might have a higher rate because of the presence of H+ ions. Oh wait, but wait. The rate of the reaction can depend on the concentration of ions in solution. Let me think about the reaction mechanisms.

In acidic solution, perhaps the reaction involves more ions, making the rate faster. Or maybe the reaction is more favorable in terms of activation energy. Wait, I think the rate of oxygen's reaction can be influenced by the solution's pH. For example, in acidic conditions, the reaction might proceed faster because protons are available for the reaction steps. Or wait, isn't the reaction in acidic solution more kinetically favorable because of the higher concentration of H+ which can stabilize intermediates?

Alternatively, maybe the opposite is true. Because in basic conditions, the O2 is a better oxidizer (since it's a weaker oxidizer in basic?), wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the rate. The rate of a redox reaction can be affected by various factors, such as the concentration of ions, the presence of catalysts, etc.

Wait, O2's reaction rate as an oxidant might be faster in acidic solutions. Because in acidic, the reaction produces H2O, which is more stable. Or perhaps because in acidic conditions, the reaction involves more ionic species, which can increase the reaction rate.

Alternatively, I've heard that in acidic solutions, the oxygen reduction reaction (like in fuel cells) has a higher rate due to better proton availability. So when the question says "kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions," the blank is about whether it's faster or slower compared to basic conditions.

So in acidic, it's faster. So the second blank should be "faster".

Wait, let me think again about the thermodynamic part. The standard electrode potential for O2 is higher (stronger oxidant) in acidic (E° is 1.23 V) compared to basic (E° is about 0.40 V). So in basic, it's a weaker oxidant. So first part is weaker.

Second part: in acidic solutions, the reaction (reduction of O2) is faster. So the statement would be "kinetically, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions."

Putting it together:

Thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions.

So the options:

Option C is weaker – faster.

Wait, checking the options:

Options:
A) stronger – faster
B) stronger – slower
C) weaker – faster
D) weaker – slower

So the correct combination is weaker (first blank) and faster (second blank). So the answer is option C.


Thermodynamically, the oxidizing strength of oxygen depends on the solution's pH. In basic solutions, the standard electrode potential of oxygen is lower (around +0.40 V), making it a weaker oxidant compared to acidic solutions, where the potential is higher (around +1.23 V). Therefore, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions.

Kinetically, the reaction rate of oxygen is influenced by the solution's environment. In acidic solutions, the reaction involves more ionic species, such as H⁺ ions, which can stabilize intermediates and increase the reaction rate. Thus, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions.

Combining these observations, the correct answer is that oxygen is a weaker oxidant thermodynamically in basic solutions and reacts faster kinetically in acidic solutions.

Answer: C
