Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here. Hmm. Let me think. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field within a sphere of radius R.

Wait, the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So its magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Oh right, so f(r) is a radial vector field, meaning it points directly away (or towards, depending on the sign) from the origin, and its strength decreases with the square of the distance from the origin.

The problem asks for the integral of the divergence of f over the volume of a sphere of radius R. So I need to compute ∫ (volume) ∇ · f dV. I remember there's a theorem related to this—Gauss's Law maybe? Or perhaps the Divergence Theorem. Oh wait, the Divergence Theorem connects the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary.

Wait, but wait. Since this is a scalar integral, but the field is only radial, maybe I can compute the divergence first.

In spherical coordinates, for a vector field that's only radial, the divergence simplifies. The general formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r) where A_r is the radial component. So in this case, the vector field has only the radial component, which is f(r) = 1/r², so A_r = 1/r².

So divergence ∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let me calculate that. r² times 1/r² is 1. So d/dr of 1 is zero. Wait, so the divergence is zero? But wait, that can't be right. Because if the field is 1/r² radial, like an electric field of a point charge, I thought the divergence would be a delta function at the origin.

Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the divergence in vacuum. Oh wait, in this case, we're outside the origin, so for r > 0, the divergence is zero. But when you integrate the divergence over a volume that includes the origin, you pick up a term related to the charge enclosed, so to speak. But in this problem, the volume is a sphere of radius R. So if R is not zero, but the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral would be zero. Wait, but that can't be right because if the field is like a point source, the divergence would be a delta function at the origin.

Wait, let's re-express this. So f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, where r̂ is the unit radial vector. Then, the divergence of this field is zero everywhere except at r=0. So when we integrate ∇·f over the volume, if the origin is inside the volume (which it is, since the sphere is centered at the origin), then the integral would be the flux through the surface, which would be a delta function. But wait, the divergence theorem says that ∫ (div f) dV = ∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector on the surface. So if I compute the flux through the sphere of radius R of f, which is (1/r²) r̂, then f · n is (1/r²) * R̂ · R̂ = 1/R² times the area element. Wait, no, wait: the vector field at the surface (r=R) is (1/R²) r̂. The surface is r=R, so n is r̂. So the dot product is (1/R²) * (r̂ · r̂) = 1/R².

The surface integral is then ∫ f · n dA = ∫ (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ. Wait, because dA in spherical coordinates is R² sinθ dθ dφ. So 1/R² times R² is 1, so the integral becomes ∫ sinθ dθ dφ over the sphere. The integral of sinθ from 0 to π is 2, and the integral of dφ from 0 to 2π is 2π. Multiply them: 2 * 2π = 4π. So the surface integral is 4π, which equals the volume integral of the divergence.

But wait, the divergence of f is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So the volume integral is the same as the flux through the surface, which is 4π. But wait, that would mean the divergence is a delta function scaled by 4π? Or is that the result of the surface integral?

Alternatively, let's think about the divergence in the volume. For r ≠ 0, the divergence is zero, but when you integrate over a volume that includes r=0, the integral picks up the delta function. So ∫ (div f) dV = 4π δ³(r). Hmm, that might complicate things.

Wait, but in this problem, the vector field is given as 1/r² radial. So in the region r>0, the divergence is zero. Therefore, the volume integral of divergence over any region that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But in our case, the sphere of radius R does include the origin (since it's centered there). So the integral would involve the delta function.

But wait, the divergence of f(r) is zero except at the origin. So the integral inside the sphere of radius R would be 4π. Because the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, and the origin is included, so the integral is 4π. But wait, I thought when you integrate a delta function over all space, you get 1. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, let's compute the divergence correctly. Let me write it again.

f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

In spherical coordinates, divergence is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r).

So A_r = 1/r².

r² A_r = r² * (1/r²) = 1.

d/dr (1) = 0.

So ∇ · f = 0 for r ≠ 0.

Wait, but that's not considering the origin. So for any point away from the origin, the divergence is zero. So when I integrate ∇ · f over the entire volume (including the origin?), then the integral would be zero except at r=0. But wait, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's singular. So when I integrate over the sphere of radius R, the integral is zero plus any contribution from the origin?

Wait, no. Because the divergence is zero everywhere inside the sphere except possibly at r=0, but in the integral, that's a point which contributes nothing to the volume integral. Because the volume of a single point is zero. So would the integral be zero?

Wait, but that's conflicting with the earlier approach using the divergence theorem. Because according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral of f · n.

But if the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, then the volume integral would be zero. But the surface integral is 4π, as computed earlier. So this suggests that the divergence theorem must be holding, so the integral would be 4π. But how does that reconcile with the divergence being zero?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, the divergence of f(r) is not zero. Let me re-examine the calculation.

f(r) is (1/r²) r̂. So the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)).

Wait, r²*(1/r²) is 1. So the derivative is zero. So ∇ · f = 0 for all r ≠ 0.

But then, the divergence theorem says that the integral over the volume is equal to the surface integral. But the volume integral is zero, but the surface integral is 4π. That would imply that the integral is 4π, but according to the divergence in the volume, it's zero. So this suggests that there's a delta function at the origin which contributes 4π when integrated.

Wait, that makes sense. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function multiplied by 4π. So the integral over the sphere (which includes the origin) would be 4π.

But wait, the problem says that f(r) is defined as 1/r², and only has a radial component. So perhaps the field is modeled as a point source, and the divergence is a delta function scaled by the charge or something. So the volume integral of the divergence would be 4π times the charge enclosed, which in this case is 4π?

So then, the integral over the sphere would be 4π, because the divergence is a delta function at the origin contributing that value.

But wait, no. Wait, Gauss's Law says that the integral of E · dA is Q_enc / ε0. If E is (1/(4πε0)) * (q / r²) r̂, then the integral is q/ε0. But in this problem, perhaps the field is given as 1/r², so it's similar to E being (1/(4π)) * (q / r²) r̂. So the flux would be (1/(4π)) * q * 4π = q.

But in our case, the field is f(r) = 1/r² r̂, so the surface integral is 4π, which would suggest that the 'charge' is 4π, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the divergence is zero except at the origin, so the volume integral is 4π. But how?

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the divergence behaves. Since f(r) is like a radial inverse-square law field, it's divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, and at the origin, it's a delta function scaled by 4π. So the divergence would be 4π δ³(r).

If that's the case, then the volume integral of ∇ · f over the sphere of radius R would be the same as integrating 4π δ³(r) over the sphere. Since the delta function is zero everywhere except at r=0, the integral would be 4π times the volume integral of δ³(r), which is 1. So the integral is 4π * 1 = 4π.

Wait, but that's not the case. Because the delta function is 4π δ³(r), so ∫ (4π δ³(r)) dV over the sphere would be 4π * 1, since the sphere includes the origin. So the integral is 4π.

But wait, earlier I thought the divergence was zero, so the volume integral would be zero. But now, considering the delta function, the integral is 4π.

Wait, but how does that make sense. Because if the divergence is zero except at the origin, but the origin is included in the volume, then the integral would capture the delta function, so the answer is 4π.

But the options given are:

A) 4π

B) 1

C)4/3 π R

D)0

So the correct answer should be A) 4π.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the mathematical definition. The divergence of a radial function f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

In general, for a radial vector field F(r) = F(r) r̂, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² F(r)).

So in this case, F(r) = 1/r².

So ∇ · F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * 1/r²) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

Wait, that's correct only when r is not zero. So for all r > 0, the divergence is zero. But what about at r=0?

Well, the divergence isn't defined in the same way at r=0 because the function isn't smooth there. But in distribution theory, when you integrate the divergence over a region that includes r=0, you get a term involving the delta function.

So the divergence can be represented as ∇ · F = 4π δ³(r).

Thus, the integral of ∇ · F over any volume containing the origin would be 4π, because ∫ δ³(r) dV = 1, so 4π * 1 =4π.

So the answer would be 4π, which is option A.

But wait, the problem says that the vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r². So perhaps it's meant to consider the case where the field is defined for r ≠ 0, but the divergence is zero. So the volume integral would be zero, but that's not the case because the divergence has a delta function contribution.

Hmm. So I'm a bit confused now. Because when I compute the divergence in the usual sense (without delta functions), it's zero. But the flux through the surface is 4π, so the divergence theorem suggests that the integral of the divergence is 4π, which requires that the divergence includes a delta function.

So perhaps the correct answer is 4π, which is option A.

Alternatively, if the field is considered to have zero divergence everywhere in the volume (excluding origin), but the origin is not part of the volume? No, the sphere is centered at the origin, so the origin is inside.

Wait, but in reality, the origin is a single point, so the volume inside the sphere doesn't change when including the origin. So the integral of ∇ · f within the sphere would be ∫ (div f) dV = ∫ (4π δ³(r)) dV = 4π * 1 =4π.

So the answer is A) 4π.


To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field \( \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) \) inside a sphere of radius \( R \) centered at the origin, we proceed as follows:

The vector field is given as \( \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}} \), where \( \hat{\mathbf{r}} \) is the unit radial vector in spherical coordinates. The divergence of a radial vector field \( \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = F(r) \hat{\mathbf{r}} \) in spherical coordinates is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 F(r) \right).
\]

For the given field \( F(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \), we compute:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0, \quad \text{for } r \neq 0.
\]

Thus, the divergence \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) is zero everywhere except at the origin \( r = 0 \), where the field has a singularity. At the origin, the divergence can be represented as a Dirac delta function \( \delta^3(\mathbf{r}) \), scaled by \( 4\pi \), i.e., \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 4\pi \delta^3(\mathbf{r}) \).

The volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) over the sphere of radius \( R \) is:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_V 4\pi \delta^3(\mathbf{r}) \, dV.
\]

The delta function \( \delta^3(\mathbf{r}) \) is nonzero only at \( \mathbf{r} = 0 \), and its integral over any volume containing the origin is 1. Since the sphere of radius \( R \) includes the origin, the integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = 4\pi.
\]

This result is consistent with the divergence theorem, which states that the volume integral of the divergence equals the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary. For \( \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}} \), the surface integral over the sphere of radius \( R \) yields the same result, \( 4\pi \).

Thus, the volume integral of the divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) inside the sphere of radius \( R \) is \( 4\pi \).
