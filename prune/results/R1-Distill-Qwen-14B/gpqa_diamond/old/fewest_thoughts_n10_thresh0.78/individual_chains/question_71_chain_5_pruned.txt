Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my orbital mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question says there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure how that affects this particular problem. Maybe it's just background info.

These planets are in orbital resonance, which I remember means their orbital periods are in a ratio of small integers. The problem gives their periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and Planet_5 the longest. 

The question is asking for the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so that part should be manageable since albedo affects temperature, but if it's the same, maybe it cancels out in the ratio.

Equilibrium temperature... right, the formula I remember is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo)/d )^(1/2), but wait, another way to think about it is using the inverse square law. The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh, right, the formula I should use is T = T_earth * (P / P_earth)^(1/4) * (d / d_earth)^{-1/2} or something like that. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the period and the semi-major axis.

Wait, no, the period relates to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. So for a star with the same mass as the Sun, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. So P² ∝ a³. So a planet's distance (a) can be found from its orbital period.

But since all these planets are orbiting the same star, I can compare their a's based on their periods. Let me think, for Kepler's third law, P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So a is proportional to P^(2/3). So the ratio of semi-major axes would be (P_i / P_j)^(2/3).

Wait, but we're comparing two planets, Planet_4 and Planet_2. Their periods are in the ratio of... Let me check the given ratio. The periods are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1 through 5. So Planet_1:1, Planet_2:2, Planet_3:2.5, Planet_4:3.5, Planet_5:5.

So Planet_2 has a period of 2 units, and Planet_4 has 3.5 units. So the ratio of their periods is P_4 / P_2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

Now, because a is proportional to P^(2/3), the ratio of their semi-major axes a_4/a_2 would be (P_4/P_2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 1.75 is 7/4, so (7/4)^(2/3). Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute numerically. Let me compute 1.75^(2/3). Let's see, cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2 (since 1.2^3 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75). So 1.2 squared is about 1.44. But wait, perhaps more accurately, let me compute 1.75^(1/3). The cube of 1.2 is 1.728, so 1.203 would be closer to 1.75. Let's say approximately 1.203. Then square that: around 1.447. So a_4/a_2 ≈ 1.447.

Wait, but that's the ratio of their a's. Now, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The formula I remember is T_planet = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo)/(d) )^(1/2). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance, because T is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), which
