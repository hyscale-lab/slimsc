Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it step by step.

The question says there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. They're in orbital resonance, so their orbital periods are in a specific ratio. The periods are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So each planet's orbital period is a multiple of the first one. Planet_1 has period 1, Planet_2 is 2, and so on up to Planet_5 with period 5.

The main question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. The options are A to D, but I need to find the ratio T4 over T2 or vice versa. Oh wait, the question asks the ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, so T4/T2?

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I recall that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the energy balance. The planet absorbs energy from the star and emits it as thermal radiation. The formula I think is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the semi-major axis. Or maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law for radiation.

Wait, no, the formula for equilibrium temperature considering the star's luminosity and the planet's distance is T = T_sun * (L_star / L_sun)^(1/4) * (a / a_earth)^(-1/2), but maybe that's not the exact way. Alternatively, the formula is T = T_eff * ( (L / (16πσ a²)) )^(1/4 ), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the semi-major axis.

But wait, since all the planets orbit the same star, their luminosity L and albedo are the same. Oh, the question says they have the same albedo. So the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star (semi-major axis) and the star's luminosity. But since it's the same star, L is the same for all. So the temperature should depend inversely on the square root of the semi-major axis. Because the formula is T ∝ (L/(a²))^(1/4), which simplifies to T ∝
