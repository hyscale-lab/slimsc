Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle and Pauli statistics. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it step by step.

The problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final state has T(NN) = 0. We need to find which partial wave isn't allowed, considering angular momentum and parity conservation.

Wait, wait. Let me get the terms right. The initial state is 1S0. So the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). For 1S0, that would be (2*0 +1)S0, which is 1S0. So S is 0, L is 0, right? Because S is the total spin, so for 1S0, the spin is zero. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, when they say 1S0, the S is for orbital angular momentum. No, no, no. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L where S is the total spin. So for 1S0, that's S=0, so 2S+1 =1. So the orbital angular momentum is L=0? Because it's 1S0, so the orbital part is S, which is L=0. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The term symbol is (2S+1)L J, where S is the total spin of the two nucleons, L is the orbital angular momentum, and J is the total angular momentum. So for 1S0, the 1 comes from 2S+1=1, so S=0. The L is denoted by the letter S, which is L=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, and J=0.

The problem says that the system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So the initial parity would be the product of the intrinsic parity of each nucleon and the orbital angular momentum part.

Wait, but wait. The parity of the NN system is given by (-1)^
