Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about annihilation. Hmm, the process given is a proton and an antiproton annihilating to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The mass of A is given as 300 MeV. Wait, but wait—the question is about the velocity of particle A. Oh right, and the antiproton is moving slowly. So I think that means the initial kinetic energy is low compared to their rest mass energies.

Wait, protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? The proton has a rest mass energy of about 938 MeV, I remember that from previous studies. So the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe we can approximate that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some low velocity? Or perhaps since the antiproton is moving, but it's a low speed, so we can use some non-relativistic approximations, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but the process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. So the products are four particles, two of each charge. And each A has a mass of 300 MeV. So maybe the system is considering the center of mass frame?

Wait, considering that the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton, their rest masses are each about 938 MeV, so the total rest mass energy is around 1876 MeV. But when they annihilate, the products are four particles each with mass 30
