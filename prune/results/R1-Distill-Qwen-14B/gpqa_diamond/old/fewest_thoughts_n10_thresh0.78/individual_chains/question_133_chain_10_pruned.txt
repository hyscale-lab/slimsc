Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down and figure out what's going on. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains two different potassium and sodium phosphate salts. 

Wait, the solution has 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters, right? And it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both of these are phosphate salts. I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. 

The problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- ion, I think. Or wait, sometimes ortho refers to H2PO4^-? No, wait, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, which dissociates stepwise. So the first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1), then H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3). So the HPO4^2- is the second ionization step. So, orthophosphate might refer to HPO4^2-.

But wait, sometimes people refer to H2PO4^- as orthophosphate. Hmm, I need to clarify that. Oh, right, I think the confusion comes from different terms. Orthophosphate ions are HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, but sometimes H2PO4^- is also called orthophosphate. Wait, maybe the question refers to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. Let me think. Since the problem gives the Ka2 value, which is for the H2PO4^- to HPO4^2- transition, maybe the concentration of HPO4^2- is what's being asked.

So, the solution has both KH
