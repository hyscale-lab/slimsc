Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, maybe it's not normalized. I should probably normalize it because in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually normalized to 1.

So the state vector is |Ïˆ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me calculate its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) times [-1, 2, 1]^T. I'll write that down.

Next, the problem introduces two observables, P and Q. The operator for P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Interesting, that's a symmetric matrix. The operator for Q is another 3x3 matrix. The first row is [1,0,0], the second [0,0,0], and third [0,0,-1]. So Q is a diagonal matrix, which probably means its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

The question is: If someone measures Q just after measuring P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?

Wait, no, actually, wait the wording is confusing me. It says "measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the order is first measure P, then measure Q. But wait, no, the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.
