Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. The reaction is gamma gamma → e+ e-. The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. Also, it's given that the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV.

Hmm. I remember that the lifetime of a particle is related to its energy and the probability of interactions. So for gamma-rays, if they interact with the CMB photons, their lifetime would be the time it takes for such interactions to occur. If the interaction probability is high enough, they would annihilate quickly, hence limiting their lifetime in the universe.

I think this is related to photon-photon interactions. The cross-section for this process must be considered. The cross-section determines the probability that two particles will interact when they meet. For high-energy gamma-rays, the cross-section for pair production (like gamma gamma → e+ e-) increases with energy.

Wait, but how do I relate the gamma-ray energy to the cross-section and the photon density of the CMB? I remember something about the interaction length. The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels before interacting. The lifetime would be the mean free path divided by the expansion rate of the universe, maybe? Or perhaps considering the Hubble parameter.

Alternatively, the lifetime τ of the gamma-ray is inversely proportional to the interaction rate Γ, where Γ = n σ v, with n the number density of target photons, σ the cross-section, and v the relative velocity.

Wait, but the CMB is isotropic and uniform, so n can be found from the CMB photon density. The CMB has a blackbody spectrum with a temperature of about 2.7 K. The average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, which makes sense because kT is about that, since 1 eV is about 1.16e4 K, so 2.7 K is about 0.00234 eV. So 1e-3 eV is close, perhaps it's an approximate value.

So, first, I need to find the condition where the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this annihilation process. That would mean the interaction occurs quickly enough that the gamma-ray doesn't travel far before annihilating. The cross-section for pair production by photon-photon interactions is given by the so-called Klein-Nishina formula, but I think in the high-energy limit, the cross-section increases with energy.

Wait, the cross-section formula for pair production for two photons with energies E and E_cm (center of mass energy) is significant. The threshold for pair production is when the center of mass energy is at least 2m_e c², which is about 1.022 MeV. So for lower energies, this doesn't happen, but since we're dealing with high-energy gamma-rays, their energy is well above that.

So the reaction γ + γ → e+ + e- can occur, and the cross-section depends on the energy. I think that the cross-section σ is proportional to E^2 at high energies, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact dependence.
