Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization involves the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. 

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, but wait. If I mix them all together, what's happening? Oh right, because HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So they will react with each other.

But wait, I should think about the reaction here. Neutralization typically produces water and a salt. But with multiple acids and a base, I think I need to figure out which acid reacts with which part of the base. Also, considering the molarity and volumes to find the moles involved.

First, I'll calculate the moles of each acid and the base. Let's list them out.

For HCl: it's 500 mL of 0.2 M. So moles = Molarity Ã— Volume (in liters). 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl.

H2SO4 is a strong acid as well. It's diprotic, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So 300 mL of 0.3 M:
