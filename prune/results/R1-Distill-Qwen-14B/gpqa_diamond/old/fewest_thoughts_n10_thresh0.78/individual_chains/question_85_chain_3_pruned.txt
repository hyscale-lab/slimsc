Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. 

The question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. They both have the same albedo, which is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect. 

The transit and radial velocity methods detected them. But okay, maybe that's just background. The question is about their equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature, right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it absorbs and emits. The formula for that is... I think it's T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), but wait, wait. No, that's the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature. 

Wait, more accurately, the formula should be T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, that term cancels out when taking the ratio of their temperatures. So the albedo doesn't matter for the ratio. 

So the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because the R_star and 2 in the denominators would cancel out when taking the ratio. So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait wait, let me get the formula right. The equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_eff * ( R_star / (2 a) )^0.5 * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. So when comparing two planets, the (1-A) term is the same, so the ratio becomes sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So T1/T2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) )

But wait, no, because each planet is at a different distance a. So if a1 is the orbital radius of
