Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the question says a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. I remember that S/N ratio is important because a higher S/N means the signal is strong enough to be detected above the noise.

ESPRESSO is the new spectrograph at the VLT, right? I think it's designed for high-resolution spectroscopy. From what I've read before, ESPRESSO has a high efficiency, especially in the visible range. But wait, the exact parameters I need to recall here. Oh, maybe I need to think about its sensitivity. Like, how bright a star needs to be for it to achieve a certain S/N.

The stars given are options a to f. Let me list them out:

a) Canopus – I know Canopus is a very bright star, around magnitude -0.7 or something like that. It should be easily detectable.

b) Polaris – Polaris is the North Star, pretty bright. Its visual magnitude is about 1.97, so also quite bright. Should be detectable.

c) Star with V mag 15, 10 pc away. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the absolute magnitude is given as 15 mag. So, the apparent magnitude would be different. Because absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear at 10 pc. So if the star is at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude is the same as absolute, so 15 mag. But wait, how bright is that? I remember that lower magnitudes mean brighter. So 15 mag is really faint. Like, probably not detectable by ESPRESSO with 1-hour exposure, unless it's very close.

Wait, but wait: Magnitude is not linear. Each step of 5 is a factor of 100 in brightness. So 15 mag is way fainter than, say, 5 mag. Let me think about the formula for apparent magnitude: m = M + 5 + 5 log(d) where d is distance in parsecs. Wait, no, the formula is m - M = 5 log (d/10). So for a star at 10 pc, m = M, so yeah, 15 mag.

But wait, I need to find the apparent magnitude because that determines how bright it appears to us. So for each star, compute their apparent V magnitude.

Wait, option c is at 10 pc, so m =15. Option e is at 5 pc: m = M + 5 log(5/10) = 15 + 5 log(0.5) = 15 +5*(-0.3010) ≈15 -1.505=13.495. So about 13.5 mag.

Option f is at 50 pc: m=15 +5 log(
