Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, right? And the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, excited in a specific energy level. So the energy levels of the iron atoms are higher in star_1 compared to star_2.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, that's the same as k_B*T where k_B is the Boltzmann constant. Or wait, no, wait. Because the energy levels are determined by the thermal energy of the stars. The energy difference (ΔE) is approximately k_B*T, but I'm not sure about that. Or is it related to the excitation temperature?

Wait, the question states that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, the excitation of atoms in each star's photosphere follows the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The ratio of the number of atoms in higher energy level (n_upper) to lower (n_lower) is given by (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T) ), where T is the temperature of the photosphere.

In this problem, for star_1, the excitation is twice as high as in star_2. So, for a specific energy level, say level 2 compared to level 1 (lower energy), let's say in star_1, the ratio is n2_1 / n1_1 = 2. In star_2, the same ratio would be n2_2 / n1_2 = 1, perhaps? Wait, wait. The question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the excitation level is higher, meaning more in the higher energy state. So for star_1, the ratio is higher than for star_2.

Wait, no, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the number of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) is twice as high compared to star_2. So, n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 = 2, and
