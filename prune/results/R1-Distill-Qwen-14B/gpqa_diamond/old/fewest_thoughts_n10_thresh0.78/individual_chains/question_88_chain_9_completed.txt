Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some immune response in mice. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question says that GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice via oral gavage. Then, in vivo imaging shows some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some tangled in mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They identified fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated proliferating cells, then sequenced their variable heavy chain genes, which showed high variability.

Wait, I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're specialized for sampling antigens in the gut. When you introduce something into the gut via oral gavage, the immune response starts there, right? The Peyer's patches are where antigens are taken up by M cells and presented to immune cells.

The GFP-tagged proteins probably function as antigens here. The mice's immune system would respond by producing antibodies against them. The fact that they observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests something is causing the diversity in the antibodies. 

So what processes create variability in antibodies? I think there are a few main ones. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) comes to mind. SHM introduces point mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors, increasing diversity. This process happens after the initial antigen recognition, during the germinal center phase. Class switching recombination (CSR) changes the isotype of the antibody without affecting the variable region; it's about the class (like switching from IgM to IgG). VDJ recombination happens during B cell development in the bone marrow, where variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to form the variable region of the heavy chain. But VDJ is a one-time event early on, so the variability from that would already be present in the initial B cells. 

They isolated proliferating cells, which suggests these are activated B cells. In the germinal centers, B cells undergo SHM and selection. High variability in the variable regions would mean SHM is happening. Because the genes show high variability, that's a result of point mutations introduced by SHM. 

Complement activation (option B) is more about opsonization and clearing pathogens, not directly about creating variability in antibody genes. So that's probably not the right answer.

So putting it together, the process happening is somatic hypermutation. That's option A.


The question involves an experiment where GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence from these proteins is observed in Peyer's patches, and the proliferating cell population isolated from these patches shows high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. This suggests a process that introduces diversity in the antibody repertoire.

Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are specialized for antigen sampling. When antigens are introduced into the gut, they are taken up by M cells and presented to immune cells, initiating an immune response. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes indicates a process that increases antibody diversity. 

Among the options provided:
- **Somatic hypermutation (SHM)** introduces point mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors during the germinal center phase, increasing diversity. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **Class switching recombination (CSR)** changes the antibody isotype but does not affect the variable region, so it is not relevant here.
- **VDJ recombination** occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes initial variability in the variable region. However, it is a one-time event and does not account for the observed variability in the experiment.
- **Complement activation** is involved in pathogen clearance and does not directly contribute to antibody variability.

The observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by somatic hypermutation, a process that occurs in activated B cells during the immune response. 

Answer: A
