Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question gives me two planets orbiting a star that's a bit more massive and bigger than the Sun. Both planets have been detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. I remember that the transit method measures the dip in the star's brightness as a planet passes in front, and the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull.

The main question is about the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. The options are A to D, so I need to figure out which one it is.

First, I recall that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the energy balance—it’s how much heat the planet absorbs from its star and how much it radiates back. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. Wait, but wait, the albedo is the same for both planets here, so that part might cancel out.

Let me write down the variables from the problem:

Star:
- Mass = 1.5 * Sun's mass
- Radius = 1.2 * Sun's radius
- Teff = 6300 K

Planet1:
- Mass = 7 Earth masses
- Radius = 1.7 Earth radii

Planet2:
- Mass = 5 Earth masses
- Radius = 1.3 Earth radii

But wait, for equilibrium temperature, the planet's mass and radius might not directly matter, except through their orbital distances. Oh right, because the RV method gives the minimum mass, but in this case, I think the problem is giving the actual masses, but perhaps I don't need them for the equilibrium temperature? Or maybe it's a trick. Hmm.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is more dependent on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula is T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5 * ( (1 + e) )^0.5, but for circular orbits, e=0, so that term is 1. So we can ignore the eccentricity here.

But wait, another thought: the equilibrium temperature also depends on the planet's albedo and its distance from the star. Oh, and the star's luminosity.

So first, I need the star's luminosity. Because each planet's equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and their respective orbital distances.

The star's luminosity (L) can be determined from the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. So even though the star is more massive and bigger than the Sun, I can compute its luminosity relative to the Sun.

Wait, but the Sun's Teff is about 5778 K. So this star is a bit hotter than the Sun. Let me compute the star's luminosity in terms of solar luminosities.

Star's radius is 1.2 R_sun, Teff is 6300 K. So the star's luminosity L = (R
