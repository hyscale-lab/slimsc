Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory where you write down all possible operators consistent with some symmetry principles, right? So the question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to each other. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, right? Because Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations and translations in space-time. So if a theory respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory... Do effective theories have to respect all those symmetries?

Wait, I think all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz invariant. Because the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is an extension. So every operator in SMEFT must be a Lorentz scalar. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Well, SMEFT is a field theory, so it's a local theory, meaning it should respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model. But wait, wait. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but does every operator have to be invariant under Poincare? I think Poincare symmetry includes not just Lorentz but also translation invariance. So all operators must be translation-invariant as well. So operators would have to be local and translation invariant. Wait, but in effective theories, operators can have higher dimensions but are still local. So I think SMEFT operators are Poincare-invariant, meaning both Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So if the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators, then if Poincare is a must, then Lorentz is automatically a must as well.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if an operator must respect Poincare, then wouldn't Lorentz symmetry be included? So the question is, are all operators in SMEFT required to be Poincare-invariant? Or is it just Lorentz?

Wait, wait. Let's think about what defines a Poincare symmetry. It's the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. So if a theory respects Poincare, it must respect both. So operators in SMEFT must be Poincare invariant, which includes Lorentz. So if the question is about which symmetries must all operators respect, then if Poincare is required, Lorentz is automatically required. But in the options given, option A is 1,2 (so Lorentz and Poincare). But since Poincare includes Lorentz, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, the question is which symmetries must be respected. So if all operators must respect Poincare, then they must also respect Lorentz. So the answer can't include
