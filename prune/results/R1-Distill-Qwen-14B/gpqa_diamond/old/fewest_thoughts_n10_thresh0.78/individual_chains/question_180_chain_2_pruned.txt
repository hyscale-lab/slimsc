Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So, the elementary charge is e, right? So each has 2 times that. They also have negligible mass, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything else besides electric potential energy.

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals, in Joules. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm. So, since all the particles are identical and have the same charge, they would either all be positive or all negative. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, but I think the energy calculation would be the same regardless of the sign because the square of the charge would be positive either way.

I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C².

But since there are multiple charges, I need to calculate the total potential energy of the system. Wait, how is the potential energy calculated for a system of multiple charges? Oh right, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But wait, that can get complicated. Let me think.

Wait, in this case, the setup is that one charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, the 13th charge is at P, and the 12 are each 2 m away from P. So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P, but what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves?

I think the problem says that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but it doesn't specify anything about their arrangement among themselves. So, I'm a
