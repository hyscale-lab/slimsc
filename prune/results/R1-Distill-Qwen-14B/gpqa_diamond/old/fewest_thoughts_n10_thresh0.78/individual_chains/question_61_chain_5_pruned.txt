Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with benzene being treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, which I remember is a nitration reaction. Benzene under nitration typically gets a nitro group added. Nitration is a meta-directing group, so the nitro group should be added in the meta position. Wait, but wait, benzene is symmetric, so where does the nitro group go? Oh, right, when benzene is nitrated, you get nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next step, product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Iron and bromine usually lead to a bromination via electrophilic substitution. But wait, product 1 is nitrobenzene, which has a nitro group. Nitro is a strong meta-directing group. So where does the bromine add? It should add in the meta position relative to the nitro group. Wait, nitro is at position 1 (if we imagine benzene as a ring with substituents), then bromine would go at position 3, right? Because meta is two carbons away. So product 2 would be 3-bromonitrobenzene.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, nitration of benzene is to add a nitro group. Then, when you brominate nitrobenzene, the bromine adds in the meta position relative to the nitro group. So nitro is at position 1, bromine at position 3. So product 2 is 3-bromo-nitrobenzene? Or is it m-bromonitrobenzene.

Then product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. That's a hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So what's in product 2? It has a nitro group and a bromine. Hydrogenation of nitro group typically converts it into an amino group. Because when you hydrogenate nitrobenzene, you get aniline. So the nitro group in product 2 becomes an amino group. The bromine stays, I think. So product 3 would be 3-bromoaniline. Wait, structure-wise, benzene with amino group at one position and bromine at the meta position relative to the amino. So amino
