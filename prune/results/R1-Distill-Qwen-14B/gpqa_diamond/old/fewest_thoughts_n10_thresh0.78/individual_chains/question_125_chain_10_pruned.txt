Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let's see, it's about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I've studied a bit about harmonic oscillators before, both in one and three dimensions. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The potential given is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the form for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. Each direction (x, y, z) has the same frequency ω. So the total energy levels are built from the sum of the energies in each direction.

In one dimension, the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) ℏω, where n is the quantum number (n = 0,1,2,...). For three dimensions, if it's isotropic, each direction contributes equally, so the total energy would be E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ℏω. Oh wait, because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2), so adding them gives the 3/2 term.

But wait, another way to think about it is that the total quantum number is N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy becomes E = (N + 3/2) ℏω. That simplifies things because we can think in terms of N instead of each component. So N is a non-negative integer.

The question is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state, first excited, etc.?

The ground state is the lowest energy. That's when N = 0. Because N = n_x + n_y + n_z, the minimum is zero, so all n's are zero. So the energy is (0 + 3/2) ℏω = (3/2) ℏω.

The first excited state is N=1. The energy would be (1 + 3/2) ℏω = (5/2)ℏω.

Second excited state is N=2: E = (2 + 3/2) ℏω = (7/2)ℏω.

Third excited state is N=3: E = (3 + 3/2)ℏω = (9/2)ℏω. So the energy should be 9/2 ℏω. That would match one of the options. Looking at the options, option A and C have this energy.

Now, the second part of the question: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue? That is, the degeneracy of the third excited state.

The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the number of ways to write N = n_x + n_y + n_z where each n_i is a non-negative integer. For a given N, the number of states is (N + 2 choose 2) = ( (N+2)(N+1) ) / 2.

Wait, wait, let's think again. The number of states for a given N is (N + 2 choose 2), which is the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N.

So for N=3, the
