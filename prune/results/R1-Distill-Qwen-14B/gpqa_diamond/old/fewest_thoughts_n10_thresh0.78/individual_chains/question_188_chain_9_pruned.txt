Alright, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Okay, let's break it down.

First, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. For a cubic system, it's straightforward because all the angles are 90 degrees, but here it's rhombohedral, so all angles are equal but not 90. The given angles are alpha, beta, gamma, which are all 30 degrees. Wait, wait, no, actually, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, but in this case, they're each 30 degrees. Hmm, but wait, I thought rhombohedral usually has angles less than 90, maybe around 60 or something else. Oh well, maybe that's correct for this problem.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, waitâ€”interatomic distance? Hmm, or is that the lattice parameter 'a'? I think sometimes in crystals, the lattice parameter a is the edge length of the unit cell. But in a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, so all edges are equal, a=b=c. So the interatomic distance might be the same as 'a'? Or am I getting mixed up? Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between atoms. So in a simple cubic structure,
