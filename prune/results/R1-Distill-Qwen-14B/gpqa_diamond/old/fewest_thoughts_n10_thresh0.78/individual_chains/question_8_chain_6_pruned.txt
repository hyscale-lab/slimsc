Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

The setup is about an experiment with white lupine plants and a fungal disease called anthracnose. They did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes, G1, G2, G3. They knocked out each gene (so g1, g2, g3 mutants) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The goal is to find out which genes contribute to resistance against anthracnose.

The question states that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. So, one of them is a TF, which means it's probably regulating the expression of other genes.

The results from the pathogen tests are as follows:
- g1 resistance: 75% of control (so less resistant than wild type)
- g2: 0% (so completely susceptible)
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

So, the wild-type is 100% resistant. Lower percentages mean more susceptibility.

Hmm. Let me think about what these results could mean. When a mutant has lower resistance, it's because the gene product is missing, and that product was contributing to resistance. If a gene is a transcription factor upstream, knocking it out would disable the pathway downstream.

Looking at g2: it's completely susceptible (0%), so the wild type's resistance is entirely lost when G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G2 is critical for resistance. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other resistance genes. Because without G2, those downstream genes aren't expressed, leading to no resistance.

G3's mutant has 50% resistance. So when G3 is knocked out, the plant is half as resistant as wild type. That could mean G3 is part of a redundant pathway or maybe it's downstream of another gene.

Wait, but when you look at the double mutants, g2g3 is 0% again. If g2 alone is 0%, and g2g3 is also 0%, maybe G3 doesn't contribute anything when G2 is already knocked out. Because if G2 is a TF upstream, without G2, the downstream genes aren't working, so G3's function is irrelevant. So in the double mutant, the resistance is as bad as the single g2 mutant.

Same with g1g2: 0%, which is same as g2. So g1g2 is as bad as g2, which would suggest that G1 is only doing something when G2 is present. Because without G2, G1 doesn't matter.

What about g1g3? That's 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. So the double mutant is worse than either single. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be working in parallel pathways. Because when both are knocked out, the effect is more severe than either alone. So in the case where both are missing, the plant has less resistance than either one alone.

Wait, let me think again. If G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, then knocking out both might not make it worse than either. But if they're in parallel pathways, then knocking out both would be additive. Like, each contributes some resistance, so losing both would be worse than losing either.

But let's think about gene redundancy. If two genes are redundant, then knocking out one doesn't have much effect, but knocking out both would. So, for example, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then g1 would be similar to wild type, but g1g3 would be worse. But in our data, g1 is at 75%, which is worse than wild type, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3. So G2 activates G1 and G3. If that's the case, then knocking out G2 would stop both downstream genes, leading to maximum susceptibility.
