Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through each clue given and see what they point to.

First, the problem says they used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to identify an unknown compound. The options are all C6H something O or O2 compounds.

Starting with the FTIR data: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So this compound likely has an -OH group, like an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, a very broad peak could also be from an aromatic -OH, but that's usually around 3000 as well. But wait, let me think further. The presence of O-H would suggest either an alcohol or something like a phenol or carboxylic acid.

Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups (C=O). So that could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1650 might be another carbonyl, but that's a bit lower. Alternatively, 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution? Alternatively, it might be a C=C stretch. Wait, but wait, the NMR part says there are peaks for vinyl hydrogens, which are the H's attached to a C=C. So that implies there's a double bond in the structure.

So combining that, the presence of both a carbonyl and a vinyl group. Hmm.

Looking at the 1H NMR: peaks for vinyl hydrogens. That suggests the structure has a double bond, maybe in an ester group or something. Or perhaps a conjugated system. Also, I should consider how the NMR would look for different functional groups.

Now, the Mass Spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. What fragments give m/z 45? Well, 45 is a common fragment, perhaps something like (CH3)2O (which is 45: 12*2 +3*3 +16= 24+9+16=49? Wait, no, wait. Wait, (CH3)2O is 45. Let me calculate: Carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. (CH3)2O is C2H6O. So 2*12=24, 6*1=6, 16=16. 24+6+16=46. Hmm, that's not 45. Did I mess up? Another thought: maybe an ethyl group fragment. No, ethyl is 29. Wait, 45 could be a fragment like CH3CO, which is 45: 12+16+12+1? Wait, no. Wait, CH3CO+ is 45? Let me see, CH3CO has a molecular weight
