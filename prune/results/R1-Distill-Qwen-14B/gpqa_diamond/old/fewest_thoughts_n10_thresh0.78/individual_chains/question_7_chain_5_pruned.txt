Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang, and its photons have a certain average energy.

The problem says we need to find the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by this annihilation process. So, I think this has something to do with the photon-photon interaction, and maybe something about the mean free path or interaction probability.

Wait, the annihilation reaction is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. For this to happen, the gamma must have enough energy to produce the electron-positron pair. Right, because you need the energy to match the rest mass of the particles involved. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV each, so together it's about 1.022 MeV. But wait, the photons are massless, so their energy has to sum to at least twice the electron mass.

But wait, in the center of mass frame, the total energy must be sufficient. So maybe the condition is that the sum of the energies of the two photons is at least twice the rest mass energy of the electron. But wait, the CMB photon is much lower energy than the gamma-ray. So the gamma-ray is high energy, and the CMB photon is low energy.

Wait, the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. So, that's 1e-3 eV per photon. The gamma-ray is much higher energy. Let me think about the threshold condition for this reaction.

The threshold condition for pair production from two photons is when the combined energy in the center of mass frame is equal to twice the electron mass. So, the condition is sqrt(s) ≥ 2m_e c², where s is the square of the total four-momentum. So, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2, but since the photons are moving in opposite directions, the spatial part would subtract. Wait, but photons are massless, so E = pc for each. So for two photons moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite.

So, for the reaction to happen, the sum of their energies must be sufficient. Let me set up the equation.

The invariant s is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. Since both photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. So, the vector sum is p1 - p2. Wait, but since E = pc for each photon, the spatial part would be (p1 c) * direction1 + (p2 c) * direction2. If they're moving in opposite directions, direction2 is -direction1.

So, the spatial part becomes (p1 c - p2 c) * direction1. Then, the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2.

But because E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c, this becomes (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2. Let me expand that.

(E1 + E2)^2 = E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2².

(E1 - E2)^2 = E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2².

So, s = (E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²) - (E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²) ) = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2. And for the pair production to be possible, we need s ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2, because the center of mass energy must be sufficient to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron
