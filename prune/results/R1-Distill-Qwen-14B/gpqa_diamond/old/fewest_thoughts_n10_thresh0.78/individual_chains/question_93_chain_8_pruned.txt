Okay, so I've got this qPCR question here, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let me read it carefully and think through the steps.

So, the scenario is a scientist making a calibration curve for qPCR. He uses a positive control with known copy numbers and dilutes it in serial dilutions. He runs three technical replicates for each dilution. The efficiency is 100%, which I remember means the reaction is perfect—so each cycle doubles the target. The R² is 1, which suggests a perfect linear relationship, so the data should fit the curve really well. The slope is -3.3. Hmm, what does that mean?

The Ct values are given for each concentration. Let me list them out:

100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5
10,000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2
1,000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9
100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6
10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3

Wait, looking at the Ct values, each dilution step is a tenfold decrease, right? So from 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10x dilution, then 1,000 is another 10x, etc.

In a perfect scenario, each 10x dilution should increase the Ct by about 3.33 cycles because with 100% efficiency, each cycle doubles the DNA. So, the formula for the slope in a qPCR calibration curve is typically slope = -3.32 (because log10(2) is about 0.301, so 1/log2(10)=~3.32). So a slope of -3.3 is very close to that. So that makes sense.

Now, the question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one explains the discrepancies.

The data given shows that for each concentration, the Ct
