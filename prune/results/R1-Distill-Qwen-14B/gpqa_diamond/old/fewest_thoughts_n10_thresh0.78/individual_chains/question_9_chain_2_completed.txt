Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about molecular symmetry, specifically looking for C3H symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let me try to think this through.

Wait, what's C3H symmetry again? Oh right, C3H means that the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis that also inverts the molecule. Oh wait, no, I'm confusing things. C3H is actually a type of symmetry where the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's a combination of rotation and reflection? Or maybe it's just the rotational symmetry without inversion. I need to clarify.

Wait, no. I think C3H symmetry refers to the molecule having a three-fold axis of rotation. So, if you rotate it by 120 degrees, it looks the same. But more accurately, the notation can sometimes be a bit tricky. Wait, I'm getting confused between C3 and C3H. Oh right, the 'H' in C3H refers to the Hermann-Mauguin symbol, which includes both rotation and point groups. Wait, I think C3H is the same as the point group D3h. Because D3h has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Or maybe it's C3 with some other elements. Hmm, maybe I should double-check the point groups.

But perhaps I can approach this by looking at each molecule's structure and their symmetry.

The question gives four options: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[... ]trifuran, and another triphenyleno [...] trifuran.

So, I'll need to figure out each molecule's symmetry.

Starting with the first one: triisopropyl borate. Its structure is (i-Pr)3BO, right? So, it's a trigonal planar structure around the boron. Wait, no, the borate is a trigonal planar molecule, but each isopropyl group is attached to the boron. So, each substituent is an isopropyl group. So the molecule looks like three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron. So, the symmetry here: if all three substituents are the same, the molecule should have a high degree of symmetry. The central boron is trigonal, so maybe the molecule has a C3 symmetry. Because rotating 120 degrees would map each isopropyl onto the others, making the molecule look the same. So, this molecule would have C3 symmetry, but does it have C3H symmetry? Wait, if the molecule has a mirror plane, then perhaps it's higher symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps it's just C3 without inversion.

Wait, but what's the point group for triisopropyl borate? I think it's D3h, but maybe that's when all the substituents are the same and it has a center of inversion. Alternatively, without a center of inversion, maybe it's just C3v. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to move to the next molecule and compare.

Next up: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, right? It has a bridge, so it's a norbornane-like structure but with a nitrogen. The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with an amine. So, the molecule has a three-fold axis. Wait, the bridgehead is in the center, and the molecule is symmetric. So quinuclidine's symmetry: it has a C3 axis because if you rotate it 120 degrees, the structure remains the same. Does it have a mirror plane? I think so. Let me visualize it. The molecule has planes of symmetry. So in terms of point group, maybe D3h again. Because it's got a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but the point group of quinuclidine is actually D3h. So that would mean it has C3H symmetry, which is the same as D3h, right? So if the question is about C3H symmetry, quinuclidine might be a candidate.

Third option: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. That's a bit of a mouthful. Let me parse the name. It's a tricyclic compound with three furan rings? Or maybe it's a fused ring system. Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where benzo rings are fused with furan rings in a particular way. The numbering suggests that it's a hexaone, so ketone groups at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9. Hmm, not sure. Let me think about symmetry. If the molecule has multiple rings arranged symmetrically, perhaps it has a three-fold axis.

Wait, maybe I should think about the core structure. Trifuran suggests three furan rings. If it's a tricyclic system with three fused furan rings, perhaps in a symmetric arrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a structure where three furan moieties are arranged around a central point, each with a ketone group.

But without the exact structure, it's a bit tough. But perhaps the key is that if the molecule is symmetric enough to have three-fold rotation. Alternatively, maybe the way the rings are fused allows for three-fold symmetry.

The fourth option is triphenyleno[...]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Hmm, that sounds like a more complex structure. Triphenylene suggests three benzene rings connected in some way. The 'trifuran' part indicates three furan rings. So it's a tricyclic system, perhaps with three benzene rings and three furan rings fused together. The numbering suggests ketone groups at specific positions.

But again, without the exact structure, it's hard to say. But perhaps the molecule has a higher symmetry than others, maybe with a three-fold axis.

Wait, let's go back. The question is which molecule has C3H symmetry. So, which of these options has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (i.e., D3h symmetry)?

Triisopropyl borate: three identical substituents around a central atom. So, the molecule is symmetric. If all three substituents are the same, then it has a three-fold axis. But does it have a mirror plane? Yes, because in the trigonal planar structure, each substituent is in a plane, so there are multiple mirror planes. Wait, trigonal planar is actually D3h symmetry. So triisopropyl borate would have D3h symmetry, which is C3H. So that's a candidate.

Quinuclidine: same point group, D3h. So it would also have C3H symmetry.

So now I'm a bit stuck because both triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine have D3h symmetry. But looking back at the options, the choices are A, B, C, D.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is triisopropyl borate, and D is quinuclidine.

Wait, but the question is about which molecule has C3H symmetry. So both could have that. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, in some molecules, the presence of substituents can lower the symmetry. For example, if a molecule has a three-fold axis but lacks a mirror plane, it would be C3, not D3h. So perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have a mirror plane? Or maybe it does.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure: it has a central nitrogen, with three bridges around it. So, in the chair-like structure, if you imagine rotating 120 degrees, the substituents (like the hydrogen atoms) would move into each other's positions. So, yes, a three-fold axis. And mirror planes as well. So D3h symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate: each isopropyl group is identical. So trigonal planar structure, which is D3h. So it's got three-fold rotation and mirror planes.

So both have C3H symmetry, but the options give them as options C and D.

Wait, but the question is to choose which one. Hmm, perhaps I'm mistaken about one of them.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure: does it have a center of inversion? Because D3h includes a horizontal mirror plane, but not necessarily a center of inversion. Or is it the other way around? Wait, the point group D3h has a three-fold rotation axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and a center of inversion. Wait, no: D3h is a subgroup of the cubic groups. Let me think.

Wait, D3h has a three-fold axis (C3), a horizontal mirror plane (ﾏド), and a two-fold axis perpendicular to the C3 axis. Alternatively, maybe it's that the point group has multiple symmetry elements. So, it's possible that quinuclidine and triisopropyl borate both belong to D3h.

So if both have C3H symmetry, then both are correct, but looking at the options, the question might be tricky. Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation, regardless of other symmetry elements. So perhaps all that's needed is C3, not necessarily the full D3h.

Wait, the question says "has C3H symmetry". So perhaps the answer is any molecule with three-fold rotational symmetry and mirror planes, which is D3h.

But the options are A, B, C, D, so I need to pick which one.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of them actually has a three-fold axis.

Wait, another approach: think about the structures.

Triisopropyl borate: each isopropyl is attached to a central boron. The molecule is symmetric in three directions, so yes, three-fold rotation.

Quinuclidine: the molecule has a three-fold axis because when you look down the axis passing through the nitrogen and the center of the bridge, each of the three bridges is equivalent. So rotating 120 degrees would swap the positions of the bridges, but the molecule would look the same.

So both have a three-fold axis.

Wait, but perhaps the triphenyleno... one is a more complex structure. Maybe it's not symmetric. Or perhaps I should think about the other options.

Looking at the other options, option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. That's another fused ring system. If the rings are arranged in a way that each is connected symmetrically, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a triphenylene fused with a trifuran system. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure, but with three benzene rings. If the benzene rings are arranged symmetrically, then perhaps the molecule as a whole has three-fold symmetry.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about each option:

Option A: triphenyleno...trifuran. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure. If the three benzene rings are arranged in a symmetric way (like a triangle), then perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis. But if the trifuran part is attached in a way that disrupts this symmetry, perhaps not. Alternatively, if the trifuran part is connected in a symmetric way, the whole molecule would have three-fold symmetry.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran. If it's a similar structure, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold symmetry. But again, without the exact structure, it's hard to tell.

But since the options are given as A, B, C, D, and the question is which has C3H symmetry, the likely candidates are C and D. Because the other structures (A and B) are more complex and the symmetry isn't as obvious.

So, between C) triisopropyl borate and D) quinuclidine.

Now, I remember that quinuclidine has a three-fold axis. Let me think: quinuclidine has a bicyclo structure with three bridges. The structure is symmetric with a three-fold axis. So yes, it has C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I think it does, making it D3h.

Triisopropyl borate: the molecule is trigonal planar, so it has a three-fold axis and multiple mirror planes, hence D3h symmetry.

So both have C3H symmetry, but the options are C and D as the choices. So how to decide which is the correct answer.

Wait, maybe the question is about whether the molecule has a center of inversion. For instance, does C3H imply that?

Wait, the Hermann-Mauguin symbol C3H refers to a screw axis, but maybe that's not what the question is about. Alternatively, perhaps the 'H' in C3H refers to the presence of a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about whether the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation only (C3) or higher symmetry. If the question were about whether it has C3 symmetry, then both C and D would be correct. But the question is about C3H symmetry, which is a point group (like D3h) that includes more symmetry elements.

So, perhaps triisopropyl borate is in a trigonal planar structure, which is point group D3h. Quinuclidine is also D3h. So both have C3H symmetry.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question lists four options, with C as triisopropyl borate and D as quinuclidine. So, how to choose between them. Maybe I should think if one of them doesn't have that symmetry.

Wait, perhaps quinuclidine is actually in a different point group. Let me think again. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The structure has a bridge, so when you look along the three-fold axis, you can see the three identical bridge structures. So rotation by 120 degrees would leave the molecule unchanged. So, yes, C3 symmetry. Does it have a mirror plane? Yes, if you imagine a plane that cuts through the nitrogen and the center of each bridge, that would be a mirror plane. So, yes, D3h symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate: The boron is trigonal planar, so the point group is D3h. So both have D3h symmetry. But the options are C and D, so perhaps the answer is both C and D are correct, but that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe only one of them has a three-fold axis. Let me think again. Triisopropyl borate: each isopropyl is identical, so the molecule looks the same after 120 rotation. Quinuclidine: same thing.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which molecule has a center of inversion. Because D3h includes a center of inversion, but another point group like C3v doesn't.

Wait, triisopropyl borate: if you invert the molecule, the boron would go to the center, but each isopropyl group would invert as well. Since each isopropyl is symmetric upon inversion, the molecule would look the same. So yes, it has a center of inversion.

Quinuclidine: if you invert through the center, you swap the positions of the hydrogen atoms and the substituents. Wait, quinuclidine is a secondary amine. It has a bridge structure. So, the central nitrogen is in a position that upon inversion, the structure remains the same. So yes, a center of inversion. So both have D3h symmetry.

But then why would the options include both C and D? Because the question must have only one correct answer. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the 'H' in C3H refers to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually about whether the molecule has an inversion axis, or perhaps it's about the presence of a three-fold axis without inversion.

Alternatively, perhaps the term C3H is a typo, and it's actually referring to C3V symmetry. But the question says C3H.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for which of these molecules actually has three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

I think both triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine have that, so perhaps the answer is either C or D.

But the options are:

A) triphenyleno...

B) benzo...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, the correct answer must be either C or D.

Wait, perhaps another way to think: the question is which of the following molecules has C3H symmetry. So, which of these four has C3H.

Another approach: find which of the options is a known example of a molecule with C3H symmetry.

I think triisopropyl borate is a classic example of a molecule with D3h symmetry, which is C3H. Quinuclidine is also D3h.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I don't recall the exact point groups for some of these. Alternatively, perhaps one of these molecules is known for having a specific symmetry.

Wait, quinuclidine is known to have a three-fold axis and a center of inversion, so D3h symmetry. Similarly, triisopropyl borate has trigonal symmetry, which is D3h.

Hmm, but both have D3h symmetry. So why is the question structured this way?

Wait, perhaps the other options are not correct, but among the four, two are correct. But the options are A, B, C, D, so the answer must be one of them.

Wait, perhaps only one of them is correct, and the others don't. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Let me think about each option again.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. It's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So yes, D3h.

Option D: quinuclidine. It's a bicyclic molecule with a three-fold axis. So yes, D3h.

So, both C and D are correct. But the options only allow one correct choice. Therefore, perhaps the question is mistaken, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps one of them doesn't have a center of inversion. Let me think.

Triisopropyl borate: each isopropyl group has a methyl group attached. If you invert the molecule, the boron goes to the center, and each isopropyl group inverts. Since each isopropyl is symmetric upon inversion (as it's a CH(CH3)2 group), the molecule remains the same. So yes, a center of inversion.

Quinuclidine: the molecule has a bridge, so inverting across the central nitrogen would swap the bridge positions. But since all bridges are identical, the molecule would look the same. So yes, center of inversion.

Hmm. So both have D3h symmetry. Then why are they both options? The question must have a mistake, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) without a mirror plane. So, maybe the molecule has C3 but not D3h.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate only has C3 symmetry and no mirror plane. But that doesn't make sense because trigonal planar structures have multiple mirror planes.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fusion of rings in some of the other options provides a three-fold symmetry. Like, for example, option A is triphenyleno... That's a triphenylene (three fused benzene rings) attached to a trifuran. Triphenylene itself is a symmetric molecule with a three-fold axis. So when you attach trifuran in a symmetric way, the entire molecule would retain that symmetry.

Wait, triphenylene is a structure where three benzene rings are fused in a symmetric arrangement, which gives it a three-fold axis. So if the trifuran is attached in three symmetric positions, the entire molecule would have C3H symmetry.

So, perhaps option A also has C3H symmetry. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A.

Wait, but without a clear understanding, I think the most likely answer is that either C or D is correct. But the options are given as A, B, C, D, with the question being which has C3H symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the other options have C3H symmetry, and only one of the options does.

Wait, perhaps the others (A and B) are more complex and don't have the symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possibility that triphenyleno...trifuran (option A) has a more symmetric structure, such as a three-fold axis.

Wait, considering that, the correct answer could be A.

But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the problem is about the presence of a three-membered ring, which would have a three-fold axis. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another idea: C3H symmetry could refer to a three-fold axis with a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis and at least one horizontal mirror plane. So, both triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine have that.

But the options are C and D, so maybe the correct answer is both, but since the options don't allow that, perhaps the question is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the question is intended to have only one correct answer, so perhaps I should focus on which of them is more likely.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D) quinuclidine, because it's a more commonly known example of a molecule with three-fold symmetry.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A or C.

Wait, another approach: think of the number of symmetry elements.

Triisopropyl borate: trigonal planar, so D3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: D3h symmetry.

So both would have C3H.

But the options only have one correct choice.

Wait, perhaps the key is that triisopropyl borate has a different point group. Let me check: for trigonal planar molecules, the point group is D3h. So both have that.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C: triisopropyl borate.

But I'm still not fully confident.

After all this thinking, I think the correct answer is D) quinuclidine. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's C) triisopropyl borate.

Wait, perhaps triisopropyl borate is a better example because it's a simple molecule with clear symmetry.

But I'm a bit stuck. I'll have to make a decision.


To determine which molecule has **C3H symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C3H symmetry** corresponds to the point group **D3h**, which includes a three-fold rotational axis (C3), a horizontal mirror plane (ﾏド), and a center of inversion. Below is the analysis of each option:

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
This molecule consists of a triphenylene core (three fused benzene rings) attached to a trifuran system. The triphenylene core is symmetric, with a three-fold axis of rotation. If the trifuran system is attached symmetrically, the entire molecule could retain **D3h** symmetry. However, the exact structure is complex, and the symmetry depends on how the trifuran is fused. Without more details, it is unclear if this molecule has **C3H symmetry**.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system with ketone groups at specific positions. The symmetry depends on the arrangement of the fused rings and substituents. While the benzo-fused system may have some symmetry, it is unlikely to have a three-fold axis or a horizontal mirror plane, making **C3H symmetry** improbable.

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure around the boron atom, with three identical isopropyl groups attached. This molecule has a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and multiple mirror planes, including a horizontal mirror plane (ﾏド). It also has a center of inversion. Therefore, it belongs to the **D3h** point group, which corresponds to **C3H symmetry**.

### Option D: Quinuclidine
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a nitrogen atom at the bridgehead. It has a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (ﾏド). Additionally, it has a center of inversion. Thus, quinuclidine also belongs to the **D3h** point group, which corresponds to **C3H symmetry**.

### Conclusion
Both **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) and **quinuclidine** (Option D) have **C3H symmetry**. However, since the question requires selecting only one correct answer, **quinuclidine** is often cited as a classic example of a molecule with **D3h symmetry**, making it the most appropriate choice.

**Answer: D**
