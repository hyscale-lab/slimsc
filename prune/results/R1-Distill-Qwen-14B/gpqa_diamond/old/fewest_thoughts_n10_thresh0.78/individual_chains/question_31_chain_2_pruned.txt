Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with toluene. So, first, I need to figure out what each step does and what the resulting compounds are. Then, I have to determine the molecular symmetry group of the final product, product 3.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction.

First step: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. Hmm, I remember that nitration usually happens when nitric acid is used, often with a sulfuric acid catalyst. Toluene is an aromatic compound with a methyl group attached to benzene. Nitration of toluene would typically add a nitro group. Where does it go? Toluene is methylbenzene, and the nitration is a meta-directing group. Wait, no, toluene is activating, so the nitro group, which is a strong deactivating group, would go into the meta position relative to the methyl group. Wait, wait, no, wait. Actually, when you nitrate toluene, the methyl group is an activating group, so the nitration occurs at the para position more predominantly, right? Or is it the meta? Oh wait, toluene has a methyl group which is ortho/para directing. So the nitration would occur either at the ortho, para, or meta positions. Wait no, the methyl is ortho/para directing, so the nitration adds the nitro group either ortho or para to the methyl. But actually, in nitration, the major product is the para isomer because of steric hindrance. So product 1 is likely para-nitrotoluene.

So product 1 is 4-nitrophenyl methyl, I think, or more accurately, para-nitrotoluene.

Second step: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. In acidic conditions, I think it's used for oxidizing methyl groups attached to benzene rings. So considering that product 1 has a methyl group attached to the benzene ring which is already substituted with a nitro group. Wait, no, product 1 has a nitro group attached. Wait, toluene is methylbenzene, so product 1
