Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by breaking down the question step by step.

The first part is about 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH would likely lead to the formation of an alkene. Because of the structure of adamantane, which is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, the product would probably be an adamantyl compound with a double bond. 

Looking at the NMR data given for product 1: a singlet at 4.79 ppm integrating for 2H. That's a strong indication of an -OCH2- group, perhaps part of an ether. Wait, but KOH is a base and a strong nucleophile. Oh, wait! If it's elimination, then maybe it's forming an epoxide? No, wait, no. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an E2 elimination forming an alkene, but then why the singlet at 4.79? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another reaction comes to mind. Heating dihalides with a base can also lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. But the NMR doesn't show any triplets or other patterns that would suggest a vinyl group. Alternatively, if it's a substitution reaction. Wait, KOH is a strong base, but in a less polar solvent, it would favor elimination. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons, so when KOH is added, it might eliminate to form an alkene. But what's the product structure?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the two bromides are replaced by something else. Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. That makes me think it's an epoxide. Because epoxides are typically light-colored, maybe even yellowish. So when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps the bromides are replaced by an oxygen, forming an epoxide. Wait, but how does that work? Epoxidation usually involves an peracid or something, but KOH is a strong base. Oh, wait, maybe it's a Williamson-type reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (singlet, 2H) could be an -OCH2- group. Wait, but if it's part of an epoxide, the protons on the epoxide oxygen would typically be around 3-4 ppm and might be split into a triplet or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether. Let me think, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, perhaps it forms an oxide. Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination to form a diene? But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a characteristic region for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc. So maybe product 1 contains a carbonyl group. But how does that fit with the starting material?

Wait, wait, when dihalides react with a strong base like KOH, sometimes dehydrohalogenation can form alkenes. But in this case, the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where both bromides are replaced by hydroxyl groups. But that would give a diol, and the IR would show O-H stretches around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹, but the question says the IR has a peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl, so maybe it's an oxidation product.

Wait a minute, another possibility: maybe the dihalide undergoes a nucleophilic substitution with OH- to form a diol. But then why the IR peak at 1720? Unless the diol is oxidized further. Wait, but the first step is only heating with KOH—it's a base, so maybe it's elimination. Maybe elimination of two HBr to form an alkene, but that would not introduce a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a base and undergoes a different type of elimination, like forming a ketone. Wait, but how? Oh! Maybe the 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base, leading to the formation of an enolate, which could then tautomerize or something. But I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution where one bromide is replaced by something else. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. Maybe it's a dialkoxide? Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet of 2H. That might indicate that those two hydrogens are equivalent and not split by any neighboring protons. Let's think about an epoxide: the two protons on the oxygen in an epoxide are typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm, and they are split into a triplet if the adjacent carbons have two equivalent protons each. But in the NMR, the 4.79 is a singlet, so perhaps that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a ketone. So the product is a ketone, which would have a carbonyl group (hence the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹). But the NMR doesn't show any carbonyl protons because they are probably absent or in a region not observed here.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (singlet, 2H) could be a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. If it's a ketone, maybe that's part of the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but that would have a broad peak in the NMR, unless it's an ether.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is forming an epoxide, but I'm not seeing the NMR matching that. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution with an oxygen nucleophile.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the dihalide is converted into a diol via substitution, but then the diol is oxidized to a diketone. But the first step is only heating with KOH. So it's probably not oxidation. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the formation of an oxide. For example, if the dihalide loses HBr, perhaps the two carbons where the bromines were form an oxide bridge, creating a cyclic ether. Oh, wait! So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, each from adjacent carbons, perhaps the two carbons bridge with an oxygen, forming a cyclic ether. So the product would be an epoxide, but in the adamantane structure. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When KOH is added, perhaps the two bromides are replaced by an oxygen bridge, making a diepoxide? No, that doesn't make sense since it's 1,3 positions. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming a single epoxide ring.

Wait, but the NMR for product 1 shows a 4.79 ppm peak as a singlet. If it's an epoxide, the protons on the oxygen would typically be a triplet, but in this case, it's a singlet. So perhaps it's not an epoxide.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. Let's imagine that 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, forms a ketone. Wait, but how? Maybe via elimination of two HBr and forming a double bond, which then gets oxidized? But the question states that the product is formed by heating with KOH, without any mention of an oxidizing agent. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution where the two bromides are replaced by a single oxygen, making a ketone. For example, if the two adjacent carbons each lose a Br and form a carbonyl group. But for that, we'd need each carbon to lose Br and form a double bond to oxygen, but that seems unlikely with KOH.

Alternatively, perhaps it's forming a geminal diol. But that would require each carbon to have two OH groups, which would lead to a lot of hydrogen bonding and perhaps broad NMR peaks.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR again. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet, 2H. The other peaks are 2.41-2.23 (10H), which could be from the adamantane structure, perhaps as CH2 or CH groups. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group. The singlet at 4.79 could be an -OCH2- group. But in what structure would that be?

Wait, if the product is an ether. Maybe it's an epoxide, but as I thought earlier, the protons in an epoxide are usually not a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's a secondary or tertiary alcohol. Wait, but then we'd expect OH protons, which would appear broad in the NMR and in the 1-5 ppm region.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone where the carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. But then the carbonyl wouldn't have protons, so the 4.79 ppm peak would be something else.

Wait, maybe the product is a gem-diol, but that would require two OH groups on the same carbon. But that's not the case here.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about product 1's structure. It has a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H). Maybe it's an acetate group? No, because then the carbonyl would be around 170 ppm in the NMR, but the IR is 1720, which is in the carbonyl region. So perhaps it's a ketone, but where?

Wait, another approach: the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is probably a carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. So maybe it's a ketone. Now, considering the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a bridged bicyclic compound. If the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, perhaps the elimination of two HBr molecules forms a double bond, and then some further reaction occurs? Or perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, wait. Maybe the dihalide undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice to form a diene, but that wouldn't introduce a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a dielimination to form a conjugated diene, but that still doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Alternatively, could the reaction be a nucleophilic substitution where the two Br atoms are replaced by hydroxide groups, forming a diol, which then loses water to form a carbonyl? But that would require more than just KOH. Unless it's under strong basic conditions and some dehydration occurs. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. So perhaps the initial reaction is the substitution of Br with OH, forming a diol. But then, under strong base conditions, the diol could lose water to form a ketone or an aldehyde.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane substitution would give 1,3-diol. But then, dehydration would require the removal of an -OH from each adjacent carbon, leading to a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol undergoes oxidation, but again, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is an epoxide. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a base, it could form an epoxide. Epoxides have a strained three-membered ring, which can be opened under basic conditions. But in this case, the product is formed by heating with KOH, so perhaps the epoxide is formed, but then what? 

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is converted into a ketone via a different mechanism. Wait, perhaps elimination and then some kind of rearrangement forms a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where one Br is replaced by an oxygen group and the other stays, but that doesn't seem to fit with the data.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is an ester or a carbonate. But the IR at 1720 could fit an ester carbonyl. But then, how would that form from a dihalide and KOH?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an -O- group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would become a 1,3-dioxygenated adamantane. But then, the structure would have two oxygen atoms, perhaps forming an oxide bridge. That might give a 1,3-dioxane structure within the adamantane framework. But the NMR would show certain signals. The 4.79 ppm could be the two CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen. Wait, 1,3-dioxane would have oxygen atoms in a six-membered ring, but in adamantane, the positions are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone. For example, if two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr and form a carbonyl. Wait, but two adjacent carbons can’t both form a carbonyl unless it's a conjugated system.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure of product 1. Let me try to think about the next steps because maybe that can help.

The second step is heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. I'm trying to remember what reactions occur when a compound is treated with Al(i-Pr)O. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a solid, which perhaps is a carbonyl compound. So if product 1 is a ketone, then in the presence of Al isopropoxide, maybe it undergoes some kind of alkylation or acylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, where the ketone acts as the acylating agent.

Wait, but product 1 is 1,3-dibromoadamantane-derived. If it's a ketone, perhaps it's adamantanone. Then, in the presence of Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation. Wait, but adamantanone is already a ketone; Friedel-Crafts would require an aromatic ring to acylate onto.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diethyl ether or another type of ether. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a carbonyl compound, like a ketone. Let's say it's adamantanone. Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of cyclization or forms an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard reaction, but I don't think so because Al isopropoxide isn't a Grignard reagent.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and Al isopropoxide catalyzes ring-opening. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the third step: product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide is added to form product 3. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond because ozonolysis acts on alkenes.

So, product 2 must have an alkene. That suggests that product 1 must have a group that, when treated with Al isopropoxide, forms an alkene.

Wait, putting it all together:

Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid)
IR: 1720 cm-¹ → carbonyl
NMR: 4.79 (singlet, 2H), etc.

Reaction 2: product 1 + Al isopropoxide → product 2 (alkene)
Reaction 3: product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3.

So, product 2 is an alkene. So, step 2 must form an alkene.

So, product 1 probably has a carbonyl group (from the IR), which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, may undergo some kind of elimination to form an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 undergoes a rearrangement when treated with Al isopropoxide.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is an ester. Then, with Al isopropoxide, it could undergo a Claisen condensation or some kind of elimination to form an alkene. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes a pinacol rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement involves the base-catalyzed dehydration of a 1,2-diol (pinacol) to a ketone. But I'm not sure if Al isopropoxide is a base for that.

Wait, or maybe product 1 is a diol. Then, under certain conditions, it could form a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a geminal dihalide, but that doesn't fit with the starting material.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. Then, treatment with Al isopropoxide might facilitate some kind of conjugate addition or elimination, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol. But without an IR peak for O-H, that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a secondary or tertiary alcohol. But the IR doesn't show a broad peak, which would be expected for OH. So perhaps it's not an alcohol.

Wait, another angle: the NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet). Let's think about the possible groups. An OCH2O group (like in a cyclic ether) might have that. For example, a dioxolane or dioxane ring. But I don't see how that would form from the dihalide and KOH.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. So maybe it's part of an ester or ketone.

Wait, if product 1 has a carbonyl group and an OCH2 group, perhaps it's an acetal or ketal. But then, the IR would have a peak for the carbonyl, which is the case here. Acetals typically don't have strong carbonyl peaks because the carbonyl is converted into an ether. Wait, but the IR here is 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone, not an acetal.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on product 1. Let me try to think about the possible structures.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, perhaps adamantanone. Then, reaction with Al isopropoxide could lead to some kind of alkylation. Wait, but without a nucleophile, that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Let's imagine it's something like CH2COOEt. Then, treatment with Al isopropoxide might lead to a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires an aromatic ring. But product 1 doesn't have an aromatic ring.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone. For example, if the elimination leads to the formation of a five-membered ring ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diethyl ether, but where would the ethyl groups come from? The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used. No, I don't think that's it.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but as I thought earlier, the NMR doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides react with strong bases, sometimes they form alkenes via elimination. But if product 1 has a carbonyl, perhaps it's an oxidation product. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. So perhaps the initial step is elimination to form an alkene, but then another reaction occurs.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is elimination to form an alkene, and then some oxidation occurs. Wait, but the problem states that product 1 is formed directly by heating with KOH, so oxidation might not be part of that step.

Wait, maybe the product is a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the IR peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR peak is from a carbonyl group in an ester. So maybe product 1 is an ester formed via a substitution reaction. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate. But I don't think KOH would form that from a dihalide.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is converted into a ketone via a two-step elimination. For example, each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the two adjacent carbons each lose a hydrogen and form a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which upon heating with KOH, eliminates two HBr molecules and forms an allene (a conjugated diene), but that doesn't explain the IR peak.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination forms a cyclic ketone. For example, if two adjacent CH2Br groups lose two HBr, and the two carbons form a carbonyl group each. But that would require each carbon to lose Br and form a carbonyl, which I don't think is possible.

Wait, perhaps it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. But that typically involves carbocation shifts, and I don't think KOH would facilitate that in this context.

Hmm. I'm really stuck on this. Let me try to think of product 1 as a ketone, say, 1-adamantanone. Then, product 2 is formed by treating this ketone with Al isopropoxide. What reaction could occur?

Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst. In the context of a ketone, perhaps it facilitates the formation of an enol. But I don't see how that would form an alkene, which product 2 must have because of the ozonolysis step.

Wait, another possibility: if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, then treatment with Al isopropoxide could lead to a ring-opening or some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the ketone undergoes aldol condensation, but that usually requires another carbonyl compound.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol, which under Al isopropoxide, undergoes elimination to form an alkene. But then, the initial product (product 1) would have to be an alcohol, but the IR doesn't show O-H stretch.

Wait, but if product 1 is a tertiary alcohol, the O-H stretch might be weak or absent. But then, how would product 1 form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? Maybe through substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a geminal diol, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, loses water to form a carbonyl and an alkene.

Wait, but I'm getting into more confusion. Let me try to approach this differently.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720, NMR shows 4.79 ppm singlet).
Step 2: product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2 (alkene, as ozonolysis in step 3 suggests).
Step 3: product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3.

So, in step 2, product 1 is converted into an alkene, product 2. Then, ozonolysis breaks that alkene into carbonyl groups in product 3.

So, focusing on step 2: what reaction could convert product 1 into an alkene?

If product 1 is a ketone, maybe it undergoes a elimination reaction to form an alkene. But what catalyst would facilitate that?

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Then, under the influence of Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, the diol could undergo oxidation or elimination. Wait, but without an oxidizing agent, it's more likely elimination.

Wait, if product 1 is a diol, then heating with Al isopropoxide could cause the diol to lose water and form an alkene. That would fit with the product 2 being an alkene.

So, putting it together:

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → vicinal diol (product 1)
Step 2: diol + Al(i-Pr)3 → elimination to form alkene (product 2)
Step 3: ozonolysis of alkene → di-ketone or similar (product 3)

But wait, the initial step's NMR and IR need to fit. So, if product 1 is a vicinal diol, the IR would show broad O-H peaks, but the given IR is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more like a carbonyl. So, this doesn't fit.

So, maybe product 1 is a ketone. Then, step 2 would involve some kind of elimination to form an alkene. So, perhaps product 1 is a ketone adjacent to a CH2 group. Then, the ketone could undergo some kind of elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a hemiacetal. But then, the IR would show a peak around 1720 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl, but the hemiacetal would have an OH group. But the NMR doesn't show a broad peak, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, product 1 could be an acetal, but that would require the absence of a carbonyl peak, which contradicts the IR data.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a gem-dialkyl ketone. But I don't think that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent oxygen-containing group, like an ether or ester.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Then, the Al isopropoxide could cause it to undergo some kind of ring-opening or elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, which could then undergo a condensation reaction to form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, then treatment with Al isopropoxide could lead to a conjugate elimination, forming an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, which would be an alkene.

Wait, that makes sense. So, product 1 is a diketone. When treated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, it could facilitate a conjugate elimination, forming an alkene.

So, in step 2, product 1 (diketone) reacts with Al isopropoxide to form product 2, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (an enone).

Then, in step 3, ozonolysis of the double bond in product 2 would break the molecule into two carbonyl groups, perhaps ketones or aldehydes, depending on the substituents.

Now, let's think about product 3's NMR. The question is, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding those that exchange with D2O.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each resulting fragment will have a carbonyl group. If the starting alkene was symmetric, the fragments would be the same, but if not, they could be different.

The most deshielded hydrogen would typically be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl.

In an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. For example, if the structure was (CH2)C=CH(CO), ozonolysis would give two ketones or aldehydes.

But let's think about the coupling pattern.

Wait, ozonolysis of an alkene typically forms carbonyl compounds. The resulting carbonyls would have adjacent hydrogens if possible. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH2, ozonolysis would form two formaldehyde molecules. But in a more complex structure, say, (CH2)2C=CH2, ozonolysis would give a ketone and an aldehyde.

But in our case, product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So, perhaps the structure is something like (CH2)nC=CHCOCH2... ?

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis, each carbonyl group is adjacent to some CH2 groups. The most deshielded hydrogen would be near the carbonyl, possibly as a CH2 group next to it.

The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring hydrogens. If a hydrogen is next to a CH2 group, it would couple with the two hydrogens on that group. Each of those two would be split into a triplet. But wait, if a hydrogen is next to a CH2 group, which is itself next to another CH2 group, it would have coupling with each.

Alternatively, let's think of a specific example. Suppose after ozonolysis, product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl group. The hydrogens on that CH2 would be split by the neighboring groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. But that's a symmetric structure, so the middle CH2 groups would have equivalent hydrogens.

But if the structure is asymmetric, perhaps the coupling is more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group that's also next to a carbonyl.

Wait, another scenario: the ozonolysis breaks the double bond into two carbonyl groups, each followed by a CH2 group. So, the structure might be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. But in that case, the CH2 groups in the middle would have two neighboring CH2 groups, leading to more splitting.

Wait, but in the example I just thought of, the middle CH2 would be between two CH2 groups. Each of the middle CH2 hydrogens would be adjacent to two CH2 groups on either side. Each of those groups has two hydrogens, so each middle H would have coupling with two neighboring groups, each of which is a triplet.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the splitting pattern.

If a hydrogen is next to a CH2 group (with two H), it would split into a triplet. But if that CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each of those H would split into further triplets. So, the overall splitting would be more complex.

Wait, suppose we have a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. That CH2 is also next to another CH2 group. So, each H on the first CH2 would be coupled with the two H on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would be a triplet. But wait, each of those two H on the adjacent CH2 are themselves split by their own neighboring groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of vicinal coupling. Let's consider a structure like:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O

The central CH2 group is between two CH2 groups. Each H on the central CH2 would be coupled with the two H on each adjacent CH2. So, each H would have two sets of coupling: one from the left CH2 and one from the right CH2.

But each coupling would be J coupling, which is typically around 7-8 Hz for vicinal H.

Wait, but if a H is coupled with two different sets of H, how does that affect the splitting?

Each coupling would cause the splitting. So, if a H is coupled with two sets of H, each with a different J, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets. But if the two J values are similar, it might appear as a triplet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group. So, each H would be split by the two H on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But also, perhaps each of these H is split by another set of H from another adjacent group, leading to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the H is next to a CH group, but that's less likely if the structure is symmetric.

Wait, but the question says the most deshielded H (excluding those that exchange). So, perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group. So, each H on this CH2 would couple with the two H on the adjacent CH2. Each coupling would be a triplet, but when two triplets combine, it becomes a triplet of triplets. Or perhaps it's a doublet of triplets, etc.

Wait, the splitting depends on how many neighboring H each H is coupled with. For example, each H in a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group (with two H each) would have a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. But if that CH2 is also adjacent to another group, like another CH2, then each H would have coupling with two different sets of H.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group between two other CH2 groups. So, each H would have coupling with four H in total: two on each adjacent CH2. Each coupling would split the peak into a triplet, but the combination could lead to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2 group which is adjacent to another CH2 group. So, the H would be split by two different CH2 groups, each with two H. So, the splitting would be a triplet from the first CH2 and another triplet from the second CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the options again.

Options are: triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

If the H is coupled with two H on one side and another two H on the other, that's four H in total. But each coupling is with a pair, leading to triplet splits. So, each coupling would cause a triplet, and the combination would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but wait. Each H in the CH2 group is coupled with the two H on the adjacent CH2 group. That causes a triplet. If that CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group, each H is also coupled with those two H, leading to another triplet. So, the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplet, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets if the coupling constants are different. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, another possibility: if the H is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to a CH group, which is itself adjacent to another CH2 group, the splitting could be more complex.

But I'm not entirely certain. Based on the options, the most likely coupling pattern for a H adjacent to two different sets of two H each would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

However, I think I might be missing something. Let me think again about the ozonolysis product.

If product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, like (CH2)nC=CHCOCH2..., then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. For example, the structure could be something like:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O

But I'm not sure about the exact structure. Alternatively, it could be a ring structure. But regardless, the resulting product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. The most deshielded H would be near a carbonyl, on a CH2 group. 

In that case, the adjacent groups would determine the splitting. If each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, then each H would be coupled with two H on each side, leading to a triplet for each coupling, and thus a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting is more like a pentet if coupled with four H. But four H would imply a quartet.

Wait, another angle. Suppose the structure after ozonolysis is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group. So, each H on the middle CH2 would be coupled with two H from each adjacent CH2. So, each H would be split into a triplet by each adjacent CH2, leading to two triplets. The combination would be a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the H is coupled with three H, leading to a quartet, but that would require a CH2 adjacent to a CH3, which I don't think is the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2 group, which is itself adjacent to a CH group. But this is getting too speculative.

Given the options, and considering the possible coupling with two groups of two H each, the most likely answer is a triplet of triplets (option B).


The problem involves analyzing the reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and determining the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product (product 3) after ozonolysis. Here's the breakdown:

### Step 1: Reaction with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group. The NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to an electronegative atom, likely oxygen. Based on the reaction conditions and data, product 1 is identified as a ketone, likely 1-adamantanone.

### Step 2: Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃
Product 1 (1-adamantanone) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)₃), a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates a conjugate elimination reaction, forming an α,β-unsaturated ketone (product 2). The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it contains a double bond that will be cleaved in the next step.

### Step 3: Ozonolysis
Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.

### Coupling Pattern Analysis
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group and is also near another CH₂ group. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group is coupled with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet. Additionally, the coupling with another set of hydrogens (possibly from a neighboring CH₂ group) further splits the signal. This combination of couplings results in a **triplet of triplets** as the coupling pattern.

### Conclusion
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is best described as a **triplet of triplets**.
