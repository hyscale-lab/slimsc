Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's try to tackle it step by step.

The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which are a type of pericyclic reaction. I remember that pericyclic reactions involve concerted movements of electrons, like in cycloadditions or sigmatropic shifts. In sigmatropic rearrangements, a pi bond moves along with a sigma bond. Examples given are Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I think usually happen under heat or acid conditions.

The problem has three parts: reactions leading to products A, B, and C. Then, there are four options (A to D) providing possible structures for each product. I need to figure out which option is correct.

Let's break down each reaction one by one.

**Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat â†’ A**

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the starting materials here. Let me write down the structures. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have an ethanamine (CH2CH2NH2) but with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So it's N-methyldimethylamine? Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. If it's 1,1-dimethoxy, then the structure would be OMe-O-C-NH2? Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Wait, wait. The structure is H2N-C(CH3)2-O, but no, wait. Let me think again. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CHNH2? Or more accurately, the amine is on carbon 1, and both substituents on that carbon are methoxy groups. So the structure is H2N-C(OCH3)2. So that's like a dimethylamine where the N is attached to two OMe groups and a CH2 group? Wait, maybe it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2? No, wait, ethanamine is
