Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

So the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases formed. These gases were passed through three tubes: first anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and then red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gained 3.60g, tube 3 gained 0.80g, and tube 2 didn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, okay, let me break this down. So, when salts A and B are heated, they decompose or react to form gases. These gases are then passed through these tubes, which probably react with specific components of the gas mixture.

Let's think about each tube:

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant, I think it absorbs water. So if the gas mixture has water vapor, tube 1 would gain mass. But wait, the problem says it's anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, so maybe it's used to absorb moisture. The mass increased by 3.60g. So that suggests that 3.60g of water was absorbed here.

Wait, but Mg(ClO4)2 is commonly used as a drying agent. When it absorbs water, it forms Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O. So the weight increase would be the mass of water absorbed. So 3.60g H2O is 3.60g.

Okay, moving on to tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. This is probably to absorb CO2. But the weight of tube 2 didn't change. That suggests that no CO2 was present in the gas mixture, or perhaps it's a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe the solution was saturated, so no CO2 was absorbed. Hmm, but that's a bit unclear.

Then, tube 3: red-hot copper. I remember that CO reacts with Cu at high temperatures to form CuO and CO2. So if CO was present, the Cu would react, producing CuO and CO2. The mass increase in tube 3 is 0.80g. Since CuO is formed, that increase would be due to the oxygen from CO. Let's calculate how much O was added.

The molar mass of CuO is 64 + 16 = 80 g/mol. So 0.80g of CuO is 0.80 /80 = 0.01 mol. Wait, but that would mean that 0.01 mol of O was added. Alternatively, since the reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So each mole of CO that reacts would produce 1 mole of CO2.

But wait, the mass increase in tube 3 is due to the oxygen from CO. Let me think again. Let's say the reaction is:

CO + Cu → CuO + C (no, wait, that's not right. Wait, the reaction when CO reacts with Cu is: CO + Cu → CuO + C? No, wait, actually, maybe I should write the balanced equation.

The reaction between CO and Cu is:

2 CO + Cu → CuO + CO2.

Wait, no, that's not balanced. Let me balance it.

The correct reaction is 2 CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. Let me check the atoms:

Left: 2 C, 2 O (from CO) + Cu. Right: CuO has 1 Cu, 1 O. CO2 has 1 C, 2 O. So total on right: 1 C, 3 O, and 1 Cu. On the left: 2 C, 2 O (from 2 CO) and 1 Cu. So that
