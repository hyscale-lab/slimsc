Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the question says there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance with orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, then Planet_2 is twice that, etc. All have circular orbits.

The key thing here is equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I remember is T = T_earth * sqrt(L/(16πσ)) * (1/√a), where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, maybe it's more straightforward. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, assuming all else is equal. Because the period relates to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's law says that P² is proportional to a³/(M), where M is the mass of the star. If we assume the star's mass is similar to the Sun, then a³ is proportional to P². So a is proportional to P^(2/3). 

But for equilibrium temperature, the formula is T = T_sun * (L / (16πσ))^(1/4) * (1/√a). But since L and other factors are the same for all planets (same star, same albedo), the ratio of temperatures will depend on their distances.

Wait, let me get this right. The equilibrium temperature formula is often approximated as T = T_earth * ( (1 / sqrt(a) ) / (1 / sqrt(1 AU) ) ) because Earth's temperature is based on 1 AU. Alternatively, T is proportional to (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4). But since L and σ are constants, T is proportional to (1/ a² )^(1/4) ) = 1 / a^0.5. So T is inversely proportional to the square root of a.

But since a is related to P via Kepler's third law, which states that a³ = (G M)^(1/2) P². So a is proportional to P^(2/3). So substituting that into the temperature formula: T is proportional to 1/ (P^(2/3) )^0.5. So that's 1 / P^(1/3). So T is proportional to P^(-1/3).

Wait, wait, let me clarify. Let's say a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a = k * P^(2/3), where k is some constant. Then, T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a) = 1/(sqrt(k P^(2/3))) ) = 1/(k^0.5 * P^(1/3)).

So T is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)). So the ratio of temperatures between two planets would be (P2/P1)^(-1/3), or (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If planet A has period P_A, and planet B has P_B, then their temperatures T_A and T_B are proportional to 1/(sqrt(a_A)) and 1/(sqrt(a_B)), respectively. But since a is proportional to P^(2/3), then a_A = (P_A)^(2/3) * some constant, same for a_B.

So T_A / T_B = [1/sqrt(a_A)] / [1/sqrt(a_B)] = sqrt(a_B) / sqrt(a_A) = sqrt( a_B / a_A )

But a_B / a_A = (P_B^(2/3) ) / (P_A^(2/3) ) ) = (P_B / P_A)^(2/3).

So sqrt(a_B/a_A) = (P_B/P_A)^(1/3).

So T_A / T_B = (P_B/P_A)^(1/3).

Wait, no, wait. Let me redo this.

T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). a is proportional to P^(2/3). So 1/sqrt(a) is proportional to 1/( P^(1/3) ). So T is proportional to 1/( P^(1/3) ). So T is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.

So the ratio T4/T2 would be (P2 / P4 )^(1/3).

Wait, no. Because T is proportional to 1/( P^(1/3) ), so T4 = k * 1/( P4^(1/3) ), and T2 = k * 1/( P2^(1/3) ). So T4 / T2 = (1/(P4^(1/3)) ) / (1/(P2^(1/3)) ) ) = (P2 / P4 )^(1/3).

Because (1/x) / (1/y) = y/x. So (1/(P4^(1/3)) ) / (1/(P2^(1/3)) ) ) = (P2^(1/3) ) / (P4^(1/3) ) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Alternatively, this can be written as [P2/P4]^(1/3).

So, the problem gives the orbital period ratios as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1 through 5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 has P2=2*P1, Planet_3 P3=2.5*P1, Planet_4 P4=3.5*P1, and Planet_5 P5=5*P1.

Wait, no, wait. The orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the actual periods are P1, 2*P1, 2.5*P1, 3.5*P1,5*P1.

But in the problem, I need to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So T4/T2.

Earlier, I determined that T4/T2 = (P2 / P4 )^(1/3).

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. T is proportional to 1/ (P^(1/3) ), so T4 = 1/(P4^(1/3) ) * const, T2 = 1/(P2^(1/3) ) * const. So T4/T2 = [1/(P4^(1/3)) ] / [1/(P2^(1/3)) ] = (P2^(1/3) ) / (P4^(1/3) ) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So substituting the given periods. P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So P2/P4 is 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (4/7)^(1/3) is the cube root of 0.5714.

What's cube root of 0.5714? Let me think. 0.8^3 is 0.512. 0.83^3 is approx 0.571787. Oh! Because 0.83 * 0.83 = approx 0.6889. 0.6889 * 0.83 ≈ (0.6889 * 0.8 is 0.55112) + (0.6889 * 0.03 is 0.020667) → total around 0.571787, which is very close to 4/7 ≈ 0.57142857.

So the cube root of 4/7 is approximately 0.83. So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

So the answer should be C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( T \propto P^{-1/3} \). This relationship arises because the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \) (from Kepler's third law), and \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \), which simplifies to \( T \propto 1/P^{1/3} \).

The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Let the orbital period of Planet_1 be \( P_1 \). Then, the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4 are \( P_2 = 2P_1 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \), respectively.

The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is given by:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 2P_1 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \), we find:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714.
\]

Taking the cube root of \( 4/7 \), we calculate:

\[
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
