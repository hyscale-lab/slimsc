Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read the question again carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But more importantly, it's asking about tautomerism and optical isomerism in given compounds. The first part is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and the second part is about which one shows optical isomerism.

So, let's break down the problem. The compounds given for part A are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. For part B, the options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Starting with part A: Tautomerism. Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where atoms, especially hydrogen and carbon, shift between positions, resulting in the same molecular formula but different structures. For example, keto-enol tautomerism. So, I need to find out which of the two compounds doesn't exhibit this.

Benzoquinone is an aromatic compound with two ketone groups on the benzene ring. Wait, actually, benzoquinone is a cyclic di-ketone. It has the structure where two ketone groups are attached to the benzene ring. But wait, benzoquinone can have two structures: para and ortho. But does it undergo tautomerism? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think about whether the molecule has adjacent positions where a hydrogen can shift leading to a keto-enol type tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, has three ketone groups at 1,3,5 positions on a cyclohexane ring. Now, for tautomerism, a molecule needs to have at least one alpha hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group because tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen from an alpha position to a carbonyl group, leading to the keto and enol forms.

Wait, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is adjacent to another. Let's see: the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketones alternating. Each ketone is at 1,3,5 positions. So, each carbon adjacent to a ketone (like the 2,4,6 positions) – are these positions each attached to a hydrogen? If so, could those hydrogens shift to the carbonyl carbon, leading to tautomerism?

Wait, but in the case of 1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl group is opposite another. The alpha carbons (like 2,4,6) are each attached to two other carbonyl groups. So, for hydrogen transfer, is that possible? Because for a keto-enol tautomerism, the hydrogen must be on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. But if all the alpha positions are themselves carbonyls, then there's no hydrogen to move. Wait, that can’t be right because the alpha carbons would be adjacent to two carbonyl groups.

Wait, actually, let's think about the structure of cyclohexane-1,
