Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The process is gamma-gamma annihilation into electron-positron pairs. The question is asking at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetimes in the universe are limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Hmm, I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, it can lead to their annihilation. For gamma-rays, this interaction is a significant factor in their propagation over cosmological distances. The process is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. So the gamma-ray is annihilating with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair.

Wait, but why does this limit the lifetime? Oh right, because the gamma-ray can annihilate with a CMB photon, which effectively removes it from the universe. So if the gamma's lifetime is shorter than the age of the universe due to this process, it can't travel very far. So the problem is asking for the energy where this annihilation becomes significant enough to limit the gamma-ray's lifetime.

I think the approach here is to calculate the probability of this annihilation and find the energy where the mean free path becomes comparable to the size of the universe. The mean free path is the average distance a gamma-ray travels before annihilating. The inverse of the annihilation rate would relate to the mean free path.

The cross-section for this process probably plays a key role. The cross-section σ for γγ → e+e- is a function of the energies of the two photons. Since the CMB photons are at low energy (~1e-3 eV), and the gamma-ray is high energy, we can approximate one photon's energy as much smaller than the other. So the cross-section might depend on the square root of the product of the two photon energies divided by the square of the center-of-mass energy or something like that.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression for the cross-section. Let me think. For pair production via photon-photon collisions, the cross-section is given by:

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α² / m_e²) * (E_cm^2) / (E1 E2)

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, I remember that for the process γγ → e+ e-, the cross-section σ is proportional to (E_cm)^2/(s) where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Hmm, not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the cross-section for this process can be approximated as σ ~ (α²/(4E1 E2)) * (E_cm^2), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the total cross-section for pair production when a photon interacts with the CMB is given by the so-called Klein-Nishina formula, but at high energies, the cross-section peaks at certain energies. Wait, but for the high-energy photon (gamma), the cross-section for pair production with a low-energy photon (CMB) is given by the "Bethe-Heitler" formula.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by σ ≈ (8π α²)/(3 m_e² c^4) * (E1 E2) / (E_cm^2), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I found a formula in my notes: the cross-section for two photons of energies E1 and E2 is:

σ = (8π α²)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * (E1 E2)/(E_cm)^2) * [ (m_e c^2)^2 )/(E1 E2) ] ?

Wait, maybe not. Another thought: the cross-section for this process is given by σ = (8π α²)/(3 m_e² c^4) * (E1 E2)/s, where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy (s= (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2). Since E1 << E2 (because E2 is the high-energy gamma-ray and E1 is the CMB photon), we can approximate s ≈ (E2)^2 + 2 E2 E1. But when E2 is much larger than E1, s ≈ (E2)^2. So, E_cm ≈ E2. So, in that case, the cross-section simplifies.

Let me try plugging in the numbers. Let me denote Eγ as the gamma-ray energy, and E_cmb as the CMB photon energy, which is 1e-3 eV.

So, cross-section σ = (8π α²)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * (Eγ * E_cmb)/s.

But s≈ (Eγ + E_cmb)^2 ≈ (Eγ)^2, so s ≈ Eγ^2.

So σ ≈ (8π α²)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * (Eγ * E_cmb)/(Eγ^2) ) = (8π α² E_cmb) / (3 m_e^2 c^4 Eγ )

Wait, that seems correct. So σ is proportional to 1/Eγ.

But another approach: the cross-section for pair production by a photon with energy Eγ and a low-energy photon E_cmb is given by σ ≈ (8π α²)/(3 m_e² c^4) * (E_cmb / Eγ ) * (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula
