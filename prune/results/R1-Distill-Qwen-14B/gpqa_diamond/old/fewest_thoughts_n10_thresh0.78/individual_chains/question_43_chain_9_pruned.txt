Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, let me try to visualize the structure. The question says there's a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to each other. Oh wait, meta means they're separated by two carbons, right? So each of these groups is positioned every other spot around the ring.

Also, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Oh, wait, the carboxylic acid is one substituent, and ortho to it would be the next positions. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then positions 2 and 3 would be ortho. But wait, the description says ortho to the carboxylic acid are hydroxyl and dimethyl amino. So that means position 2 and 3 each have these groups? Or maybe one of them is in position 2 and the other in position 3? Or wait, no, because a benzene ring has six positions. Let me think: if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then positions 2 and 6 are ortho, position 3 and 5 are meta, and position 4 is para. Oh wait, that's right. So if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the ortho positions are 2 and 6. So the hydroxyl and the dimethyl amino are at 2 and 6
