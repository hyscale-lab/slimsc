Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, denoted as ΔP_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue, and the state is given as a column vector. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the standard deviation formula. So, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z.

Wait, the formula is ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ − ⟨A⟩²), right? So for P_z, I need to find ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩, then compute the square root of their difference.

But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, which means when I measure P_x, I get a definite value. But when measuring other observables like P_z, there will be uncertainties.

The given state is the column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write this out:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2 ; 1/√2 ; -1/2 ]

I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for this state. Since P_z is an operator, I can compute these expectation values by taking the inner product of |ψ⟩ with P_z |ψ⟩ and similarly for P_z squared.

Wait, actually, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ† P_z ψ, and ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ† P_z² ψ. Then, the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2).

So first, let's find the matrix for P_z. From the question, the matrix of P_z is:

[ [ħ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ħ] ]

Wait, no, let me check again. The question says the matrix form of P_z has the first row as (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0,0, -ħ). So the diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

Hmm, okay. So P_z is a diagonal matrix. That should make things easier because applying P_z to a vector is just scaling each component by the corresponding diagonal element.

So |ψ⟩ is a column vector [a, b, c] where a=-1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2.

Let me compute P_z |ψ⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, each component of |ψ⟩ is multiplied by the diagonal element.

So P_z |ψ⟩ = [ ħ*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), -ħ*(-1/2) ] = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let's be precise. The matrix is:

Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So when I multiply P_z with |ψ⟩, it's:

First component: ħ*(-1/2)
Second component: 0*(1/sqrt(2)) = 0
Third component: (-ħ)*(-1/2) = ħ/2

So P_z |ψ⟩ = [ -ħ/2 , 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Then, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩ multiplied by P_z |ψ⟩.

Wait, |ψ⟩ is real here (all elements are real numbers). So the conjugate transpose is just the transpose.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ] * [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]

Wait, no. Wait, the multiplication is a row vector times a column vector. So:

⟨P_z⟩ = (-1/2)*(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(ħ/2)

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-1/2)*(-ħ/2) = (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4
Second term: (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 = 0
Third term: (-1/2)*( ħ/2 ) = (-1/2)(ħ/2) = -ħ/4

Adding them up: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0.

Oh, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero? Interesting.

Now, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Hmm, since P_z is diagonal, P_z² will have the squares of the diagonal elements. So the matrix for P_z² is:

[ [ (ħ)^2 , 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, ( -ħ )^2 ] ]

So that's:

[ [ ħ², 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, ħ² ] ]

So P_z² |ψ⟩ would be:

First component: ħ²*(-1/2)
Second component: 0*(1/sqrt(2)) = 0
Third component: ħ²*(-1/2) [Wait, no: it's (-ħ)^2 is ħ², multiplied by (-1/2) from |ψ⟩. So third component is ħ²*(-1/2) ]

Wait, no, the third component of |ψ⟩ is -1/2. So P_z² |ψ⟩ is [ ħ²*(-1/2), 0, ħ²*(-1/2) ]^T.

Wait, no, wait. The third component of P_z is -ħ, so P_z² is (-ħ)^2 = ħ². So when P_z² acts on |ψ⟩, the third component is ħ² * (-1/2). So:

P_z² |ψ⟩ = [ ħ²*(-1/2), 0, ħ²*(-1/2) ]

Wait, that's not right. Let me recalculate. The matrix P_z squared is:

Row 1: [ ħ², 0, 0 ]
Row 2: [ 0, 0, 0 ]
Row 3: [ 0, 0, ħ² ]

So when I multiply P_z² with |ψ⟩, I get:

First component: ħ²*(-1/2)
Second component: 0*(1/sqrt(2)) = 0
Third component: ħ²*(-1/2)

So P_z² |ψ⟩ is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T.

Now, to compute ⟨P_z²⟩, which is |ψ⟩† P_z² |ψ⟩.

Again, |ψ⟩ is real, so it's [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ] multiplied by [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2 )

Compute each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4
Second term: 0
Third term: (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4

Adding them: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Earlier, ⟨P_z⟩ was 0, so (⟨P_z⟩)^2 is zero.

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2) ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So that's the answer.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recap:

- Calculated P_z |ψ⟩ correctly? Yes, because P_z is diagonal, each component is scaled by the respective diagonal element.

- Calculated ⟨P_z⟩ correctly? Yes, came out to zero.

- Calculated P_z² correctly as the square of each diagonal element, yes.

- Then, the expectation value of P_z² is correctly computed as ħ²/2.

So the uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2). So the correct option is B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Applying $P_z$ to $|\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \\ 0 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\hbar \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, compute $\langle P_z \rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Applying $P_z^2$ to $|\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z^2 |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \\ 0 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \hbar^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right).
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute the computed values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B**
