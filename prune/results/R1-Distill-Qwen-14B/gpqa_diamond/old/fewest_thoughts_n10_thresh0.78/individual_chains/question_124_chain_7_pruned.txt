Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about particles in a detector, Lorentz factors, and how many reach the inner walls. Right, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. That affects how far they can travel before decaying.

So, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that decay quickly but move at ultra-relativistic speeds. The average Lorentz factor is about 20. One third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. Now, the question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that two-thirds reach the walls?

Wait, the radius is 30 meters. Oh right, so the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is determined by its lifetime multiplied by its speed. Since gamma (Lorentz factor) affects both time dilation and velocity, I need to relate the two scenarios.

Let me restate the problem. In the first case, with gamma=20, one third of the particles reach the wall. So maybe the distance is such that a fraction of them make it. In the second case, we want two-thirds to reach the wall. So I need to find the gamma that allows that.

I think the key here is the proper lifetime of the particle. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame, tau. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau.

The distance the particle travels is speed multiplied by time. Since they're moving at relativistic speeds, beta is approximately 1 (because gamma is high, so v is close to c). So for a good approximation, beta â‰ˆ 1. So distance L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

Wait, but wait: the speed is v = beta c, and the lifetime is gamma tau. So yes, L = beta c gamma tau.

But in the problem, particles are produced at the center, so the maximum possible distance they can travel is the detector's radius, which is 30 meters. Wait, but in the first scenario, only one third reach the wall. So maybe the average path length is 30 meters multiplied by one third, which is 10 meters. But wait, no, perhaps the fraction refers to particles that reach the wall,
