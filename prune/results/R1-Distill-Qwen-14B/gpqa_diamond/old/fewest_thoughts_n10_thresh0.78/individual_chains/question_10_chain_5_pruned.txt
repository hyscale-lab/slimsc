Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density among the given options a to d.

The options are:

a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius.
b) 2 Earth masses, density about 5.5g/cm³.
c) Same composition as Earth, but 5 times more massive.
d) Same composition as Earth, but half the mass.

Wait, wait. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. But how does that relate to the properties given here?

Let me break down each option.

Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? Because Earth is made of rock and metal. So this planet's density would be same as Earth's, so about 5.5. So a would have 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, and it says the density is approximately 5.5. Wait, but how does mass affect density? Well, if a planet has more mass but same density, then its radius would have to be bigger because volume depends on radius cubed. But here, option b's density is given as 5.5, same as Earth. So its density is 5.5, same as Earth. So option b's density is 5.5.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass. So if it's same composition, same density as Earth. So density would still be 5.5. Because composition determines density. So even though it's more massive, if it's same material, the density stays same. So option c's density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition, same density. So 5.5 as well.

Wait, but that can't be right because the question is asking which has the highest. All of them have the same density? But that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read again.

Option a is Earth-mass and radius. So same as Earth. So same density.

Option b: Mass is 2 Earth masses, with density 5.5. So if you have higher mass but same density, the radius would be larger. Because mass is density times volume. Volume is (4/3)pi r^3.
