Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. Let me break it down.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with a double bond. The numbering is such that the cyclohexene part is at position 3. So, the ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, probably.

Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group. Formyl is CHO, right? And at position 5, there's a vinyl group. Vinyl is CH2=CH-, so attached to the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, cyclohex-3-ene, so the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. So the substituents are at positions 2 and 5. The 2-formyl would be attached to C2, and the 5-vinyl to C5. Also, there's a carboxylic acid group at position 1, maybe? Or is the numbering different? Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has the carboxylic acid (COOH) as a substituent. Oh, wait, the base name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at a position, and the substituents are at 2 and 5.

Wait, cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid would have the COOH group on carbon 1, I think. Because in cyclohexane carboxylic acid, the COOH is on carbon 1. Then, the double bond is at 3, so between C3 and C4. Substituents at 2 and 5: formyl and vinyl.

So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a double bond from C3 to C4. Then, at C2 is a formyl group (CHO), at
