Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. It's about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons producing electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's everywhere in the universe. The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime is limited by this process.

The reaction given is γγ → e+ e-. So, a high-energy gamma-ray photon and a CMB photon annihilate into an electron-positron pair. I think this process must have some energy threshold because not all photons will have enough energy to do this.

Wait, but the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. Oh right, the CMB has a blackbody spectrum peaking at microwave frequencies, so the typical photon energy is about that. So any gamma-ray photon with energy much higher than this is way more energetic.

Now, I remember something about the cross-section for this process. The cross-section for pair production by photon-photon collisions increases when the center-of-mass energy is above a certain threshold. The threshold occurs when the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the rest mass of an electron, since each electron has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV. So the center-of-mass energy (sqrt(s)) needs to be at least 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV for the process to occur.

But wait, the cross-section's behavior depends on the energies of the two photons. If one photon is much more energetic than the other, the threshold condition is when the high-energy photon's energy exceeds a certain value relative to the CMB photon's energy.

Let me think about the formula. The condition for the pair production threshold is when the sum of the four-momenta of the two photons allows for the creation of the electron-positron pair. The minimum energy for each photon is determined by the threshold condition. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the center-of-mass energy.

Wait, the photon energies are E1 and E2. The center-of-mass (CM) energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons are massless, their momentum is E/c. So, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 +
