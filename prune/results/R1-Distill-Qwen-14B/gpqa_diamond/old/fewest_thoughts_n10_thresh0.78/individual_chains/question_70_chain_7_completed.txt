Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what it's asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and then asks about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I remember that symmetry groups are part of molecular symmetry, which relates to how a molecule looks the same after certain operations like rotations or reflections.

First, I think I need to figure out what the compounds A, B, C, D, E, etc., are. The reactions given might help me deduce their identities.

Let me break down the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
Hmm, bright red product. That makes me think of something like sulfur, perhaps? Or maybe a transition metal compound. Wait, when I think of red products, sulfur dioxide isn't red. Oh wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, in chemistry, maybe the reaction is sulfur with something else. Or perhaps a reaction involving copper? No, copper compounds are often blue. Wait, maybe it's a reaction to form a complex with a high coordination number.

Wait, another thought: when you have a solid reacting with a gas in a high ratio, like 8 equivalents, perhaps it's something like the formation of a coordination complex. For example, maybe A is a metal and B is a ligand.

Wait, another possibility: solid A could be an oxide, and gas B could be a halogen. For example, maybe A is copper(II) oxide reacting with Cl2 (chlorine gas) to form CuCl4^2- or something. But I'm not sure if that gives a bright red product.

Alternatively, solid A could be iron(III) oxide, but I'm not certain. Let me think about another reaction. Oh wait, maybe A is sulfur (solid S) and B is something else. Sulfur reacts with something to form a red product. Sulfur trioxide (SO3) is a gas, but I don't know if that's red.

Wait, another angle: product C is involved in a second reaction with gas D. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So, when C reacts with water, it produces A and two acids. If A is a metal, then perhaps C is a nitrate or sulfate complex. Alternatively, if A is a non-metal oxide, maybe sulfuric acid is formed.

Wait, let's think about the acids. F and G are produced when C reacts with water. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Common strong acids include H2SO4 (sulfuric), HCl, HNO3. Common weak acids include HCN, H3PO4, H2CO3, etc.

Wait, another thought: if C is a compound that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a weak acid, maybe C is a sulfite? No, because sulfites reacting with water would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and maybe something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. A + 8B → C. If B is a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles per mole of A. For example, if A is Fe and B is O2, but that would form FeO or Fe3O4, which don't immediately come to mind as bright red.

Alternatively, maybe A is carbon (solid) and B is something. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, what about when C reacts with gas D? The reaction produces E, which is extremely hazardous. E might be a toxic gas, like HCN or NO. Or perhaps a more dangerous compound like sarin? Wait, but the way the question is worded, E is a product of C and D. So D is another gas.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water to produce A and two acids. Suppose C is a sulfide or a nitride. If C is a sulfide, reacting with water would produce H2S (a weak acid) and maybe another acid. But then A would be metal sulfide reacting with water to form the metal hydroxide and H2S. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the second reaction: C + 2 D → E. If E is highly hazardous, maybe it's a gas like HCN or something else. But let's not get stuck here yet.

Wait, another thought: gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Solvents could be something like H2O, but D and B are gases. Let's see. If B is Cl2, and D is something else, like NH3? No, NH3 is a gas but not sure.

Wait, D and B in 1:1 ratio form H, a solvent. Let's think: common gases that can react in 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. For example, if B is O2 and D is H2, they react to form H2O, which is a solvent. That's possible. So D is H2, B is O2, H is H2O. That's a possibility.

Alternatively, B could be Cl2 and D could be something else. For example, Cl2 and H2 react in presence of light to form HCl. But HCl isn't a solvent, but a gas. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is C (carbon), but that wouldn't form a solvent.

Wait, another possibility: if B is CO2 and D is H2O, but then their reaction would be to form H2CO3 (carbonic acid), which isn't a solvent. Alternatively, B is N2 and D is H2, but that forms NH3, which is a gas, not a solvent. Wait, but NH3 is a gas but can also be a solvent. Hmm, if H is NH3, then maybe B is N2 and D is H2. But the reaction isn't straightforward.

Wait, another angle: if D is H2O (a liquid?), but D is a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, H could be H2O, and B and D are O2 and H2. So, B is O2, D is H2, and their reaction forms H2O. That makes sense. So H is H2O, a solvent. So B is O2 and D is H2.

Wait, that's a possible scenario. Let me see if that fits.

So, B is O2, D is H2.

Then, let's go back to the first reaction: A (solid) + 8 O2 → C (bright red). Hmm, what solid reacts with O2 in a 8:1 ratio to form a bright red product?

Wait, maybe A is Fe (iron) reacting with O2 to form FeO? But FeO isn't bright red. Alternatively, could A be Cu? Cu reacts with O2 to form CuO, which is black. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, what about sulfur? Sulfur (S8) is a solid. It reacts with O2 to form SO2 or SO3. Wait, but SO2 is a gas, not a solid. Alternatively, if A is S (solid), and B is O2. If it's a reaction like S + O2 → SO2 or SO3. But SO2 is a gas, not solid, unless it's in certain conditions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is a metal oxide. For example, if A is CuO, but that wouldn't react with O2. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal sulfide.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the other reactions. The product C when reacted with water gives A and two acids: F (strong) and G (weak). Suppose C is a sulfate salt. For example, if C is FeSO4, then reacting with water might not produce two acids. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, which when hydrolyzed gives Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, another thought: C could be a sulfite, like CaSO3. When it reacts with water, perhaps it hydrolyzes into Ca(OH)2 and H2SO3. But H2SO3 (sulfurous acid) is a weak acid. So F and G would be which? Wait, but if C is a sulfite, then when it reacts with water, it might not produce a strong acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate ester, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate. For example, if C is Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, maybe it hydrolyzes into Ca(OH)2 and HNO3. HNO3 is a strong acid. But that would produce Ca(OH)2 (a base) and HNO3 (acid). Hmm, but the question says two acids. So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed salt. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, let's think about the possible identity of C. If it's bright red, maybe it's a copper complex? Or perhaps a lead oxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a chromium compound, but they are usually green or orange.

Wait, another idea: maybe C is a transition metal complex with a high coordination number. For example, if A is a metal, B is a ligand, and C is a complex ion. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is the formation of sulfur trioxide (SO3), which is a gas, but then how would that fit into the other reactions?

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the possible products and their properties.

The product E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous chemicals? Sarin gas, mustard gas, hydrogen cyanide (HCN), phosgene (COCl2), etc. So perhaps E is a cyanide or something similar.

Wait, but in the reaction where C reacts with D to form E, D is a gas. And D reacts with B (O2?) in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Earlier, I thought that B is O2 and D is H2, so H would be H2O. Let me go with that for now.

So, B is O2 (gas), D is H2 (gas). H is H2O (solvent).

So, in the first reaction: A + 8 O2 → C. What solid reacts with O2 in 8 equivalents to form a bright red product?

Wait, 8 equivalents of O2 for one equivalent of A. Let's think about the stoichiometry. 8 O2 per A. So for 1 mole of A, 8 moles of O2 are used.

Hmm, perhaps A is Fe, and the reaction forms Fe3O4, which is a mix of FeO and Fe3O4. But Fe3O4 is black, not red.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is carbon (solid), and C is CO. Wait, but carbon reacts with O2 to form CO or CO2. CO is a gas, so that might not fit.

Wait, another idea: could A be PbS (lead sulfide, which is a dark solid)? But I don't think that's bright red.

Wait, maybe A is sulfur (S8), a solid. When it reacts with O2, it forms SO2 or SO3. SO2 is a gas, but SO3 is also a gas. But how would that form a bright red solid? Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction condition. Wait, if S reacts with O2 in excess, maybe it forms something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is with another gas. Wait, B is a gas, but in the first reaction, 8 equivalents of B are used. So, if B is O2, then 8 moles per mole of A.

Wait, another possibility: A is a metal like iron, and B is Cl2. Iron reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. That's a solid, but is it bright red? I think FeCl3 is more of a yellowish solid. Hmm, not quite.

Wait, perhaps A is iodine (I2), but I don't know if that fits.

Wait, another angle: the product C, when reacted with D (which is H2 in this scenario), produces E. E is extremely hazardous. If D is H2, then perhaps E is HCN. But how would C reacting with H2 produce HCN? Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a cyanide salt. So, when C (a cyanide salt) reacts with H2, it could produce HCN. But that seems a bit off.

Wait, but E is produced when C reacts with D. So, if D is H2 and it reacts with C to form E, which is HCN? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN, and C is a cyanide salt. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, NH3 is a gas, but if C is, say, NaH (a solid?), which reacts with H2 to form Na (metal) and H2 gas. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloro compound. If C is CHCl3, but that's a liquid, and I don't know.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the symmetry of E. The options are symmetry groups. So knowing what E is would help.

If E has a certain molecular structure, its symmetry group can be determined. For example, if E is HCN, which has a linear structure, its symmetry group would be D∞h. Alternatively, if E is CO2, which is linear, symmetry group is D∞h as well. But CO2 is a gas, but is it extremely hazardous? I don't think so. Maybe something else.

Wait, another thought: if E is H2O, but that's not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, if E is something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a dangerous gas. Phosgene has a structure similar to O=C=O with two Cl substituents. Wait, no, phosgene is O=CCl2. Its structure is planar, with two Cl atoms opposite each other. So its point group would be D∞h, because it's linear with certain symmetry elements.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if E is HCN, which is linear, its symmetry group is D∞h.

Wait, but what if E is CO (carbon monoxide), which is a linear molecule. Its point group is D∞h.

So, what's the symmetry group of E? Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, the options given are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

So, D∞h is a high symmetry group for linear molecules. C2 would be a 2-fold rotation. D4h is a lower symmetry, perhaps for a molecule with a square planar structure or something else.

If E is something like HCN, which is linear, then D∞h is the group. Alternatively, if E is something with a bent structure, like H2O, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another possibility: if E is NH3, but that's a trigonal pyramidal structure, which would have a C3v symmetry. Not an option here.

Alternatively, if E is CH4, which has Td symmetry, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. So if D is H2, then perhaps E is something like H2S, but that's not extremely hazardous, though it's toxic.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or something else. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: C reacts with water to form A and two acids. If A is a metal, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. When it reacts with water, it could hydrolyze into the metal hydroxide and sulfuric acid. But sulfuric acid is a strong acid, so F is H2SO4, and G is the other acid, which is weak. Wait, but if C is a sulfate, hydrolysis would produce H2SO4 and the metal hydroxide. But the acids would be F=H2SO4 and G= maybe another acid? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate. For example, sodium nitrate. When it reacts with water, maybe it hydrolyzes into HNO3 (strong acid) and another acid. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, another thought: when C reacts with water, it produces A and two acids. So perhaps C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, if C is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), which when hydrolyzed in water produces H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (which is a base, not an acid). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate. Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacts with water to produce H2CO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). Again, not two acids.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to think of another approach.

Since D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Earlier, I thought B is O2 and D is H2, making H as H2O. So H is H2O, which is a common solvent. That seems plausible.

So, in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 O2 to form C. Let's think about what solid reacts with O2 in 8:1 ratio to make a bright red solid.

Wait, another idea: perhaps A is carbon (solid), and B is O2. The reaction is 2C + O2 → 2CO. But that's a 1:1 ratio, not 8:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is Fe and B is O2. Fe reacts with O2 to form FeO (black) or Fe3O4 (black or reddish?), but I'm not sure if Fe3O4 is bright red.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Cu and B is O2. Cu reacts with O2 to form CuO, which is black, not red.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the formation of SO3. Sulfur (solid S) reacts with O2 to form SO3. But the reaction would need to be S + 3O2 → 2SO3. But I don't know the ratio here. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is S + O2 → SO2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal and B is a halogen. For example, A is Na, B is Cl2, forming NaCl. But sodium chloride is white, not red. Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal and B is another gas.

Wait, perhaps the bright red product C is a copper(I) oxide or something else. Cu2O is a reddish solid, but I'm not sure if it's bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a different copper compound, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of C with D (H2) produces E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is HCN, perhaps C is a cyanide salt. For example, if C is NaCN, and D is H2, but I don't think NaCN reacts with H2 to produce HCN. Maybe under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Ca3N2 reacts with H2O to form NH3 (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2. But that doesn't fit because the question states two acids, F and G. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate. For instance, NaClO3. When it reacts with H2, perhaps it forms HClO3 (which is a strong acid, but actually, HClO3 is a strong acid? I think it's a strong acid but not common. Alternatively, maybe it decomposes.

But this is getting too vague. Let me try to think about the possible structure of E and its symmetry group.

If E is a linear molecule, like CO or HCN, the symmetry group would be D∞h. For a molecule with a mirror plane and a 2-fold rotation, maybe C2v. For example, H2O has a C2v symmetry.

Wait, but in the options, C) is D∞h, which would be for linear molecules. If E is a linear molecule, like HCN, then the symmetry group would be D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a C2 symmetry, like ethylene, but ethylene isn't extremely hazardous.

Wait, another thought: if E is something like Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygenyl), which is a dangerous compound, but I'm not sure about its structure. Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene, which has a structure of O=C=Cl2. Wait, no, phosgene is O=CCl2, which has a planar structure with two Cl atoms opposite each other. So, its symmetry group would be D∞h, as it's linear with a center of inversion and mirror planes.

So, if E is phosgene, its symmetry group is D∞h, which is option C.

Alternatively, if E is something like O3 (ozone), which is a bent molecule, its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

Wait, but ozone is a bent molecule with a central O and two others. O3 has a structure where O is in the center with two O's on either side, but it's bent like a V. So its point group is D3h, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's C2v, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the options don't include D3h. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

So if E is a linear molecule, the symmetry group is D∞h. If it's a bent molecule with a C2 axis and some mirror planes, perhaps C2v.

Wait, another possibility: if E is a molecule like NO (nitric oxide), which is linear. NO is a diatomic molecule, so it has D∞h symmetry.

So, in that case, the symmetry group would be D∞h.

But I'm not entirely certain about the identities of the compounds. However, based on the reactions and the symmetry options, I think the most likely answer is D∞h, which is option C.


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the formation of product E, and the question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E. To determine this, the identities of the compounds involved must first be deduced based on the given reactions and properties.

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - The bright red color suggests a possible transition metal compound or a sulfur-based compound.  
   - A plausible scenario is that A is a metal or sulfur, and B is oxygen gas (O₂). For example, sulfur reacts with oxygen to form SO₃, which is a bright red gas. However, the exact identity of A and C remains unclear, but C is likely a compound that forms when A reacts with oxygen in a high ratio.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product.  
   - Gas D reacts with B (O₂) in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If B is O₂, D could be H₂, forming H₂O as the solvent.  
   - If C is a cyanide salt (e.g., NaCN), it could react with H₂ to form HCN, a highly toxic gas. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, it might react with H₂ to form NH₃, but this does not align with the description of E as extremely hazardous.  
   - A more likely candidate for E is a linear molecule like HCN or phosgene (COCl₂), both of which are highly hazardous and have linear structures.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak).  
   - If C is a cyanide salt (e.g., NaCN), hydrolysis would yield HCN (weak acid) and NaOH (base), but this does not fit the description of two acids.  
   - If C is a sulfite (e.g., Na₂SO₃), hydrolysis would produce H₂SO₃ (weak acid) and NaOH (base), again not matching the two acids.  
   - A better fit is if C is a nitrate (e.g., NaNO₃), which hydrolyzes to HNO₃ (strong acid) and NH₄OH (weak acid), aligning with the description.

4. **Symmetry Group of E**:  
   - If E is a linear molecule like HCN or phosgene, its molecular symmetry group is **D∞h**, as it has infinite symmetry elements along the molecular axis.  
   - If E were a bent molecule like O₃, its symmetry group would be **C₂v**, but this is less likely given the description of E as extremely hazardous and linear.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible symmetry group for E is **D∞h**, corresponding to a linear molecule like HCN or phosgene. 

Answer: C
