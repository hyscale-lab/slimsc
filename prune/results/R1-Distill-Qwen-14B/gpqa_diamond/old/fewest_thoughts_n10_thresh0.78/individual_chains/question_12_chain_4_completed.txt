Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay process. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The reaction given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The pion is at rest, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the muon and the neutrino. The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV/c² and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². Wait, neutrinos are a bit tricky because their mass is negligible compared to other particles. I think we can treat the neutrino as massless for this problem.

Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum should still be zero because momentum is conserved. So the momentum of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That means |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Now, the total energy before the decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.

So, the conservation of energy equation should be:

E_pion = E_muon + E_neutrino
139.6 MeV = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + E_nu

But since E_nu = |p_nu| c, and |p_nu| = |p_mu|, we can write E_nu = p_mu c. Also, for the muon, the energy is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ), so E_muon = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) MeV.

Putting it all together:

139.6 = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p_mu c

Let me denote p_mu c as x for simplicity. So the equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x

Let me rearrange this. Subtract x from both sides:

139.6 - x = sqrt(x² + 105.7²)

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x² + (105.7)^2

Expanding the left side:

139.6² - 2 * 139.6 x + x² = x² + 105.7²

The x² terms cancel out on both sides. So,

139.6² - 279.2 x = 105.7²

Compute 139.6 squared and 105.7 squared. Let me see:

139.6^2: Hmm, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. So (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

105.7^2: Let me calculate that. 100² is 10000, 5.7² is ~32.49, and the cross term is 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So plug those in:

19488.16 - 279.2 x = 11172.49

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 279.2 x

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let me subtract:

19488.16
-11172.49
------------
= 8315.67 (since 19488 - 11172 is 8316, and 0.16 - 0.49 is negative, so 8316 - 0.33 = 8315.67)

So 8315.67 = 279.2 x

Solve for x:

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Hmm, 279 * 30 is 8370, which is a bit more than 8315. Let me see:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 = 8376 minus 279.2 → 8376 - 279.2= 8096.8. Which is less than 8315.67.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.8:

279.2 * 30 = 8376. Subtract 279.2 *0.2 → 55.84.

So 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

Wait, 8315.67 is a bit less than 8320.16. So 29.8 would give 8320.16, which is 4.49 more than 8315.67.

So, 29.8 - (4.49 / 279.2) → 4.49 / ~280 is about 0.016.

So x ≈ 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because 279.2 * 29.784 is what?

Alternatively, perhaps a calculator approach would help, but since I'm doing this mentally, let me accept that x ≈ 29.78 MeV.

So x = p_mu c ≈ 29.78 MeV. Therefore, the neutrino's energy E_nu is also approximately 29.78 MeV.

Now, the muon's energy is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Let me compute that. 29.78 squared is about 886.8. Because 30^2 is 900, so 29.78 is close to that. Let me compute: 29.78 *29.78. Let's see:

(30 - 0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22^2 = 900 -13.2 + 0.0484= 886.8484.

105.7 squared is 11172.49 as before.

So adding 886.8484 + 11172.49 = 12059.3384.

Then sqrt(12059.3384) is ?

Well, 110^2 is 12100. So sqrt(12059.3384) is just a bit less than 110.

Compute 109.8^2 = (110 -0.2)^2 = 12100 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.04 = 12100 -44 +0.04= 12056.04.

Wait, 109.8^2 = 12056.04. Our sum is 12059.3384, which is 3.2984 more.

So how much more? Let me compute (109.8 + delta)^2 = 12059.3384.

(109.8 + delta)^2 = 109.8^2 + 2*109.8 * delta + delta^2 = 12056.04 + 219.6 delta + delta^2.

Set equal to 12059.3384.

12056.04 + 219.6 delta ≈ 12059.3384.

So 219.6 delta ≈ 3.2984.

delta ≈ 3.2984 / 219.6 ≈ 0.01503.

So approximately 109.8 +0.015 =109.815.

So E_muon ≈ 109.815 MeV.

But wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. So the kinetic energy K_mu is E_muon - m_mu c² = 109.815 - 105.7 = 4.115 MeV.

So the muon's KE is approximately 4.115 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which matches closely. So the answer should be option D.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, when I had x = p_mu c, which was about 29.78 MeV. Then, the muon's energy is sqrt( x² + m_mu² ). So that's sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Which as we computed, is about 109.815 MeV.

So the kinetic energy is 109.815 - 105.7 = 4.115 MeV, as before.

The neutrino's energy is x, which is 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.

So option D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That looks correct.


The problem involves finding the kinetic energy of the muon and neutrino in the decay of a stationary pion, given the reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

The rest masses of the pion and muon are \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), respectively. The neutrino is treated as massless.

### Conservation of Energy and Momentum
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay is conserved:
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}
   \]
   The total initial energy is the rest energy of the pion:
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   After the decay, the muon's energy is:
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2},
   \]
   where \( p_{\mu} c \) is the momentum of the muon, and the neutrino's energy is:
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c.
   \]
   Since momentum is conserved and the pion is stationary, \( p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} \).

2. **Simplification**: Let \( x = p_{\mu} c \). Substituting into the energy conservation equation:
   \[
   139.6 = \sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} + x.
   \]
   Rearranging and squaring both sides:
   \[
   (139.6 - x)^2 = x^2 + 105.7^2.
   \]
   Expanding and simplifying:
   \[
   139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot x = 105.7^2.
   \]
   Compute \( 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \) and \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \):
   \[
   19488.16 - 279.2x = 11172.49.
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

3. **Muon's Energy**: The muon's total energy is:
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
   \]
   Compute \( 29.78^2 = 886.8484 \) and \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \):
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.8484 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.3384} \approx 109.815 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   The muon's kinetic energy is:
   \[
   K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 109.815 - 105.7 = 4.115 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

4. **Neutrino's Energy**: The neutrino's energy is:
   \[
   E_{\nu} = x = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The muon's kinetic energy is approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the neutrino's energy is approximately \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Option D: \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \).**
