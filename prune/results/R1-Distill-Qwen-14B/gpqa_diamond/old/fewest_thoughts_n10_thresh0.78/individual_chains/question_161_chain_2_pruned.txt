Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and gas molecules in the vacuum chamber. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. It's using a pretty high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to make an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. That's super low pressure, right? The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible in the sample compartment so that they don't interfere with the electron beam. But even so, some gas particles are still there, detected by a mass spectrometer. 

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, with low pressure, the mean free path increases because molecules don't bump into each other as often.

But then, when he turns on the electron beam, he notices something odd. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. The temperature is the same, so that shouldn't affect the mean free path in the same way.

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Oh, because the electrons are moving fast and interacting with the gas molecules. The electron beam is causing the gas molecules to scatter more. Because when you have a high-energy electron beam, it can knock gas molecules around. 

So without the beam, the gas molecules are just floating around, their mean free path determined by their own interactions. But with the beam, the electrons can collide with the gas molecules, which would effectively increase the number of collisions the gas molecules experience. 

Wait, but how does that affect the mean free path? The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure and square root of the absolute temperature, but more importantly, it's related to the number of collisions a molecule has. If the gas molecules are being hit more by electrons, those collisions count as effective collisions, so the effective mean free path would be shorter. 

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for mean free path. The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(n * π * d² / 2), where n is the number density and d is the diameter of the molecules. But in this scenario, the number of gas molecules is fixed because the pressure is fixed. So why would λ change?

Wait, but when the electron beam is on, the electrons are also interacting with the gas molecules. So each gas molecule now has another type of interaction: being hit by electrons. So the effective number of collisions increases because each gas molecule can collide not only with other gas molecules but also with electrons.

Hmm. So if the gas molecules are colliding with electrons, each collision would count as a scattering event. So from the perspective of the gas, their mean free path would be shorter because they're scattering not just off each other but also off the electrons.

So the mean free path λ is calculated based on the rate of collisions. If the number of collisions increases, λ decreases. So λ2 should be less than λ1.

Wait, but let me think again. The mean free path for the gas molecules in the vacuum (without the electron beam) is λ1
