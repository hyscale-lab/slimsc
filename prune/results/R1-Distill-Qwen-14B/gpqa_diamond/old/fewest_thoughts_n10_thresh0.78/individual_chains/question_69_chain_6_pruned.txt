Okay, so I need to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime of τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, I think this has to do with the concept of particle decay and the time it takes for the decay to be observed. Since particles moving at relativistic speeds might have their lifetimes dilated, which affects how many decays are observed. The resolution probably refers to the precision of the measurement, like the time resolution of the detector.

Wait, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. The formula for time dilation is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor, calculated as γ = E / m, since energy E is related to mass and velocity.

So first, I should calculate the Lorentz factor γ. Given E is 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. Wait, but in natural units, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But since the particle is moving at high energy, maybe E ≈ pc, so γ is E/(m c²). But since the units here are in GeV, I think we can treat E and m in the same terms since the c² would be factored in. So γ = E/(m c²) → but without knowing the units, perhaps it's just E/m, since the c² would be a constant when using GeV for both.

Wait, so let me think. The mass is 3.41 GeV/c², and the energy is 27 GeV. So γ would be E/(m c²). But in terms of units, if E is given in GeV and m in GeV/c², then when you compute E/(m c²), the units would be GeV/( GeV/c² * c²) ) → GeV/( GeV) ) → unitless, which is correct for γ.

Wait, but E is the total energy, which is γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). So substituting, E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let me see: 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41*8=27.28. So 27 is a bit less than 8 times 3.41. So 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91 maybe? Let's say approximately 7.91.

So γ is about 7.91. Then the dilated
