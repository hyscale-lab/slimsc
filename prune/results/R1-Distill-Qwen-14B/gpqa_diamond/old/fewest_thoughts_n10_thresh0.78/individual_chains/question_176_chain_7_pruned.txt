Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully again.

The state of the system at time t is a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state is usually a column vector, but the elements should be complex numbers and normalized, right? Oh, but in this case, the vector is (-1, 2, 1). Let me check the length: |−1|² + 2² +1² = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so this isn't normalized. Oh, but maybe that's okay because maybe the question doesn't require normalization, or perhaps the state is given in a non-normalized form but we'll have to normalize it when calculating probabilities. Hmm, but wait, when operators are applied, normalization matters, right? Or maybe the question doesn't require it because it's just about the process. Wait, actually, when calculating probabilities, the state vector must be normalized. So first thing I should do is normalize the given state.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ] divided by sqrt(6), because the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Next, the operators P and Q are given. So first, operator P has a matrix:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, no, let me write it correctly. Operator P's matrix is:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Hmm, that looks familiar. Wait, perhaps it's a spin matrix in some basis, but not sure. Let me see.

Operator Q's matrix is:

Row 1: [1, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -1]

So Q is a diagonal matrix, which implies that its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So measuring Q would give one of these eigenvalues.

The question is: someone measures Q just after measuring P. We need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, so the measurement order is P first, then Q. So when you measure P first, the state collapses to an eigenstate of P. Then, after that, measuring Q on this new state.
