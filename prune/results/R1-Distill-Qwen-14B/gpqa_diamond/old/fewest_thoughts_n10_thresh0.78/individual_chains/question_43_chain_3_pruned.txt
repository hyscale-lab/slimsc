Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and jot down the important details.

The question describes a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me list them out:

- Carboxylic acid (-COOH)
- Carbaldehyde (-CHO)
- Cyano group (-CN)
- Hydroxyl (-OH)
- Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)
- Methoxy (-OCH3)

The substituents are arranged in a specific way: the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano group are all meta to one another. So each of those three groups is at a position that's meta relative to the others. Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group. Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Additionally, the methoxy and the hydroxyl groups are both ortho to the nitrile.

Hmm, okay. Let me visualize the benzene ring. I'll imagine the ring with the carboxylic acid (let's say at position 1) for reference. Then, the other two groups (carbaldehyde and cyano) should be at positions 3 and 5 because they are meta to each other relative to the COOH.

Wait, no. Wait, the COOH, CHO, and CN are all meta to each other. So if COOH is at position 1, then CHO would be at 3 and CN at 5, because each is meta to each other. Alternatively, maybe they're arranged differently. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH, CHO, and CN each are meta to each other. So for a benzene ring, each pair of these groups is separated by two carbons (meta positions). So let's say COOH is at position 1, then CHO is at position 3, and CN at position 5. Because 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, and 5 and 1 are meta? Wait, no. Wait, in a benzene ring, any two meta positions are two apart in numbering, but if you have three groups each meta to the others, that's a bit tricky. Maybe they're each at positions 1, 3, 5. Oh, wait, that's possible.
