Alright, so I've got this problem here where I'm given an algorithm's input and output, and I need to figure out what the output is for a new input. Let's break this down step by step.

The given examples are:
- AGG -> 115
- TGCTGA -> 176

And I need to find the output for ACAGTGACC. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Hmm. Let's think about what kind of algorithm could take a DNA sequence and produce these numbers. DNA sequences are made up of the bases A, T, C, G. So maybe each base is being converted into a number and then summed or something like that.

Let me look at the first example: AGG. So that's three nucleotides. The output is 115. Let me see if each letter is contributing a value. If I take the positions of the letters in the alphabet: A is 1, G is 7, another G is 7. So 1 +7 +7 =15. But the output is 115. That's way bigger than 15. So maybe each letter is multiplied by a certain number.

Wait, another approach: maybe each base is assigned a specific numerical value. For example:

A = 1
T = 2
C = 3
G = 4

But let's test that. For AGG: 1 +4 +4 =9. Not 115. Doesn't fit.

Hmm, another idea. Maybe it's based on the molecular weight of each nucleotide. The approximate molecular weights are:

Adenine (A) ~ 330 g/mol
Thymine (T) ~ 289 g/mol
Cytosine (C) ~ 284 g/mol
Guanine (G) ~ 324 g/mol

But wait, let's calculate AGG. A is 330, G is 324, another G is 324. So total would be 330 +324 +324 = 978. That's way higher than 115. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the algorithm is using the sum of the positions of each base in the DNA sequence. Or perhaps it's something
