Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully and figure it out step by step. 

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, and the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find the right reagent A and catalyst B from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine, and when it undergoes certain reactions, it can form various products. The product given has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine ring. Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl... that sounds like a cyclohexyl group connected via a double bond, maybe? Like an ene group. So the product structure probably has a substituted cyclohexene attached via a methylene group.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the cyclohexylidene part is a substituent on the pyrrolidine's nitrogen? Or wait, no, in pyrrolidine, the numbering is such that the substituents are on the ring. Let me think: pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four CH2 groups and one NH. The numbering places the nitrogen as position 1. So 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a methyl group on carbon 3.

When this reacts with compound A under acid catalysis, the product has another substituent. The product's structure is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Wait, so substituent is on the nitrogen? Because the numbering would be 1 (nitrogen), 2, 3, 4, 5. So the substituent is on the nitrogen? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it mentally. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The substituent is on the nitrogen, making it a quaternary ammonium? No, probably not. Wait, wait,
