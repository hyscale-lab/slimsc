Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I need to figure out the energy levels from the options provided.

Wait, I remember that in two dimensions, especially using polar coordinates, the potential can sometimes be separable. Maybe I can write the potential in terms that make the problem easier to solve. Let's see. The potential has two terms: one that's purely r² and another that depends on cos²θ. 

I recall that in polar coordinates, the Laplacian (which appears in the Schrödinger equation) is separable into r and θ parts. So maybe the potential here also allows the wavefunction to be separable into radial and angular parts. 

Looking at V(r, θ), the first term is (1/2)k r², which is like a harmonic oscillator potential in radial direction. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Right, cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2 k r²)( (1 + cos 2θ)/2 )

Let me compute that. Multiply 3/2 by 1/2, that gives 3/4. So:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ)
Wait, no, wait: 3/2 * (1/2) is 3/4. So the first two terms add up: (1/2 + 3/4) kr². Let's compute that: 1/2 is 2/4, plus 3/4 is 5/4. So:

V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4) k r² cos(2θ)

Hmm, but wait, I might have made a mistake in that expansion. Let me recheck. Oh yeah, because the cos²θ term would be (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So the second term is (3/2)k r² * (1/2)(1 + cos 2θ) = (3/4)k r² (1 + cos 2θ). So expanding that, it's (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ). Adding the first term (1/2 kr²) gives 1/2 + 3/4 = 5/4, so the potential is:

V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ)

Wait a second, perhaps it's better to think of this as a sum of two potentials. One is a radial harmonic oscillator, and the other is an angular part that depends on cos(2θ). So
