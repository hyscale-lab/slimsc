Okay, let's see. The question is about how Maxwell's equations would change in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Maxwell's equations, but I'll try to think it through.

So, Maxwell's equations in our universe are four in total. Two of them deal with the divergence of E and B, and the other two with their curls. The equations are:

1. Gauss's Law: divergence of E equals rho/epsilon_0.
2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: divergence of B equals zero.
3. Faraday's Law: curl of E equals negative dB/dt.
4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): curl of B equals mu_0 times J plus mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt.

Wait, so in our world, the divergence of B is zero. That's because we don't have isolated magnetic poles, right? Monopoles don't exist. So Maxwell's equations assume that there are no magnetic charges. 

But in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated North or South poles. So that means they can have magnetic charge, just like electric charges. So that must change one of Maxwell's equations.

Let me think. If magnetic monopoles exist, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Because if you have a magnetic charge, like a point with a north pole, the field lines would start there, similar to how electric field lines start from positive charges. So divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, just like divergence of E is proportional to the electric charge density.

So in our universe, equation 2 says divergence B = 0. In the parallel universe, it would be divergence B = something, maybe rho_m (magnetic charge density) times a constant, similar to equation 1 which is divergence E = rho_e / epsilon_0.

So equation 2 would change. What about the other equations? Let me think about Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law.

Faraday's Law is about the curl of E. It says that the curl of E is the negative rate of change of B. Does that change? I don't think so. Because that's about how changing B fields create E fields (induction), which doesn't directly relate to the existence of magnetic charges. Unless... wait, maybe if magnetic monopoles exist, the direction of the field lines changes, but the equation itself deals with the curl, not the divergence. So maybe equation 3 remains the same.

Similarly, Ampère's Law deals with the curl of B and relates it to current and the rate of change of E. I think that would still hold, right? Because whether you have monopoles or not, the current is still the movement of charges, which are electric. So equation 4 might stay the same.

Wait, but wait. I've read somewhere that if magnetic monopoles exist, then Maxwell's equations would have to be modified in two places. Because not only would the divergence of B change, but also the curl of E might change. Let me think again.

In our equations, Faraday's Law says curl E = -dB/dt. That's based on B having no divergence. But if B does have a divergence (because of monopoles), then perhaps Faraday's Law would pick up something else? Or maybe another equation would have to change.

Wait, another thought. I remember that in the presence of magnetic charges, the Maxwell equations get modified in two ways. The divergence of B is no longer zero but is proportional to the magnetic charge density. Also, Faraday's Law gets modified. Because in the original, the curl of E is related to the time derivative of B. If there's a magnetic current, perhaps the curl of E would have another term.

Wait, let me think in terms of symmetries. Maxwell's equations are symmetric between electric and magnetic fields when you include the time derivatives, which is why introducing magnetic monopoles would require a similar change as in the electric case.

So, the divergence of B would become rho_m (the magnetic charge density) times a constant, similar to how divergence E is rho_e / epsilon_
