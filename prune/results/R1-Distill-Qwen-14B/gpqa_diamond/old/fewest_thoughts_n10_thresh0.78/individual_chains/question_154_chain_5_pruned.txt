Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to spectroscopy, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on its spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one matches the given data.

First, let's look at the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%), and there's another peak at 158 (32%). Hmm, the molecular weight is 156. The other peak is at 158, which is two units higher. That might suggest a chlorine isotope because chlorine has two common isotopes: 35Cl (about 75%) and 37Cl (about 25%). So if the molecular ion is 156, and the next peak is 158, that would fit if the molecule has a chlorine atom. Let me check the options to see which have Cl.

Looking at the options:
A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid
C) Phenyl chloroformate
D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid

All except maybe C have chlorine? Wait, C is phenyl chloroformate. Structure-wise, that's OCl attached to a carbonyl group. So yes, all options except maybe one have Cl. Let me check. Option A: Cl on benzene, yes. B: Cl on benzene. C: Cl in the chloroformate group. D: Cl on benzene. So all have Cl except none. So mass spec makes sense.

Next, IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But the range given is 3500-2700, which is a bit lower. Wait, 3500-2700 is a pretty broad range. Maybe it's an O-H stretch. Alternatively, for aldehydes, the aldehyde proton is around 2800-2700, but that's a sharp peak. Wait, the IR has a broad peak in that region, which might suggest an -OH group, like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a carbonyl stretch. Which carbonyl? For a carboxylic acid, it's around 1700-1725. For an ester or aldehyde, slightly different. 1720 is probably a carbonyl, maybe an ester or acid.

Looking at the options, benzoic acids (B and D) would have a carbonyl in the 1700s. Benzaldehyde (A) has an aldehyde, which is around 2820 (stretch) and 1700 (C=O). Wait, but in the IR data, the 1720 is a strong sharp peak. Also, the broad peak could be the O-H from a carboxylic
