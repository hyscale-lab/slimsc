Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Wait, the state is given as (3i, 4). I guess that means the spinor is written as a column vector [3i, 4]^T. Right, because in quantum mechanics, spin states are represented by two-component spinors for an electron's spin-½ system.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product: <ψ|Ô|ψ>, where Ô is the operator. So, for S_y, I need the operator sigma_y multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, because for spin-½ particles, the spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

Sigma_y is given as the matrix:
0 -i
i 0

So putting that together, the operator S_y is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

Now, the expectation value <S_y> would be ψ† * S_y * ψ. Let me represent ψ as a column vector: [3i; 4]. 

So ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which would be [ -4, -3i ] because the conjugate of 3i is -3i, but wait, wait, no. Wait, the original vector is [3i, 4], so ψ is |ψ> = 3i |↑> +
