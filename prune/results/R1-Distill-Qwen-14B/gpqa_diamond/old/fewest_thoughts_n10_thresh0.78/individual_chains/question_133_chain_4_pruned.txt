Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and phosphate ions. Hmm, I remember from class that when you mix different phosphate salts, they can form a buffer solution. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, HPO4^3-, in this solution. Oh wait, wait—orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it dissociates, it forms different ions. Wait, no. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, then it loses a proton to become H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and finally PO4^3- (phosphate). So in this case, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. 

I think KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. And Na2HPO4·2H2O, when dissolved, gives Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That makes me think of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation because it's a buffer solution involving a weak acid and its conjugate base.

Wait, the buffer here would be between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Oh wait, but what about the K values? Because H3PO4 has three dissociation steps. The first Ka is for H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+, and the third is HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+. So the second dissociation is governed by Ka2, which is 6.2x10^-
