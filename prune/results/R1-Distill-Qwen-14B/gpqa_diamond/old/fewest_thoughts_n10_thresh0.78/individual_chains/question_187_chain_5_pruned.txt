Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I remember ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope in Paranal. Let me think about the details.

The question is about the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) each star would give. The requirement is S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out for each star whether the exposure meets this.

First, what factors determine the S/N ratio in a spectrograph? I think the key factors are the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the spectrograph's efficiency, and the noise sources like readout noise and background noise.

ESPRESSO has a certain sensitivity curve, right? From what I remember, it's designed for high-resolution spectroscopy, so maybe it's more efficient for brighter stars. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact S/N per magnitude.

Wait, I think the formula for signal-to-noise ratio in astronomy is something like S/N proportional to sqrt(N) × 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m0 is a reference magnitude. Or maybe it's better to use a formula where the S/N depends on the number of photons collected, which depends on the exposure time and the star's flux.

Another approach: I remember that the VLT has a certain collecting area. The 8m VLT telescope has a diameter of 8 meters, so the area is π*(4)^2 = 64π m², approximately 201 m². The ESPRESSO spectrograph is fiber-fed, so it's using a specific fiber size which determines how much light it captures.

The star's apparent magnitude plays a big role here. The lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. So for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitudes based on their absolute magnitude and distance.

The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is the distance in parsecs. Wait, no, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5, yes that's correct. So for each star, let's compute m
