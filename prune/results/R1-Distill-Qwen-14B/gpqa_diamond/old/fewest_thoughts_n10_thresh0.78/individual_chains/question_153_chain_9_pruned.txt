Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question has three parts (A, B, C), each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the products based on the Michael addition mechanism. I remember that the Michael addition is a 1,4-addition where a nucleophile (the enolate) attacks an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

Let's start with reaction (A): dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so I think it deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH, which can lose a proton from the central CH to form a conjugate base, the enolate.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=C(p-Tol)-COOCH3, but wait, the E configuration would have the p-tolyl group on one side and the COOCH3 on the other. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. Wait, no, in the Michael addition, the enolate attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl at the beta position, adding 1,4.

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl), so the addition occurs at the beta position. So for the acrylate: structure is CH2-C(O)OCH3 with the p-tolyl group attached to the double bond. Oh wait, no, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-p-Tol-CO-OCH3? No, wait, I think I'm getting that wrong. Let's clarify.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=C(p-Tol)COOCH3. Wait, is that right? So the structure is CH2-C(p-Tol)=COOCH3, but the E configuration would have the substituents opposite each other. So when the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position, which is the CH2 in CH2-C(p-Tol)=COOCH3?

Wait, no. The structure is CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon, but wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So position 3 would be the middle carbon. Hmm, wait, maybe it's CH2-C(p-Tol)-
