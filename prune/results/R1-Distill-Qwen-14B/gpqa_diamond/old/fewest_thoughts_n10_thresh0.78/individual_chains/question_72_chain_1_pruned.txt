Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with all these reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting from a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then it goes through several steps, each with different reagents and conditions. The final question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. The options are A) 8, B) 4, C) 10, D)7.

Hmm, so I need to figure out what each reaction does, draw the structures, and then count the distinct hydrogens in the final product. Let me break it down.

First, the starting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta is like a norbornene structure, right? So that's a bicyclic compound. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So the structure has two rings, with the oxy group attached.

Next step: this compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Hmm, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexadiene has two substituents: each is a dibromomethyl group attached to carbons 5 and 6. So each is CH2Br2? Wait, no, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2, but wait no, wait. Wait, dibromomethyl is CH2Br2? Or is it (CH2Br)2? Oh wait, no, dibromomethyl is (CH2Br)2, but actually, it's CH2Br2. Wait, sorry, dibromomethyl is CH2Br2. Each substituent is a methyl group with two bromine atoms attached â€“ so each is a -CH2Br2 group? Hmm, but that's not possible because a methyl group can't have two Br atoms attached as in CH2Br2. Wait, no, perhaps it's a -CHBr2 group? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Oh, no, dibromomethyl is CH2Br2, which is a methyl group with two bromines. So the substituent is -CH2Br2.

Wait, but that's a bit unlikely because CH2Br2 is a bit unusual, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's (dibromomethyl) meaning each substituent is a -CH2Br group, but that wouldn't be dibromo. Wait, the name is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), so each substituent is a methyl group with two bromines attached. So each is -CH2Br2? Hmm, that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's -CHBr2, but that would be a
