Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading through the problem again to make sure I understand it.

So, a scientist is running quantitative PCR (qPCR) and wants to make a calibration curve. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it in serial dilutions. He ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency was 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect, so each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² was 1, which is a perfect correlation, so the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope was -3.3; I remember that in qPCR, the slope of the calibration curve is related to the efficiency. A perfect efficiency (100%) should give a slope of -3.3219, which is close to what he has here (-3.3). So this all looks good.

Now looking at the Ct values. For each concentration, there are three replicates. Let's list them:

- 100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5 → average around 34.2
- 10,000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2 → average ~31
- 1,000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9 → ~27.6
- 100: 24, 24.3, 24.6 → ~24.3
- 10: 20.7, 21, 21.3 → ~21

Wait, so each dilution is a tenfold decrease. So from 100,000 to 10,000 is 1/10, then 1000 is another 1/10, etc. Each dilution step should ideally increase the Ct by about 3.3 cycles because with 100% efficiency, each 10-fold dilution would take log2(10) ≈ 3.32 cycles to decrease the Ct by that much.

Looking at the Ct values, let's check the differences between the concentrations. Let's compute the Ct for each and see if they decrease by about 3.3 each step.

For 100,000 to 10,000: Ct goes from ~34.2 to ~31 → difference is about 3.2. Close enough to 3.3, considering maybe some minor variation.

From 10,000 to 1,000: 31 to 27.6 → that's a 3.4 difference. Hmm, a bit higher than 3.3.

From 1,000 to 100: 27.6 to 24.3 → difference is 3.3. Perfect.

100 to 10: 24.3 to 21 → difference of 3.3 again.

Wait, but looking at this, each step has a difference that's roughly 3.3, except maybe the first step which is 3.2 and the second which is 3.4. But with three technical replicates, the Ct values for each dilution are pretty tight. For example, the 100,000 sample has Ct values 33.9, 34.2, 34.5, so a range of about 0.6. The 10,000 has 30.6 to 31.2, a range of 0.6 again. All others are similar.

Now, the question is about the discrepancies in his results. So what's wrong here?

Looking at the options:

Option A: qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. No, because the efficiency is 100% and R² is 1. So the calibration is good, so qPCR is working.

Option B: Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target. Well, the data seems to show a clear trend, so I'm not sure. But each step's Ct is about 3.3 lower than the previous. So I'd think they are in agreement.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, the slope is negative, so each tenfold increase in DNA would decrease the Ct by 3.3 cycles. So the tenfold dilution (decrease in copies) would lead to a Ct increase of 3.3. Wait, the question says the slope is -3.3. So each increase in log copies (e.g., each tenfold increase) would
