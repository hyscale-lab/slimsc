Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the main part is ethan-1-one, which is acetophenone-like. So, the ketone is on the first carbon, attached to a phenyl group. The phenyl group has substituents: a bromo at position 3 and a nitro at position 5.

Wait, benzene is the starting material. So, I need to add substituents in the correct positions. Let me draw this out mentally. The phenyl group has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Wait, numbering for benzene can be tricky. Let me imagine the benzene ring with the ketone as the main substituent. So, the ketone is at position 1. Then, the bromo is at position 3 (which is two positions away from 1 in a meta arrangement), and the nitro is at position 5. Wait, no, when the main substituent is at position 1, the positions are numbered such that the next substituents are in the correct meta or para positions. Maybe I should think of the substituents as being on the benzene ring attached to the acetophenone group.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the phenyl group is attached to the ketone (so, acetophenone has the structure Ar-CO-CH3, where Ar is the substituted benzene). So, the acetophenone part is the ketone. The substituents on the benzene ring are at positions 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro) relative to the ketone group. So, the ketone is at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5. So, the ring would have substituents at 1 (CO-CH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Wait, but that would mean the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone, which is at
