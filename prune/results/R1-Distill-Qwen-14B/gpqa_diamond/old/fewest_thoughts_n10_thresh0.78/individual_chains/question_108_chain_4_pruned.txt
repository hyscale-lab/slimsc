Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, right. So first, I need to understand what each of these terms refers to.

The scenario is a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis, and it's given as 1 Tesla. They also mention small values of m, which is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, but wait, in atoms, the orbital quantum number is l, and m can be -l, ..., +l. So small m would imply l is low, maybe like l=0, 1, or 2. But I'm not sure if that's important here.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is part of the Hamiltonian, I think. Paramagnetism arises when the magnetic moment of an atom interacts with an external magnetic field. The coupling term in the Hamiltonian would be something like the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. Oh right, the Zeeman term.

The transition energy ΔE refers to the energy difference between two atomic energy levels. For hydrogen, the emission or absorption of a photon corresponds to a transition between these levels. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers. I remember that this is about the Balmer series; specifically, the wavelength for the H-alpha line, which is a transition between the n=3 and n=2 energy levels in hydrogen. So that's the ΔE they're referring to.

The problem is asking to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with this ΔE. The options are whether ⟨H⟩ is much greater than, much less than, equal, or just greater than ΔE.

So, I need to calculate or estimate both terms and see which is bigger.

First, let's find ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². The H-alpha line is from n=3 to n=2. Let me calculate the energy difference.

E_2 = -13.6 / (2)^2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV.
E_3 = -13.6 /9 ≈ -1.511 eV.
ΔE = E_3 - E_2 = (-1.511) - (-3.4) = 1.889 eV. So approximately 1.89 eV.

Converting that to Joules for easier comparison with other units. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1.89 eV is about 3.025e-19 J.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. The magnetic interaction energy is given by the Zeeman term, which is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * (eħ/(2m)) * m_s, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio. But wait, for electrons, the magnetic moment is μ = -g_s (μ_B) S, where g_s is the electron g-factor (~2) and μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, but since we're dealing with orbital angular momentum, maybe it's the orbital magnetic moment? Or is it the spin? Wait, paramagnetism usually arises from the spin magnetic moment. Oh, but the question says paramagnetic coupling term, which I think refers to the spin-orbit coupling. Or wait, no, paramagnetism is about the interaction of the electron's spin magnetic moment with the external field. So perhaps the paramagnetic term is H = -μ·B, where μ is the spin magnetic moment.

Wait, but in atoms, paramagnetic effects are due to the spin. So the coupling term would be the Zeeman term for spin.

The spin magnetic moment is μ = g_s * μ_B * m_s, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is (eħ)/(2m_e). So the energy is H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, H would be proportional to m_s, I think. But wait, for the expectation value, since we're taking ⟨H⟩, perhaps it's the expectation value of the spin component in the magnetic field. For an atom in a state with certain m_s, the energy would be H = - μ_B g_s B m_s.

But wait, maybe for the problem, they're considering the orbital magnetic moment? Or perhaps it's the spin-orbit coupling, but I'm not sure. The initial problem says "paramagnetic coupling term" — paramagnetism is about the spin, so it's the spin interaction.

So, the paramagnetic term is H = - g_s μ_B m_s B. But wait, isn't that for a single electron? Hydrogen has only one electron, so yeah.

Wait, but wait. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is given as small. Oh, wait, in the problem statement, it says "small values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number)". Oh, so m here is the orbital m, m_l. Hmm, but wait, the spin magnetic quantum number is m_s, which can be ±1/2. So maybe the question is mixing terms here. Or perhaps the paramagnetic term is due to the orbital angular momentum. Wait, no, paramagnetism is due to spin, not orbital angular momentum. So I'm a bit
