Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. 

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. They're asking what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes, right? But the question is about the next 150 minutes, so maybe it's better to think in terms of the remaining half-life or something.

Wait, wait. Oh right, radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. The key here is that the decay is memoryless, meaning that the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes doesn't affect its probability of decaying in the next period. So the probability should be the same as it would have been starting fresh for 150 minutes, but wait, no, because the initial condition was given for 100 minutes. Hmm, maybe I should approach this using the concept of decay probabilities.

I remember that the probability of decay can be modeled using the exponential decay formula. The decay probability P(t) is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time. Alternatively, sometimes people use the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-t/τ), where τ
