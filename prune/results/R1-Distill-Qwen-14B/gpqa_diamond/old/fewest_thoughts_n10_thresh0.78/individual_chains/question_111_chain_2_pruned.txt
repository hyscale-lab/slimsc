Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question involves two separate reactions, A and B, and I need to determine the major products for each based on steric hindrance and product stability.

First, let's look at the first reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this sounds like an enolate formation reaction. Enolate chemistry is a big part of carbonyl reactions, like the aldol reaction or maybe some kind of conjugate addition.

The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure. The cyclohexanone ring has a ketone at position 1 (so position 1 is carbonyl). Then, positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. So the substituents are all around the ring. Wait, wait, position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group? Or is it that position 2 is substituted with ethyl and position 6 has methyl, same as position 2? Wait, let me clarify the structure. The compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the ketone is at position 1. Then, position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it's 2-ethyl-2-methyl? Or wait, maybe it's position 2 has an ethyl, and position 6 has methyl. Wait, no, the numbering must be such that the substituents are at positions 2, 2, and 6. Wait, no, I think 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one means that at position 2, there's an ethyl and a methyl group (so substituents at 2 are ethyl and methyl), and at position 6, another methyl group. So positions 2 and 6 are substituted.

Wait, actually, no. Let me think. The formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone. So the cyclohexanone has the ketone at position 1. Then, position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group (so 2-ethyl and 2-methyl), and position 6 has a methyl group. So that's how the substituents are arranged.

When we form an enolate, the base (t-BuOK) will abstract a proton alpha to the carbonyl. The alpha positions are adjacent to the carbonyl. In a cyclohexanone, the alpha carbons are positions 2 and 6 (since the ketone is at 1). So, in this case, the carbonyl is at 1, so positions 2 and 6 are alpha.

But wait, the substituents on the cyclohexanone are at positions 2 (ethyl and methyl)
