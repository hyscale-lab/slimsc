Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where we write down all possible operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries but with higher dimension terms. So the operators must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model, right?

Wait, but what are the Standard Model symmetries? The Standard Model has the gauge symmetry SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), but I think the question is about spacetime symmetries like Lorentz, Poincare, etc.

Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if Poincare is a bigger symmetry, then if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So which of these symmetries are required?

Wait, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Effective theories don't necessarily have the same symmetry as the UV complete theory. Wait, no, SMEFT is built to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the operators must have the same symmetries as the Standard Model.

Wait, the Standard Model does respect Poincare symmetry. Because all local theories in relativity respect Poincare. So the operators in SMEFT must be Poincare invariant.

But wait, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if the operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz symmetry. So if the question is which must be respected, then if Poincare is required, Lorentz is automatically required. But looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2, which are Lorentz and Poincare. But wait, the options are about which must be respected by all operators. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. But does SMEFT require respecting Poincare?

Wait, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because the Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT is an effective theory based on it. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. But do they have to respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, Poincare includes translations. Effective theories usually break translation symmetry because they are non-renormalizable and have higher dimension operators. Wait, but higher dimension operators don't break Lorentz symmetry because the terms are like derivatives or fields. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the operators in SMEFT are local, so they should respect Lorentz symmetry. But translation symmetry is about shifting the spacetime coordinates. Effective theories are built in a way that they are Lorentz-invariant but not necessarily Poincare invariant? Or do they also respect Poincare?

Wait, no. The effective theory is constructed to be Lorentz-invariant, but when you include higher-dimension operators, you might have terms that are not invariant under translations because they might have different scaling. Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are built from the Standard Model fields and their derivatives, so the Lagrangian is constructed to be Lorentz-invariant. So the operators respect Lorentz symmetry.

Wait, but Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translation. Since the effective theory is built in a way that the Lagrangian is Lorentz-invariant, but the operators might not necessarily respect translation symmetry. Because effective theories can be non-relativistic, but wait, SMEFT is a relativistic effective theory.

Wait, I think that in SMEFT, all operators are Lorentz-invariant, so they must respect Lorentz symmetry. Also, being a field theory, it's Poincare-invariant because it includes spacetime translation. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well? Or is that not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, maybe SMEFT doesn't have to respect Poincare symmetry because it's a low-energy effective theory and the energy scale affects the symmetries.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about what each symmetry implies. Poincare symmetry includes translations, so the theory must be invariant under shifting the coordinates. But in an effective theory, especially one constructed with higher dimension operators, how does this affect things? For example, the operators would have different scaling with the energy scale Λ. But the structure of the Lagrangian would still need to be Poincare-invariant because the theory is supposed to describe physics at lower energies but respecting the same spacetime symmetries.

So perhaps all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. That would mean option A) 1 and 2 would be correct. But looking at the answer options, option A is 1,2.

Wait, but the question is which of the following must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare is a requirement, Lorentz is automatically required.

Wait, but I've heard that in effective theories, only Lorentz symmetry is preserved, not necessarily Poincare. Because the effective theory is built at a certain scale, and translations are part of the full symmetry but perhaps not the effective theory's symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe Poincare symmetry is a subset of the symmetries that are part of the Standard Model, so any operator in SMEFT must respect it.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: Which of these symmetries are part of the Standard Model's symmetries that SMEFT must preserve. The Standard Model is a Poincare-invariant theory, so SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but wait. The Standard Model has Poincare symmetry because it's a Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant theory. So SMEFT, which is an effective theory built from the Standard Model, must also respect Poincare.

So if operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare, then they must respect Lorentz as well because Lorentz is a subset.

But the question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare is a must, then Lorentz is included. But the options include both 1 and 2.

Wait, the options are 1. Lorentz, 2. Poincare. So the possible answers include options where both are correct. Let's look at the answer options. Option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2. So if both are required, then answer would include 1 and 2. But what about the others?

Now, CP and CPT symmetries. The Standard Model is not CP-symmetric because of the CKM problem and other CP-violating effects. So SMEFT can have operators that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

What about CPT? The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry. So any effective theory based on the Standard Model must respect CPT as well. Because CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, right?

Wait, but in the Standard Model, CPT is a symmetry, but some theories beyond the Standard Model can violate CPT. But wait, no, I think CPT is a more fundamental symmetry. In any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT must be a symmetry. Because in quantum field theory, the LSZ formula and the axioms require CPT symmetry.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So Lorentz symmetry implies CPT symmetry? Or is it the other way around? Because in QFT, the combination of C, P, and T symmetries can vary, but CPT is always a symmetry if the theory is Lorentz-invariant.

Wait, from what I remember, any Lorentz-invariant theory must have CPT symmetry. Because the charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal transformations are all connected through Lorentz symmetry. So if a theory respects Lorentz, it must respect CPT.

So if all operators in SMEFT respect Lorentz symmetry (which I think they do), then they automatically respect CPT symmetry.

So that would mean that 4 is a must.

So let me recap the symmetries:

1. Lorentz symmetry: must be respected because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory.

2. Poincare symmetry: must be respected because SMEFT is built from SM, which respects Poincare.

Wait, but if they must respect Poincare, but if all operators must be Poincare-invariant, then they must be Lorentz and translation invariant too. But the question is giving 1 and 2 as separate options. So perhaps the correct answer includes both 1 and 2.

Wait, but Poincare is Lorentz plus translation. So if all operators are Poincare-invariant, Lorentz is automatically satisfied. So the question is, which of these must be satisfied by the operators. So the operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare, which implies Lorentz.

But the question presents Lorentz and Poincare as separate options, so the correct answer would include both 1 and 2, as well as 4 (CPT), making option C (1,2,4) correct.

Wait, but let me think again: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must respect Lorentz (1 is correct). Also, since it's a Poincare-invariant theory (as it's built from SM, which is Poincare-invariant), all operators must respect Poincare (2 correct). Also, because it's Lorentz-invariant, it must be CPT-invariant (4 correct). So the correct answer would include 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer is C.

But wait, what about the Poincare thing? Does SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry? Well, the Standard Model does, so SMEFT should as well. So operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare.

So putting it all together:

Must be respected by all operators:
1. Lorentz Symmetry (Yes)
2. Poincare symmetry (Yes)
4. CPT symmetry (Yes)
3. CP symmetry (No, because SMEFT can have CP violating operators)

So the answer is option C: 1,2,4.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM), including spacetime symmetries. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and its operators are built from SM fields and their derivatives, ensuring Lorentz symmetry. Poincaré symmetry, which combines Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry, is also respected by SMEFT because the SM, from which SMEFT is derived, is Poincaré-invariant. Since Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, the operators in SMEFT must respect both.

CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, and any Lorentz-invariant theory, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry. However, CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by SMEFT, as the SM already allows for CP violation (e.g., through the CKM mechanism), and SMEFT can include operators that violate CP symmetry.

Analyzing the options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: Must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.  
2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.  
3. **CP Symmetry**: Not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT.  
4. **CPT Symmetry**: Must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Thus, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
