Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed.

Wait, wait. First, I should make sure I understand the structure of the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, the "d" probably stands for deuterium. Oh, right, benzene rings can have deuterium substitution. So the molecule is bromobenzene with deuterium in position 2. So, the bromine is in position 1, and the deuterium is in position 2 of the benzene ring.

Now, the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. Also, when it's used in ammonia, especially at low temperatures, it's typically involved in elimination or dehydrohalogenation reactions. Wait, but wait—this is a benzene ring; what reactions could happen here?

Oh, wait! Benzene rings with substituents can undergo various reactions. In this case, the substituents are Br and D (deuterium). Let me think. One possibility is that the bromide leaves, but wait, benzene is stable, so maybe elimination isn't the way. Alternatively, considering aromatic substitution.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. It's used to deprotonate things. Where are the acidic protons here? In benzene rings, the alpha protons (ortho to substituents) are more acidic. So, the deuterium is in position 2, which is ortho to the bromine in position 1. Hmm, but wait, the deuterium is a substituent itself. So, maybe the protons in the ring are the acidic ones.

Wait, but the starting material has a deuterium in position 2. So, that position is already occupied. So, the other positions—let's see, benzene is a six-membered ring. The substituents are at positions 1 (Br) and 2 (D). So positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 are available.

But wait, with NaNH2, the question is about deprotonation. So, which protons are acidic enough to be deprotonated by such a strong base?

In benzene rings, typically the para position is deprotonated, but wait, sometimes ortho and para positions are possible. But in this case, the substituents are at 1 and 2, so the available Hs are at positions 3,4,5,6. Let's see their positions relative to Br and D.

The bromine is a strong electron-withdrawing group. Ortho and para to Br would have more acidic protons because the EWG increases acidity. So, in our case, the Br is at position 1. The o- positions are 2 and 6. But position 2 is already occupied by D. So, only position 6 would be ortho to Br, but position 6 is available. Wait, no: position 2 is deuterium, so position 6 is adjacent to Br. So
