Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, I need to find the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the inner walls, given that currently one-third reach it. Let me think through this.

First, I remember that Lorentz factor (gamma) is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. The particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, so gamma is significant. The detector is a sphere with a radius of 30 meters.

Wait, the problem says that on average, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So, that means the time it takes for them to reach the walls is such that only a fraction of them make it. I think this has to do with their lifetime and the distance they travel before decaying.

Oh right, when particles are created, they travel until they decay. So the ones that reach the detector's walls are those that don't decay quickly enough. The average lifetime is dilated due to their high velocity, so their lifetime as measured in the lab frame (detector's frame) is gamma times their proper lifetime (tau). Proper lifetime is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame.

So the time the particle has to travel is t = gamma * tau. The distance they can travel is v * t. But since they're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, I should probably express it in terms of the speed of light, c.

Wait, but for ultra-relativistic particles, v is approximately c. So the distance they can travel before decaying is approximately (gamma * tau) * c.

But the detector has a radius of 30 meters. So the maximum distance a particle can travel without decaying to reach the detector's wall is 30 meters. So, 30 = gamma * tau * c.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because particles are created at the center, so the distance they have to cover is 30 meters. So if a particle's lifetime allows it to travel 30 meters, it will reach the wall. Otherwise, it decays before that.

So the fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on how much their lifetime is. So if the average fraction is 1/3 now, that implies that on average, their lifetime is such that only 1/3 reach 30 meters.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me approach it differently. Let's model this probabil
