Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with compound A, which is C3H6. Let's see what that could be. C3H6 is either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, but propene is more likely because when it undergoes bromination in CCl4, that's a typical addition reaction for alkenes. Cyclopropane might not react the same way. So I think A is propene.

So, compound A (propene, C3H6) undergoes bromination in CCl4. That's probably an addition reaction. Propene has a double bond, so bromine adds across the double bond. The product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when propene (CH2=CH2CH3) reacts with bromine, it adds across the double bond, so the product is 1,2-dibromopropane. Correct.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base. So, what's B? It's 1,2-dibromopropane. When 1,2-dibromide reacts with alcoholic KOH, it's an E2 elimination reaction. So two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons. The KOH would abstract a beta hydrogen, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond. So the product C would be propene again? Because we started with propene and added Br, then removed it. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the initial compound is propene, but when you add Br, you get 1,2-dibromopropane. When you eliminate two Brs, you can form either propene or maybe something else? Or wait, maybe the initial product after bromination is 1-bromo-1-propene? No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacting with Br2 in CCl4 would add Br across the double bond. So the product is 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double
