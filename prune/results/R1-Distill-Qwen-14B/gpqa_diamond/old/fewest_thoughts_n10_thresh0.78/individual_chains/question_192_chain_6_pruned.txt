Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the setup: There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity, which means a hollow space. The center of this cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and since r is less than R, the cavity is entirely inside the conductor. 

Then, someone places a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the spherical conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and it's also at a distance l from the center of the cavity. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm. So point P is outside the conductor since L is greater than R. The options given involve different expressions for E, so I need to remember how electric fields work in conductors, especially when there are cavities involved.

Wait, I remember something about conductors and charges. When a conductor is neutral, any charge placed inside a cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when we put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the charge +q will attract negative charges to the inner surface. But since the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it out.

So the outer surface has a charge +q. But wait, the conductor was uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero, but the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q. So the total conductor's charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0. That makes sense.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So when we're outside a conductor, the electric field is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. That's the shell theorem or something like that. So for a spherical charge distribution, the external field is the same as a point charge located at the center.

In this case, the outer surface has
