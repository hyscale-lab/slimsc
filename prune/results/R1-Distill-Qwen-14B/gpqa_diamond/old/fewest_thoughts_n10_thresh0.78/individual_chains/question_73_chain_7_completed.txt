Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy. The options are given, so maybe I can calculate each part separately.

First, relative speed. Wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Galilean addition (v = u + w) doesn't apply at high speeds. I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. Oh right, the formula is (v - u) / (1 - (vu)/(c²)). Or wait, wait, no, actually, if two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (v - u)/(1 + (vu)/(c²))... or is it (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/(c²))? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, the correct formula for the relative speed from the perspective of one observer to another. Suppose observer A is moving at speed u with respect to the rest frame, and observer B is moving at speed v in the same direction as A. Then, the speed of B relative to A is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Right, that's the formula. So in this case, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction, so I have to find the relative speed of the 3m astronaut (moving at 0.5c) as seen from the 2m astronaut (moving at 0.6c) or vice versa? Wait, the problem says "relative speed", which is typically the speed of one with respect to the other. So I should calculate the speed of the 3m astronaut relative to the 2m astronaut's frame.

Wait, no. The problem says 'relative speed' between them. So it's the speed of one as seen from the other. Let me clarify: astronaut A (2m) is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B (3m) is moving at 0.5c, but wait, aren't they moving in the same direction? So from A's frame, what is B's speed? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, the problem says both are moving in the positive x-direction. So if A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c, but wait that can't be right because 0.6c is faster than 0.5c. So from the rest frame, A is ahead of B? Or are they on two different objects moving in the same direction but at different speeds.

Wait, no, the problem says both are moving in the positive x-direction. So, from the rest frame, A is moving faster than B. So from A's frame, B would be moving backwards? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, relative velocity depends on the frame you're in.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this. Let's take the 2m astronaut as the one moving at 0.6c, and the 3m astronaut at 0.5c. So from the rest frame, 2m is moving faster. So from the perspective of the 2m astronaut, how fast is the 3m moving?

Wait, no. Wait, in the rest frame, if 2m is moving at 0.6c and 3m at 0.5c, then the 3m astronaut is actually moving slower. So from the 2m's frame, the 3m would be moving at a speed relative to him. Let me apply the formula.

Wait, the formula for relative velocity is (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the frame, and v is the velocity of the object as seen from the rest frame. So, if we’re in the 2m astronaut's frame, then u is 0.6c. The 3m astronaut's velocity in the rest frame is 0.5c. So, from the 2m's perspective, the 3m's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. Numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c is (-0.1c). Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 -0.3=0.7.

So relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. Negative indicates direction. But speed is positive, so 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. So looking at the options, I see options C and D have 0.14c for relative speed.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did the formula correctly. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken u as the 3m's speed and v as the 2m's speed. No, no, the formula is (v' = (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/(c²))), where u is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the rest frame. So in this case, the rest frame is the one where the 2m astronaut is moving at 0.6c. So from 2m's frame, the 3m's velocity is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Yes, that would be correct. So the relative speed is about 0.1428c, approximately 0.14c. So in the options, C and D have this speed. So that's the relative speed part.

Now the second part: the total energy of the system. Hmm, each astronaut has their own relativistic energy. The total energy would be the sum of their energies.

The relativistic energy for each is gamma * m c². So for the 2m astronaut, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v is 0.6c.

Gamma_2m = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy for 2m: 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the 3m astronaut, v is 0.5c.

Gamma_3m = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Energy for 3m: 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is a bit off.

So the correct option would have relative speed 0.14c and E=5.96 mc², which is option C.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. For the 3m astronaut, 0.5c, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. Square root is about 0.866. So 1/0.866 is about 1.1547, correct. Multiply by 3m: 3 * 1.1547 ≈ 3.464 m c². So 2.5 + 3.464 is about 5.964, yes.

So the energy is about 5.96 mc², and the relative speed is 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C has both. So the answer must be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system based on the given data.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction in special relativity is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{vu}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.6c \) (velocity of the 2m astronaut in the rest frame),
- \( v = 0.5c \) (velocity of the 3m astronaut in the rest frame).

Substituting the values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the speed is positive, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the 2m astronaut (\( v = 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_{2m} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_{2m} = \gamma_{2m} \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the 3m astronaut (\( v = 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_{3m} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_{3m} = \gamma_{3m} \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_{2m} + E_{3m} = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96mc^2 \)**
