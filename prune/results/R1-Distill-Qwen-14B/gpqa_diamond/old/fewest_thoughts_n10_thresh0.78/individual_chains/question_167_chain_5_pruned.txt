Okay, so I have to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that the Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states. The state given here is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. And N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). 

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So I should plug those in. Let me compute N first. 

Phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. Sin(2phi) is sin(-pi/2) which is -1. Then exp(-2 alpha²) with alpha 0.5 is exp(-2*(0.25))= exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So sin(2phi)*exp(-2 alpha²) is (-1)*(0.6065) ≈ -0.6065. 

Wait, but N is the square root of (1 plus that term). So 1 + (-0.6065) is 0.3935. The square root of 0.3935 is approximately 0.627. So N ≈ 0.627. Let me check that calculation again. 2 alpha squared is 0.5, so exp(-0.5) is indeed about 0.6065. And sin(2phi) is -1, so multiply those gives -0.6065. Adding 1 gives 0.3935. Square root is around 0.627.

So the state is normalized, right? Because N ensures that. So |psi> is (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ) / 0.627. 

Wait, cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, around 0.7071. And sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, about -0.7071. So the state is [0.7071 * |0.5> - 0.7071 * |-0.5> ] / 0.627.

But the question is about non-Gaussianity. The relative entropy is given by del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the state's density matrix and tau is a Gaussian reference state's density matrix.

Wait, I remember that Gaussian states include coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states, etc. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity would measure how non-Gaussian the state is, with higher values indicating more non-Gaussian.

But wait, for a state that's a Gaussian state, the relative entropy would be zero because it's compared to itself, or maybe another Gaussian. But if the state isn't Gaussian, del_b would be positive.

So the question is, is the given state a Gaussian state or not? Because if it's a Gaussian, then nG is zero.
