Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics, specifically dealing with vectors and expression constructs. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The question describes a scenario where a researcher has created a bicistronic vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes, right? So in this case, the ligand and the receptor are each under their own regulatory elements in the same vector. 

The vector is a lox-Cre construct. From what I remember, loxP sites are used for recombination. The Cre-lox system is commonly used for conditional gene expression or to knock out genes in specific tissues. So when Cre is present, it can excise certain parts of the DNA.

Looking at the vector setup: the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), and then mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, with an IRES element upstream. The IRES is an internal ribosome entry site. IRES elements allow for the translation of a second gene without the need for a stop codon and a new ribosome binding site because they drive internal initiation. So when the first gene is translated, the ribosome can fall off and restart at the IRES for the second gene.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong constitutive promoter, so it should drive expression of the ligand. The receptor is after the IRES, which probably means it's under the same promoter as the ligand? Or maybe the IRES is part of a separate regulatory setup. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. 

The stops for each ORF are in loxP and lox2272 cassettes. LoxP is a 34 bp recognition site for Cre, and lox2272 is a variant. So in the vector, the ligand is followed by a stop with loxP sites. The receptor has a lox2272 stop cassette. 

When Cre is present, it can recombine these sites. So if you have a Cre-expressing cell, the stop cassettes would be removed. That would allow the downstream genes (mCherry for ligand, eGFP for receptor) to be expressed because the stop is gone. 

The researcher used this vector in primary astrocyte culture and transfected it. They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and did a Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, which suggests that the loading was correct. But when they bred mice homozygous for the construct into a wild-type background and crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, the offspring didn't show a green signal under the confocal. 

SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre mice would express Cre under the control of SOX10, meaning Cre is active in neural crest cells, including the cells that give rise to astrocytes and other glial cells. 

So the idea is that in the offspring, SOX10-Cre would activate the Cre-lox system in neural crest-derived cells. That should excise the stop cassettes, allowing both the ligand and receptor to be expressed along with their respective fluorescent tags. 

But in the experiment, the green signal (from eGFP on the receptor) wasn't observed. Let's look at the options:

Option A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But why would that prevent eGFP expression? The question is about expression in the Western blot and fluorescence. So this might not be the issue. 

Option B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If the protein isn't trafficked properly, the GFP wouldn't be on the surface and might not fluoresce. But the Western blot would still show the protein, as it's a total protein lysate. So the blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, so if the receptor is made, it should show up. But in the question, the blot is successful because they see signals proportional to actin. So the presence of the protein would be detected on the Western, but maybe not on the GFP. Wait, but the eGFP is fused to the receptor, so if the construct is made, the eGFP should be expressed. Unless the eGFP isn't correctly processed. But the question says they don't see green, not that the Western blot is negative. 

Option C) The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The CBA promoter is constitutive, so enhancers might not be necessary. Unless the IRES isn't working without a certain enhancer. But the question says the ligand is under CBA, which is strong, so maybe the receptor's expression relies on the IRES and another promoter. Wait, I'm not sure about that.

Option D) The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP might not be correctly translated. So the eGFP would be expressed but possibly truncated or not functional, leading to no fluorescent signal. But the Western blot would still detect the receptor, assuming the antibody is against the receptor. Hmm. Alternatively, if the eGFP is not in frame, the receptor might not be expressed because the stop codon is after the loxP. Wait, the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So perhaps when the lox2272 site is recombined, the stop is removed, and the receptor-eGFP is expressed as a single protein. If the eGFP is out of frame, the protein might be truncated, but the Western blot should still detect the receptor. 

Wait, but in the vector, the setup is that the ligand is first, then a stop, then mCherry. The receptor is after the IRES. So when Cre is present, the ligand ORF is flanked by loxP sites, so the Cre would remove the stop, allowing the ligand to be expressed with
