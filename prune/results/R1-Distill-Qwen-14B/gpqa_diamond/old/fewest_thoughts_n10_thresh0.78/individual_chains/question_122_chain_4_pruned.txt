Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions starting with acetic acid. Let me outline each step to understand what each product is.

Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm. Wait, I remember that when acetic acid reacts with acetic anhydride, it typically undergoes acetylation. Pyridine is often used as a base in such reactions. But wait, bromine is also present. Oh wait, maybe it's a bromination reaction. Wait, acetic acid has a -COOH group. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetylation of something else.

Wait, bromine in presence of pyridine and acetic anhydride... Oh, wait, maybe it's the formation of a bromide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid. When treated with acetic anhydride in presence of a base like pyridine, it's usually used for acetylation, like converting an -OH group to an ester. But wait, acetic acid has an -OH on the carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids are less reactive towards acetylation because they are deprotonated.
