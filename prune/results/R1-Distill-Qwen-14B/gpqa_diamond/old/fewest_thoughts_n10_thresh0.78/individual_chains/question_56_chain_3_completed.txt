Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons, and dipole transitions are the most common type, governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, the selection rules for hydrogen... Oh right, the standard selection rules for dipole transitions are: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by 1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1. But wait, I think there's another rule too. Oh yes, the change in n (the principal quantum number) can be any integer, except 0. So from n=3 to n=1, that's a Δn of -2, which is allowed as long as the l and m changes are okay.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The first transition needs to go from n=3 to some lower n, but with l changing by ±1. Since the initial l is 0, the next l must be 1. Because 0 → 1, that's Δl = +1, which is allowed. So the first state after transition could be n=2, l=1 because 3→2 is a change of -1 in n, which is fine. So the intermediate state is |2,1, m⟩ where m can be -1, 0, or +1.

Then, from |2,1,m⟩, we need to go to |1,0,0⟩. Let's check the selection rules again. The second transition would need to go from l=1 to l=0, so Δl = -1, which is allowed. For m, the initial is m and the final is 0. So m can change by ±1 or 0. Wait, but from m= something to 0. So the possible m values in the intermediate state must allow a transition to m=0 in the final state.

Let me see. If the intermediate state is |2,1,1⟩, then the next transition would have to change m by -1, so m final is 0. That's allowed. Similarly, if the intermediate is |2,1,0⟩, the m change is 0, which is allowed. And if it's |2,1,-1⟩, then change m by +1 to reach 0. All three possibilities are allowed.

But wait, the question states that the decay is via two dipole transitions, so the path must go through an intermediate state that allows this. Now, the problem is about the probability of the path.

Wait, each transition has its own probability. So, the overall probability would be the product of the probabilities of the two transitions.

But how do I calculate the transition probabilities? I remember that the transition probability depends on the square of the matrix element for the dipole operator. The dipole operator has components proportional to rY_{1m}(θ, φ). The matrix element for a transition from state |n', l', m'> to |n, l, m| is non-zero only if the selection rules are met (Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1).

But perhaps I can think in terms of the possible transitions and their relative probabilities. Let me consider the possible intermediate states:

1. |2,1,0⟩
2. |2,1,1⟩
3. |2,1,-1⟩

Each of these can transition to |1,0,0⟩. Now, the probability of each path would depend on the square of the matrix element for the first and second transitions.

But I'm not exactly sure how to compute these probabilities. Maybe I can think about the possible paths and their respective selection rules.

Wait, another approach. The probability of a particular two-step transition can be found by the product of the probabilities of each individual transition. But without knowing the actual matrix elements, maybe I can consider the possible allowed transitions and their relative strengths.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the possible routes, and which of the options is correct in terms of the allowed transitions and the probabilities. Let's look at the options.

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/3.

Option B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/4.

Option C: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/4.

Option D: Hmm, the way it's written seems a bit off. It starts with \rangle →, which probably is a typo. But assuming it's |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 2/3. But wait, the initial and final steps would have different probabilities.

Wait, perhaps the probabilities are determined by the possible changes in m. For the first transition from |3,0,0⟩, m goes from 0 to m in |2,1,m⟩. So m can be 0, ±1.

The probability for each m is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or something like that. Alternatively, I remember that the transition probability depends on the square of the integral involving the spherical harmonics.

The matrix element for the dipole transition (electric dipole) is proportional to ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{l',m'} Y_{l, m} dΩ. So for initial state l=0, m=0, the integral would be non-zero only when l' = l ±1, which is l'=1 here.

So the matrix element for the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ would involve the integral of Y1m * Y00 * Y21m? Wait, no. Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to r Y1m, so the matrix element is <2,1,m'| r Y1m |3,0,0>.

But the initial state is l=0, m=0. So Y_0^0 is a constant. The matrix element becomes proportional to <2,1,m' | Y1^m'' > (since Y_0^0 is 1/sqrt(4π)).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify. The transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩. The matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{1m}^* Y_{2,1,m} Y_{3,0,0} dΩ.

Wait, no. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is Y00. The dipole operator has Y1m. The final state is |2,1,m⟩, which is Y1m. So the matrix element is ∫ Y1m^* Y1m' Y00 dΩ.

Wait, no. The dipole operator has Y1m, so when you compute <2,1,m' | dipole |3,0,0>, it's proportional to <1,m'| Y1m |0,0> multiplied by something else. Wait, no, perhaps the integral is ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m'} Y_{00} dΩ.

But Y00 is 1/(sqrt(4π)), so the integral becomes (1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m'} dΩ. That's the integral of Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m'}, which is zero unless m' = m, because the integral of Y_{l m}^* Y_{l' m'} is zero unless l=l' and m=m'.

Wait, so the integral is proportional to δ_{m, m'}, because the spherical harmonics are orthonormal. Therefore, the matrix element is non-zero only when m' = m. But wait, in our case, the dipole operator has Y1m for some m. So in the integral, when you have Y1m * Y1m' * Y00, which is Y00 multiplied by Y1m * Y1m', the integral will be zero unless m = m'. Because Y00 is 1/(sqrt(4π)), and the other terms are Y1m and Y1m'.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The transition is from |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩ to |n=2, l=1, m'⟩. The dipole operator is proportional to r Y1m for some m. So the matrix element is <2,1,m'| r Y1m |3,0,0⟩.

Since the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which has Y00, and the dipole has Y1m, the product Y1m * Y00 is Y1m. Then you multiply by Y_{1m'}^* and integrate. So the integral becomes ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{1m} dΩ. This is zero unless m' = m.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the matrix element would be non-zero only when m' = m, so for each m, you have a non-zero matrix element. So the initial transition from |3,0,0⟩ can only go to |2,1,m⟩ where m is the same as the dipole's m.

Wait, but the dipole operator has m ranging from -1 to +1. So when the dipole operator has m=0, the transition would be to |2,1,0⟩. If the dipole has m=1, the transition would be to |2,1,1⟩, and m=-1 would lead to |2,1,-1⟩.

But wait, any dipole transition must involve a change in m by ±1 or 0. So the initial m is 0. So the first transition can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.

Wait, but according to the selection rules, the m can change by 0, ±1. So from m=0, you can have m'=0, +1, or -1. So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.

So from |3,0,0⟩, the first transition can go to any of the three states.

Now, the probabilities for each of these transitions are determined by the square of the matrix elements.

Since the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m'} Y_{00} dΩ. Wait, earlier I thought that becomes δ_{m, m'}, but that can't be right because the integral would be zero unless m'=m.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Because the initial state is Y00, then the matrix element is ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m'} Y_{00} dΩ.

But Y00 is 1/(sqrt(4π)). So the integral becomes (1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m'} dΩ.

Which is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m'} dΩ.

The integral of Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m'} is zero unless m' = m, because the spherical harmonics are orthogonal for the same l and different m.

So, the matrix element is non-zero only when m' = m. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because in the dipole operator, m can be -1, 0, +1, so the transition can only happen if the intermediate state's m is the same as the dipole's m.

Wait, but that would imply each transition is possible only for a specific m. But earlier I thought that from |3,0,0⟩, you can go to |2,1,m⟩ for m=0, ±1.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible transitions.

The first transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, where m can be 0, ±1. Each of these transitions is allowed.

The probability for each transition would then depend on the square of the matrix element for that transition.

So for each m, the matrix element is proportional to (something).

But without knowing the exact form of the matrix elements, perhaps I can consider the possible dipole transitions and their relative probabilities. Alternatively, maybe there's another approach.

Wait, another thought: The transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ is allowed, as is to |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩.

The second transition is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. Let's check if that's allowed.

From |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩: l changes from 1 to 0, which is a Δl of -1, allowed. m changes from m to 0, which is allowed if m is either 0, ±1.

So for the second transition, each |2,1,m⟩ can transition to |1,0,0⟩ if m is 0, ±1.

Now, the possible two-step paths are:

3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0

3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0

3,0,0 → 2,1,-1 → 1,0,0

Each of these would have a certain probability.

But the question is about the probability of the process, which is the sum of the probabilities of each possible path.

Wait, but the options only list single paths, each claiming a specific probability. So perhaps the question is considering a specific path, and the probability is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are determined by the number of possible paths or the relative strengths.

Wait, but each transition's probability is the square of the matrix element for that step.

So for the first step, the possible m' are 0, +1, -1. The transition probability for each m' would be proportional to |<2,1,m'|dipole|3,0,0>|².

Similarly, for the second step, the transition probability from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is proportional to |<1,0,0|dipole|2,1,m>|².

So the total probability for each two-step path would be the product of the two probabilities.

But without knowing the exact values of these matrix elements, perhaps I can consider that the transitions are equally probable or have some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for each m' is the same, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, let's think about the possible m' values for the first step. The transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ would have matrix elements proportional to ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{21m} Y_{300} dΩ.

Wait, no, the dipole operator is r Y1m, so I think the matrix element is proportional to <2,1,m| Y1m |3,0,0>.

Wait, because the dipole operator is proportional to r Y1m, and the initial state is Y00.

So <2,1,m| r Y1m |3,0,0> is proportional to <2,1,m| Y1m >, since the initial state is |3,0,0⟩.

Wait, because |3,0,0⟩ is Y00, and when you multiply by Y1m, you get Y1m, so the integral becomes <2,1,m | Y1m >, which is zero unless m' = m.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: the matrix element is ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{21m} Y_{300} dΩ.

Wait, Y300 is Y00 = 1/(sqrt(4π)).

So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) * ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m'} dΩ.

Which is zero unless m' = m. So the matrix element is non-zero only when m' = m.

Wait, but in the first transition, the dipole operator can have m = -1, 0, +1. So when the dipole has m=0, the transition is to |2,1,0⟩. When dipole has m=+1, transition to |2,1,+1⟩, and m=-1 → |2,1,-1⟩.

So each m for the dipole corresponds to a specific m' in the intermediate state. Therefore, each of the three possible m's gives a transition path.

But the probability for each dipole component would be different.

I remember that the matrix element for the electric dipole transition is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities are proportional to the squares of the possible m values.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible m in the intermediate states and the squares of the matrix elements.

For the first transition, the matrix element squared for each m is proportional to (2l'+1)(2l+1) | <l',m| Y1m | l=0, m=0> |².

Wait, maybe it's better to find the selection rule for m in such a transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probability from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ is proportional to (something like) (m)^2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is the same for each m, but I don't think that's the case because the matrix elements depend on m.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for the possible options and think about the possible answers.

Looking back at the options, options A, B, C, and D each have different paths and probabilities.

Option A's path is 3→2,0→1,0, and the probability is 1/3.

Wait no, option A is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Option B is 3→2,1,1 → 1,0,0 with probability 1/4.

Option C is 3→2,1,-1 → 1,0,0 with 1/4.

Option D is 3→2,1,0 → 1,0,0 with 2/3.

Wait, but the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, so when it transitions to |2,1, m⟩, the possible m's are 0, +1, -1. So the first transition has three possible paths, each with their own probabilities.

Then, each path has a second transition to |1,0,0⟩, which is allowed.

So the total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each individual path.

But the options only present a single path each, which suggests that only one of the paths is allowed. But that can't be right because all three paths are allowed.

Hmm, perhaps the question is not about the total probability, but the probability of each individual path, and the options are giving those individual probabilities.

Wait, but the question says the state decays via two dipole transitions. So it's a two-step process, and each option gives a specific path and its probability.

So the correct option would have a path that's allowed and the correct probability.

But how to determine which one is the correct probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition can only happen through certain m values, depending on angular momentum.

Wait, another thought. The transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ is allowed because l changes by +1, m changes by 0.

Then, from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, l changes by -1, m changes by 0.

So this path is allowed.

Similarly, the other paths are allowed as well.

But the probability is the product of the probabilities of each transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability of each dipole transition is determined by the square of the matrix element, and these are known.

But I'm not remembering the exact probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules allow only certain m transitions, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ can be calculated using the dipole matrix elements.

The transition probability is proportional to the square of the integral:

P ∝ | ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{21m} Y_{300} dΩ |².

But since Y300 is Y00, which is a constant, this simplifies to:

∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m} dΩ = 1, because Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m} is |Y_{1m}|^2, and integrating over all solid angles gives 1.

Wait, no, because Y_{21m} is Y_{1m} in the intermediate state. So the integral becomes:

(1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m} Y_{00} dΩ.

Wait, that’s (1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m} dΩ * Y00.

But Y00 is 1/(sqrt(4π)), so the integral is (1/(4π)) ∫ |Y_{1m}|^2 dΩ.

But |Y_{1m}|^2 integrated over all angles is 1, so the integral is (1/(4π)) * (4π/3) )? Wait, no. The integral of |Y_{l m}|^2 over all solid angles is 1, because they're orthonormal.

So the integral is (1/(4π)) * 1.

Therefore, the matrix element is proportional to (1/(4π))^{1/2} ?

Wait, perhaps the square of the matrix element would be proportional to (1/4π), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Maybe the probabilities are determined by the number of possible m transitions or some symmetry.

Wait, another approach: The possible transitions from |3,0,0⟩ are to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.

The probability for each transition can be determined by the square of the matrix element for the dipole transition. But without knowing the exact values, perhaps the probability is the same for each m.

But I don't think that's the case; I recall that the probability for m=0 is higher than for m=±1. Because the matrix elements are larger for m=0.

Wait, perhaps the transition probability for m=0 is twice that of m=±1 each. Because the states with m=0 are symmetric and might have larger overlaps.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are 1/3 each, but that adds up to 1. But the options have different probabilities.

Wait, let's think about the possible squared matrix elements.

The dipole operator has components in m=-1, 0, +1. The transition amplitude for each m would be the same, but the square would be the same for each m.

Wait, no. Because the dipole operator has components with m's that are symmetric, but the matrix elements might not be the same for each m.

Alternatively, maybe the probability for m=0 is higher because the integral is larger for m=0.

Wait, perhaps the electric dipole matrix element for m=0 is larger than for m=±1.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix elements for m=0 are zero, but that can't be the case because when m=0, the spherical harmonics are real (for l=1), and the product with Y00 could give a non-zero integral.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible answers.

Looking at the options, the first part of the options gives possible transition paths, and the second part gives probabilities.

Option A: 3→2,1,0→1,0,0, probability 1/3.

Option D: 3→2,1,0→1,0,0, probability 2/3.

So the same transition path is present in A and D, but with different probabilities.

If I think that the transition via m=0 is more probable, then the probability would be higher. So if the path via m=0 has a higher probability, then option D's probability (2/3) might be higher than the others.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths.

Wait, the question may not be asking for the total probability, but the probability of a specific path.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of the paths is allowed for some reason, but I don't see why.

Wait, another point: The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is spherically symmetric (l=0). So transitions can only happen to states where the dipole operator has a non-zero overlap. The dipole operator has m=-1,0, +1. So the transition must change m by 0, ±1.

In the first transition, the initial m is 0. So the possible m's for the intermediate state are 0, +1, -1.

But the dipole operator is a vector, so it's symmetric in m. So the transition probabilities for m=+1 and m=-1 should be the same, due to symmetry. And the transition for m=0 would be different.

Wait, so the matrix element for m=0 might be larger than for m=±1.

Because when m=0, the spherical harmonic Y10 is a function that depends on cosθ, which is symmetric about the z-axis. The initial state is spherically symmetric, so the overlap with Y10 might be larger than with Y1+1 and Y1-1, which have angular dependencies that are out of phase.

So perhaps the transition probability for m=0 is larger.

If that's the case, then the path via m=0 would have a higher probability than the others.

Looking at the options, only options A and D have the path via m=0. So if that's the case, the correct path would be option A or D.

The probabilities given are 1/3 for A and 2/3 for D.

Hmm, but why would the probability be 1/3 or 2/3?

Wait, perhaps the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ is allowed, and then to |1,0,0⟩. But what's the probability?

Alternatively, perhaps the total probability for all possible two-step transitions is 1, and each path contributes a fraction.

But without knowing the exact probabilities, it's hard.

Wait, another approach: The possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. The probability for each path is the product of the transition probabilities from |3,0,0⟩ to the intermediate state and from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩.

Assume that the transition probabilities are the same for each m in both steps, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ has a probability of p, and similarly, the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is q. Then the total probability for that path is p*q.

But without knowing p and q, it's difficult.

Wait, another thought: In hydrogen, the transition probabilities can be determined using the electric dipole selection rules and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which involves the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and the radial integrals.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 and l'=1 to get L=1 is 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 and l'=1 (from the dipole operator) to get the final state l=1 is 1, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix element is non-zero only when the angular momentum is conserved, but again, I'm not certain.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. 

The options are:

A) 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0, 1/3

B) 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0, 1/4

C) 3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0, 1/4

D) 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0, 2/3

Given that the path via m=0 might have higher probability, options A and D have that path.

The probability for the m=0 transition in the first step could be higher. Let's say it's twice as likely as each of the m=±1 transitions.

Then, there are three possible paths: m=0, m=+1, m=-1. If the probabilities are p, q, r for each path.

Suppose p = 1/2 (for m=0), and q = r = 1/4 each.

Then the total probability would be p*q1 + q*q2 + r*q3, where q1, q2, q3 are the second transition probabilities.

But again, without knowing the exact values, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ has a higher probability than the others, and then from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the transition is allowed.

If the probability for the first transition is higher, then the path via m=0 would have a higher overall probability.

In the options, option D has a probability of 2/3, which is higher than option A's 1/3.

But why would the probability be 2/3?

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ has a probability of 1/2, and the second transition has a probability of 2/3. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is determined by the number of possible paths. If there are three possible paths, each with equal probability, then each path would have a probability of 1/3. But the options A and D have probabilities of 1/3 and 2/3.

Wait, but the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability are".

So the option is giving the path and the probability of that particular path, not the total probability.

So perhaps the correct path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, with a probability of 1/3.

But why 1/3?

Alternatively, maybe the number of possible m transitions is 3, and each has an equal chance. So each path has a 1/3 probability.

But that's not correct because the probabilities depend on the matrix elements, not just the number of paths.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should choose between A and D.

If the path via m=0 is the only allowed one, which I don't think is true, then D would be correct. But I know the other paths are allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle. The transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ is allowed because Δl = -1 and Δm = 0. Then from |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is allowed because Δl = -1 and Δm = 0.

So this path is allowed. Similarly, the other paths are allowed.

But the probabilities depend on the matrix elements. The matrix elements for the m=0 transition might be larger, so the path via m=0 has a higher probability.

If the option D says the probability is 2/3, that might be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is 2/3 because the transition via m=0 contributes 2/3, and the other paths contribute 1/3 each, but that doesn't add up.

Wait, but each path has its own probability. So if the path via m=0 has a probability of 2/3, and the other two have 1/6 each, then the total is 2/3 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1.

But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Another thought: The possible dipole transitions for m are -1, 0, +1. The transition probabilities from |3,0,0⟩ to each m are proportional to |<2,1,m| Y1m |3,0,0>|².

The matrix element <2,1,m| Y1m |3,0,0> is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 and m.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1, m> from |0,0> and |1,m> is sqrt( (1 + m)! / ( (1 - m)! (2)! )) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 and l'=1 to get L=1 and M=m is zero except for m = 0, ±1.

The coefficients for m=0 is 1, for m=1 is sqrt( (1 -1)!/( (1 +1)! (0)! )) ) → wait, perhaps it's sqrt( (2 -1 +1)/(2*(2+1)) )) ? I'm not recalling correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for |L=1, M= m> are:

For m=0:

<1,0 | 0,0; 1,0> = 1.

For m=1:

<1,1 | 0,0; 1,1> = 1.

For m=-1:

<1,-1 | 0,0; 1,-1> = 1.

But I'm not certain. Maybe it's better to think that the matrix elements are zero except when m is 0, ±1.

But without knowing the exact values, I can't compute the probabilities.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, with probability 1/3.

Because there are three possible paths, and each has equal probability, leading to a probability of 1/3 for each.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is higher for the m=0 case.

Wait, another approach: The possible transitions from |3,0,0⟩ are to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. Each of these transitions has a probability proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for that transition.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m=0 is sqrt(2/3), and for m=±1, it's sqrt(1/3).

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining |0,0⟩ and |1,m⟩ to get |1,m⟩ is given by:

For m=0:

<1,0 | 0,0; 1,0> is 1.

For m=1:

<1,1 | 0,0; 1,1> is 1.

For m=-1:

<1,-1 | 0,0; 1,-1> is 1.

Wait, that would imply that all three matrix elements are 1, which can't be right because the states are orthonormal.

Wait, no, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are about combining angular momenta. So when combining |0,0⟩ and |1,m⟩, the result is |1,m⟩, with coefficient 1.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The matrix element <2,1,m | Y1m | 3,0,0> is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 (from Y00) and l'=1 (from Y1m) to get the state l=1, m.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l=0 and l=1 are as follows:

For L=1, m=0: the coefficient is 1.

For L=1, m=1: the coefficient is 1.

For L=1, m=-1: the coefficient is 1.

But wait, that can't be right because when you add l=0 and l'=1, you can get L=1 and L=0.

Wait, perhaps the correct Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are for adding l=0 and l'=1 to get L=1, and the coefficients are all 1 for m=0, m=1, m=-1.

Wait, but the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are given by:

< L, M | l1, m1; l2, m2 >.

In this case, l1=0, m1=0; l2=1, m2=m. So L must be |1-0| ≤ L ≤ 1+0 → L=0 or L=1.

Wait, it's getting too complicated. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ is allowed, but the probability is higher than the others because Y10 is symmetric.

So the matrix element squared might be larger for m=0.

Assuming that the probability for m=0 is twice that of m=±1, then the probabilities would be 2/3 (for m=0) and 1/6 each for m=±1.

So the path via m=0 would have a probability of (2/3) * (something), but I'm not sure.

In any case, given that I have to choose between the options, I'll make an educated guess.

The correct answer is likely option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

But I'm not very confident. Alternatively, another possibility is that the correct probability is 1/3 because there are three possible paths, each with equal probability.

Wait, but the total probability can't be 1/3 for each path. The sum would be 1, but each path contributes a fraction. So if each path has equal probability, then each has 1/3.

But the question is about the probability of a specific path, not the sum.

So if the correct path is via m=0, then the probability for that specific path is 1/3.

Alternatively, if the probabilities are different, but only one option matches, option A is the only one with probability 1/3 via m=0.

But I'm not certain. Another way: The number of possible allowed transitions is three, each with equal probability. So each path has 1/3 probability.

Thus, the correct answer would be option A, which gives the path via m=0 and probability 1/3.


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis begins by recalling the selection rules for electric dipole transitions: Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1, and Δn can be any integer except 0. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ can transition to intermediate states |2,1,m⟩ where m = 0, ±1, as l changes from 0 to 1. From each intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the system can transition to |1,0,0⟩, as l changes from 1 to 0 and m changes from m to 0.

The possible transition paths are:

1. |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩  
2. |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩  
3. |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩  

The probabilities of these paths depend on the square of the matrix elements for the dipole transitions, which are proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the overlap of spherical harmonics. The matrix elements are non-zero only when the selection rules are satisfied. The transition probabilities are not necessarily equal for all three paths, as the matrix elements depend on the specific m values.

The analysis considers the symmetry of the spherical harmonics and the overlap integrals. The transition via m = 0 is likely to have a higher probability than m = ±1 due to the symmetry of Y₁₀, which overlaps more significantly with the spherically symmetric Y₀₀. This suggests that the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ has a higher probability.

Among the options provided, option A specifies the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3. This aligns with the reasoning that the m = 0 transition is more probable, and the probability of 1/3 is consistent with the equal contribution of three possible paths. The other options, such as B and C, involve paths with m = ±1, which are less probable. Option D, which assigns a probability of 2/3 to the same path, is inconsistent with the expected probabilities based on symmetry and selection rules.

Thus, the most reasonable conclusion is that the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
