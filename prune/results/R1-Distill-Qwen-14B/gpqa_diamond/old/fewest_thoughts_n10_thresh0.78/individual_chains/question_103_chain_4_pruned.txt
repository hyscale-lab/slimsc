Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can be tricky. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, breaking that down, it's a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). The phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5: a bromine and a nitro group, respectively. So the structure should be a benzene ring with a ketone group (COCH3) attached. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)C=O, right? No, wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-, so the ketone would be at position 1 of the benzene ring. Wait, but benzene doesn't have positions; the substituents are at specific positions relative to each other.

Wait, the name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one is the main chain. So the benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon (position 1 of ethan-1-one). So the benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl group, making it a ketone with a benzene substituent.

So the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the point
