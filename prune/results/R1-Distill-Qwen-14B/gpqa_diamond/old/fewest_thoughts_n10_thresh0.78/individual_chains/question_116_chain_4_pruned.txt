Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

The question starts with compound A, which shows two signals in the proton NMR. The first signal is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals tell us about the environment of the protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two neighboring protons, maybe from adjacent CH2 groups. The quartet suggests each proton is next to three others, like in a CH2CH2CH3 situation.

Looking at the integration: 6H as a triplet. That could be two equivalent CH3 groups, each with 3H. The quartet has 4H, which might be two equivalent CH2 groups. So putting this together, maybe it's a structure where two CH3 groups are attached to something that's next to two CH2 groups. Wait, like a diethyl group? No, wait, diethyl ether maybe? Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, another thought: If it's a triplet for 6H, maybe it's a (CH3)2 group where each CH3 is next to a CH2. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a compound where the CH3 groups are adjacent to a CH2 group that's split into a quartet. Let me think. Maybe it's a structure like (CH2CH3)2O, which is diethyl ether. Wait, diethyl ether's structure is CH2CH2OCH2CH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Diethyl ether is actually CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. So each CH2CH3 group is attached to oxygen. Let's see, the NMR for diethyl ether: the CH3 would be split by the adjacent CH2. The CH3 would be a triplet because each is next to a CH2 with two H. But in diethyl ether, each CH2CH3 group's CH3 would be a triplet. The CH2 next to oxygen would be a quartet because each H is next to two H on the adjacent CH2. Wait, but the integration would be for each group: each CH2CH3 has 2H in the CH2, and 3H in CH3.

Wait, but in diethyl ether, the two CH2 groups (adjacent to O) would each have 2H. Their NMR would be quartets because each H is next to the other H in the same CH2 and the Hs on the adjacent CH2. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. Diethyl ether's structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. The Hs on the CH2 next to O would each have two neighboring Hs on their own CH2 and two from the adjacent CH2, right? So each of those Hs would be a quartet, integrating to 4H (2 from each CH2). The CH3 groups would be next to the CH2, so each CH3 H would be a triplet, integrating to 6H (3 from each CH3). That matches the NMR data given for compound A: triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H). So compound A is diethyl ether. Yes, that makes sense.

Okay, moving on. Compound A undergoes monobromination to form compound B. So diethyl ether reacting with a brominating agent. Monobromination of ethers typically occurs at the less substituted position because it's more reactive. Wait, no, wait. Wait, diethyl ether has two identical CH2CH3 groups attached to O. So when it undergoes monobromination, the bromide would substitute at the oxygen. Wait, no, wait. Wait, substitution in ethers usually happens at the oxygen, but diethyl ether is symmetric, so it's not possible to have a mono-substitution because both ends are the same. Wait, maybe the question is referring to a different type of bromination.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the bromine is adding across the ether oxygen, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction, but that would form an alkene. Alternatively, maybe the diethyl ether is undergoing an SN2 reaction with something like HBr, but that would substitute one of the ethyl groups. Wait, but diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. If it reacts with HBr, would it substitute one ethyl group with Br? That would give (CH2CH3)OCH2CH2Br? Wait, no, because diethyl ether is symmetric, so substitution would occur equally on either side, but perhaps it's a different bromination.

Wait, perhaps it's an addition reaction. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the compound isn't diethyl ether. Wait, let me double-check the initial assumption. Are there other compounds that fit the NMR data?

Another option: maybe it's an ethyl propyl ether. Let's see: If the structure is (CH2CH3)CH2CH2-O-CH2CH3. No, that doesn't make sense because the integration would change. Alternatively, maybe it's tert-butyl something. Wait, tert-butyl groups have 9H as a singlet, so that's not matching here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the structure is a diethyl group attached to something
