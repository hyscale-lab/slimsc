Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopy techniques. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

The data provided includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

First, let's think about each of these techniques and what they can tell us.

Starting with the FTIR. The broad absorption around 3000 cm-1 is probably due to O-H stretching. A broad peak usually indicates hydrogen bonding, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's a strong hydrogen bond, like in a carboxylic acid or maybe an ester? Wait, no, esters have O-H in the carbonyl region, but maybe it's an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid. Or perhaps it's an -OH group in something else.

Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like conjugated double bonds or an aromatic C=C stretching). Wait, but aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600 cm-1. So if 1700 is a C=O, then 1650 could be another carbonyl, like maybe a conjugated system, or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with some conjugation, but that might not fit with the other data.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: 1650 could be an amide II band, but I don't see any options with N, so probably not. Alternatively, it could be an ester or a ketone. Hmm.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond somewhere. Maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would have both a carbonyl and a double bond adjacent.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. I remember that common fragments can be helpful. The fragment at 45 could correspond to a couple of things. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's m/z 91. Wait, 45 is lower. Let's think about possible fragments. Maybe a methyl group plus something? Or perhaps it's a ketene fragment? Wait, another thought: the m/z 45 is often the molecular ion of acetic acid (CH3COOH has a molecular weight of 60, but maybe a fragment). Or maybe it's a fragment that comes from the loss of something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the (CH2)2O group or something else.

Wait, what's the molecular formula? The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Let me think about each option and see which fits the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation calculation: For C6H12O2, the formula is CnH2mOx. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2n +2 - m - x)/2. So n=6, m=12, x=2.

DoU = (2*6 + 2 -12 -2)/2 = (14 -14)/2=0. So zero DoU? That means all single bonds, no rings or double bonds. But the NMR showed vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So that's a problem. So maybe this isn't the right one. Unless I'm miscalculating. Wait, let me double-check:

DoU formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. Oh, I must have made a mistake earlier. So DoU is 1. So that could be one double bond or one ring. So the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So that's possible.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. So could be two double bonds, or a ring and a double bond, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (14-10 -2*2)/2? Wait, no, let me compute correctly. It's (2*6 + 2 -10 -2)/2. Because X is O, but in the DoU formula, X is subtracted as 0 (since it's not like X in HX). Wait, no, wait, the DoU formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is halogens. Since there's no halogens, it's (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. Could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 -12)/2=1. So one DoU. So either a double bond or a ring.

Alright, so looking back at the data.

The FTIR has a broad peak at ~3000 cm-1, which suggests an O-H group. Then peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 is a strong carbonyl, probably a ketone or ester or aldehyde, but aldehydes have lower wavenumbers. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring if it's a lower wavenumber, but no, 1650 is more likely a conjugated carbonyl (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester), or maybe an amide, but we don't have N here.

The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. The presence of O-H and a conjugated carbonyl suggests something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone, perhaps.

Now, the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is the molecular weight of (maybe) (CH3)2O (which is 45? Let me check: CH3-O-CH3 is 2*(15) +12=42? No, wait: 12 + 3*1 + 16 + 3*1= 12+3+16+3=34? No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a carbonyl group plus something. Alternatively, the fragment might be a CH
