Okay, so I have this genetics question about barley and a compound that's making it unsuitable for food. The goal is to find out which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Let's try to break this down.

So, the problem says that there's a gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. They've done EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a type of chemical mutagen that causes point mutations, usually by altering the DNA structure, like adding or changing base pairs.

They sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon. Exons are the coding regions of the gene, so any mutation here could affect the protein structure.

Looking at the options:

The intact gene sequence is: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Hmm, let's compare. The first part of the wild type is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGT... so in Mutant 1, I see that where the wild type has TTCTCGC, the mutant has TTCTACG. Wait, let me count the letters. Wild type: T T C T C G C T G G... So mutant 1 has T T C T A C G. So the sixth and seventh positions are changing. So, the original is TCG, now it's TAC. So that's a base change in the middle.

Wait, but how does this affect the protein? Let me think about the amino acids. The change is from TCG to TAC. Let me get the codon translation.

In the wild type: TCG is Serine (Ser). In Mutant 1, TAC is Tyrosine (Tyr). So Ser becomes Tyr. That's a substitution. But is that enough to affect the function? Maybe, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach yet.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing again. Wild type is TTTCTCGC, and mutant 2 is TTCTAAGC.

Wait, let me look more carefully. The wild type starts ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... So the first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... So mutant 2 has ATG T T C TAA GCT GGT ACT... Wait, maybe I should split into codons.

Let's split the wild type and mutants into codons to see the
