Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. We have compound X, which is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and we need to identify what compound X is from the options.

Hmm, first, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a bicyclic amine, often used in certain reactions. Wait, I remember it's used in the Nazarov cyclization or maybe in the Wittig reaction? Or perhaps it's a base for some kind of elimination or ring-opening. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, right? It's used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes via the Prilezhaev oxidation. Or wait, maybe it's more about ring-opening epoxides? Or maybe it's involved in rearrangement reactions.

Wait, the reaction conditions are nonpolar solvent and high temperature (403 K), which is around 130Â°C. High temps sometimes indicate a reaction that needs heat, like elimination or possibly a Diels-Alder, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, all of them are oxiranes, which are epoxides. So the product of the reaction is an epoxide. So, Compound X must have a structure that, when reacted, forms an epoxide.

Wait, no. Wait, the product is the result of reacting X with this amine. So X could be something that, under these conditions, forms an epoxide. So perhaps X is an alkene that gets epoxidized.

Wait, but wait another thing. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is often used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes. Oh wait, but epoxidation of alkenes is usually done with peracids. Alternatively, this amine might be part of a different reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's a base that
