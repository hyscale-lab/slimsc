Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant.

Hmm, I remember that Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems. The Pauli vector σ is made up of the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz. So σ · n would be the dot product, which would be n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. And since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation, H|ψ> = E|ψ>, where E are the eigenvalues. Alternatively, I remember that for a 2x2 Hermitian matrix like the Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues are plus and minus some value related to the trace and determinant.

Wait, the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1. For example, σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But when we have a combination like σ · n, which is a sum of the Pauli matrices multiplied by components of n, what's the eigenvalue?

Oh right, because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have determinant -1 each. But when you have a linear combination, like a·σ where a is a vector, the eigenvalues depend on the magnitude of a. I think the eigenvalues are plus and minus the magnitude of a.

Wait, the operator here is H = ε σ · n. So σ · n is a unit vector direction because n is a unit vector. So the magnitude of σ · n would be 1, since each component of σ is multiplied by n_i, which is a unit vector.

Wait, no. Wait, the magnitude of the Pauli vector operator is... Hmm. Let me think. The operator σ · n is a 2x2 matrix. Each Pauli matrix has trace zero and determinant -1. But when you have σ · n, the matrix is (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz). The trace of this matrix would be zero since each Pauli matrix has trace zero. The eigenvalues of a 2x2 traceless matrix are plus and minus some value.

The trace is zero, and the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues. Let me compute the determinant of σ · n. Since σ · n is a sum of Pauli matrices, perhaps the determinant is the square of the coefficients? Wait, I think the square of σ ·n is (σ ·n)². Because each Pauli matrix satisfies σ_i² = I, and cross terms involve σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k.

So let's compute (σ ·n)^2. Expanding it, (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2. Each σi squared is I, and the cross terms are σi σj = i ε_ijk σk. So the expansion would be:

n_x² σx² + n_y² σy² + n_z² σz² + 2 n_x n_y σx σy + 2 n_x n_z σx σz + 2 n_y n_z σy σz.

Each σi² is I, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1 (since n is a unit vector), so that part is I.

The cross terms: 2 n_x n_y σx σy = 2 n_x n_y (i σz) because σx σy = i σz. Similarly, σx σz = -i σy, and σy σz = i σx.

Wait, let's compute each term:

σx σy = i σz → term is 2 n_x n_y i σz.
σx σz = -i σy → term is 2 n_x n_z (-i σy).
σy σz = i σx → term is 2 n_y n_z i σx.

But wait, when I expand (σ ·n)^2, the cross terms are 2n_x n_y σxσy + 2n_x n_z σxσz + 2n_y n_z σyσz.

So substituting each product:

= 2n_x n_y (i σz) + 2n_x n_z (-i σy) + 2n_y n_z (i σx).

Hmm, but when we add all these terms, what's the result? Let me factor out the 2i:

= 2i [n_x n_y σz - n_x n_z σy + n_y n_z σx ].

But wait, this is an expression for the cross terms. Now, adding all together, (σ ·n)^2 = [
