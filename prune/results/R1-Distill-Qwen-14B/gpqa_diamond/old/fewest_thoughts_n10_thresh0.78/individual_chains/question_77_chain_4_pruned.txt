Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions yet. But I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is about two reactions: the first one involves a compound reacting with BuLi and then H+, and the second is a Cope rearrangement under heat. I need to figure out the major products A and B and match them to the options given.

Let's start with the first reaction. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. I'll draw that structure to visualize it better. The benzene ring has a substituent which is a (CH2OCH2C(CH3)=CH2) group. Wait, no, let me parse that correctly. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with a methyl at position 3. Wait, but wait, butenyl is four carbons, so numbering starts from the end with the double bond at 2. So 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Let me write it out. The structure is:

The group is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- (since the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the substituent starts at C1). Wait, but 3-methyl would be a methyl on C3. So the structure would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH2-? No, wait, but wait, but the butenyl is four carbons, so positions
