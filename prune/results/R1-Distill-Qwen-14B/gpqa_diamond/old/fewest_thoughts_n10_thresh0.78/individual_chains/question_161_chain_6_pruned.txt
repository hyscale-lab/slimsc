Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Let me read through it again and think it through step by step.

So, Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment to improve imaging because fewer gas particles mean less electron scattering—right? Because if there's gas around, the electrons from the beam can hit those molecules and scatter, which would blur the image. So the vacuum pumps help create a super clean environment for better resolution.

But, even with all that pumping, some gas particles are still there. They detected this with a mass spectrometer, which makes sense because you can't get to zero pressure. So Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The factors like volume, pressure, and temperature would influence this. 

Now, the interesting part is when he starts the electron beam. He notices something about the mean free path. He finds that it's now λ2, which is different from λ1. But wait, the temperature is the same, so that shouldn't change the mean free path due to thermal reasons. Hmm.

So I need to figure out why the mean free path would change when the electron beam is on. What's different when the beam is active? The main thing I can think of is the electrons interacting with the gas molecules. When the electron beam is on, it's moving through the gas. The electrons might cause the gas molecules to ionize or maybe get excited, but more importantly, the beam's presence could cause the gas particles to scatter electrons, which is a different interaction than just the gas molecules moving around in the vacuum.

Wait, the mean free path of the gas molecules is based on their movement in the vacuum, right? So λ1 is based on how often these gas molecules collide with each other. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons are also moving through the system. Do the gas molecules interact differently with the electrons than with each other?

Oh, right, the mean free path can also be affected by interactions with other particles, like the electrons. So when Mike starts the electron beam, the gas molecules are now being hit by the high-energy electrons from the beam. These collisions can change the mean free path of the gas molecules because each time an electron hits a gas molecule, it's another collision event for that molecule.

So how does that affect the mean free path? The mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision probability. So if there are more collisions (because the gas molecules are colliding with electrons as well as each other), the mean free path would decrease. Because more frequent collisions mean the molecule doesn't travel as far before hitting something.

Wait, the original λ1 was calculated without considering the electron beam. So λ1 is the mean free path of the gas molecules without any external particles. But when the beam is on, the gas molecules are also colliding with the electrons. So the effective mean free path λ2 would be shorter because there's another source of collisions. So λ2 should be
