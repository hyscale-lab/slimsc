Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, so that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. I wonder what the structure could be. The NMR data is given, so maybe I can use that to figure out the structure first.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift. That makes me think of an aldehyde proton because aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes it can be an aromatic proton in certain situations, but the triplet suggests maybe coupling with two adjacent protons, or maybe an aldehyde next to some other group.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. That seems like aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted because two protons as a doublet. So maybe a para-disubstituted ring where each substituent is the same.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. Possibly another para-substituted ring or maybe part of a conjugated system.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singletâ€”maybe an exchange with something like an OH group? Or maybe some coupling with other groups. Could be vinyl protons adjacent to an electronegative atom or a conjugated system.

- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. That's a bit downfield for CH2. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2, or perhaps part of a di-substituted group. Like maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen, perhaps an ether or an ester.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula again. C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO, which can be rewritten as C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, X=0 here. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2
