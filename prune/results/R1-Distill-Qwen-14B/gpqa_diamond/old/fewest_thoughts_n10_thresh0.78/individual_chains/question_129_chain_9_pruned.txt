Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question carefully.

The problem gives a reaction scheme with compounds A to E. I need to identify compound E from the options provided. There are also some hints and an IR spectrum clue, so I should pay attention to those.

Starting with the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

The hints are a and b. Let's look at them.

Hint a says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes by reacting with a ylide. So compound A must have a carbonyl group (either aldehyde or ketone) since it reacts with a ylide to form an alkene.

Looking at the product of the Wittig reaction, the structure is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The substituents are at positions 1,2,4. Wait, the structure is a cyclopentane with a cyclopropane substituent? Or maybe a branch. Let me sketch this out.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-cyclopentane with a propan-2-ylidene group at position 4. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is like a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 group attached at position 4. So the cyclopentane has methyl groups at 1 and 2, and a substituent that's a propenyl group at position 4.

Wait, but the Wittig reaction forms a double bond. So compound A must have a carbonyl group. Let's think: if A is a cyclopentanone derivative. For example, if A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone, then the Wittig would add an alkenyl group.

Wait, the product after Wittig has the structure I described. Let me think about the starting carbonyl compound. Maybe A is 4-methylcyclopentanone? Or perhaps another position. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that when the Wittig occurs, it forms the correct substitution pattern.

Wait, another approach: the product after Wittig has an exocyclic double bond. So the ylide would have attacked a carbonyl group. Let me imagine the structure. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. Position 4 has a substituent which is an allyl group (the propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2?), but wait, propan-2-ylidene would be =CH-C(CH3)H? Hmm, maybe better to think of the structure as a cyclopentane with two methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a substituent at 4 that's a propenyl group attached via the double bond. Or perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane? No, wait, the substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the ylide would have added a propenyl group at position 4.

Wait, perhaps the ylide is a propenylidene group, which reacts with the carbonyl of compound A. So, if compound A has a carbonyl (like a ket
