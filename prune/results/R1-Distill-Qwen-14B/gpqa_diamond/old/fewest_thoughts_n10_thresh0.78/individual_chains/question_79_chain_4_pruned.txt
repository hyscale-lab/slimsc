Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data after a reaction. Hmm, I remember that NMR is used to determine the structure of molecules based on the signals their nuclei emit. So, the product of the reaction gives specific NMR signals, and from those, we have to figure out what the starting compound was.

The problem says that compound X is C11H12O. Oh, wait, and it was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I'm a bit fuzzy on that reagent. Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common base, often used in the formation of epoxides through the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides, but wait, no, maybe it's more about elimination reactions. Or wait, when you have a diene and an epoxide, perhaps it does something else. Wait, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base, often used in the Corey-Bakshi-Shibata (CBS) reduction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's part of the Sharpless epoxidation? No, that's more about epoxidizing double bonds. Wait, wait, maybe it's a base that deprotonates something. Oh, right, in some elimination reactions, like in the formation of epoxides from diols, but perhaps in this case, it's used in a different context.

Wait, the starting material is compound X, and the product is formed after this reaction. So the reaction is probably leading to an epoxide or something that would form an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination reaction, such as forming a double bond or an epoxide.

Looking at the options, all the options are epoxides with different substituents. So maybe compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction is a ring-opening or some kind of transformation.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. Let me look at the 1H and 13C NMR data.

The 1H NMR has the following signals:
- δ 2.28 (3H, singlet)
- δ 2.31 (3H, singlet)
- δ 6.75 (1H, doublet)
- δ 7.08 (2H, doublet)
- δ 7.68 (1H, doublet)
- δ 7.71 (2H, doublet)

And the 13C NMR:
- δ 21.3 (1C, s)
- δ 28.4 (1C, s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
