Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. Hmm, let's see what the problem says.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, so it's a two-dimensional problem. I remember that in two dimensions, the potential can sometimes be solved using polar coordinates, which makes sense here because r and θ are given.

I think the first step is to analyze the potential. Let me break it down. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks familiar. Oh, right! That's like the potential for a harmonic oscillator. In one dimension, the harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω² x², but here, it's in two dimensions and it's (1/2)kr². Wait, but k is usually the spring constant, which is mω². So maybe in this case, k here plays a similar role.

The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, that's interesting. Cos squared theta suggests some angular dependence. I think that can be expressed in terms of cos(2θ) using a trigonometric identity. Let me recall: cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)kr² * (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Let me compute that: (3/4)kr² (1 + cos(2θ)).

So the total potential V becomes:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² (1 + cos(2θ)).

Wait, maybe I should factor out kr² to simplify:

V(r, θ) = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/4)(1 + cos(2θ)) ].

Let me compute the constants inside the brackets:

(1/2) is 0.5, and (3/4)(1) is 0.75. Adding 0.5 and 0.75 gives 1.25, which is 5/4. And the (3/4) cos(2θ) term remains. So:

V(r, θ) = kr² [5/
