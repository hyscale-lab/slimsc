Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is asking me to arrange six substituted benzene rings in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo a monobromination reaction with excess bromine. The options are given as A to D, each with a different order.

First, I need to remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the directing effects of substituents play a big role. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) activate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions—ortho and para, usually. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) deactivate the ring and might direct to meta positions. But wait, some groups are strong EDGs or EWGs and might have a different effect.

The substituents in each case are:

1) С6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The methyl group is an EDG because of the +I effect. So it's an activating group. It should direct the incoming Br to the ortho and para positions. Since it's a single substituent, the major product would be a mix of ortho and para. But for the purpose of this question, they're considering the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for toluene, the para isomer might be a major product compared to some others.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: This is ethyl benzoate. The substituent is a carbonyl group attached to an ester. The carbonyl is an EWG because of the -I effect. So it's deactivating. But wait, the ester group (COOEt) is an ortho/para director because it's an electron-withdrawing group but still has some resonance effects. Wait, no, wait. I think I might be getting this wrong. Let me think. Esters have a carbonyl group, which is EWG. So they should deactivating and meta-directing? Or ortho/para? Hmm, I might be confused here.

Wait, substituents with EWG can be meta directors. But wait, some substituents are meta directors even if they are EDGs if they have a strong -I effect. Wait no, EDGs are activating and direct to ortho/para. EWGs are deactivating and direct to meta. So for ester groups, which are EWGs, they should direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. So in the case of ethyl benzoate, the substituent is EWG, so meta direction. So the para product would be minor, perhaps. So the weight fraction of para isomer would be low.

3) C6H5-Cl: This is chlorobenzene. Cl is an EWG due to its -I effect (since it's more electronegative), but because of its resonance effect, it's a weaker EWG than, say, nitro groups. Chlorine is a deactivating group but ortho/para-directing. So in chlorobenzene, the substituent directs the incoming Br to ortho and para positions. So the para isomer
