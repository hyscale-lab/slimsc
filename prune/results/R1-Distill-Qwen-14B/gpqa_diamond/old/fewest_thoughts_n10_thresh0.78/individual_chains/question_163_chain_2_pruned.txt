Okay, so I've got a chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. What's the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed, and what's the pH of the resulting solution?

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. When you add an acid to a hydroxide, they should neutralize each other. The reaction would be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with H+ ions to produce Fe^3+ and water.

First, let me write down the chemical equation. Fe(OH)3 is a base, and when it reacts with a strong acid, like HCl or H2SO4 (but wait, the acid is monobasic, so it's HCl, HNO3, etc.), each mole of H+ will react with one OH- from Fe(OH)3.

So the reaction should be:
Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

Wait, actually, each Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of H+.

Right, so first, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are in 0.1 grams.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH- is 17 g/mol. So for Fe(OH)3, it's 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.1 / 106.85 = 0.000936. So approximately 9.36e-4 moles.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve. So moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M (molarity), so volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters. Which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, but looking at the options, I see option C is 28.05 cm³, which is close. But wait, maybe I made a rounding error.

Wait, maybe I should calculate more precisely. Let me recalculate the molar mass.

Fe: 55.845 g/mol (exact?), O: 16, H:1
