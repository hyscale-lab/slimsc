Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, the potential V(r, θ) is given as (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I remember potentials in polar coordinates usually involve some kind of radial and angular parts.

Wait, so this potential is a function of r and θ. Let me break it down. The first term is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator in the radial direction. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, cos squared theta—maybe that can be expressed in terms of cos(2θ) using a trigonometric identity. Oh right, cos²θ is (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that into the potential, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Let me compute that: (3/2)*(1/2) is 3/4, so (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Wait, combining the terms without cos: (1/2 + 3/4)k r² = (5/4)k r², and then the third term is (3/4)k r² cos2θ. So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, maybe I can factor out (k r² /4), but perhaps there's a better way. Let me think about the form of the potential. The first part is a radial harmonic oscillator, and the second part depends on cos2θ, which suggests an angular component. So this might be a case of a particle in a central potential plus some angular perturbation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, or maybe the potential can be written in terms of a perturbation. Alternatively, perhaps it's separable into radial and angular parts. Let me see. Wait, actually, because r and θ are separate variables, the potential
