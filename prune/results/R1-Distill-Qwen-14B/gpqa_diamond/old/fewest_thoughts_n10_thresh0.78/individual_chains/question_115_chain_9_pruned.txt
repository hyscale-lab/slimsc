Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, they annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are one upper-right and one lower-right. I need to find the angle between them. The options are A)74, B)172, C)138, D)96.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a problem involving relativistic collisions and conservation laws. Since electrons and positrons are annihilating, their rest mass energy should be converted into the energy of the photons. But wait, the Lorentz factors are given, so I have to consider their relativistic energies, not just their rest mass.

First, I remember that when particles collide and annihilate, energy and momentum must be conserved. So I need to apply conservation of momentum and conservation of energy.

Wait, but since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. So I should calculate their momenta before the collision and make sure the photons' momenta add up to that same total.

But wait, electrons and positrons have the same mass. The electron is moving left, positron right. Wait, the electron is moving from the left, so its velocity is to the right, and the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left. Wait no, the question says the positron is moving from the right. Oh, wait, the horizontal axis is the same for both. So let's imagine a coordinate system where the positive x-direction is to the right.

So the electron is moving from the left, so along the positive x-direction? Or wait, no. If it's moving from the left, it's moving towards the right. So its velocity is in +x direction. The
