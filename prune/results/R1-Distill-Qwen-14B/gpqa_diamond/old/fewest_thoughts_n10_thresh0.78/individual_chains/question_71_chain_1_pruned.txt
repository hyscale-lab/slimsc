Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Hmm, it's about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. I remember TTV stands for transit timing variation, which I think is a method used to detect planets by looking at the variations in the timing of a planet's transit across the star's disk. But I'm not sure if that's super relevant here; maybe the key part is that these planets are in orbital resonance and have certain orbital periods.

The planets are labeled Planet_1 to Planet_5, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, I guess that means if Planet_1 has a period of P, then Planet_2 is 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P. Wait, but the question is about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So I need to find T_eq for each and then take the ratio.

The question says to assume they have the same albedo. Oh, right, albedo is the measure of how much light that hits a planet is reflected versus absorbed. If they all have the same albedo, then that factor cancels out when taking the ratio of their temperatures. So that's a relief; I don't have to worry about that.

Equilibrium temperature—so I should be recalling the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature. I think it's something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but wait, let me get this right. The formula for equilibrium temperature (assuming a black body and no greenhouse effect) is T = [ (L/(16πσ)) * (1 - A)/(a²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, A is the albedo, a is the orbital semi-major axis, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since all these planets orbit the same star, their L and σ are the same. Also, since A is the same for all planets, those factors will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the formula simplifies for the ratio of temperatures. Let me think: the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to sqrt( (L (1-A)) / (a²) ) )^(1/4? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of (L/(a²))^(1/4). Because the formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) ). Since A is the same for all, that part cancels when taking the ratio of T_eq between two planets. Also, R_star and T_star are the same for all planets, so those factors will cancel out in the ratio.

So the equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the semi-major axis. Because the semi-major axis a is proportional to the orbital period, assuming the star's mass is the same. Wait, Kepler's third law says that the orbital period squared is proportional to a^3, right? So P² ∝ a³. So a = (P^2)^1/3 * (some constant factor). So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

Wait, correct Kepler's law: P² = (4π²/G M) * a³. So a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²), so a ∝ P^(2/3). So each planet's a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So for Planet 2, P is 2P_1. For Planet 4, P is 3.5P_1. So a_2 is (2P_1)^(2/3), a_4 is (3.5P_1)^(2/3).

But wait, since all P's are relative, perhaps I can set P_1 as 1, so the periods are 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 5. So for Planet_4, P=3.5, so a_4 = (3.5)^(2/3). Similarly, Planet_2 has P=2, so a_2 = (2)^(2/3). 

But the equilibrium temperature formula, for each planet, T_eq is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2). Wait, no: T_eq is proportional to (L/(a²))^(1/4), so T_eq proportional to 1/(a^(0.5)). Because (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/a^(0.5).

Alternatively, wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me write the formula properly. The equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_eq = [(L (1 - A)) / (16 π σ a²)]^(1/4)

So T_eq is proportional to sqrt( (L (1 - A)) )^(1/4) * (1/a²)^(1/4) = (L)^1/4 * (1 - A)^1/4 / a^(0.5)

Since L, (1 - A), and other constants are the same for all planets, when taking the ratio, T_eq, say for Planet_4 over Planet_2, it's (a_2 / a_4 )^(1/2).

Because T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). So the ratio T4 / T2 is (a_2 / a_4 )^(1/2).

Wait, let me think again. If T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), then T4 / T2 = (a_2 / a_4 )^(1/2). Because T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a2), so the ratio T4/T2 = (sqrt(a2) ) / (sqrt(a4)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ).

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Let's say T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So T4 = k / sqrt(a4), T2 = k / sqrt(a2), so T4 / T2 = (k / sqrt(a4)) / (k / sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a4) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Yes
