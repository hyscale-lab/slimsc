Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving genes, ligands, receptors, and some fluorescent markers. Hmm, it's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the setup: They're studying a new ligand-receptor pair initially found in neural crest cells. The goal is to understand their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets making up the binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and before the receptor, there's an IRES regulatory element. 

Wait, I remember that IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, which can drive translation of a second gene downstream without a second promoter. So, the ligand is probably under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is after the ligand's coding sequence.

There are stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. So, between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a stop with lox2272. I think these are to prevent read-through from one gene to another. When Cre is introduced, the lox sites are recognized, and the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the genes to be expressed together.

They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression on Western blot. Actin loading is proportional to the signal, so normalization is okay.

They made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then, they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. Using Cre should induce recombination in the regions flanked by loxP or lox2272. 

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They don't see a green signal, which is from eGFP. So, the question is why.

The options are A to D. Let me go through each.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the experiment is about expression. The absence of green signal doesn't directly relate to paracrine vs. other modes. Unless the expression is not happening, but I'm not sure. Maybe this isn't the right answer.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. eGFP is a reporter for proper protein trafficking. If it's stuck in Golgi, it might not get to the cell surface. But the question is about the expression in the mouse. Wait, the Western blot uses total proteins, so even if the protein is in the Golgi, it should be present in the lysate. So why wouldn't eGFP show up? Also, the question is about the fluorescent signal in the mouse. If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps because the construct isn't working.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The construct uses CBA promoter for the ligand, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter. Wait, but IRES elements drive expression from the same transcript. So, without an enhancer, maybe the expression isn't happening. But the CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter. Maybe if the expression cassette is missing an enhancer, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the issue is elsewhere.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, wait, the construct is such that the receptor is fused to eGFP. If the stop cassette wasn't removed properly, the eGFP might not be expressed. Or more accurately, the fusion might not be correct. Alternatively, if the stop cassette hasn't been excised, then the receptor could be truncated. Wait, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP in a lox2272 cassette. So, when Cre is introduced (like with SOX10-Cre), which recognizes loxP sites, but lox2272 is a variant. Wait, can Cre recognize lox2272? I think lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre, but maybe only in certain conditions or perhaps it's a different recombinase. Alternatively, maybe the two stop cassettes are for different recombinases, but in this case, they used Cre. 

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct with loxP-stop-loxP before the ligand and mCherry, and lox2272-stop-lox2272 before the receptor and eGFP. So when Cre is introduced, it should cut both loxP sites and lox2272 sites. But I'm not sure if Cre can recognize lox2272. Wait, lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site. It has the same core recognition sites, so Cre should still recognize and cut it. So, using Cre would delete both stop cassettes, allowing both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so the Cre should be active in those cells. But in the offspring, the construct would have the Cre recombinase acting on the lox sites. So the ligand and receptor would be co-expressed in the same cells where Cre is active, which is neural crest derivatives, like astrocytes perhaps.

But in the experiment, they don't see green signal under the confocal. So eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

Let me think about the expression setup. The ligand is under CBA promoter. The receptor is under an IRES, which is after the ligand's coding sequence. The stop before the receptor is in a lox2272 cassette. So, under normal conditions (without Cre), the stop would prevent the receptor from being expressed. But when Cre is introduced, it should delete the stop, allowing the receptor to be expressed along with the ligand.

But wait, the eGFP is downstream of the receptor's ORF. So, in the vector, after the receptor's stop, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So when Cre cuts, the stop is removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed as a single transcript. But for that to happen, the stop must be removed, otherwise, the receptor's expression is terminated.

Alternatively, maybe the fusion is incorrect. If the stop wasn't removed, the receptor would be expressed as a truncated protein without eGFP. Or perhaps the eGFP is not in frame, so the fusion is not correct, leading to no eGFP expression. That's what option D says.

Wait, the vector is designed so that upon Cre recombination, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the ORFs of the ligand and receptor (plus their tags) to be expressed. So for the receptor-eGFP to be expressed, the lox2272 sites must have been cut, removing the stop. If that didn't happen, the receptor's expression would be interrupted, and eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. They crossed to SOX10-Cre mice, which are hemizygous. So the offspring should have the Cre under the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So the Cre should have recombined the lox sites.

Wait, but maybe the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is present. Or perhaps the Cre isn't present in the offspring? Wait, no, the parents are crossed, so the offspring would have the Cre.

Alternatively, maybe the stop cassettes haven't been cut. Why? Perhaps the Cre isn't working, but the SOX10-Cre is supposed to do that.

Wait, another thought: in the vector, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. The IRES allows for translation without a promoter. So, the ligand and receptor are co-expressed when the stop is removed. But in the Western blot, using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, perhaps they didn't detect the proteins. But the question says that the Western blot works for the total proteins. So maybe the proteins are expressed.

But in the mouse, when they cross to SOX10-Cre, the construct should allow expression of both ligand and receptor. But the eGFP isn't showing up in the confocal. So why?

Let me think about the expression. The vector is bicistronic: the ligand is 5', then a stop cassette, then the receptor with a stop, then eGFP. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor is not expressed. With Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, so both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP are expressed.

But the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So when they cross to SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the stops, allowing expression.

Wait, but in the question, the mouse is crossed to SOX10-Cre, and the offspring are born, but no green signal. So perhaps the Cre is not active in the cells expressing the construct.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the vector is set up, the Cre can't excise both stops. Or maybe the stops are arranged in a way that only one is excised, or perhaps the eGFP isn't being translated properly.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 sites are not recognized by Cre. Wait, but lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre. So that shouldn't be the issue.

Wait, another angle: the vector's two ORFs are under the same transcriptional unit. The first is the ligand under CBA promoter, then the IRES, then the receptor, and then eGFP. So when the stop cassettes are removed, the transcript would have the ligand followed by the receptor. But what if the stop isn't removed correctly, so the receptor isn't expressed?

But the problem is that the eGFP isn't showing up. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being properly expressed because the stop isn't removed, so the receptor's ORF is not translated, so eGFP isn't made.

Wait, but the vector has the ligand and the receptor in the same transcript. The ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP. So when the lox2272 stop is removed, the receptor can be expressed along with eGFP.

But if the stop isn't removed, the receptor's expression would be terminated, and eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor. If the stop wasn't removed, the receptor might be expressed but without the eGFP. But if the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP should be co-expressed.

Wait, but the problem is that the eGFP isn't showing up. Another thought: perhaps the eGFP is not being correctly expressed because it's in the same reading frame. If the construct has the receptor followed by eGFP in frame, then the fusion would be correct. But if the stop wasn't removed, maybe the eGFP isn't expressed. Or perhaps the stop is preventing the expression.

Wait, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So if the stop is present, the receptor would be expressed as a truncated protein, and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But when Cre is introduced, it should delete the stop, allowing both the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

If the Cre didn't delete the stop, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So why wouldn't the Cre delete the stop?

Wait, the vector uses loxP and lox2272. The SOX10-Cre is supposed to express Cre in neural crest derivatives. The construct is in a mouse, so the Cre would be active in the right cells. So perhaps the issue is that the lox2272 sites can't be cut by Cre, leaving the stop intact. But that’s unlikely because Cre can cut lox2272.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the vector is designed such that both stop cassettes are only flanked by loxP, but one is lox2272 and the other is loxP. So when Cre is introduced, only the loxP stops are cut, leaving the lox2272 stop in place. Or vice versa.

Wait, the ligand ORF has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, it can cut the loxP sites, but what about the lox2272? If the vector uses loxP and lox2272, perhaps the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. Wait, no, because Cre can recognize lox2272. So the lox2272 sites should also be cut.

Wait, but maybe the vector uses a different strain's Cre, which may not recognize the lox2272 sites properly. Or perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is expressed.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the way the vector is set up. The ligand is first, then the stop, then the receptor and eGFP with another stop. So when Cre cuts, the stop cassettes are removed, but the ligand and receptor are expressed in the same transcript. But for the eGFP to be expressed, the stop between the receptor and eGFP must be removed. If the Cre didn't cut that, then the eGFP wouldn't be present.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct, and the Cre is introduced, so the lox sites should be cut. But in the experiment, the eGFP isn't expressed. So why?

Another angle: the eGFP is C-terminally fused to the receptor. So if the stop is between them, and Cre doesn't cut, then the receptor would be expressed without eGFP. Alternatively, the eGFP is not co-expressed.

Wait, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So the ORF is receptor followed by a stop, then eGFP. So without Cre, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is not. Because the stop is in between. Wait no, the stop is in a lox2272 cassette. So without Cre, the stop would prevent the eGFP from being expressed. But when Cre is introduced, it deletes the stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed in frame.

But if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer could be that the stop wasn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why wouldn't the stop be removed? Because the Cre didn't cut the lox2272 sites. So perhaps the issue is that the stop between receptor and eGFP wasn't excised, so the eGFP isn't made.

But why? The Cre should have cut it. Unless the vector has the lox sites in a way that the Cre can't cut them. Alternatively, maybe the vector uses the same lox site on both sides (like loxP on both sides for the stop). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enhancer for the expression is missing. Wait, the construct uses the CBA promoter for the ligand. CBA is a strong promoter, so that's probably not the issue. But the receptor is under IRES, which is a weak promoter. So perhaps the expression isn't happening. But the problem is that no green signal is seen, implying that eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, another thought: IRES elements are often used to allow the translation of a second gene in the same transcript. But IRES can be cell-type specific. Maybe in this case, the IRES isn't working in the cells where the construct is expressed, so the receptor isn't being translated. But then the ligand would be expressed, but the eGFP wouldn't. So if the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP aren't, then in the Western blot, you'd see mCherry but not eGFP. But the question says the Western blot was done with antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, and the signal was proportional to actin. Maybe the blot showed ligand but not receptor?

But in the question, the Western blot was after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. So the authors tested expression in vitro before making the mouse model. But the question is about the mouse model.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct, so in their cells, the Cre would have recombined the lox sites. So why isn't the eGFP expressed?

Let me think about the answer options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So, if the stop wasn't removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But if the stop was removed, but the eGFP is not in frame, maybe the eGFP isn't made correctly. However, the eGFP would be a separate coding sequence after the receptor. So if the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are in frame? Wait, no. The eGFP is a separate ORF. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not being correctly transcribed or translated.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the eGFP is not in the same reading frame as the receptor, but that's not the case. The eGFP is a separate ORF after the receptor. So the stop is between them. If the stop is removed, the receptor's ORF is terminated, and the eGFP starts. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed at all, because the stop remains.

So if the stop remains, the eGFP isn't expressed. Why would the stop remain? Because the Cre didn't cut the lox2272 sites. But why?

Wait, maybe the vector uses a different type of lox site. I remember that loxP is the standard site, and lox2272 is a variant where the two sites are in a different orientation. Or perhaps the vector has loxP and lox2272 arranged such that the Cre can only cut one of them. Maybe the lox2272 is in a way that the Cre can't cut it, so the stop remains.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the stop cassette for the receptor-eGFP is flanked by lox2272 sites, and the Cre used (like the SOX10-Cre) doesn’t recognize lox2272. But I thought Cre can recognize lox2272.

Wait, another possibility: The vector uses a loxP site for the ligand's stop and a lox2272 site for the receptor's stop. The Cre used is a standard Cre, which can cut both. But perhaps the lox2272 site wasn't properly inserted, so the Cre can't cut it, leaving the stop in place. So the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

In that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop remains. But why would the lox2272 site not be cut? Maybe because the vector was designed incorrectly, and the Cre can't cut it. So the answer would be that the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Alternatively, if the stop remains, the eGFP isn't expressed because the ORF is terminated.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But I'm not entirely sure how the frame applies here. Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, leading to a frameshift and no eGFP protein.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the eGFP is a separate ORF. So the frame would only matter within the same protein. Since the receptor and eGFP are separate, their frames don't affect each other.

Hmm. Another angle: perhaps the IRES is not working, so the receptor isn't being expressed. But the eGFP is after the receptor, so if the IRES doesn't work, the receptor isn't expressed, and the eGFP isn't either. But in that case, the ligand would be expressed (since it's under CBA), but the receptor and eGFP wouldn't. So in the mouse, you'd see mCherry but not eGFP. But the question is about the absence of eGFP in the mouse, which is the case.

So why isn't the IRES working? The IRES is supposed to drive the translation of the receptor. But if the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor isn't expressed. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either.

Alternatively, maybe the CBA promoter is only for the ligand, and the receptor relies on the IRES. If the IRES isn't working in the cells (like it requires a certain condition or cell type), then the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

But the mouse model is in a wild-type background, so the IRES should be functional.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the stop cassettes weren't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed. So the eGFP isn't either.

But why? Because the Cre didn't cut the lox sites.

Alternatively, perhaps the loxP and lox2272 sites were in the wrong orientation, so the Cre couldn't cut them, leaving the stop cassettes intact. For example, if the lox2272 sites were in a way that they couldn't be cut, the stop would remain.

But if the vector was designed correctly, the lox sites should be in the correct orientation.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the vector uses a different recombinase recognition site. For example, the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP sites, and the receptor's by lox2272. But if the Cre used is a mutant that only recognizes one type, then only one stop is cut.

Wait, SOX10-Cre is a standard Cre, which should recognize both loxP and lox2272 sites. So the issue might not be that.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not correctly inserted, leading to no expression.

Wait, the other possibility is option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. But I don't see how that would affect the expression of the eGFP. Because paracrine means they act on neighboring cells, but the construct is designed to express both ligand and receptor in the same cell. So if they are in a paracrine relationship, that would mean the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells. But the technical issue here is why eGFP isn't expressed, which is about expression, not function.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps the eGFP is not being translated because the stop wasn't removed. But why? Maybe because the Cre wasn't active, so the stop remains.

Wait, but the SOX10-Cre is supposed to activate in neural crest cells, so the Cre should be active in those cells. So if the mice are born and the Cre isn't active, perhaps the construct isn't recombined.

Alternatively, maybe the vector didn't get into the germ cells properly, so the Cre isn't active in the right cells. But that's a technical issue, not one of the options given.

Looking back at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop wasn't removed, and the eGFP isn't present. But that would be because the stop remains, which would be due to the Cre not cutting the lox2272 sites. So why would the Cre not cut them?

Wait, another possibility: the vector has the loxP sites in a way that the Cre can't cut them. For example, perhaps the loxP sites are in the same orientation, leading to a deletion that doesn't remove the stop. Or perhaps the lox2272 sites are arranged in a way that the Cre can't cut them.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the two lox sites are the same, so when Cre cuts, it deletes a large region, including the receptor and eGFP. But that would remove both, leading to no eGFP.

Wait, no. The vector is ligand (with loxP stop), then receptor (with lox2272 stop). When Cre cuts, it should delete the stops, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the vector uses a loxP site upstream of the ligand and a lox2272 site downstream of the receptor. So the Cre would delete the loxP-stop between ligand and mCherry, and the lox2272-stop between receptor and eGFP. So both would be expressed.

But if the lox2272 sites aren't cut, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

So, going back to the options, which one matches this scenario.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the ORF is out of frame. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP isn't being translated because the stop remains, which is option D. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed. The most likely reason would be that the stop wasn't removed, preventing eGFP expression. But why wouldn't the stop be removed? Because the Cre didn't cut the lox sites.

But none of the options directly address the failure of Cre to cut the lox sites. So perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Alternative approach: think about the expression in the mouse. The mouse is homozygous for the construct, meaning both alleles are modified. When crossed to SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the stops in the construct.

If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't correctly positioned. Or perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is under a promoter that isn't working.

Another angle: perhaps the vector allows only the ligand to be expressed because the receptor's stop isn't removed. So, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor and eGFP aren't. So, in the Western blot, they'd see the ligand but not the receptor. But the question says the Western blot was done after transfection, not in the mice.

Wait, but the mouse model's expression relies on the Cre deleting the stops. So, perhaps in the mouse, the stops aren't deleted because the Cre isn't active. But the mice are born, so SOX10-Cre must be active.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me consider the options again:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine: Doesn't explain eGFP absence.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi: eGFP would still be present but not at cell surface. But Western blot would detect it; fluorescence would be present if it's expressed.

C) Enhancer missing: CBA is a strong promoter, so this is unlikely.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame: eGFP isn't expressed because the ORF is disrupted.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, leading to a frameshift and no eGFP. But how would that happen? Because the eGFP is a separate ORF, the frame wouldn't affect it. So, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being translated because the stop isn't removed, so D isn't the right answer.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship, so the ligand is secreted, and the receptor is on the cell surface. But that wouldn't prevent the eGFP from being expressed. So, I think A isn't the right answer.

Wait, another possibility: the IRES element is not working, so the receptor isn't being translated. So eGFP isn't expressed. But why? Because the IRES requires certain conditions. But the problem is that the Western blot showed expression of the proteins, suggesting that the construct is working. Or did it?

The question says that after the Western blot, the signal was proportional to the actin loading, which suggests that the blot worked. But whether the proteins were expressed is another matter. The Western blot was done after transfection to primary astrocyte culture, suggesting that in vitro, the construct might have worked but maybe not in the in vivo model.

But back to the options. The correct answer is probably D. Because if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But why would the stop not be removed? Perhaps the lox sites aren't recognized, so the Cre can't cut. But the options don't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So, when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't because it's not in frame, leading to no eGFP expression. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly address that. The closest is option D.

I think I need to make a decision. Based on the options, the most likely reason is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer is D.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand-mCherry fusion under the CBA promoter and a receptor-eGFP fusion under the control of an IRES element. The ligand and receptor are separated by stop cassettes flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites, respectively. Upon Cre recombination, these stop cassettes should be excised, allowing both the ligand and receptor to be expressed. The experiment involves crossing a mouse model homozygous for this construct with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, but no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand acts on neighboring cells, but it does not explain why eGFP is not expressed. The issue is about expression, not functional interaction. Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, eGFP would still be present in the cell and detectable via Western blot or fluorescence. Since no green signal is observed, this is unlikely to be the cause.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. There is no indication that an enhancer is missing, making this option less likely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   The eGFP is a separate coding sequence downstream of the receptor, and its expression depends on the removal of the stop cassette flanked by lox2272 sites. If the stop cassette is not removed, eGFP would not be expressed. This could occur if the lox2272 sites are not recognized by Cre, or if the vector is designed incorrectly. This explanation aligns with the observed lack of eGFP expression and is the most plausible answer.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the absence of the green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not being co-expressed due to issues with the stop cassette removal, potentially related to the lox2272 sites not being recognized or excised properly. This aligns with **Option D**.

Answer: D
