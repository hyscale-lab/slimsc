Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. The question has three parts, each with a different starting material and conditions, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Let me take it step by step. First, I'll look at each reaction individually.

Starting with the first reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ + Heat â†’ A

I think I remember that when alcohols and amines are present, especially with some acid, they might form some kind of imine or enamine. But wait, the problem mentions sigmatropic rearrangement, specifically Cope or Claisen. Claisen rearrangement usually involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging into gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But wait, here we have an amine, not a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a Cope rearrangement? No, the Cope rearrangement is for 1,5-dienes. Hmm. Alternatively, I recall that when an amine is involved with an allyl group, it can undergo some kind of rearrangement. Oh, wait! The starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. The structure would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Hmm, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH. Wait no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol structure: the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CH-CH(OH)- something? No, but-
