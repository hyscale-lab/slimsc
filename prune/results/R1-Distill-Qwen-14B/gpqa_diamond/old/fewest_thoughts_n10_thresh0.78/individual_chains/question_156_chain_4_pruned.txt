Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to determine how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation is when an alkene reacts with a peracid to form an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, right? So the geometry of the starting alkene affects the product.

Let me think about the first reaction: (E)-oct-4-ene. E stands for entgegen, opposite. So in (E)-oct-4-ene, the two substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. The peracid attacks the less substituted end because the transition state is more favorable when the more substituted part is less crowded. Wait, no, actually, for epoxidation, the peracid approaches the double bond, and the endo rule applies. Or wait, maybe it's more about regiochemistry? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, I think the stereochemistry of the starting alkene leads to the stereochemistry of the epoxide. 

Wait, for alkenes, when you epoxidize (like with mCPBA), the reaction forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So if you have a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide will have the oxygen atoms on opposite sides, leading to a trans epoxide. Similarly, a cis (Z) alkene would form a cis epoxide.

Wait, no, actually, wait. The addition of mCPBA to the alkene in an epoxidation is a concerted process, leading to the formation of an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide will form a trans epoxide, and for (Z), a cis epoxide.

But wait, the question says each reaction goes to 100% completion, so each starting material gives one product.

Wait, but when the epoxide is formed, it's a three-membered ring. Then, the next step is treatment with aqueous acid. Aqueous acid would lead to acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. 

In acid, the epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. The nucleophile (water) attacks the less substituted carbon because the more substituted epoxide carbon is more electrophilic (due to carbocation stability). Wait, no, in epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions, the attack is on the more substituted carbon because that leads to a more stable carbocation. Or wait, maybe it's more about which carbon is more accessible after
