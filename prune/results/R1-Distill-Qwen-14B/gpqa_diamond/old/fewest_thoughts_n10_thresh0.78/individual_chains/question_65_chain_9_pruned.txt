Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to break it down. The question has two reactions, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each. Then, choose the correct option from A to D.

First, let me look at reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is reacting with THF, KH, and H+. I'm not exactly sure what THF is, but I think it's tetrahydrofuran, which is a solvent. KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. H+ probably means an acid workup at the end.

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which is the spiro center. The structure here is 1-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group attached to the spiro center. The formula is like spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the non part is nine carbons. The spiro connects a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring, maybe? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the spiro notation is [m.n], where m and n are the number of carbons in each ring, excluding the spiro atom. So spiro[3.5]non would have a nine-carbon molecule where the spiro is connecting a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, the total carbons would be 3 + 5 + 2 (the spiro ring?), no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. The spiro compound has two rings connected at one carbon. So the spiro center is the 1-position. So the molecule is a spiro compound with one ring being 3 carbons (so a 4-membered ring including the spiro) and the other being 5 carbons (so a 6-membered ring). Wait, no. Wait, the formula is spiro[m.n]something. The m and n are the number of carbons in each ring that are attached to the spiro atom. So for spiro[3.5], each ring has 3 and 5 carbons respectively, excluding the spiro. So the entire molecule would have 3 + 5 + 1 (the spiro carbon) = 9 carbons, which matches the non in the name.

So the structure is a spiro system with a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring, both sharing the same carbon (position 1). The 1-position has a vinyl group (CHâ‚‚=CH-), and the 5 position has an enol (OH adjacent to a double bond? Or is it an enol ether? Wait, the structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the spiro is at 1, which is where the vinyl is attached. The 'en' at position 5 indicates a double bond between 5 and 6, perhaps.

So the structure is a spiro compound with a 3-membered ring (so a cyclopropane ring) and a 5
