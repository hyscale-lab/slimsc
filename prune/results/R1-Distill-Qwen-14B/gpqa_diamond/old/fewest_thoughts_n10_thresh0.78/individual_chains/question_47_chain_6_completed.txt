Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given IR and 1H NMR data. The options are A to D. 

First, let's look at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. Breaking that down: 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygen atoms. I can think of possible functional groups. The IR and NMR data should help me figure out what's going on.

Starting with the IR data. There are medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. But wait, the intensity is medium to strong. Amide N-H stretches are typically around 3300-3500, but they can show a couple of peaks due to the two N-H groups (stretching in different modes). Alternatively, if it's an O-H stretch, that's usually a broad peak around 3200-3600. Looking at the NMR, if I see broad signals, that might suggest exchange with water, which would happen with O-H. But let me check the NMR data.

Another IR peak is a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the compound likely has a ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide, or maybe an acid. The 1720 is a bit on the lower side. Esters and amides typically absorb around there. Acids are higher, say around 1700 but can vary. So possible carbonyl group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H. That's probably a methyl group next to an oxygen, like in an ethyl group (OCH2CH3). The triplet comes from coupling with the adjacent CH2.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals are often from exchangeable protons, like NH or OH. But wait, we're in the 4.0 ppm range. If it's an amide, the NH protons might be here, but in DMSO, they might show up broader. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group, but a singlet suggests no coupling. Hmm, maybe an -OCH2- group where the two protons are equivalent and not split much.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): A quartet integrating for 2H. Quartet usually implies coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2 next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group. For example, in an ester, like OCH2CH3, but wait, the 1.20 is the CH3, so the quartet here would be the CH2, so 4.5 ppm would be OCH2. But wait, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be around 4.1-4.3 typically. So maybe not. Alternatively, if it's a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, perhaps in a propionamide or something similar.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are split into two sets of doublets. So this is probably a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) suggests electron-withdrawing groups. Like nitro, carbonyl, or amino groups. Wait, amino groups are typically ortho/para directing but if they are in the para position, the adjacent protons would be more deshielded, hence higher ppm. But wait, amines can cause different shifts. Alternatively, if it's an amide group attached, perhaps.

Putting this together. The aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0, which suggests that the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group. Like a nitro group, but that's not in the options. Looking at the options, some have amide groups or amino groups.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be a benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide has an NH group, which would be expected in the IR. But the substituents on the benzene would be at positions 3 and (the amide at position 1?), but wait, that might not lead to a para-substituted benzene. Alternatively, maybe 3-ethoxy and amide at another position. Not sure.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide group attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl ring. The formamide would have a carbonyl (O=C-N). The ethoxy is at para position. So the benzene would have substituents at 4 (ethoxy) and the formamide at position 1. So the protons on the benzene would be at ortho positions, which would be two doublets. That fits with the NMR data (7.0 and 8.0 ppm).

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That's a propionate ester attached to a 4-aminophenyl group. So the structure would be CH2CH2COOH attached via ester to the benzene. Wait, no. Propionate would be CH2CH2COO- as an ester. So the benzene has NH2 at position 4 and the propionate ester at position 1. The aromatic protons would again be in para positions, leading to two doublets. The amino group would show up in the IR as NH stretches.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the benzoate ester with an ethyl group, and an amino group at position 4. The structure would be OEt-C6H4-NH2. Wait, no. Benzoate ester is OEt attached to the benzene, and amino group at position 4. So the benzene has substituents at 1 (ester) and 4 (amino). So the aromatic protons would be at the 2,3,5,6 positions. Wait, that's ortho and para to substituents. Hmm, but the substituents are at 1 and 4, which are para to each other. The protons on the benzene would be at ortho and meta positions. So perhaps the NMR would show more than two sets of doublets. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, 4-aminobenzoate would have substituents at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (NH2). So the benzene ring would have the ester group and amino group in para positions. The remaining protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Those protons would be split into two sets: positions 2 and 6 (ortho to amino) and 3 and 5 (meta to amino, but ortho to ester). But wait, the ester is at position 1, so the protons at 2 and 6 are ortho to the ester and meta to the amino. Hmm, not sure. But in any case, the NMR shows two doublets, which might suggest that the substituents are in such a way that the remaining protons are in two sets of two. So maybe the substituents are at 1 and 3? No, because then the pattern would be different.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the para positions, leading to two sets of doublets. Let me think: If substituents are at positions 1 and 3, the aromatic protons would be a different pattern. But for the given NMR, it's two doublets each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, making the ring para-substituted. Wait, no. Wait, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, the ring is 1,4-disubstituted. The remaining protons are at 2,3,5,6. So two pairs of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That would fit the NMR. For example, in p-xylene, the protons are split into two doublets, each 2H. So perhaps in this case, the substituents are at 1 and 4, leading to the same pattern.

Looking back at the options:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So structure is OEt attached to the benzene at position 1, and NH2 at position 4. Then, the ring has substituents at 1 and 4. So the protons on the ring would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Those would split into two sets: positions 2 and 6 (ortho to OEt, meta to NH2) and positions 3 and 5 (ortho to NH2, meta to OEt). Each set would be a doublet because of coupling with adjacent protons. So in the NMR, each of these would be a doublet integrating to 2H each. That matches the given data. The 7.0 and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) each.

Now, looking at other parts of the NMR. The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H). If it's an ester, the OCH2 group would be around 4.1-4.3 typically. Here it's at 4.5, which is a bit upfield. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Like in a propionamide or something else.

Wait, another thought: the IR showed a strong band at 1720 cm-1. For esters, the carbonyl is around 1740-1720. So that fits. If it's an ester, then the OCH2 would be around 4.1-4.3. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. Could it be a different group?

Alternatively, if the quartet is from a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, maybe in an amide. Like in a group such as CH2CONH... perhaps.

Wait, let's think about the options again.

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is OEt attached to the benzene ring (as benzoate ester) and an amino group at position 4. So, the ester group would be OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be at around 4.1-4.3, but in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit higher than typical. Could that be because of the amino group nearby affecting the shift? Or perhaps it's not an ester but something else.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide is HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3). The ethoxy is at 4 position. The formamide would have a carbonyl (C=O) which would show up around 1720, which fits the IR. The OCH2CH3 would be at around 4.0 ppm, perhaps as a quartet. But wait, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, so that may not fit. Alternatively, let's look for the ethoxy group. The ethoxy's CH2 would be around 4.0-4.2 as a quartet. But in the NMR, 4.0 is a broad singlet, and 4.5 is a quartet. So maybe the quartet is from the formamide's CH2 group?

Wait, formamide is RCONH2, but in option B, it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is HCON-(4-OCH2CH3)Ph. So the formamide group is HCO-N-Ph-OEt. So the formamide's carbonyl would be at 1720, which matches the IR. The ethoxy group would have a triplet at 1.20 (the CH3), and the CH2 would be around 4.2 as a quartet. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5.

Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from the OCH2 of the ethoxy group. So the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, so the CH2 is adjacent to the O. The quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2, as it's coupled with the CH3 (triplet), but wait that's the triplet at 1.20. So the CH2 should be a quartet, but typically around 4.0-4.2.

In the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. That's a bit upfield from where I'd expect an OCH2 in an ethoxy group. Could it be another type of CH2?

Looking at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate ester would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. So the structure is OCH2CH2COO-NH-(4-Ph). Wait, no, structure is PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? No, perhaps it's PhNH-COO-CH2CH2CH3. Alternatively, perhaps it's the propionate ester, like CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene via an ester linkage, but with an amino group at position 4.

Wait, the propionate ester would be OCH2CH2COO- group attached to the benzene. So the OCH2 would be around 3.5-4.0. The CH2 in the ester would be a quartet because it's next to another CH2 (the propyl group). So in the NMR, the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) could be the OCH2 of the ester. But why is it so upfield? Hmm.

Alternatively, the quartet is from the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. Like in a propionamide or something else.

Wait, another approach: let's analyze the splitting. The quartet at 4.5 ppm is 2H, and it's a quartet. So each of these two protons is split into four peaks, which suggests coupling with two neighboring protons each. So for a quartet, the neighboring group has two protons. So perhaps a CH2 next to a CH2 group. Like in a propyl chain, the middle CH2 would be a quartet. But in an ethyl group, the CH2 would be a quartet because of the adjacent CH3 (which has 3H, triplet). But in this case, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, suggesting it's near an electronegative atom.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet is from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2COO-. So the CH2 next to the oxygen would be split by the adjacent CH2.

Wait, perhaps in the propionate ester (option C), the structure is OCH2CH2COO-PhNH2. So the CH2 adjacent to O would be split by the next CH2. So the OCH2 would be a quartet, integrating to 2H, at around 4.1-4.3. But in the NMR, it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the quartet is part of an amide group. Wait, looking at option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be Ph-OCH2CH3 with a benzamide group (CONH2) in position 3. The benzamide would have a carbonyl at ~1680 cm-1, but the IR shows 1720, which is higher, more like ester or amide. Wait, benzamide's carbonyl is around 1680-1700, which is lower than the IR given. So this might not fit. The IR peak is at 1720, which is higher than typical amide carbonyls, which are about 1650-1700. So maybe this option is less likely.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide would have a carbonyl at ~1720, which fits the IR. So that's a good sign. The ethoxy group would have the triplet at 1.20 (CH3), and the quartet for the OCH2 around 4.0-4.2. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet corresponds to the NCH2 group? Wait, formamide is HCONR2. So in option B, the structure is HCON-(4-OCH2CH3)Ph. So the N is attached to the benzene ring and the formamide group. So the only groups would be the ethoxy (OCH2CH3) and the formamide (HCON-Ph). So the OCH2 would be at around 4.0 (as a quartet), but in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. So maybe this isn't the right fit.

Looking back at option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: OEt (from the ester) attached to the benzene, and NH2 at position 4.

So, the substituents are at positions 1 (OEt) and 4 (NH2). The aromatic protons are at 2,3,5,6. These would be split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the NMR.

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2 protons. Wait, but NH2 protons usually show up as broad signals. In D2O, they might exchange and not appear, but in the NMR, it's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. But amines are usually more downfield, around 1-5 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps it's an OCH2 group. Wait, in ethyl ester, the OCH2 is around 4.1-4.3, so perhaps the 4.0 is the OCH2 as a quartet, but in the data, the quartet is at 4.5. So maybe not.

Wait, the ethyl ester's OCH2 should be a quartet (coupled with the CH3). So 1.20 (t, 3H) is the CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1-4.3. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. So that doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in thinking about the groups. Let's think about the other parts. The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be an NH group, but in D2O, they might be exchanged and not appear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, maybe the NH is in the molecule, but in the NMR, it's broad, so perhaps it's an amide's NH. But in the IR, the N-H stretches are medium to strong at 3420 and 3325. Amide N-H typically shows two peaks, which are medium in intensity. That fits. So maybe the compound has an amide group.

Looking at the options again. Option A is a benzamide, which would have an amide group. The substituents would be ethoxy at position 3 and amide at position 1. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,4,5,6. Wait, but then the ring would have substituents in positions 1 and 3, leading to more complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 (amide) and 4 (ethoxy). Hmm.

Alternatively, option B is a formamide. The substituents are 4-ethoxyphenyl, so the ring has OEt at 4 and formamide at 1. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. In the NMR, that would give two doublets, each 2H. That fits.

So in the NMR, the aromatic region matches for both options B and D. Let's think about the other parts.

The quartet at 4.5 (2H) and the triplet at 1.20 (3H).

If the quartet is from an OCH2 group, it's a bit upfield. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure is HCON-(4-OCH2CH3)Ph. The CH3 of ethoxy is 1.20 (t), which matches the triplet. The OCH2 should be a quartet around 4.0-4.2, but the NMR has a quartet at 4.5. Hmm, maybe it's not the OCH2.

Wait, what about the formamide's NCH2? No, formamide is HCONR2. In this case, R is the phenyl group, so the N is attached to the phenyl and the formyl group. So no CH2 group on the N.

Another approach: the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be an NH group, but in the formamide, the NH is part of the amide, which is usually a broad peak. But in DMSO, amide NH protons can appear as a broad singlet. But typically, they're around 6-8 ppm? Or lower. Wait, no, in amides, the NH protons are usually around 6-8 ppm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: primary amides (like formamide) have NH protons around 8-9 ppm, but in the case of substituted amides, they might be downfield. Alternatively, aromatic amines (like aniline) have NH protons around 7 ppm. But in this case, the NH is part of an amide, which is deshielded, so perhaps around 7-8 ppm.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. That doesn't seem to fit with an amide NH. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group.

Wait, maybe the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2 from the ethoxy, and the singlet at 4.0 is something else, but that doesn't make sense because the OCH2 should be a quartet.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, like in an amide. Let's think about the structure. For option B, the formamide is attached to the benzene. So the structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 attached to the formamide group. So maybe the formamide's structure is HCON-(Ph-OCH2CH3). So there's an OCH2CH3 on the benzene. So the OCH2CH3's CH2 is a quartet around 4.0-4.2. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the quartet is from a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl in the formamide. But formamide is HCONR2, so where would the CH2 be? Unless it's part of a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the quartet is from the formamide's carbonyl adjacent CH2. Wait, no, formamide is HCONR2, so no CH2 attached to the carbonyl.

Let me think about the other options again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: OEt attached to the benzene at position 1, NH2 at position 4. The ester group would give a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. The OCH2CH3 would have a triplet at 1.20 (CH3) and a quartet around 4.1-4.3 (OCH2). But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, so perhaps this doesn't fit. Unless the OCH2 is split by another group.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the quartet is at 4.5 (2H), and the singlet is at 4.0 (2H). Maybe the quartet is another group, like a CH2 connected to the amino group? But that doesn't make sense because the amino group is on the benzene.

Wait, let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2.

Degrees of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0, it's (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees: a benzene ring (3), ester (1 C=O, and the ester O counts as a single bond), and an amide (another C=O?), but wait, let's recount.

Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So another approach: the molecular formula can be broken into parts. Let's think about esters. An ester has the formula R-O-CO-R', which contributes (for R and R' as alkyl groups). Alternatively, a benzoate ester would be O-CO-OEt attached to benzene.

But perhaps I should look for the functional groups based on the IR.

The IR has strong peaks at 3420 and 3325, which are likely N-H or O-H. The 1720 is a carbonyl. So possibilities are ester, amide, or acid. Since the options include amides and esters, let's focus on them.

In the NMR, the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 connected to an oxygen. Like in an ester group. But in ethyl ester, it's usually around 4.1-4.3. So maybe it's not an ethyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet is part of a propyl group. For example, in a propionate ester, the CH2 adjacent to the ester oxygen would be around 4.1, but perhaps in a different environment, it's shifted upfield to 4.5.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for more clues.

The IR has two N-H stretches, which suggests either two N-H groups (like in a primary amide) or one N-H group with two peaks (like in an amide where the two protons are in different environments). Alternatively, it could be an amine with O-H, but that's less likely as O-H is usually broader.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). That could be an NH2 group. But NH2 protons are usually not singlets unless they're in a very symmetric environment or perhaps as part of an amide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 adjacent to another CH2 group, like in a propyl chain. For example, in option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure would be PhNH-COOCH2CH2CH3. The ethyl group (OCH2CH2CH3) would have a triplet at 1.20 (CH3), a quartet at around 1.6 (CH2CH2), and a triplet around 4.1 (OCH2). But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl in the propionate. For example, in the structure OCOOCH2CH2CH3, the CH2 next to the O would be around 4.1, but again, the quartet is higher.

Wait, maybe the quartet is from a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in an amide, like CH2CONH2. The CH2 next to the carbonyl would be around 2.5-3.5 ppm, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2-. For example, in a propyl ester.

Wait, another approach: let's look for the number of signals.

The NMR has 5 signals:

1.20 (t,3H)

4.0 (bs,2H)

4.5 (q,2H)

7.0 (d,2H)

8.0 (d,2H)

So only 5 signals, which suggests that some protons are equivalent or not split.

In option D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the structure is OEt attached to the benzene and NH2. The aromatic protons would be 2 sets of 2H each (the doublets). The OEt group would have a triplet (CH3) and a quartet (OCH2). The NH2 would be a broad signal. That would account for 5 signals: triplet (1.20), quartet (4.1?), broad (NH2), and two aromatic doublets. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which doesn't fit the OCH2 at 4.1.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from another group, like the CH2 adjacent to the amino group. But that doesn't make sense in this structure.

Hmm. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide is HCON-(4-OCH2CH3)Ph. So the structure would be:

Ph-OCH2CH3 with the formamide group attached at position 1.

The NMR would have:

1.20: CH3 of ethoxy as triplet.

4.0: OCH2 as quartet.

4.5: I don't see where this would come from. Alternatively, perhaps the formamide's CH2? No.

Alternatively, the quartet could be from the formamide's NH2, but that's unlikely.

Wait, the formamide group is HCONR2, where R is the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So no CH2 in the formamide itself. So the quartet must come from elsewhere. But I don't see another CH2 group in option B.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look for another approach.

The aromatic protons in the NMR are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. The substituents on the benzene are likely electron-withdrawing groups, making the adjacent protons deshielded. So the substituents are probably at para positions, making the ring para-disubstituted. So the substituents are in positions 1 and 4.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 4-ethoxyphenyl formamide. Wait, no. The substituents are formamide at position 1 and ethoxy at position 4. So the substituents are in para positions, leading to the two doublets in the NMR. So that fits.

The formamide's carbonyl is at 1720, which matches the IR. The ethoxy's CH3 is at 1.20 (t), and OCH2 would be at 4.0 (q). But the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, perhaps the OCH2 is at 4.0 but in the NMR, it's at 4.5. Not matching.

Option D: 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester. Substituents are at 1 (OEt) and 4 (NH2). The ester's OCH2 would be at ~4.1-4.3 as a quartet, but the NMR has quartet at 4.5. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is not the OCH2 but another group. For example, in the amide or another part of the molecule.

Wait, option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with ethoxy at position 3. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 1. The aromatic protons would be more complex, perhaps as a triplet or more. But the given NMR shows two doublets, which suggests para substitution. So this is unlikely.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would have substituents at 4 (NH2) and 1 (propionate ester). So the aromatic protons would be para to each other, leading to two doublets. That fits.

The propionate ester would have the CH2 groups. The NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), which could be the OCH2 in the propionate ester. The triplet at 1.20 (3H) would be the CH3 of the ethyl group. Wait, but propionate ester would have a propyl group: OCH2CH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be around 3.7-4.0, the middle CH2 around 1.6-2.0, and the CH3 around 0.9-1.3. But in the NMR, the triplet is at 1.20, which is higher than expected for a CH3 in a propyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is from the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl in the propionate. So OCO-OCH2CH2CH3. The OCH2 would be around 3.7-4.0, but the quartet is at 4.5. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm thinking about the structure wrong. The propionate ester could be OCO-OCH2CH2CH3, but the CH2 next to the oxygen would be a quartet if it's adjacent to another CH2. So the OCH2 would be a quartet, but again, it would be around 4.0, but in the NMR, it's at 4.5.

Wait, maybe the quartet is from the amino group. But amino groups are typically broad and not quartets.

Another thought: perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 group that is adjacent to both the carbonyl and an oxygen. For example, in a structure like OCH2COO-. But I don't see such a group in the options.

Wait, maybe the quartet is the CH2 from the ethyl group connected to the ester. So OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet. So in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. But normally, OCH2 is around 4.0-4.2. So why is it at 4.5? Maybe because of the amino group's effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an amide with a substituent. Let's look at option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The benzamide has a CONH2 group, which would have a carbonyl peak around 1680-1700 cm-1, but the IR is 1720, which is higher. So that doesn't fit. So option A is probably not correct.

So perhaps the correct option is B or D.

Another angle: looking at the hydrogens. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of hydrogen deficiency is 5. So, likely a benzene ring (3), an ester (1), and perhaps an amide (another). Or a benzene, ester, and another double bond.

Wait, no, the ester is a carbonyl (no double bond), and the amide is also a carbonyl.

Wait, the molecular formula in option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formula would be C9H10NO2. Wait, let me calculate. The benzene is C6H5, formamide is HCONH-, ethoxy is OCH2CH3. So the formula would be C6H5-OCH2CH3 + HCONH- attached to benzene. So total C: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide) +1 (NH) = 10? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, more accurately: the formamide is HCONHR', where R' is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So R' is C6H4OCH2CH3. So the formula would be C6H4OCH2CH3 (which is C8H9O) plus HCONH- (which is C1H1N O). So total C: 8+1=9? H: 9 +1=10? O: 1+1=2. N:1.

So the formula is C9H10O2N. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So the formula is off by one H. Hmm, that suggests perhaps the correct option is not B.

Similarly, option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzoate ester (C7H5O2) + NH2 (C0H2N). But wait, benzoate is C6H5COOEt. So C6H5COOEt is C9H10O2. Adding NH2 (as in 4-aminobenzoate) would make it C9H11NO2. So option D's formula matches.

So option D is C9H11NO2, which fits.

Now, let's see the NMR for option D:

Ester group: OEt (CH2CH3O). The CH3 is a triplet at 1.20. The OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, not matching. So perhaps I'm missing something.

But wait, the NH2 group in D: in the NMR, it's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). NH2 protons are usually broad and might appear around 1-5 ppm, but in DMSO, they might be exchanged and not show up. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is not present as a separate peak because it's in D2O. But in the NMR, it's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which might not be the NH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from the CH2 in the ester, but at 4.5. So maybe the chemical shift is shifted due to the amino group's proximity.

Another possibility is that the NH2 is in a different environment. Maybe the compound is a benzoate with an amino group at para, leading to specific shifts in neighboring protons.

Wait, the aromatic protons in option D are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. So the substituents are OEt and NH2, which are both para. The OEt is an electron-donating group, so the adjacent protons would be upfield, while the NH2 is electron-withdrawing (due to resonance), leading the adjacent protons to be downfield. So the downfield shift (8.0 ppm) would be adjacent to the NH2, and the upfield (7.0 ppm) adjacent to the OEt.

So the NMR data fits this scenario.

Now, what about the quartet at 4.5 ppm? If it's not the OCH2, perhaps it's something else. Wait, maybe the quartet is from the amino group, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's from a CH2 group adjacent to the amino group.

But in option D, the structure is OEt-C6H4-NH2. So the only CH2 is in the OEt. So the quartet at 4.5 doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck because I'm missing something. Let me consider the options again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

The molecular formula would be C9H10NO2, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's one H less. So option B's formula doesn't match the question.

Wait, formamide is HCONR2. R is 4-ethoxyphenyl (C6H4OCH2CH3). So the molecular formula is C6H4OCH2CH3 (C8H9O) plus HCON (C1H1NO). So total C: 8+1=9, H:9+1=10, O:1+1=2, N:1. So total C9H10NO2. But the question is C9H11NO2. So option B's formula is off by one H. So it can't be the correct answer.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Molecular formula would be C9H11NO2.

Structure: The propionate ester is OCOCH2CH2CH3. The benzene has NH2 at 4 and OCOCH2CH2CH3 at 1. So the formula is C9H11NO2. That matches.

Now, the NMR for option C: propionate ester (OCH2CH2CH3). The CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9-1.1 ppm, the middle CH2 a quartet around 1.4-1.6, and the OCH2 a triplet around 3.7-3.9. But in the NMR data, the triplet is at 1.20, which is higher than expected. The quartet at 4.5 would be for the OCH2? No, OCH2 is around 3.7-4.0. So that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. So the propionate's CH2 next to the carbonyl would be around 2.4-2.6, but that's not matching the 4.5 quartet.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me recap.

The correct formula is C9H11NO2.

Option D: formula matches.

Option B: formula doesn't match.

Option C: formula matches.

Option A: formula doesn't match.

So we're down to options C and D.

Looking at the NMR of option D again.

If option D is correct, the NMR should have:

1.20 (t,3H): CH3 of ethoxy.

4.0 (bs,2H): possibly the NH2 group.

4.5 (q,2H): OCH2 of ethoxy.

Aromatic protons: two doublets.

But the OCH2 of ethoxy is usually around 4.1-4.3, but in the NMR it's at 4.5. That's a discrepancy.

Another possibility: perhaps the quartet is from a different group. Wait, in option D, after the ester and the amino group, are there any other CH2 groups? No, because it's ethoxy and amino.

Wait, maybe the quartet is from the NH2 group. But NH2 protons are usually broad and not quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a coupling between the OCH2 and the NH2. But that's stretching it.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a geminal coupling, but that's unlikely.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option B, but the formula doesn't match. Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the formula.

Wait, option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Let me re-calculate.

Ph-OCH2CH3 (C6H5-OCH2CH3) is C8H9O.

Formamide group is HCONH-.

So combining, we have C8H9O + HCONH-.

Which is C8 + C1 = C9.

Hydrogens: C8H9O has 9 H (Ph-OCH2CH3: benzene has 5 H, ethoxy has 5 H (but wait, no: structure is Ph-OCH2CH3: benzene has 5 H? No, benzene has 5 H in the para substitution? No, wait, benzene has 5 H when substituted in para with OCH2CH3 and another group in position 1. But in option B, the substituents are the formamide and ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the molecular formula again.

Ph-OCH2CH3 is C8H9O.

Formamide is HCONH-.

So when attached to the benzene, the structure is HCONH-(Ph-OCH2CH3). So the formula would be C8H9O + C1H3NO (HCONH-).

Wait, HCONH- is C1H3NO.

Adding to C8H9O: C9H12NO2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count the atoms.

Ph-OCH2CH3: C6H5-OCH2CH3 → C8H9O.

Formamide group: HCONH-R, where R is the phenyl group. So adding HCONH- would add C1H3NO.

So total formula: C8+1=9 C.

H: 9 (from Ph-OCH2CH3) +3 (from formamide) =12 H.

O: 1 (from Ph-OCH2CH3) +1 (from formamide) +1 (ester O?) Wait, formamide is HCONH-R, which has one O. So O is 2.

N: 1.

So formula is C9H12NO2. But the question is C9H11NO2. So option B would be C9H12NO2, which is one H more. So doesn't match.

Thus, option B is not the correct answer.

So, back to option D and C.

In option D, the NMR quartet at 4.5 doesn't fit the OCH2 of ethoxy. So perhaps it's not option D.

In option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

The structure is OCOCH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene with NH2 at position 4.

The ester group would have OCH2CH2CH3. The triplet for the CH3 (OCH2CH2CH3) would be around 0.9-1.1 ppm, but in the NMR it's at 1.20. The quartet for the middle CH2 would be around 1.6 ppm, and the OCH2 would be around 3.7-4.0.

But in the NMR data, the triplet is at 1.20, but it's for 3H, which could fit the CH3 of the propyl group. However, the quartet is at 4.5, which doesn't fit with the OCH2 of propyl ester.

Wait, unless it's part of another group. Maybe the quartet is from the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. So the propionate ester would have OCO-OCH2CH2CH3. The CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be around 2.4-2.6 ppm, which isn't the case here.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck between options C and D, but the NMR doesn't seem to fit either perfectly.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the number of signals.

In option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

NMR signals would be:

- OEt CH3: triplet at 1.20.

- OEt CH2: quartet at ~4.1.

- NH2: broad singlet (but maybe not appearing if exchanged).

- Aromatic protons: two doublets.

So that's four signals plus possible NH2. But in the NMR data, there's a fifth signal at 4.0 (bs,2H), which I don't have an explanation for in option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 (bs,2H) is the NH2. But NH2 in D would be a broad signal, but usually around 1-5 ppm. If the NH2 is at 4.0, that could fit.

So, putting this together:

1.20 (t,3H): CH3 of OEt.

4.0 (bs,2H): NH2.

4.5 (q,2H): OCH2 of OEt.

7.0 and 8.0 (d,2H each): aromatic.

That accounts for all five signals, but the OCH2 in the NMR is at 4.5, which is higher than expected. Maybe the OCH2 is shifted due to proximity to the amino group. Alternatively, perhaps it's not an ethyl ester but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from the amino group, but that doesn't make much sense.

Hmm. Another approach: let's think about the integration.

The quartet at 4.5 is 2H. So perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group. So OCH2CH3.

In that case, the OCH2 would be a quartet at 4.5, and the CH3 a triplet at 1.20. That fits the data.

So if quartet is OCH2, and triplet is CH3, then the ethyl group is OCH2CH3.

Which is in option D as OEt.

So in option D, the OCH2 would be at 4.1-4.3, but in the NMR, it's at 4.5. So why the shift?

Perhaps because of the amino group's effect. The amino group is para to the ester, which could cause some deshielding, shifting the OCH2 upfield? Or perhaps the opposite.

Alternatively, maybe the amino group is adjacent, but in the structure, it's para, so the effect is minimal. I'm not sure.

Another possibility: the quartet is not part of the OEt group but another group. But I don't see another CH2 in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the quartet is from the CH2 in the NH group, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the quartet is from a CH2 connected to both the carbonyl and an oxygen, but I don't see such a group.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the quartet is from an amide group, but option D doesn't have an amide.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the options' structures again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: OEt attached to benzoate (COOEt) at position 1, NH2 at position 4.

So, the ester is OEt attached to the benzene via the carbonyl. The carbonyl is at 1720 cm-1 (IR), which fits.

The ethoxy group: CH3 as triplet at 1.20, OCH2 as quartet at ~4.1-4.3.

But in the NMR, OCH2 is at 4.5. So perhaps the chemical shift is different due to the amino group's proximity.

Alternatively, maybe the quartet is not from the ester but from another part.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet is from the benzoate's CH2 group. But benzoate is OEt, so it's OCH2CH3. No, that's the same as before.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted the possibilities. Given that option D's formula matches and the NMR data mostly fits except for the quartet position, I'll have to go with option D as the correct answer, assuming that the quartet is from the OCH2 and the shift is due to some other factor like the amino group.


The compound has the molecular formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂**, and the goal is to identify it using the provided IR and ¹H NMR data.

### Key Observations:
1. **IR Data**:
   - Medium to strong bands at **3420 cm⁻¹** and **3325 cm⁻¹**: Suggest the presence of N-H or O-H bonds.
   - Strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹**: Indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), likely from an ester or amide.

2. **¹H NMR Data**:
   - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating for 3H, likely from a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH₂.
   - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating for 2H, possibly from an NH₂ group.
   - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating for 2H, likely from a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂.
   - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets each integrating for 2H, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- Structure: Benzamide (CONH₂) with an ethoxy group at position 3.
- The aromatic protons would not produce two doublets (as required by the NMR data), but rather a more complex splitting pattern due to the meta substitution. 
- The molecular formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂** matches, but the NMR data does not fit.  
**Eliminated.**

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- Structure: Formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group.
- The aromatic protons would produce two doublets due to the para substitution, matching the NMR data.
- The ethoxy group would produce a triplet at **1.20 ppm** (CH₃) and a quartet at ~**4.0 ppm** (OCH₂). However, the NMR shows a quartet at **4.5 ppm**, which is inconsistent with the expected shift for OCH₂ in an ethoxy group.
- The molecular formula **C₉H₁₀NO₂** does not match the given formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂**.  
**Eliminated.**

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- Structure: Propionate ester (CH₃CH₂COO-) attached to a benzene ring with an amino group at position 4.
- The aromatic protons would produce two doublets due to the para substitution, matching the NMR data.
- The propionate ester would produce signals for CH₃ (triplet at ~1.20 ppm), CH₂ (quartet at ~1.6 ppm), and OCH₂ (triplet at ~3.7 ppm). However, the NMR shows a quartet at **4.5 ppm**, which does not fit the expected shift for OCH₂ in a propionate ester.
- The molecular formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂** matches.  
**Eliminated.**

#### **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- Structure: Ethyl ester (OCH₂CH₃) attached to a benzene ring with an amino group at position 4.
- The aromatic protons would produce two doublets due to the para substitution, matching the NMR data.
- The ethoxy group would produce a triplet at **1.20 ppm** (CH₃) and a quartet at ~**4.1-4.3 ppm** (OCH₂). The NMR shows a quartet at **4.5 ppm**, which could be explained by a slight upfield shift due to the proximity of the amino group.
- The molecular formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂** matches.  
**Fits the data.**

### Conclusion:
Option D, **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, best matches the molecular formula and the IR and ¹H NMR data. The slight discrepancy in the chemical shift of the OCH₂ group can be attributed to the influence of the amino group.
