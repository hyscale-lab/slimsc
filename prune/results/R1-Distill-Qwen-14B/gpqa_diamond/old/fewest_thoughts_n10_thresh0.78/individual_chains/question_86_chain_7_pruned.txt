Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about determining the correct starting materials A and B for two different reductions. The products in both cases are 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but with opposite configurations: (R) for reaction A and (S) for reaction B. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no—the products are the same molecule but with different configurations? Or no, wait, the product given is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one for reaction A, and (S) for reaction B. So I'm guessing the starting materials must be something that, when reduced, forms these.

The reducing agents are different: LiBH4 and BH3. Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent compared to BH3. Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh, wait, no. I think BH3 is a milder reducing agent, maybe used under specific conditions. Oh wait, no, actually, I think they're both used for ketone reductions. Wait, no, wait. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Because LiBH4 is used for more stubborn reductions, like esters or amides, but BH3 is more for aldehydes and ketones. Wait, or is that not right? Hmm.

Wait, no. Maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. LiBH4 is typically used in protonic solvents like methanol or ethanol, and it's a strong enough reducing agent to reduce esters and amides, but when it comes to ketones, both LiBH4 and BH3 would reduce them. But wait, wait, BH3 is usually used in a different form, like with THF as a Lewis acid, right? Oh, right, BH3 is often used as part of the BH3•THF complex, which is a selective reducing agent for aldehydes, not ketones. Wait, no, wait. Actually, BH3 is used for ketones, but maybe LiBH4 is more vigorous.

Wait, perhaps the key here is the stereochemistry of the reduction. Because the products have different configurations (R and S), that must be due to the starting material's configuration and the type of reduction.

Wait, so the product is a ketone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic ketone. So the starting material for each reaction must be a cyclic ester, perhaps a lactone, since when you reduce a lactone you get a diol, but that's not what's happening here. Or wait, maybe the starting material is a ketone, but that wouldn't make sense because the product is a ketone as well. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is not a ketone but a different carbonyl. Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters, or maybe they are epoxides. Wait, no, because LiBH4 and BH3 are typically used for carbonyl reductions, not for epoxides.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals? No, probably not. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ethers with substituents
