Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, Planet_1 or Planet_2. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on the geometry of the system.

Wait, the key factors for transit probability are the size of the star and the size of the planet relative to their orbital distances. Oh right, the formula for the probability is roughly (R_p / a) where R_p is the planet radius and a is the orbital distance. But wait, I think it's more accurately (R_p + R_s) over the distance in some units. No, no, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital plane aligned edge-on. So the probability is (R_s + R_p) / (a * (1 - e)), but since both orbits are circular, e is zero. So the formula simplifies to (R_s + R_p) / a.

Wait, no, I think it's more precise. The probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 + R_planet / R_star), but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, the dominant term is R_star / a. So the transit probability is proportional to (R_*/ a), where R_* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The transit probability (P) is given by the ratio of the size of the star plus the planet to the size of the orbit, but considering the orbital distance in a certain way. Oh wait, no, actually, the probability is (R_* + R_p) / (a * (1 - e)) ), but since e is zero for both, it's (R_* + R_p) / a. But since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately R_* / a.

But wait, both stars have the same radius. Oh because the question says that both host stars have the same radii. So R_*1 = R_*2 = R. So the probability then depends on the ratio 1/a. So a planet with a smaller a (shorter orbital period) would have a higher probability since a is in the denominator.

Wait, no, because if a is smaller, then 1/a is larger. So the probability increases as a decreases. So Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period, meaning it's closer to its star (since P is related to a via Kepler's third law). So for Planet_1, a1 is smaller than a2. So R_* is the same for both, so (R_*) / a1 is larger than (R_*) / a2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

But wait! Wait a second. Orbital period is given by Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) ) a^3. Since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate P² = (4π²/(G M_* )) a^3. So a^3 = (G M_*) P²/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

So for Planet_1, M_*1 =
