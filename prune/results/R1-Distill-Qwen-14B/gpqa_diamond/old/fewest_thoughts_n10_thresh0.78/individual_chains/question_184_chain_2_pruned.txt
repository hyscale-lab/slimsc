Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are four different reaction sequences, labeled A to D. I need to figure out which sequence would lead to the desired product with high yield.

First, let me try to draw the structure of the target molecule. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, wait. Wait, numbering... Let's think: when numbering the benzene ring, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So for 1-ethoxy-2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzene, the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. So, substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, the ring has ethoxy in position 1, nitro in 3, and tert-butyl in 2.

But wait, when you have multiple substituents, you need to arrange them in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. So perhaps the numbering might change based on substituent priority. Wait, the priority of substituents for numbering is based on alphabetical order, but for ortho, meta positions, it's based on substituents' priority.

Wait, but in IUPAC nomenclature, the substituents are numbered in such a way that the substituents with higher priority come first. The priority order is based on the substituent's atom. So, nitro (NO2) has higher priority than ethoxy (OCH2CH3) and tert-butyl (C(CH3)3). So, the nitro group would get the lowest number possible.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me imagine the benzene ring: position 1 has ethoxy, position 2 tert-butyl, position 3 nitro. Wait, but if I number it so that nitro is at position 1, then ethoxy would be position 2, and tert-butyl position 3. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the substituents in order of priority. Nitro is highest priority, followed by tert-butyl, then ethoxy. Wait, no, the priority is based on the first atom in the substituent. So, nitro (N) has higher priority than oxygen in ethoxy or tert-butyl. So, the nitro group gets the lowest possible number.

So, if nitro is at position 1, the ethoxy would be at position 2, and tert-butyl at position 3? Or another arrangement. Wait, wait, the structure is 3-nitro, 2-tert-butyl, 1-ethoxy. So, looking at the benzene ring, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, the nitro is at position 3, which is the next number after 2 and 1.

Wait, but if nitro has the highest priority, the numbering should start with nitro as position 1. Then, the ethoxy would be at position 2, and tert-butyl at position 3. But the target is named as 3-nitro, so perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in the order: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, the ring has ethoxy on one carbon, then moving clockwise, tert-butyl on the next, and nitro on the third. So, the three substituents are at adjacent positions, 1, 2, 3.

Wait, but is that possible? For a benzene ring, having three substituents in adjacent positions would mean they're in a meta arrangement? No, adjacent would be ortho and meta, but three adjacent would be a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

But regardless, the main point is to figure out the order of reactions to get these substituents in place.

So, the target has three substituents: ethoxy, nitro, and tert-butyl. So, the synthesis steps would involve adding these groups to the benzene ring in the correct order to ensure the desired positions.

In electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents are added based on the directing effects of the existing substituents. So, the order in which the substituents are introduced is crucial.

Let's think about each substituent's directing effect.

- Nitro group is a strong meta-directing group.
- Ethoxy is an activating group, since it's an ether (OR), which is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent.
- tert-Butyl is a bulky, but activating (since it's an alkyl group) and ortho/para-directing.

So, the strategy is to add substituents in an order that allows each new group to be added in the correct position, considering the directing effects.

The target has nitro at position 3, tert-butyl at 2, and ethoxy at 1. Let me try to imagine the steps.

One approach is to first add the nitro group as the first substituent. Then, add the ethoxy group, which would be directed by the nitro group. Then introduce the tert-butyl group based on the directing effects of the existing substituents.

Wait, but let
