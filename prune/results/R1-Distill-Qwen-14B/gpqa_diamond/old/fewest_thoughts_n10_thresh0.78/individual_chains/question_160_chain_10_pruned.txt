Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction and apertures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down.

The question says that the aperture is shaped like a N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is falling vertically on it. We're looking for the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. Oh right, and we can approximate tan(theta) as theta because the angles are small.

Wait, so when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So this problem is probably about a circular aperture, but wait, no—if all the apothems are the same, maybe it's approximating a circle in a different way.

Wait, no, the problem says the apothems are all the same. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So if all apothems are the same, it's a regular polygon. So as N approaches infinity, the regular polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem 'a'? Or wait, no, the apothem in a regular polygon is the radius of the inscribed circle. So for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem is the distance from the center to the middle of a side. So as N becomes very large, the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a'. So the aperture would effectively be a circular one with radius a.

Wait
