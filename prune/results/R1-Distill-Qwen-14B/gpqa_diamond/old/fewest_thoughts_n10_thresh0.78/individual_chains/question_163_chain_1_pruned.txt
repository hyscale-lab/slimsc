Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these stoichiometry and solution problems. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

The question says: We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of total volume. Then, we have to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to prepare the solution. Also, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm. So, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and it's being dissolved in an acid. That makes sense because acid would neutralize the hydroxide. The acid is monobasic and strong, so it's probably something like HCl, HNO3, or similar. Monobasic means it can donate one proton per molecule.

First, I think I need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. Molar mass is key here. Let me calculate that. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). Each OH is 17 g/mol (16 +1). So:

Fe: 55.85
3*(O + H): 3*(17) = 51
Total: 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So, 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.85 moles. Let me compute that. 0.1 /106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, that's about 9.36 x 10^-4 moles.

Now, when Fe(OH)3 reacts with a strong acid, like HCl, the reaction should be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O.

Wait, is that right? Because Fe(OH)3 is a trihydroxide, so each molecule would need 3 H+ ions to dissolve. So the acid is monobasic, so each provides one H+. So the mole ratio is 3:1 for Fe(OH)3 to HCl.

So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of HCl. So the moles of HCl needed are 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

But wait, the acid solution is 0.1 M (molar). Molarity is moles per liter. So to find the volume of acid needed, I can use the formula: moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). Rearrange that to Volume = moles / Molarity.

So, Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, that
