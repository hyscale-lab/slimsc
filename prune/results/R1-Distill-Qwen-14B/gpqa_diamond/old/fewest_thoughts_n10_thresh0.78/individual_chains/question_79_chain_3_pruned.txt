Okay, so I have this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which compound X is. Hmm. Let's see what the question says.

Compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given. I think this reaction is some kind of cycloaddition or ring-opening perhaps? Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? Oh wait, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide. Because in epoxide ring-opening reactions, especially with bases, the epoxide would react with a nucleophile. But wait, what's the role here? Or maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? No, that would form a six-membered ring. Alternatively, is it a [2+2] or [3+3] cycloaddition? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction that forms an epoxide, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, the product's NMR is given, and I have to find the starting material. So maybe the reaction is forming an epoxide from a diene or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an epoxide opening into a diol or similar structure. But looking at the options, all of them are epoxides except maybe one? Wait, no, looking at the options:

Options are A to D. Let me see their structures:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, all of them are epoxides, except perhaps the product. Oh wait, no, the product is from X reacting with the base. So X is reacting to form the product, which is an epoxide? Or perhaps the product is a ring-opened epoxide. Hmm, maybe I should focus on the NMR data of the product to determine its structure, and then see which starting material would give that.

The product's 1H NMR has signals:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

That's a total of 3+3+1+2+1+2 = 12 H? Wait, but the product's formula isn't given, but compound X is C11H12O. Wait, wait, when X reacts, if the product is an epoxide, maybe it's adding an oxygen? Or perhaps the product is the same formula, but maybe different structure.

Wait, the NMR signals: two singlets at around 2.28 and 2.31, each 3H. So maybe two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their peaks, like maybe attached to an electronegative atom or in a symmetric environment. The other signals are in the aromatic region.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the aromatic signals:

6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Wait, that seems like a pattern of two doublets of two different coupling constants. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted benzene ring with substituents that cause these signals.

Let me think about possible structures. The presence of two singlet methyl groups suggests maybe two methyl substituents on something, perhaps adjacent to oxygen or in a symmetric position.

In the 13C NMR, the signals are:

21.3 (1C, s) – maybe a methyl attached to something electroneg
