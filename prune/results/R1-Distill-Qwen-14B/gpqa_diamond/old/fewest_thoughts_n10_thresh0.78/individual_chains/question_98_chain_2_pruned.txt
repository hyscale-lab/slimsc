Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the starting material is. The reaction given is this: A plus a methyleneruthenium compound reacts with 1-propene to form 1-(prop-1-en-1-yl)-2-vinylcyclopentane. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that reactions involving methylruthenium compounds often relate to olefin metathesis. Oh wait, Grubbs catalyst comes to mind. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst used for olefin metathesis, which is a reaction where olefins (alkenes) exchange parts. So, this reaction is probably a ring-closing olefin metathesis.

Let me think about olefin metathesis. In this process, two alkenes exchange their ends. So for a ring-closing metathesis, one of the alkenes must have a part that can form a ring when the metathesis occurs. So the product is a cycloalkane with some substituents.

The product given is 1-(prop-1-en-1-yl)-2-vinylcyclopentane. Let me draw that structure to visualize. So the cyclopentane ring has a substituent at position 2 that's a vinyl group (a CH₂CH₂ group, but actually it's CH₂CH₂ connected where? Wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, so a vinyl group is attached to the cyclopentane at position 2.
