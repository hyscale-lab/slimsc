Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's see.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the states with definite values.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So, the overall operator P is probably the vector operator, which would be a combination of these components depending on the direction n.

The direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So, n can be represented by spherical coordinates where the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and φ is in the x-z plane, so maybe φ is zero? Or wait, no, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so φ could be any angle between 0 and π/2 or something. Wait, actually, in spherical coordinates, any direction in the x-z plane would have φ = 0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, maybe we can generalize it.

Wait, maybe the operator we're dealing with is the spin operator. Muons have spin-1/2, so the spin operator S would have components S_x, S_y, S_z similar to what's given here, except perhaps scaled. Wait, the given components are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Oh right, because the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and the spin operators are (ħ/2) σ for each component.

So the operator P here is the spin operator, probably. So the eigenvalue for the spin along direction n is ħ/2, which is the maximum value for spin-1/2.

The eigenvector we're looking for is the spin-up state along direction n. So the state should be |+n> = cos(θ/2) |up> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |down>, perhaps. But wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, which implies that φ is zero. Because in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is zero. So then, the state would be cos(θ/2)|↑> + sin(θ/2)|↓>, right?

Wait wait, let me think again. The spin-up state along an arbitrary direction n can be written in terms of the eigenstates of S_z. So if n is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but in our case, n is in the x-z plane, so φ=0. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because x is sinθ, z is cosθ, etc. Wait, maybe it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ) depending on convention. Hmm, need to clarify.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction vector is usually (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). So if n is in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π. Let's say φ=0 for simplicity. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the direction is along (x, z). Then, the spin-up state along this direction would be a linear combination of |↑> and |↓> states.

So, the general formula for the spin-up state along n is |+n> = cos(θ/2)|↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓>. But since φ=0 here because n is in x-z plane (so φ=0), the state simplifies to cos(θ/2)|↑> + sin(θ/2)|↓>.

Wait, but wait a second. The spin matrices are 2x2, so the eigenvectors are 2-element vectors. The problem says to find the normalized eigenvector. So the elements would be these coefficients, right?

Looking at the options:

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ). Hmm, but I thought it's cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). So maybe option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which matches what I thought earlier.

Wait, option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ), but I think the correct components are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2), so option C.

But wait, what if the eigenvalue is +ħ/2? The spin-up state would have that eigenvalue. So the operator is P·n, which is P_x sinθ cosφ + P_y sinθ sinφ + P_z cosθ. But since φ is 0, that reduces to P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, but the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, which would have φ=0. So the operator would be P·n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

But the eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

Hmm, but maybe I don't need to compute the operator explicitly because the eigenvectors are given in terms of the angles.

Wait, the eigenvector for spin up along an arbitrary direction n is given by |+n> = cos(θ/2)|↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓>, as I thought. Since for our case, φ=0, this becomes cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2), so the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which matches option C.

Wait, but let's look at the options. Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So the normalized eigenvector has those components.

Wait, another point: the operator P is given for each component. So the overall operator P·n would be a combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z. But since the direction is in x-z, P_y component might contribute, but no, because P_y has a term with e^{i phi}, but since phi is zero, maybe it's not involved. Wait, no, the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so phi could be any value, but wait no, in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi, depending on direction. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator P is the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. The eigenvectors are same for any combination, but perhaps the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P along n.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the eigenvalue equation for P·n. Since P·n is a 2x2 matrix, we can write it as n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But let's compute that. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So let's compute n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ (since direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ)).

So P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Which becomes (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ].

Wait, let's compute it step by step:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]].

cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]].

Adding them together:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ].

So P·n is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So we can write the matrix equation:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b].

Dividing both sides by ħ/2, we get:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b].

So the matrix equation becomes:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a,

sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b.

So let's write the equations:

(1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0,

(2) sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0.

Hmm, let's solve these equations.

Equation (1): (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

Similarly, from equation (2): sinθ a = (cosθ +1) b → a = [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] b.

So both expressions for a must be equal: [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] = [ (cosθ +1)/sinθ ].

Let me compute sinθ/(1 - cosθ) equals (1 + cosθ)/sinθ?

Multiply both sides by sinθ (1 - cosθ):

sin^2θ = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) → sin^2θ = 1 - cos^2θ → which is correct since sin²θ + cos²θ =1.

So the two expressions for a are consistent.

So from equation (1), a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b.

But 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2).

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

Let me set b = 1, then a = cot(theta/2) → a = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2).

So the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ]^T.

But wait, we can factor out 1/sin(theta/2):

= [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T / sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, because the denominator is 1/sin(theta/2), which when multiplied by 1/sin(theta/2) gives 1 as the normalization factor. Wait, actually, the vector's magnitude is sqrt( cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ) = 1, so it's already normalized.

So the normalized eigenvector has components (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches option C.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, implying that the azimuthal angle $\phi = 0$. The eigenvalue equation for the spin-up state along $\vec{n}$ is solved by expressing the eigenvector in terms of the eigenstates of $P_z$.

The spin-up state along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ is generally given by:

\[
|+n\rangle = \cos(\theta/2)|\uparrow\rangle + e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta/2)|\downarrow\rangle,
\]

where $\theta$ is the polar angle and $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\phi = 0$, simplifying the state to:

\[
|+n\rangle = \cos(\theta/2)|\uparrow\rangle + \sin(\theta/2)|\downarrow\rangle.
\]

The components of the normalized eigenvector are therefore $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$. Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ — This does not match the derived components.
- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$ — This is incorrect because the components involve $\cos(\theta/2)$ and $\sin(\theta/2)$, not $\cos(\theta)$ and $\sin(\theta)$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ — This matches the derived components exactly.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ — This is incorrect because the coefficients $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$ are not present in the normalized eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it accurately represents the normalized eigenvector for the given eigenvalue and direction.

Answer: C
