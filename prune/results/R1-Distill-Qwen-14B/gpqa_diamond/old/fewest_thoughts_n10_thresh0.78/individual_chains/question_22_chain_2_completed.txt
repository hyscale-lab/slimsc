Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the oxidizing strength of oxygen in different solutions and how it reacts kinetically.

Alright, the question says: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. And then we have to choose the right combination from the options.

Hmm. So I remember that in electrochemistry, the effectiveness of an oxidant can depend on the solution's pH. Let me think about the standard reduction potentials. Oh wait, oxygen is involved in redox reactions, right. In basic conditions, the reaction would be different than in acidic.

Wait, the standard reduction potential for the oxygen reaction in acidic solution is higher. Oh right, I think the O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O reaction has a higher E° than the same reaction in basic conditions. So in acidic solution, O2 is a stronger oxidant because higher E° means it's more likely to be reduced, making it a stronger oxidizing agent.

So thermodynamically, in basic solutions, is O2 a weaker or stronger oxidant? Because in basic, the pH is higher, so maybe O2 isn't as strong. Wait, because in acidic solution, the E° is higher, so it's a stronger oxidant. So in basic solution, O2 would be a weaker oxidant thermodynamically.

Now, about kinetic aspects. Kinetics have to do with reaction rates. I remember that in acidic solutions, the reaction might proceed faster because of the presence of H+ ions. Oh wait, the reaction rate for oxygen's redox reactions might be influenced by the medium. For example, in acidic solutions, H+ could act as a catalyst or participate in the reaction, making it faster.

Wait, the oxygen reduction. In acidic conditions, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O. The H+ ions are involved, so maybe the reaction can proceed more readily because H+ is available. So kinetically, in acidic solutions, oxygen reacts faster. But wait, what about in basic solutions? There are OH- ions instead. Do they slow down the reaction because they might not be as good at facilitating the electron transfer?

Alternatively, I think that in more acidic solutions, the reaction tends to have a lower activation energy because H+ can help stabilize the transition state. So the kinetics are better. So in acidic, it's faster.

Putting it together: thermodynamically, in basic solution, O2 is a weaker oxidant. Kinetically, in acidic solutions, it reacts faster.

So the first blank is 'weaker', the second is 'faster'. Let me look at the options.

Option C) weaker – faster. That's the third option. Oh wait, looking at the options:

A) stronger – faster → No, because basic makes it weaker.

B) stronger – slower → No, because we said basic is weaker.

C) weaker – faster → Yes.

D) weaker – slower → No, because in acidic, it's faster.

So the correct combination is weaker (thermodynamic in basic) and faster (kinetic in acidic), which is option C.


Thermodynamically, the strength of an oxidant depends on its standard reduction potential. Oxygen (O₂) has a higher standard reduction potential in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions. This means that in acidic solutions, oxygen is a stronger oxidant. Conversely, in basic solutions, oxygen is a weaker oxidant thermodynamically.

Kinetically, reaction rates are influenced by the solution's pH. In acidic solutions, the presence of H⁺ ions facilitates the reduction of oxygen (e.g., in the reaction O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O), often lowering the activation energy and making the reaction proceed faster. In contrast, in basic solutions, the absence of H⁺ ions and the presence of OH⁻ ions can slow down the reaction. Therefore, oxygen reacts faster kinetically in acidic solutions.

Combining these observations:
- Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.
- Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.

The correct combination is **weaker – faster**, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
