Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about heating a mixture of two salts, A and B, which are equimolar. The mixture weighs 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, a mixture of gases is formed. Then this gas is passed through some tubes, and the results are given.

The tubes are filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (number 1), then Ca(OH)2 solution (number 2), and then red-hot copper (number 3). The weights increased in tubes 1 and 3 by 3.60 g and 0.80 g respectively. Tube 2's weight didn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. So, first, I need to figure out what's happening in each of these tubes. Let's break it down.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, but when it's exposed to a gas, it gains 3.60 g. Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent, so it probably absorbs water. So the gas passing through must be something that reacts with it to form water. Wait, but Mg(ClO4)2 is used for drying, so maybe the gas carried moisture, like water vapor. Because when water vapor reacts with Mg(ClO4)2, it would form Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, increasing the mass. So the gas must have H2O.

Wait, but the problem says the mixture was heated without air. So maybe the salts decompose to produce gases including H2O.

Wait, but the tube's weight increased by 3.60 g. If the gas is H2O, then the mass increase would be the mass of the H2O captured. So the amount of H2O is 3.60 g.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Mg(ClO4)2 as a drying agent will absorb water. So if the gas passed through it gains mass, that's due to water being absorbed. So the mass increase in tube 1 is 3.60 g of H2O. So the amount of H2O is 3.60 grams. So moles of H2O would be 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.

So maybe the initial heating of salts A and B produced H2O gas, which was absorbed by tube 1. So, the salts A and B upon heating may decompose to produce H2O and other gases.

Then, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. The weight didn't change. So what does that mean? Ca(OH)2 solution is used to absorb CO2. Because CO2 reacts with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. So if the gas has CO2, the tube would gain mass. But since the tube's weight didn't change, perhaps there was no CO2 in the gas mixture.

So, the gas that passed through tube 2 didn't react, meaning no CO2 was present. So the gas that went into tube 2 didn't contain CO2. So what else could it be?

Then, tube 3 is red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. So when gases pass through hot copper, what happens? Well, CO (carbon monoxide) reacts with copper at high temperatures to form CO2 and Cu. But in this case, the copper is red-hot, so perhaps the gas is CO. Wait, or could it be H2?

Wait, another possibility: if the gas is H2S, but that's less likely here. Alternatively, SO2 or another gas, but given the
