Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up in the mice when they were visualized under the confocal microscope. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, the setup: They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one vector, right? So in this case, the ligand and the receptor are both expressed from the same vector.

The vector structure: The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then, the receptor is at the 3' end and fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element. I remember that IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor could be expressed without the need for a separate promoter in some cases, but I'm not entirely sure how that works here.

Wait, the vector has loxP-stop-loxP between the ligand and mCherry, and lox2272-stop-lox2272 between the receptor and eGFP. LoxP and lox2272 are recombination sites, and Cre would cause the stops to be removed, allowing expression. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand and eGFP are not expressed because the stops are in place. But when Cre is present, it should recombine the lox sites, removing the stops.

They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. I think the blot would show whether the ligand and receptor (with their fluorescent tags) are being expressed. But the question is about the mouse model, not the cell culture. Oh, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background.

They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre would be expressed in neural crest-derived cells. The idea is that Cre would recombine the lox sites, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

Wait, but the vector has two different lox sites: loxP and lox2272. LoxP is recognized by Cre, and lox2272 is a variant that Cre can also recombine, but they have different recombination efficiencies. I think lox2272 is more efficiently recombined than loxP, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the recognition is the same, but the sites are in a way that Cre can flip them.

So the construct in the mouse is without Cre, so the stops are in place, preventing expression of the ligand and the receptor. But when the Cre comes in (from the SOX10-Cre mice), it should recombine the sites. Let me visualize this. The vector is:

[CBA promoter] --> ligand ORF --> stop (loxP) --> mCherry

Then, after the IRES, it's receptor ORF --> stop (lox2272) --> eGFP.

Wait, no, wait: the vector is bicistronic. So the structure is a single transcript, but the first ORF (ligand) is under the CBA promoter. Then, after the IRES, the receptor ORF is expressed. So the vector is likely set up so that the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, and the receptor from the IRES-driven promoter. But without Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), so the ligand can't be expressed. Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop cassette with lox2272, so the receptor can't be expressed either.

When Cre is present, it should recombine the lox sites. For the ligand, loxP sites: Cre would excise the stop, allowing the ligand to be expressed along with mCherry. For the receptor, it's lox2272 sites. So Cre would excise that stop, allowing the receptor to be expressed with eGFP.

So after Cre recombination, the ligand would be expressed, and the receptor would be expressed. The mouse is homozygous for the construct, so each allele would have
