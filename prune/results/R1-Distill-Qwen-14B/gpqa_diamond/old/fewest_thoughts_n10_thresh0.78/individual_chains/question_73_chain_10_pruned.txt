Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's give it a shot. Alright, let's read the question carefully.

So, there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm. Okay, relativistic speeds, so I remember that at speeds close to the speed of light, classical mechanics doesn't apply. We need to use special relativity here.

First, the relative speed. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as adding velocities like in classical mechanics. I think there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically. Let me recall. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So, wait, because both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed would be the difference divided by that factor.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. If they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the faster one with respect to the slower one would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c^2)). Because one is moving at v1 and the other at v2, same direction.

So, in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

Plugging into the formula:

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²) / c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's a clue.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm. Each astronaut has rest mass, and they're moving at relativistic speeds, so their energies will be their relativistic energies, which include kinetic energy and rest mass energy.

Wait, but the problem says, the total energy of the system. So it's the sum of the energies of both astronauts.

The total energy E_total would be E1 + E2, where E1 is the energy of the first astronaut, and E2 the second.

The relativistic energy formula is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's compute E1 and E2.

E1: for the first astronaut, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c.

γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6
