Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let's see. The options are a, b, c, d, each with different masses and other properties.

Wait, density is mass divided by volume, right. So I need to calculate the density for each option and compare them.

Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. I know Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So a must have that density.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density 5.5 g/cm³. So its density is given as 5.5. So same as a. Or wait, no. Wait, no, the density is given as 5.5, but wait, does the mass affect the density? Oh wait, no, the density is given as 5.5, so regardless of mass, its density is that. So b's density is 5.5.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition implies same density, right? Because density is based on composition. So if it's made of the same materials as Earth, then its density would be same as Earth. So c's density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition so same density, 5.5.

Wait, so all options have the same density? But that can't be right. Wait, the options can't all have the same density, I must have misunderstood.

Wait, let me read again. Option a: Earth mass and Earth radius. So Earth's density is 5.5, so that's correct.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, and density is given as 5.5. So if the density is 5.5, then same as Earth, same as a, c, and d.

But wait, no, perhaps I should think about how mass and radius relate. Because if the mass changes, but the density doesn't, then the radius would change. Because mass is density times volume, and volume is (4/3)πr³.

So for option c: same composition implies same density as Earth (5.5). But let's say Earth's mass is M, then c is 5M. Since density is same, the volume scales with mass. So Earth's volume is V = M / density. For c, volume is 5M / density. So the radius would be
