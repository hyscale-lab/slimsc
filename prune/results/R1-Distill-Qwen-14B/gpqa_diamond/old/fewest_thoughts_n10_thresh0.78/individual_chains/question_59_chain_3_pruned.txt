Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with these kinds of pH calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. And then I have to choose the correct pH from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider the neutralization reactions. So, first, I should figure out how much H+ and OH- are present from each solution.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about each component:

1. CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. It won't dissociate completely, but for the purpose of initial calculation, maybe I can treat it as a strong acid? Or wait, no, I have to account for its dissociation.

Wait, but actually, when you have a solution of acetic acid, it's in equilibrium. But when you mix it with other solutions, especially strong acids and bases, things will change. Hmm.

2. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, releasing H+ ions.

3. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It will dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions.

So, the plan is:

- Calculate the moles of H+ from each acid (CH3COOH and HCl), and the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.
- Then, determine if there's excess H+ or OH- after neutralization.
- If there's excess, calculate the concentration of H+ or OH- in the total solution volume.
- Then, find the pH using the appropriate method (like using pH = -log[H+] for strong acids or weak acids, or pOH = -log[OH-] then pH=14-pOH for strong bases).

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so each mole gives two OH- ions. So, for each mole of Ba(OH)2, we get 2 moles of OH-.

Let me calculate each component's contribution.

First, find the moles of each:

CH3COOH: Molarity = 0.1 M, Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate. But wait, when mixing with strong acid and strong base, maybe I should consider the net neutralization first.

Wait, perhaps I should first consider the reaction between the acids and the base. So the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, maybe I should find the total moles of H+ from all acids and total moles of OH- from the base.

So, let's compute:

Moles of H+ from HCl: HCl is 0.
