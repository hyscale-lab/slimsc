Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's core has these proton-proton reactions, and there are different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh wait, right, the main pp-I branch produces helium-4 and positrons, and then there's pp-II and III which involve different isotopes. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. Oh, right, because the Sun's radius is about 700,000 km, and light travels about that distance in about 8 minutes. So if the core reactions stop, it'll take about 8.5 minutes for the effect to be felt here on Earth. But how does stopping this branch affect the neutrino flux?

Neutrinos are produced in various processes. The main ones are the proton-proton chain, the CNO cycle, and maybe others. The pp-III branch... what neutrinos does that produce? I think that the pp-III branch is one of the side branches in the proton-proton chain. Let me think. Oh, okay, the pp-I branch is the main one, producing two positrons and two neutrinos. The other branches, like pp-II and pp-III, also produce neutrinos but in smaller quantities, perhaps?

Wait, neutrinos are produced when a positron captures a proton,
