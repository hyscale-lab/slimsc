Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because electrostatics can be a bit tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the electric field at a point outside a spherical conductor with a cavity. Hmm.

Alright, let me read the setup again. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So the conductor isn't a solid sphere but has a hollow part. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R, which makes sense because the cavity is inside the conductor.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, any charges placed inside the cavity should induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, right, according to Gauss's Law, the charges inside a cavity affect the inner surface, and any excess charge on the outer surface.

Wait, so the conductor itself is neutral. When I place a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must develop an induced charge of -q to cancel the electric field within the conductor material. Because the conductor was uncharged, the outer surface must then have a charge +q to balance it out.

Now, I'm thinking about the electric field outside the conductor. For points outside a charged spherical conductor, the electric field should behave as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. That's the shell theorem in action. But wait, in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. So the field outside should be similar to that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the charge is inside a cavity, not at the center of the conductor. The conductor's center is at a different point than the cavity's. So I'm a bit confused. How does that affect the field outside?

Wait, the conductor's charges rearrange themselves. The inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. But the outer surface's charge distribution is only dependent on the total enclosed charge within the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral except for the induced charges, the outer surface's charge is +q, regardless of where the +q was placed in the cavity. So the electric field outside the conductor is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's geometry and any induced charges would influence the field. Let me think. The conductor's outer surface has a charge +q, so the field outside should be that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the charge +q is placed not at the center but in the cavity, which is shifted by s. Does that affect the outer induced charge distribution?

Wait, no. Because the conductor is a sphere, the induced charges on the inner surface will arrange themselves such that the inner surface's charge distribution depends on the position of the cavity's charge. But the outer surface's charge distribution is determined by the total enclosed charge within the conductor. Since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, and since the conductor is spherical, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, as if it were a point charge at the center.

Wait, but wait. If the cavity's charge is off-center, then the inner surface's charge would not be uniform. The inner surface would have a charge distribution that's non-uniform, but the outer surface would still be uniformly distributed because the conductor is neutral and the cavity's charge is inside a conductor. Oh wait, no. Because the conductor was neutral, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. But the outer surface is a sphere, so the charge on it is uniformly distributed. So regardless of where the +q is placed in the cavity, the outer surface's charge is uniformly spread.

So for points outside the conductor, the electric field is the same as if all the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center.

So, the field at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Option D is same but with l squared. Option A and C have terms involving l, s, and cos(theta).

But wait, another thought. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The charge is inside the cavity, which is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the displacement between the charge and point P is not straightforward. But no, because the field outside the conductor is only due to the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and that's as if it's at the center.

So, the electric field outside the conductor should be as if the charge is located at the center of the conductor. So the distance from the charge's position (the center of the conductor) to point P is L. So the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

Wait, but another possible confusion: the point P is at distance L from the conductor's center, but what's the distance from the charge inside the cavity? Because the charge is at the center of the cavity, which is a point s away from the conductor's center. So the displacement vector from the charge to point P would be L in length, but that's not correct because the charge is at a different point.

Wait, no, because the field outside is due to the outer charge, which is uniformly distributed. So regardless of where the inner charge is placed, the outer conductor's field is as if the charge is at the center.

So I think the correct answer is B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must develop a charge $+q$ to balance the system.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For points outside a spherical conductor, the electric field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere (by the shell theorem). The outer surface of the conductor has a uniform charge distribution of $+q$, so the electric field at any external point depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance from the center of the conductor.

3. **Effect of Cavity and Induced Charges**:  
   The charge $+q$ inside the cavity is offset by the induced $-q$ on the inner surface. The outer surface, being uniformly charged, ensures that the electric field outside the conductor is independent of the position of the cavity or the charge inside it. Thus, the field at point $P$ depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Involves terms like $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which are unrelated to the field outside the conductor since the field depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$.  
   - **Option B**: Matches the expected form of the electric field outside a spherical conductor, given by $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.  
   - **Option C**: Similar to Option A, it incorrectly involves terms like $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which are irrelevant for the external field.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrectly uses $l^2$ (the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center) instead of $L^2$ (the distance from $P$ to the conductor's center).

Thus, the correct electric field at point $P$ is given by Option B, as it correctly accounts for the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

Answer: B
