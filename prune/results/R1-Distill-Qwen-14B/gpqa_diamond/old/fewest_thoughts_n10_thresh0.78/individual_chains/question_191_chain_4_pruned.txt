Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4. Hmm, let's see. The problem describes a series of reactions starting with a particular compound. Let me break it down step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. I'll try to visualize it. So cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. The 3 position has a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and the 5 position has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2CH(CH2) group, right? Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CHCH2- but attached at the second carbon? Wait, no. Let me think. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. The prop-1-en-2-yl group would be the substituent from the second carbon. So it's CH2-C(CH2)-? No, wait, maybe it's the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the substituent is on C2. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2-) something? Or maybe the substituent is CH2- attached to a double bond. I'm a bit confused, but maybe I'll come back to that.

So the first reaction is treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium hydride is a strong base; it's usually used to deprotonate something. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So in this context, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group is being deprotonated by NaH, making an alkoxide, which then reacts with benzyl bromide, an SN2 reaction maybe. So the hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) becomes CH2O- after deprotonation. Then benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br) would donate the benzyl group. So the product would be CH2-O-C6H5CH2- attached to the cyclohexanone.

Wait, but the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)... So after alkylation, that becomes 3-(benzyl-O-CH2-), but wait, no, the hydro
