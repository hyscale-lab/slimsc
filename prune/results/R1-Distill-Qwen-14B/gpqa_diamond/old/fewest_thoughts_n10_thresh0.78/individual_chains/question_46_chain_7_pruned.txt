Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and figuring out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

First, I need to recall what Grubbs catalyst does. Grubbs is a transition metal carbene catalyst used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means "change places," so it's a process where the positions of substituents in alkenes are exchanged. It can lead to ring-closing or ring-opening, and also cross-metathesis if other alkenes are present.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the first carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₃)-something? Wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl group on C3.

So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH₂CH₃? Wait, no. Wait, pent is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Because the pent chain is five carbons, with double bond from 1 to 2, and a methyl branch on carbon 3.

Wait, let me count: Carbon 1: CH₂=, carbon 2:
