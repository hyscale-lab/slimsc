Okay, so I've got this question about oscillating charge distributions and the radiation they produce. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f(λ, θ). The maximum power is A, and we need to find what fraction of A is radiated at θ=30 degrees, and also figure out the possible form of f.

Wait, I remember that when a charge oscillates, it acts like a dipole antenna. The radiation pattern for a dipole has a specific angular dependence. Oh right, the power radiated by a dipole varies with the angle θ as sin²θ. So the radiation isn't isotropic; it's strongest along the equator (θ=90 degrees) and less along the poles (θ=0 or 180 degrees).

The maximum power radiated would be when the power per unit solid angle is at its peak. But wait, the total power is the integral of the power per unit solid angle over all solid angles. So the maximum value of the function f(λ, θ) would correspond to the maximum possible power per solid angle, but the total integrated power would be the sum over all angles.

Wait, no, in this question, the maximum power A is the maximum value of the function f. Because the question says, "the maximum power thus radiated is A." Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up concepts. Let me read it again.

Ah, wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle, and the maximum of f is A. So A is the maximum value of f. So when θ is such that f is maximum, that's A. Then, the fraction of A at a particular θ would be f(θ)/A.

Wait, but the question is asking for the fraction of the maximum power A that is radiated at θ=30 degrees. So, it's (f(30 degrees)/A) multiplied by the solid angle involved. No, wait, wait. No, because f is the power per unit solid angle. So the total power would be the integral of f(θ) over the entire solid
