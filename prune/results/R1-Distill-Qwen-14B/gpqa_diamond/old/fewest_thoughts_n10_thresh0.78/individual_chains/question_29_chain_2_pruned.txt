Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these mutants would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that the gene responsible has five exons and four introns. So the gene is split into exons, and the introns are the non-coding regions. But since all the mutations are in the first exon area, I can probably focus on the exonic changes.

The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, which is synthesized by this gene. So, I'm looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, possibly by causing a premature stop codon or altering the protein structure so that the compound isn't produced.

Looking at the wild-type (intact) gene sequence:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

The first part is the start codon (ATG), which is correct because it's the beginning of the protein.

Now, let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the wild type, the sequence after ATG is different. Let me line them up:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTA CTT C... Wait, no, let me compare each nucleotide.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look for any changes that might result in a frameshift or a stop codon early on.

Mutant 1's changes: Looking at the first part, the wild type has TTTCTC. The mutant has TTCTAC. So, let me see the position.

Wait, perhaps it's better to see where the change starts. Let me number the nucleotides from the beginning.

Wild: positions 1-3: ATG (start)
Positions 4-6: TTT
Positions 7-9: CT C
Wait, perhaps I should line up the sequences.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTA CTT C... Let me see. Wait, perhaps the exact change is in the fourth codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's look for changes that cause a premature stop codon. The stop codons are TGA, TAG, and TAA. If a mutation leads to any of these
