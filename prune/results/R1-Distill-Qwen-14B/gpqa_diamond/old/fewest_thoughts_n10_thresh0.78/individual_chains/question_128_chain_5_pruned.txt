Okay, so I've just gotten this question about cloning a human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. Hmm, I need to choose the right plasmid from the four options (A, B, C, D). Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when expressing proteins in E. coli, the plasmid must have a strong promoter, usually from a bacteriophage like T7 because E. coli's own RNA polymerase isn't strong enough. Also, the gene should be under the control of the T7 promoter so that induction with IPTG can happen. Oh wait, but the question says the priority is to produce and purify quickly, so probably the plasmid needs to be in a suitable vector for high expression.

Looking at the options, they all start with ATG, which is the start codon. But the sequences are quite long, so I need to find key differences. Maybe the presence of the T7 promoter or certain restriction sites?

Wait, another thing: E. coli has the genotype BL21, which is a strain that lacks the T7 RNA polymerase. To produce T7 transcripts, the plasmid must have the T7 RNA polymerase gene under an inducible promoter, like lacUV5. So the plasmid should have that.

Looking at the sequences, I need to check for the T7 promoter sequence. The T7 promoter is recognized by the T7 RNA polymerase and is a specific sequence upstream of the gene. It usually is around 6 bp: 5'-T7 promoter is something like 'TAATTAAT' or similar. Wait, no, the T7 promoter has a specific sequence. Oh wait, the T7 promoter is a site where the T7 RNA polymerase binds. The consensus sequence is about 20 bases upstream, I think. The core promoter sequence is 'T7GAGCTC' or something like that? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with other promoters.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid sequences given include the T7 promoter before the start codon. Looking at each option's beginning:
