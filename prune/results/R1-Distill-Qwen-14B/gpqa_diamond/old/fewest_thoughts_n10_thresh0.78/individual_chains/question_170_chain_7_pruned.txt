Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me see what it's about. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4). Oh wait, I remember that spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors, like a column vector with two elements. So this state is (3i, 4) written as a column vector, right?

The options are A to D, and each has a value involving hbar, so I'm guessing the expectation value will be in terms of ħ. The note also gives the Pauli matrix σ_y, which is:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

Right, I remember that the spin operator S is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So for the y-component, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. That makes sense because the spin operators are proportional to the Pauli matrices.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as <ψ| S_y |ψ>, where |ψ> is the state vector. So I need to compute that. Let me write down the steps.

First, the state is |ψ> = [3i; 4]. So in vector form, that's the top component 3i and the bottom component 4.

The operator S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the σ_y matrix. So σ_y is the matrix I wrote earlier. So the operator is:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Now, to compute <S_y>, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. That's because expectation values are given by the bra-ket notation <ψ|O|ψ>.

So let's write ψ as a column vector:

ψ = [ 3i ]
      [ 4  ]

The conjugate transpose, ψ†, would be [ -3, 4 ] because the conjugate of 3i is -3, and 4 remains 4.

So ψ† is [ -3, 4 ]

Now, let's compute the product ψ† S_y ψ.

Breaking it down, first compute S_y ψ. Then multiply that by ψ†.

Wait, actually, the order is ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ. So let's
