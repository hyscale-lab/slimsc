Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, so the setup is: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is going upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma equals the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. For an electron or positron, the rest mass is the same, about 0.511 MeV. So the electron's energy is gamma times m*c², so 4 * 0.511 = 2.044 MeV. The positron's energy is 2 * 0.511 = 1.022 MeV.

But wait, direction matters for momentum. The electron is moving to the right (since it's coming from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (since it's coming from the right). So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Momentum for each particle: For relativistic particles, momentum p is gamma*m*v. Alternatively, since p = gamma m v and v is in terms of c, but perhaps it's easier to calculate using the relativistic relation between energy and momentum. Remember that E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

So for the electron (gamma=4, m=me):
E_e = 4 * me c² = 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV.
So (pc c)^2 = E^2 - (me c²)^2. Wait, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

So p_e = sqrt( (E_e)^2 - (me c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, let me get the units right. Let's compute the momentum.

E_e = 2.044 MeV. me c² is 0.511 MeV. So (2.044)^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (0.511)^2. So (p_e c)^2 = (2.044)^2 - (0.511)^2. Let me compute that numerically.

2.044 squared is about 4.177. 0.511 squared is about 0.261. Subtracting gives 4.177 - 0.261 = 3.916. So p_e c = sqrt(3.916) ≈ 1.979. So p_e = 1.979 / (c). Hmm, but wait, units are a bit tricky here. Alternatively, maybe I should express everything in units where c=1 for simplicity. Since all the terms are in MeV and c is factored into them.

Similarly for the positron (gamma=2, E_p = 2 * 0.511 = 1.022 MeV). So (p_p c)^2 = (1.022)^2 - (0.511)^2. 1.022 squared is about 1.044. Subtract 0.261 gives 0.783. Square root is about 0.885. So p_p c = 0.885, so p_p = 0.885 / c.

Wait, but the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the total momentum before collision is the sum of the two momenta. Let me calculate that.

Electron's momentum is positive (right direction), positron's is negative (left direction). So p_total = p_e - p_p.

Wait, wait, wait, no. Because the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is in the negative x-direction. So p_total = p_e (right) + (-p_p) (left) = p_e - p_p.

Wait, p_e is 1.979
