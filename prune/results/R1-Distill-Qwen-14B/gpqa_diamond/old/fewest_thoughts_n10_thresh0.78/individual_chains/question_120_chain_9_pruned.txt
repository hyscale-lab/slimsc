Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are four different power laws, so I think it's about figuring out the relationship between the number of stars and parallax.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So a larger parallax means a closer star and a smaller parallax means a more distant star.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. I'm not entirely sure what that implies about their actual distribution in space. Uniformly distributed in the sky—so maybe they're spread out evenly in all directions, but how does that translate to their actual positions in 3D space?

I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform. So, the number per unit volume is the same everywhere. So, if you imagine a sphere with radius r, the number of stars inside would be proportional to the volume, which is (4/3)πr³. But wait, since stars are everywhere, the number in a thin shell at radius r would be proportional to the surface area of that shell times some thickness. The surface area is 4πr², so the number per unit distance (like a shell of thickness dr) would be something like 4πr² * n, where n is the number density.

But the question is about parallax. Since plx = 1/r, r is 1/plx. So, I can substitute r with 1/plx. Let me think about how the number of stars in a given range of plx relates.

Wait, the problem is asking for the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx). So, for a small change in plx, dplx, how many stars are there?

Since plx is inversely proportional to r, a change in plx corresponds to a change in r. Let me think in terms of differentials. If r = 1/plx, then dr = (1/plx²) dplx. So, the change in r is proportional to 1/plx² multiplied by the change in plx.

Now, the number of stars in a thin shell (with radius r and thickness dr) is proportional to the surface area times dr. The surface area is 4π r². So, the number of stars in that shell
