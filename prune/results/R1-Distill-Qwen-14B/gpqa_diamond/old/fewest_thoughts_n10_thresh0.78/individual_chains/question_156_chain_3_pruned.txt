Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reactions involving mCPBA and what happens when the products are run through HPLC columns. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says a chemist does two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene under the same conditions. Both go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The options are about how many peaks each HPLC would show.

Wait, what's mCPBA do? Oh right, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's a peracid, so it's used for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation typically proceeds via an electrocyclic ring-opening mechanism. For trans alkenes, like the E isomer, I think the epoxidation leads to a trans epoxide. Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think. The geometry of the alkene affects the epoxide's structure. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So for E, the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide?

Wait, no. Wait, mCPBA is an oxidizing agent that forms epoxides. The reaction is stereospecific. So for a trans (E) alkene, the epoxidation would form a trans epoxide. Similarly, a cis (Z) alkene would form a cis epoxide.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The reaction of mCPBA with alkenes leads to the formation of an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is trans, so the epoxide formed will have the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides of the
