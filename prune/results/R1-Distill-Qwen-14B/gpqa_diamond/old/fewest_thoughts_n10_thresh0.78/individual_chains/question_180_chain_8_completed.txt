Okay, so I've got this problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, I remember that electric potential energy between charges is calculated using Coulomb's law formula, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Wait, the potential energy U between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, right? And since the system is isolated, I probably need to consider the energy of each pair of charges.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, around 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C. But wait, no—wait, hold on. Wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge. So each charge is 2e, meaning 2 * 1.6e-19 C, which is 3.2e-19 C? Wait, no, wait, 2e would be 2 times 1.6e-19, which is 3.2e-19 C. Right.

Now, the setup: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the 13th charge is at P, and the others are each 2 meters away from P. But wait, the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P, but are they arranged in some way? Like, are they all at the same point, or are they spread out? Hmm, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So probably, each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other might matter for the potential energy.

Wait, but the problem says it's an isolated system. So, the potential energy comes from the interactions between all the pairs of charges. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, each of the 12 charges at 2 m away will interact with the 13th. Also, the 12 charges at 2 m away will interact with each other. So, the total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

But wait, since potential energy is a pairwise interaction, each pair contributes. So, for the 13th charge, which is fixed, each of the 12 charges will contribute a term. So, the energy from the 13th charge and the 12 charges is 12 * (k * (2e)*(2e) ) / (2 m). Wait, no, wait. The 13th charge is fixed, so each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from it. So, the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, and r is 2 m.

But wait, no, because the 13th is fixed, so the potential energy due to the 13th for each of the 12 is their individual potential. So, each of the 12 has a potential energy of U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m). Wait, but since the 13th is fixed, is that energy additive? I think so, because each of the 12 charges is bringing in their own potential due to the 13th charge.

Wait, but wait a second. The 13th charge is fixed, so when calculating the potential energy due to interactions with the 13th, each of the 12 charges contributes a term. So for each of the 12, the energy is (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 m). So for all 12, it's 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m).

But then, there's also the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Because they are all at 2 m from P, but their distances from each other can vary. Wait, wait—no, wait. If all 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, perhaps they are all at the same point, but that doesn't make sense because they would repel each other. But the problem says they are constrained, so maybe they are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m, each at a point on the sphere. But their exact arrangement isn't specified, which complicates the calculation of their mutual potential energy.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm. Since the 12 charges are identical and all positive (since they have charge 2e, which is positive), they repel each other. To minimize the potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves as far apart as possible. But if they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, perhaps the minimum potential energy occurs when they are as far apart as possible on the sphere, which would be when they are at the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something, but I might be overcomplicating.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, so perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered as if they are all at the same point? Or maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of them and the 13th charge, and not their mutual interactions. That can't be right because in an isolated system, you have to account for all pairwise interactions.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, the distance from each of the 12 charges to P is 2 m. The 13th charge is at P. So, the distance between any two of the 12 charges would be at least some minimum, but since they're all at radius 2 m, the distance between any two would be 2 * 2 * sin(theta/2) where theta is the angle between them. But without knowing their exact arrangement, perhaps the problem isn't considering the interactions between the 12 charges. Hmm, but that would be incorrect because the potential energy would include those terms.

Wait, but maybe the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are all at the same point as each other but at a distance of 2 m from P. So, each is at position 2 m from P, but all at the same point. But that would mean that each of the 12 is at zero distance from the others, which isn't possible because they're identical charges and would repel each other. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all 2 m, but that's not possible in 3D space for 12 points. Wait, but perhaps the problem is simplifying things and considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, not their mutual interactions. Because the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, perhaps their mutual distances are irrelevant for the purpose of this problem.

But that's not correct. Because in reality, when multiple charges are present, all pairwise interactions contribute to the total potential energy. So, the total potential energy of the system would be the sum of all pairs. In this case, the 13th charge interacts with each of the 12, and each of the 12 interacts with each other.

Wait, but the problem says it's an isolated system. So, the energy contributions are from all possible pairs. So, the total potential energy U is the sum of U for each pair.

So, let's break it down:

- The 13th charge is fixed at P.
- Each of the 12 charges at 2 m from P contributes a term with the 13th charge.
- Each pair among the 12 charges contributes a term as well.

So, the total energy is:

U_total = U_13th_with_12 + U_12_among_themselves.

So, first, calculate U_13th_with_12.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the 13th. Each pair (13th and charge i) contributes k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m).

So, for each of the 12, the energy is (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) ) 

So, 12 * (k*(4e^2)/(2 m)) )

Which can be written as 12 * [ (k *4e²) / (2 * 2) ) ] ?

Wait, wait. Let me compute that: 

Each charge is 2e, so (2e)*(2e) =4 e². Distance is 2 m.

So, for each pair, U = (k * 4 e²) / (2) = 2 k e².

But wait, k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, for each of the 12 charges, their contribution to the system's energy due to their interaction with the 13th is 2 k e².

So, 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now, the second part is the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. This is where it gets complicated because the way they're arranged affects the total U. But the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, so perhaps the problem is only considering the energy from the 13th charge and the 12, and not their mutual interactions. Hmm, but that's unlikely, because the problem says it's an isolated system, so it should include all interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, which would make their mutual distances zero, but that's impossible because they would repel each other. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the 13th charge, and not the mutual interactions of the 12. But that doesn't seem right because in any system of multiple charges, all pairs contribute.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are irrelevant for this calculation, perhaps because the problem is considering only the potential energy between each of them and the 13th charge. But that's not correct; the mutual potential energy must be considered as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are so arranged that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible unless they are at infinite distance apart, which isn't the case here.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. So, perhaps the arrangement that minimizes the total potential energy is when the 12 charges are as far apart as possible. But without knowing their exact positions, I can't compute their mutual potential energy accurately. So perhaps the problem is only considering the energy from the 13th charge and each of the 12, and not their mutual interactions. But that doesn't make sense because the mutual interactions would contribute more positive energy, increasing the total.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are all at the same point, then the mutual potential energy would be very high, as all pairs would be at zero distance. But that's not the minimum. So perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, and not their mutual interactions.

Wait, that would make the problem solvable, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me read the problem again.

"12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system correct to three decimals?"

Hmm, maybe the 12 charges are all fixed at 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other are such that their mutual potential energy is minimized. But how?

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at a distance of 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are as large as possible. For example, if they're arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, each as far apart as possible. But without more information, it's hard to compute their mutual potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and not their mutual interactions. That would make the problem solvable, so perhaps that's the case.

If that's the case, then the total energy U is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m).

Which is 12 * (k *4 e²)/(2 * 2m) )? Wait, no. Let me recalculate:

Each pair between the 13th and the 12 charges:

U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m) ) = k*(4e²)/(2 m) ) = 2 k e².

Multiply by 12: 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

So the total U is 24 k e².

But wait, what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? If they're all at the same point, that would be a problem, but perhaps the problem is assuming that their mutual distances are much larger than 2 m, but that's not stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is negligible, but in reality, for 12 charges, the mutual interactions would add a significant amount.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 m from P and from each other. But that's impossible for 12 points on a sphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's impossible unless they're infinitely apart, which isn't the case.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge. Let's proceed under that assumption, because otherwise the problem doesn't give enough information.

So, the total potential energy would be 24 k e².

But wait, let me compute that. Let's plug in the numbers.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.6e-19 C.

So, e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So, each term is 2 * 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38.

Let me compute that step by step.

2 * 8.988e9 = 1.7976e10.

1.7976e10 * 2.56e-38 = (1.7976 * 2.56) * 1e(10-38) = approx.

1.7976 * 2.56 = let's calculate:

1.7976 * 2 = 3.5952.

1.7976 * 0.56 = approx 1.7976 * 0.5 = 0.8988, 1.7976 *0.06=0.107856. So total 0.8988 + 0.107856= 1.006656.

So total 3.5952 + 1.006656 = 4.601856.

So 4.601856e-28 J.

Wait, wait, no. 1e(10-38) is 1e-28.

So each term is 4.601856e-28 J.

But each of the 12 charges contributes a term. Wait, no. Wait, we had 24 k e².

Wait, 24 * (k e²) is 24 * (8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2 ) / 2.

Wait, no. Wait, the earlier calculation might have an error. Let me re-express.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed, so each of the 12 charges has an energy of (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 m) ) = k*(4e²)/(2 * 2). Wait, wait, the distance is 2 m, so denominator is 2 m.

Wait, no, (2e)*(2e) is 4e². r is 2 m. So U_i = k*(4e²)/(2).

Which is (k *4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So each of the 12 charges contributes 2 k e².

So 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now, compute 24 * k * e².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So,

24 * 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 24 * 8.988e9 = 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Then multiply by 2.56e-38:

2.15712e11 * 2.56e-38 = (2.15712 * 2.56) * 1e(11-38) = 5.52586e-27 J.

Wait, wait, (2.15712 * 2.56) = let's compute:

2 * 2.56=5.12.

0.15712 * 2.56 ≈ 0.4024.

So total ≈5.5224.

So 5.5224e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about four times larger than 5.5e-27.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988e9.

Let me compute 24 * 8.988e9.

8.988e9 is approximately 8,988,000,000.

24 * 8,988,000,000 = ?

Well, 20 * 8,988,000,000 = 179,760,000,000.

4 * 8,988,000,000 = 35,952,000,000.

Adding, 179,760,000,000 + 35,952,000,000 = 215,712,000,000.

Which is 2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.56e-38:

2.15712e11 * 2.56e-38 = (2.15712 * 2.56) * 1e(11-38) = 5.525e-27 J.

Hmm, but none of the options match that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recalculate.

Wait, each of the 12 charges contributes U_i = k*( (2e)^2 ) / (2 m) ), which is k*(4e²)/(2 m) )... Wait, but wait, the 13th charge is at P, and the others are at 2 m from P. So the distance between the 13th and each of the 12 is 2 m.

So, U_i is for each pair (13th and charge i) is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2 m.

Which is k * (4 e²) / 2 m. Wait, no, no, the 2e is each charge, so (2e)*(2e)=4e², and r is 2 m.

So U_i = (k *4 e² ) / (2 m) ) = 2 k e².

So 12 * U_i = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, but 24 * k * e² = 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Let me compute that again.

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988e9.

8.988e9 is 8,988,000,000.

24 * 8,988,000,000 = 215,712,000,000.

Which is 2.15712e11.

Now, multiply by (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

So 2.15712e11 * 2.56e-38 = 2.15712 * 2.56 = approx 5.525, then exponent is 1e(11-38) = 1e-27.

So 5.525e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C, 7.056e-27, which is about 1.3 times larger.

Hmm, but I don't see where I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is included. Let's think about that.

Each of the 12 charges interacts with the others. The number of pairs among 12 charges is C(12,2) = 66 pairs.

Each pair contributes U = k * (2e)^2 / r, where r is the distance between two charges. But if the 12 charges are all at 2 m from P, their mutual distances would vary, but perhaps in the minimal energy configuration, they are arranged in a way that each pair is as far apart as possible. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that all the 12 charges are at the same point, which would make their mutual potential energy very high (since r approaches zero), but that's not the case for minimum energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all the 12 charges to be at a very large distance from each other, but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is neglected, perhaps because the charges are point charges at 2 m, and their mutual distances are large enough that the potential energy is negligible compared to the contribution from the 13th charge. But that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach. Let's compute 24 * k * e² numerically.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.6e-19 C.

So,

24 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2 = ?

Compute (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

So,

24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988e9 = 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

2.15712e11 * 2.56e-38 = ? 

Multiply 2.15712e11 by 2.56e-38:

2.15712 * 2.56 = Let me compute this accurately.

2.15712 * 2 =4.31424.

2.15712 * 0.56 = let's compute 2.15712 * 0.5 = 1.07856.

2.15712 * 0.06 = 0.1294272.

So 1.07856 + 0.1294272 = 1.2079872.

So total 4.31424 + 1.2079872 = 5.5222272.

So 5.5222272e(11-38) = 5.5222272e-27 J.

Which is approximately 5.522e-27 J.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 7.056e-27.

Option B is 2.822e-26.

Wait, 5.522e-27 is about 0.552e-26, which is way smaller than option B (2.8e-26) and option A (5.6e-26).

So none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. For potential energy, perhaps the formula is U = (k q1 q2) / r, but in the system, each pair is counted once. So, for the 13th charge and each of the 12, that's 12 terms. But for the pairs among the 12, that's 66 terms.

But if the problem only considers the 13th charge's interactions, that's 12 terms. Otherwise, the total would be 12 + 66 = 78 terms. But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute their contribution.

But the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero. That doesn't make sense unless all the 12 charges are at infinite distance apart, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered to be zero, and the problem only includes the energy from the 13th charge and the 12.

But according to the calculation, that gives 5.52e-27 J, which is not an option. So perhaps there's a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the charges are electrons, so their charge is -2e, but that wouldn't affect the magnitude of the potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 2 meters apart from each other, but that's not stated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the 24 * k * e².

Wait, 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988e9 = 215.712e9.

Multiply by e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

So 215.712e9 * 2.56e-38 = (215.712 * 2.56) * 1e(9-38) = 552.586 * 1e-29 = 5.52586e-27 J.

Again, same result. So none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5.1 times larger than 5.52e-27. Hmm, 5.52e-27 * 5 = 2.76e-26, which is close to option B.

Wait, but why would the calculation be off by a factor of 5?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Let's see: each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th, so 12 terms. But perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the work done in assembling the charges, which includes bringing each charge from infinity to its position. But in that case, the 13th charge is fixed, and each of the 12 is brought to 2 m away.

Wait, but the formula for assembling charges is different when considering the system's potential energy. The potential energy of a system of charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their final positions, considering the potential due to all charges already in place.

So, when assembling the 13th charge, it's fixed. Then, bringing each of the 12 charges to 2 m from P, each time the potential at P (due to the 13th charge and any previously placed charges) must be considered.

Wait, but since all the 12 charges are identical and placed symmetrically, perhaps the potential at P due to the 12 charges is the same as each charge is placed.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed, so when placing each of the 12 charges, the potential at P due to the 13th charge is V = k*(2e)/(2 m) ) = k* e/(2 m).

Wait, no, the potential at a point is scalar, so for each charge, the potential at P due to any charge at radius 2 m is V = k*(2e)/(2 m) ) = k e / m, where m is 2 m? Wait, no, the distance is 2 m.

Wait, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P. So, when placing the first charge, the potential at P due to the 13th charge is V13 = k*(2e)/(2 m) ) = k e / (2 m). No, wait, the 13th charge is at P, so when placing the i-th charge (among the 12), the potential at P due to the 13th charge is V_13 = k*(2e)/(2 m) ) = (k * 2e) / (2 m) ) = (k e)/m.

Wait, m is 2 meters, so (k e)/(2 m) )? No, wait, no: the distance is 2 m.

Wait, the 13th charge is at P. The first of the 12 charges is placed at 2 m from P. The potential at P due to the 13th charge is V13 = (k * 2e) / (2) ) = (k * e) / 1 ) = k e.

Wait, no, wait, the 13th charge is 2e, and the distance is 2 m. So the potential at P due to the 13th charge is V_13 = (k * 2e) / 2 ) = (k e).

Now, when placing the first charge (among the 12), the work done is the charge times the potential at P due to the existing charges.

Initially, there are no other 12 charges yet, only the 13th. So when placing the first charge q, the potential at P is V = V_13 + V_others (which are zero). So the work done is q * V.

Wait, the charge being placed is 2e. So the work is (2e) * V, where V is the potential at P due to all existing charges before placing this one.

Wait, but the potential at P due to the 13th charge is V_13 = (k * 2e) / 2 ) = k e.

So for the first charge (among the 12), the work done is (2e) * V_13 = 2e * (k e) ) = 2 k e².

Wait, but that's the same as the potential energy term we calculated earlier.

Wait, but when placing the second charge, the potential at P is V_13 plus the potential due to the first charge (among the 12). So, the potential from the first charge is (k * 2e) / 2 m ) = (k 2e )/2 ) = k e.

So V = V_13 + V_12_first = (k e) + (k e) ) = 2 k e.

So the work done for the second charge is (2e) * 2 k e = 4 k e².

Similarly, for the third charge, the potential is V_13 + V_12_first + V_12_second.

Which would be (k e) + (k e) + (k e) ) = 3 k e.

So work done is (2e) * 3 k e = 6 k e².

This pattern continues, so the i-th charge requires a work of (2e) * (i * k e).

So the total work done to bring all 12 charges is the sum from i=1 to 12 of (2e) * (i * k e) ).

Which is 2 k e² * sum_{i=1 to 12} i.

Sum of 1 to 12 is (12)(13)/2 = 78.

So total work is 2 k e² * 78 = 156 k e².

Wait, that's different from the earlier calculation.

Wait, earlier calculation was 24 k e², but this approach gives 156 k e².

Hmm, but which approach is correct?

Ah, I think I see where I went wrong earlier. The initial approach considered each of the 12 charges contributing 2 k e², leading to 24 k e², but that's incorrect because when you bring each charge, the potential at P due to the previously placed charges increases, hence each subsequent charge requires more work.

So the correct approach is to compute the work done in assembling all 12 charges, which is the sum of each individual contribution, considering the potential due to the existing charges.

So, the correct total energy U is the sum of each charge's contribution, which is 2 k e² (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 12).

Sum (1 to 12) is (12)(13)/2 = 78.

So, U = 2 k e² * 78 = 156 k e².

Wait, let me compute that.

156 * k * e².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.6e-19 C.

e² = 2.56e-38 C².

So,

156 * 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38.

Compute step by step:

156 * 8.988e9 = Let's compute 156 * 8.988e9.

156 * 8.988e9 = ?

Compute 156 * 8.988.

8.988 * 100 = 898.8.

8.988 * 50 = 449.4.

8.988 * 6 = 53.928.

So total is 898.8 + 449.4 = 1348.2 + 53.928 = 1402.128.

So 156 * 8.988e9 = 1402.128e9 = 1.402128e12.

Now multiply by 2.56e-38:

1.402128e12 * 2.56e-38 = (1.402128 * 2.56) * 1e(12-38) = 3.583e-26 J.

Wait, let me compute 1.402128 * 2.56.

1.402128 * 2 = 2.804256.

1.402128 * 0.56 = 0.78519 (approx).

So total is about 3.58944.

So 3.58944e-26 J.

Which is approximately 3.59e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 and option A is 5.645e-26.

Hmm, 3.59e-26 is between B and A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the sum.

Wait, when I calculated the sum of 1 to 12, I got 78, which is correct. So 2 * 78 = 156.

Wait, so 156 * k * e².

Let me compute 156 * 8.988e9 = 156 * 8.988 = Let's compute:

8.988 * 100 = 898.8

8.988 * 50 =449.4

8.988 *6=53.928

Total 898.8 + 449.4 = 1348.2 +53.928=1402.128.

So 1402.128e9 = 1.402128e12.

Multiply by e²=2.56e-38:

1.402128e12 * 2.56e-38 = (1.402128 * 2.56) * 1e(12-38) = (3.589) * 1e-26 =3.589e-26 J.

So approximately 3.59e-26 J.

But the options don't have this value. The closest is option B (2.822e-26) and option A (5.645e-26).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, when calculating the work done to assemble the charges, the formula is U = sum_{i=1 to n} q_i * V_i, where V_i is the potential at the position of the i-th charge due to all charges already placed before it.

In this case, we're placing each of the 12 charges at 2 m from P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P.

So, when placing the first charge (among the 12), the potential at P is due to the 13th charge only.

So, V_1 = (k * 2e) / 2 = k e.

Work done for first charge: (2e) * V_1 = 2e * (k e) ) = 2 k e².

For the second charge, the potential at P is due to the 13th charge and the first charge.

V_2 = (k * 2e)/2 + (k * 2e)/2 = (k e) + (k e) ) = 2 k e.

Work done for second charge: 2e * 2 k e =4 k e².

Similarly, third charge: V_3 = 3 k e.

Work done: 2e *3 k e =6 k e².

So, the pattern is work for i-th charge is 2e * i k e = 2 i k e².

Summing from i=1 to 12:

Total U = sum_{i=1 to 12} 2i k e² = 2 k e² sum_{i=1 to 12} i.

Sum i from 1 to 12 is (12)(13)/2 =78.

So, U= 2 k e² * 78= 156 k e².

Which brings us back to the same calculation.

Hmm, but the result doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, without considering the work done in assembling them. If that's the case, then the total U is 24 k e² =5.52e-27 J, which is option C (7.056e-27) is not matching either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me re-calculate 156 * k * e².

156 * 8.988e9 = let's compute:

156 *8 = 1248.

156 *0.988 = let's compute 156 *1 =156. Subtract 156 *0.012= 1.872. So 156 -1.872=154.128.

So total is 1248 +154.128=1402.128.

So, 1402.128e9 =1.402128e12.

Multiply by 2.56e-38:

1.402128e12 * 2.56e-38 = (1.402128 * 2.56) * 1e-26.

1.402128 * 2.56 = let's calculate:

1 *2.56=2.56.

0.4 *2.56=1.024.

0.002128 *2.56≈0.005437.

So total is 2.56 +1.024=3.584 +0.005437=3.589437.

So, 3.589437e-26 J.

So approximately 3.59e-26 J, which is closest to option A (5.645e-26) and option B (2.822e-26). But it's not matching exactly.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12. That would give U=24 k e²=5.52e-27 J, which is about 5.52e-27, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the 13th charge as fixed, so only the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is considered. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the approach. Let me think again.

Another approach: the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of all pairwise potentials.

In this case, there are 13 charges.

The 13th is fixed at P. The other 12 are each at 2 m from P.

So, the pairs are:

- Each of the 12 with the 13th: 12 pairs.

- Each pair among the 12: C(12,2)=66 pairs.

So, total pairs: 78.

Each pair contributes U = (k * (2e)^2 ) / r_ij.

For the 12 pairs between 13th and the others: r_ij=2 m.

For the 66 pairs between the 12: r_ij is the distance between two of the 12 charges, which are all at 2 m from P. But without their arrangement, the distance r_ij can't be determined.

But the problem asks for the minimum energy, so perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy. Since they are all positive, they would arrange themselves as far apart as possible to minimize repulsion, which would minimize the potential energy (since potential energy is positive for like charges).

But without knowing their exact positions, it's impossible to compute. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, and not the mutual terms.

But that would give U=24 k e²=5.52e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered to be zero, perhaps if the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual distances are infinite, but that's not practical.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, considering only the 13th's contribution.

But then the answer would be 5.52e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the assembling work. Let me recheck.

Wait, when you assemble the 12 charges, each contributes a certain amount of work. The sum is the sum from i=1 to 12 of 2 k e² * i. Wait, no, each term is 2e * (k e * i ), because the potential at P when placing the i-th charge is i * k e.

So, each term is 2e * (i k e ) = 2 i k e².

Sum from i=1 to 12: sum 2 i k e² = 2 k e² sum i.

Sum i from 1 to 12 is 78.

So, 2 *78=156.

Thus, total U= 156 k e².

Again, same calculation.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the 13th charge as part of the system, but the mutual interactions between the 12 charges are considered as zero. But that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that all the 12 charges are at the same point, so their mutual potential energy is extremely high. But that's not the case for the minimum energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all the 12 charges to be at the same point as the 13th charge, but that's not possible because they're constrained to be at 2 m away.

I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is 2.822e-26 J.

Which is approximately 2.8e-26.

Hmm, 2.8e-26 is about 5.08 times larger than 5.52e-27.

Wait, wait, 5.52e-27 *5=2.76e-26.

Hmm, close to option B (2.822e-26).

So perhaps the problem is considering the system's potential energy as including the 13th charge and the 12, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 2 in the assembling approach.

Wait, the assembling approach gave me 156 k e² =156 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38.

Wait, let me compute 156 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38.

Compute 156 * 8.988e9 =1,402,128,000,000 (1.402128e12).

Multiply by 2.56e-38: 1.402128e12 *2.56e-38 =3.587e-26 J.

So approximately 3.59e-26 J.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a different approach, like using electric potential energy for a system where all the 12 charges are at 2 m from the 13th, but the mutual terms are not considered.

Then, the energy is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) )= 24 k e²=5.52e-27 J.

Which is not an option, but option C is 7.056e-27.

Wait, 7.056e-27 is about 1.278 times larger than 5.52e-27.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 24 * k * e² again.

24 *8.988e9 =24 *8.988e9= 215.712e9=2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.56e-38:

2.15712e11 *2.56e-38=5.5258e-27 J.

So, 5.5258e-27 J is approximately 5.526e-27.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is larger.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula U = (k * q² ) / (2 r ), considering the system's potential energy as the work done to bring all charges together.

Wait, for a system of n identical charges, the potential energy can be calculated as U = (n (n-1) k q² )/(2 r ), where r is the distance from the center.

But wait, that's when all charges are placed on a sphere of radius r, each pair being at a distance of 2 r sin(theta/2), but it's a simplification.

Alternatively, for a system of n identical charges at the vertices of a regular n-polygon (in 2D), the potential energy can be computed, but in 3D, it's more complex.

But perhaps the problem is using a simplified formula, considering that each charge interacts with the others at a distance of 2 m.

Wait, if all 12 charges are at 2 m from P, perhaps their mutual distances are 4 m (if diametrically opposite), but that’s only in a specific arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from each other, but that's not possible for 12 charges.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P, and the mutual distances between them are 2 m as well, but that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges, and not the mutual terms. So, the total U is 24 k e²=5.52e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J, which is 5.1 times larger than 5.52e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute all steps.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 2e instead of e. Let me recheck.

Each charge is 2e. So, when calculating U between the 13th and a charge, it's (2e)*(2e) =4 e².

Wait, but in the assembling approach, perhaps the potential at P due to the 13th charge is V= k*(2e)/(2 m) )= k e/(m).

Wait, no, the distance is 2 m, so V= k*(2e)/(2) )= k e.

Ah, yes, that's correct.

So, when assembling the first charge, work done is (2e) * (k e )=2 k e².

Second charge: (2e) * (k e +k e )=2e * 2 k e=4 k e².

So, total for 12 charges: sum from i=1 to 12 of 2 i k e².

Which is 2k e² sum i=1 to12 i = 2k e² *78=156 k e².

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

But none of the options are matching. Perhaps the problem expects only the potential energy between the 13th and the 12 charges, which is 24 k e²=5.52e-27 J. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of e. Let me recheck: e is 1.602e-19 C. So e² is (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 C².

So, let me recalculate 24 *k *e².

24 *8.988e9=215.712e9.

Multiply by 2.566e-38:

215.712e9 *2.566e-38=5.547e-27 J.

Again, same as before.

Hmm. I'm not seeing any other approach. Perhaps the correct answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J.

Wait, wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the energy of a system of point charges in electrostatic equilibrium, which is U = (1/2) * sum U_ij, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a point charge in the field of another, but multiplied by the number of charges.

But I think the only approach that makes sense is the assembling approach, which gives approximately 3.59e-26 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B, which is approximately 2.822e-26 J.

But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, which is 1.278 times larger than 5.52e-27 J.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at a distance of 2 m from P and from each other. But that's not possible for 12 charges in 3D space. Alternatively, perhaps they're arranged in a circle, each at 2 m from P, but the mutual distance would be 4 m if diametrically opposite, but that's for only two charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is negligible, so the problem only considers the potential energy due to the 13th charge.

In that case, the answer would be 5.52e-27 J, which is not an option. So I'm stuck.

Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the assembling approach by a factor of 2.

Wait, let me re-express the assembling approach again.

When assembling the first charge, work done is 2 k e².

Second:4 k e².

Third:6 k e².

...

Twelfth:24 k e².

So the sum is 2 k e² (1 +2 +3 + ... +12 )=2 k e² (78 )=156 k e².

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 13th charge is also being counted, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the charges are protons, so positive, but that doesn't change anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the potential energy to be calculated as (k * (2e) * (2e) ) / (2 m) ) * (12 + 11 + 10 + ... +1 ), which is the same as the assembling approach.

Hmm.

In the end, after all this, I think the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J.

Wait, let me compute 156 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38.

156 *8.988e9 =156 *8.988e9.

Compute 156 *8.988e9:

8.988e9 = 8,988,000,000.

156 *8,988,000,000 = ?

Compute 100 *8,988,000,000 =898,800,000,000.

50 *8,988,000,000=449,400,000,000.

6 *8,988,000,000=53,928,000,000.

Adding together: 898,800,000,000 +449,400,000,000=1,348,200,000,000 +53,928,000,000=1,402,128,000,000.

So 1.402128e12.

Multiply by 2.56e-38: 1.402128e12 *2.56e-38=3.589e-26 J.

3.589e-26 is 3.59e-26.

So, if there's a typo in the options, perhaps the intended answer is 3.59e-26, but that's not an option.

So perhaps the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26.

But I'm not certain.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total potential energy of the isolated system of 13 identical charges. Each charge has a magnitude of \( 2e \), where \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the remaining 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of \( 2 \, \mathrm{m} \) from \( P \). The total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of all pairwise interactions.

### Key Contributions to Potential Energy:
1. **Interactions between the 13th charge and the 12 charges**:  
   Each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th charge. The potential energy for each pair is given by:  
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{k \cdot (2e) \cdot (2e)}{2} = \frac{4k e^2}{2} = 2k e^2
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such pairs, the total contribution is:  
   \[
   U_{13 \text{ and } 12} = 12 \cdot 2k e^2 = 24k e^2
   \]

2. **Interactions among the 12 charges**:  
   The 12 charges are constrained to stay at \( 2 \, \mathrm{m} \) from \( P \), but their exact arrangement is not specified. Without explicit information about their relative positions, it is unclear how to calculate their mutual potential energy. However, the problem likely assumes that the mutual interactions are negligible or already accounted for in the given options.

### Total Potential Energy:
The total potential energy of the system is dominated by the interactions between the 12 charges and the 13th charge, as the mutual interactions among the 12 charges are not explicitly calculated. Thus, the total potential energy is approximately:  
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 24k e^2
\]

### Numerical Calculation:
Using \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \) and \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \):  
\[
e^2 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.56 \times 10^{-38} \, \mathrm{C^2}
\]  
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 24 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.56 \times 10^{-38})
\]  
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 24 \cdot 2.297 \times 10^{-29} = 5.513 \times 10^{-28} \, \mathrm{J}
\]  
This result does not match any of the provided options directly.

### Comparison with Options:
- **Option A (\( 5.645 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{J} \))**: This is significantly larger than the calculated value.  
- **Option B (\( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{J} \))**: This is also larger than the calculated value but closer in magnitude.  
- **Option C (\( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \mathrm{J} \))**: This is smaller than the calculated value.  
- **Option D (\( 122.330 \, \mathrm{J} \))**: This is orders of magnitude larger and unrealistic for the given setup.

Given the mismatch between the calculated value and the options, the most plausible explanation is that the problem assumes additional contributions to the energy, such as the work done in assembling the charges, which would increase the total energy. Based on the provided options, the closest match to the expected result is **Option B (\( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{J} \))**, which is approximately 5.1 times larger than the calculated value.

ANSWER: B
