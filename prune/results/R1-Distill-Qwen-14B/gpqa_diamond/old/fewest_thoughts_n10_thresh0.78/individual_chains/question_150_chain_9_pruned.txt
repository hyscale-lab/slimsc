Okay, let's try to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the final product after a series of reactions. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me break it down.

First, the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I'm a bit rusty on NMR, but I remember that certain regions correspond to specific functional groups. The 9.7 ppm is a triplet, which is quite upfield. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 9.7 ppm is actually a high value. Oh, no, wait, 9.7 is actually a deshielded proton. Could that be an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or sometimes a triplet if coupled with another proton. Wait, but in this case, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde.

But wait, looking again, it's a triplet. Aldehydes usually don't couple much because the aldehyde proton is next to a carbonyl, which doesn't have protons. Oh, wait, maybe it's an enol or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, the triplet could suggest that the proton is next to a CH2 group. But wait, aldehyde is RCHO, so the aldehyde proton is adjacent to a carbon with no other hydrogens. So that can't be a triplet unless it's coupled with a neighboring CH2. Hmm, maybe it's an enol form? Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that cause splitting.

Wait, maybe the 9.72 is an aldehyde. Let's tentatively say that's an aldehyde proton.

Looking at the other signals:

6.98 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That's probably two protons on an aromatic ring, perhaps para-substituted. Because in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons are equivalent and each would couple with two others, but in a para-substituted
