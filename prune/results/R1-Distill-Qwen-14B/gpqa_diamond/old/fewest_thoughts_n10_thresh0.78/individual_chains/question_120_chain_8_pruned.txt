Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, meaning they're spread out evenly in all directions. We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, so I think it's about figuring out the relationship between parallax and the number of stars in a certain range.

Wait, what's parallax again? Oh right, the parallax of a star is the apparent shift in its position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax (d = 1/plx). So bigger parallax means closer stars.

Now, the number of stars per unit parallax. Let's consider that the distribution is uniform, so the number of stars should depend on the volume of space at various distances. Because stars are spread out uniformly, the number we can observe depends on how much volume we can see as we look further out.

Wait, volume in 3D space. If we think about a spherical shell at a certain distance, the volume is proportional to the radius squared times the thickness. So, Volume = 4πr² * dr, where dr is the thickness. Or wait, in terms of distance, each shell's volume is 4πd² dd, where d is distance and dd is the change in distance.

But parallax is related to distance. Since plx = 1/d (d in parsecs), then d = 1/plx. So, substituting into the volume, we get 4π(1/plx)^2 * (d d). Wait, but I'm trying to find the number per unit parallax, so perhaps I should express this in terms of plx.

Alternatively, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be proportional to the surface area of that shell (since they are uniformly distributed), multiplied by the thickness. Wait, no, because if they're uniformly distributed in space, the number density is constant, so the number in a volume would be density * volume. But if the density is uniform, say n stars per cubic parsec, then the number in a shell is n * (4πd² dr), yeah.

But how does this relate to parallax? Let me think. Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's make a substitution: d = 1/plx, so dr (change in d) would be the change in distance corresponding to a small change in parallax. Hmm, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx.

Let me consider a small range of parallax from plx to plx + d_plx. The corresponding distances would be from d to d + dd, where dd = -d^2 d_plx, because plx + d_plx = 1/(d + dd), so maybe.

Wait, let me get the relationship between dd and d_plx. Since plx = 1/d, taking differentials:

d_plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² d_plx. But since d_plx is a small positive change, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But when considering the number of stars in a range, the actual thickness should be positive. So perhaps I can ignore the sign and just focus on the magnitude.

So the volume between d and d + dd (which is d = 1/plx and d + dd) is approximately 4πd² dd. Substituting dd from above: 4π d² (d² d_plx) → 4π d^4 d_plx. But d is 1/plx, so substituting d = 1/plx:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^4 * d_plx.

Wait, so the volume between plx and plx + d_plx is proportional to (1/plx^4) * d_plx. But wait, that can't be right because when
