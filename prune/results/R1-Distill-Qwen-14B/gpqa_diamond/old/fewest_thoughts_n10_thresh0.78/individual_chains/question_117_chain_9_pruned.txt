Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I think optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, specifically where compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. That usually involves chiral centers or some sort of asymmetry. Let me break down each option provided and see which ones can exhibit that.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining some of these four compounds. I'll go one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   Okay, so this is a biphenyl compound. The substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions of each phenyl ring. The molecule has a central biphenyl structure with two nitro groups on each ring at position 6 and two carboxylate groups at position 2 on each. Wait, I'm trying to visualize the structure. The two phenyl rings are connected at position 1 and 1' (1,1'-biphenyl). So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. 

   Now, can this compound have stereoisomerism? Since biphenyls can have rotations around the central bond, but in this case, are there substituents that would prevent free rotation and create E/Z isomerism? Alternatively, is there a chiral center here? Looking at the substituents, the nitro and carboxylate groups are in specific positions. Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are symmetrical, then no chiral centers. But wait, in this case, each ring has two substituents, but are they arranged symmetrically?

   Alternatively, maybe the substituents on each ring are causing the molecule to be chiral. Let's think: for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Let me imagine the biphenyl as two benzene rings connected at their 1 positions. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Wait, the 6 position is across from the connection point (1), and 2 is adjacent. So the substituents on each ring are in para positions relative to the connecting bond? Or maybe they're at ortho and para positions.

   Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. If the substituents on each ring are mirror images, the whole molecule might be symmetrical. But if the substituents are such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then maybe it could have a chiral center.

   Alternatively, could the biphenyl structure lead to some kind of isomerism? Wait, I'm confusing constitutional isomerism with stereoisomerism here. For optical isomerism, we need a chiral center or a planar chirality or something like that.

   Wait, another approach: The formula for optical isomerism is when there's a lack of internal plane of symmetry. So, does this molecule have such a plane? If the substituents on both rings are arranged in
