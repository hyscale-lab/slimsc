Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's read through it carefully.

Compound A is C3H6. Wait, the molecular formula is C3H6. That could be either propene or cyclopropane, but more likely propene since it's a common alkene. So probably propene (CH₂=CHCH₃).

Then, compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of CCl4. Bromination of an alkene typically adds bromine across the double bond. So propene would add bromine to become 1,2-dibromopropane (if it's a trans addition) or possibly a mixture, but in any case, it's an dibromide. So compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. So when 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with KOH, it will eliminate twice. Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, each Br is adjacent, so when KOH is present, each Br can be eliminated with a base. But wait, 1,2-dibromide reacting with KOH may form an epoxide? No, no, wait. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH would eliminate HBr twice. Let me think: when you have vicinal dihalides (two adjacent Br atoms), treatment with a strong base like alcoholic KOH can lead to elimination, forming an alkene. So two HBr molecules would be eliminated, and we would get back propene. But wait, that can't be right because that's the starting material. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, when 1,2-dibromide (like 1,2-dibromoethane) reacts with a base, it can form ethene. Similarly, 1,2-dibromopropane would form propene again. So compound C is propene again? Or wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but wait. When you have a dihalide, like vicinal dihalide (two adjacent halogens), and you eliminate two HX (like HBr), you get an alkene. So for 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination of two HBr would give back propene, which is compound C. So
