Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars. Specifically, they're talking about the Lyman alpha wavelength, which I remember is around 1216 Angstroms. I think that's in the ultraviolet range. The question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm. Okay, so I'm trying to recall what I know about redshift and how it relates to observed wavelengths. I remember that when a source is moving away, its light is redshifted. The formula that comes to mind is the redshift formula: z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength.

Right, so the rest wavelength here is the Lyman alpha, which is 1216 Angstroms. The observed wavelength would be what we detect here on Earth or with our telescopes.

But wait, the question is about the clouds absorbing the light. So the quasar emits light, including at 1216 Angstroms, which is absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. So from our perspective, the quasar's light that passes through the cloud is absorbed at a specific wavelength. But due to the redshift of the cloud (or the quasar?), the absorbed wavelength would be shifted.

Wait, the cloud is in front of the quasar, right? Because the quasar is the background object. So the cloud's redshift would affect the absorption line we observe.

So the quasar emits light, which is then absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. The cloud's redshift will determine the observed wavelength of that absorption line.

Now, the big thing is that optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because our atmosphere blocks it. So, if the absorbed wavelength is in the optical range, then it's detectable. But if it's still in the UV, it won't be visible from the ground.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers or 121.6 nm â€” that's deep UV. So when it's redshifted, the observed wavelength becomes longer. If that observed wavelength is in
