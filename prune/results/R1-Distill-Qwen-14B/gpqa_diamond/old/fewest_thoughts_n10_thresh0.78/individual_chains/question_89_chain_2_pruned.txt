Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a four-fused cyclohexane rings in a diamond shape. So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure.

Heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows several signals: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, there's an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is typical for a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester.

Wait, when dibromide reacts with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, it usually forms an epoxide if it's vicinal dihalide. Oh wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide. Vicinal would be adjacent (like 1,2), but 1,3 is two apart. Hmm, so maybe it's not epoxide.

Another possibility: elimination reaction. When two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination gives an alkene. But 1,3-dibromide might not form an alkene because the geometry isn't right. Alternatively, could it be a substitution reaction? Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so elimination is more likely.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromide. Let me think: when KOH is in excess and heat is applied, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming a ketone or another carbonyl compound. Wait, how? Maybe each Br is replaced by OH, but that would form a diol, but then why the IR at 1720? Oh, wait, maybe it's a different kind of elimination.

Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement. Wait, pinacol rearrangement happens when a 1,2-diol (vicinal diol) undergoes elimination with acid to form a carbonyl. But in this case, we have a dihalide, so maybe it's a similar scenario but with elimination of HBr twice.

Wait, 1,3-dibromide. So if each Br is on carbons 1 and 3, perhaps when heated with KOH, which is a base, two elimination steps occur, each losing HBr, leading to a conjugated diene? Or maybe forming a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination forming a carbonyl group. Wait, if two adjacent Brs lead to elimination, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So maybe each Br is eliminated with a base, but not in a way that forms a double bond. Maybe forming an epoxide isn't possible here because the bromides are not adjacent.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide, but in adamantane's structure. Let me think about adamantane. It's a four fused cyclohexane rings, so the 1 and 3 positions would be across a bridge or something. If the two Brs are on adjacent carbons in such a structure, elimination could form a bridgehead double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is adamantanone. Because the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH could undergo double dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. That makes sense because the elimination would form a carbonyl group. Let me think: when a dihalide undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice, it can form a carbonyl. For example, 1,2-dibromides usually form alkenes, but 1,3-dibromides might form ketones.

So, product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantanone, or simply adamantanone. Let's check the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests some kind of CH₂ group, maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like an -OCH₂- group. But wait, if it's a ketone, the structure would have no oxygen except in the carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, the IR at 1720 could also be an ester or a ketone. Let me think about the NMR. 4.79 ppm is around where an -OCH₂- group would appear. But if product 1 is an epoxide, then the NMR would have a triplet or quartet from the epoxide CH₂. But the IR of an epoxide doesn't usually show a strong peak at 1720, unless there's another carbonyl present.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diepoxide? No, wait, starting from 1,3-dibromide, adding two epoxide groups would require each Br to be on adjacent positions, which they aren't. So perhaps I'm wrong about the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol. But a diol wouldn't have a carbonyl peak. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR. 4.79 (2H) could be a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or an epoxide. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) might be from the adamantane structure, which is quite shielded, and the 1.94 (2H) could be another CH₂ group.

If product 1 is an epoxide, then 4.79 would be the epoxide CH₂, which is typically a triplet because each H is next to two other Hs (in a CH₂ group next to another CH₂). But wait, in an epoxide, each CH₂ is connected to another CH₂, so each H would have coupling with two Hs from each adjacent CH₂. Wait, but in an epoxide, each CH₂ in the ring would be next to another CH₂, and each H would have two neighboring Hs from each adjacent group.

Wait, but an epoxide ring is a three-membered ring, so each CH₂ is adjacent to the other CH₂. So each H in the epoxide would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH₂, but since they're on the same carbon, it's actually a triplet. Wait, no, epoxide protons are typically a triplet because each H is next to two Hs on the adjacent carbon. So each H in the epoxide CH₂ would see two Hs on the other CH₂, leading to a triplet. But wait, if it's a three-membered ring, each H is also adjacent to the other H on its own carbon, but in a three-membered ring, each CH₂ is connected to two other CH₂ groups.

Wait, maybe for an epoxide, the coupling is more complex. Let me think: in an epoxide, each CH₂ is next to another CH₂. So each H in the first CH₂ would be next to two Hs in the adjacent CH₂. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. So the 4.79 ppm is a triplet for the two Hs. But the integration is 2H, so it's a singlet for each H? Or maybe each H is a triplet, but because two Hs are present, it integrates to 2H as a triplet.

Wait, but in an epoxide, the two Hs on each CH₂ are equivalent, so the splitting would be into a triplet because each H is coupled with two Hs from the adjacent carbon. So the NMR would show a triplet for the 2H, which matches the 4.79 ppm (2H, triplet). That fits. Then, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ would suggest a carbonyl, but an epoxide doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ether. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe it's not an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. But in that case, where would the 4.79 ppm (2H) come from? Maybe an adjacent CH₂ group. Let me think: if the structure is a ketone, perhaps the remaining structure has a CH₂ group next to it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an alcohol. But again, the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, another angle: when 1,3-dibromide reacts with KOH under high heat, maybe it's a double elimination to form a carbonyl. So 1,3-dibromide → (elimination) → ketone.

But how does that happen? Let's think about the mechanism. Each Br is on a carbon, and when KOH abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, if the dihalide is 1,3, maybe each elimination would form a double bond, but that would require each Br to have a beta H. Alternatively, perhaps two eliminations occur, each removing HBr, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps when two adjacent positions lose HBr, a carbonyl forms. For example, in 1,2-dibromides, elimination gives alkenes, but in 1,3, perhaps two eliminations give a ketone. So the product would be adamantanone.

If that's the case
