Okay, I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the problem involves HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for such reactions is typically measured in kilojoules per mole, but the options here have kcal and kJ, so I'll need to pay attention to units.

First, I should figure out which substances are the acid and which are the base. HCl is a strong acid, and H2SO4 is also a strong acid, although it's diprotic. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, the acids will react with the base.

Wait, but when you mix multiple acids and a base, the neutralization will depend on the amounts of H+ and OH- available. So, I need to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then see which is the limiting reagent.

Let me break it down step by step.

Calculating moles of H+ from each acid:

1. HCl: It's a monoprotic acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+.
   Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L).
   Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So, H+ is also 0.1 moles.

2. H2SO4: It's a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 moles of H+.
   Molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 300 mL (0.3 L).
   Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So, H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base Ba(OH)2. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.
Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.
Molarity is 0.5 M, volume is 200 mL (0.2 L).
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So, OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but OH- is 0.2 moles. H+ is 0.28 moles.

The neutralization reaction: H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

So, H+ is in excess. But wait, how much will react?

The OH- is 0.2 moles. So all OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

So, the reaction will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

The remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

Wait, but what about the excess H+? That would mean the final solution is acidic because there's more H+ than OH-.

But the enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ reacting with OH-. So the total enthalpy change would be based on the amount that actually neutralizes.

The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately the same, around -57 kJ/mol (or about -13.7 kcal/mol, since 1 cal is about 4.184 J, so 57 kJ is about 1
