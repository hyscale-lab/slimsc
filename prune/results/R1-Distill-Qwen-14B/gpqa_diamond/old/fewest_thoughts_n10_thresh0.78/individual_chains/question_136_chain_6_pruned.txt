Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that we have a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. We're supposed to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Alright, let's start by recalling what divergence is. Divergence of a vector field measures the magnitude of a vector field's source or sink at a given point. Mathematically, the divergence of a vector field F is ∇·F, and in spherical coordinates, for a vector field that has only a radial component (which this problem states), the divergence is particularly simple to compute.

Wait, right. For a vector field F(r) that only has a radial component, F = F_r(r) e_r, the divergence in spherical coordinates is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r). So here, our field f(r) is F_r(r) = 1/r². So let's plug that into the divergence formula.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The field is f(r) with magnitude 1/r², and it's along the radial direction. So F_r = 1/r², and the other components (like theta and phi) are zero. So the divergence would be (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * F_r).

Substituting F_r, we get (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ). Let me compute that. r² * (1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence is (1/r²)*0 = 0. Hmm, that suggests that the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin.

Wait, but wait a second. If the field is 1/r², that makes me think of electric fields, like the electric field of a point charge. Oh, right! The electric field of a point charge is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / r
