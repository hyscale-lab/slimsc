Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to think through it step by step. Let me try to break down each part of the question and see what I can figure out.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

Alright, let's start by trying to identify each component. Let's list what we know about each:

1. **Substance X**: Incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Hmm, that makes me think of something like NaOH (sodium hydroxide) or KOH (potassium hydroxide), which are strong bases and used in many reactions. Or maybe something else like PCl5? Wait, but it's used in organic chemistry, so maybe it's something like THF (tetrahydrofuran) or a solvent... Wait, but the heavier isotope part suggests maybe deuterium? Because deuterium is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. So maybe X is something like D2O (deuterium oxide), but I'm not sure yet.

2. **Liquid Y**: Reacts violently with X. If X is a base, then Y might be an acid. But let's think about possible reactions. Another possibility is that X is a metal, and Y is an acid. Alternatively, maybe X is something that reacts with an alcohol or another liquid.

3. **Gas W**: Its molecule has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. So the molecular formula would be such that for each atom in the molecule, the number of protons and neutrons are the same or perhaps for the entire molecule. Wait, the problem says the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So for example, if it's H2O, each H has 0 neutrons, but O has 8. H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons would be 2+8=10, total neutrons would be 8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Another example: NH3. N has 7 protons, 7 neutrons. H has 1 each. So, NH3 has 7+3*1 =10 protons, and 7 neutrons. Not equal. Hmm. Let's think of a molecule where the total protons equal the total neutrons.

Wait, maybe CO2? C is 6 protons, 6 neutrons (for
