Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. But let's take it step by step. The question is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given IR and NMR data. The options are A to D.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 with medium to strong intensity. Those are probably N-H stretches because those regions usually indicate either amine or amide groups. Amides typically show broad peaks around those regions, but I'm not sure yet. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That seems like a carbonyl group. The carbonyl in esters and amides usually appears around there. So maybe it's an ester or an amide.

Now the NMR data. Let's go through each peak.

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something that splits into a triplet. A triplet for a methyl group suggests it's next to a CH2 group. Like in an ethyl group: CH2CH3. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide?

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad could mean it's near an electronegative atom or maybe part of an amide. Two protons. Maybe an ethyl group attached to something else, but the coupling is broad, so perhaps it's part of an amide or something deshielded.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet means it's next to a CH2 group. Quartet of 2H—so maybe a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group where each CH2 is split by the other. So that might be the OCH2CH3 group (ethoxy) or perhaps part of a carbamate or something else.

7.0 ppm, doublet, 2H; 8.0 ppm, doublet, 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. Each doublet with 2H suggests symmetry. So maybe two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. The 7.0 and 8.0 ppm could be para-substituted aromatic rings. Like para-substituted phenyl groups.

Putting this together, the compound likely has an aromatic ring with substituents. The IR suggests a carbonyl and possibly amide or amine groups. The NMR shows ethyl groups and aromatic protons.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: benzamide (so a CONH2 group) with an ethoxy group at the 3-position. The IR would have a strong amide peak, which fits the 3420 and 3325 cm-1 (broad from NH). The carbonyl would be around 1680, maybe, but the IR here is 1720, which is a bit higher. Or perhaps it's a substituted amide. Wait, but benzamide might have a lower carbonyl stretch. Hmm.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONR2, so the carbonyl is at around 1720 cm-1, which matches the IR. The ethoxy group would have a triplet in NMR. The formamide would have an NH group, which would show the broad peaks in IR. The aromatic protons would be para to the ethoxy and formamide groups, so two doublets. That fits the NMR.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So this would be a propionamide or propionate ester. Wait, propionate would be an ester (like CH2CH2COO-). The protons would be different. Let's think: the ethyl from the ester would be at around 1.2 (triplet) and 4.0-4.3 (quartet). The NMR given has 4.5 as quartet, which could be the OCH2 in the ester. The amino group would have NH absorption in IR, which is present. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet, which might not fit an ester. Also, the protons on the amine would be broad, but that might not explain the 4.0 peak. I'm not sure, need to think more.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That's an ester: benzoate with an ethyl group. Structure is OEt-O-CO-Ph (with an amino group at para). The IR would show a strong ester carbonyl (1720 is correct). The amine would have N-H stretches, which would be in the 3300-3500 region. The NMR: the ethyl ester would have triplet at 1.2 (CH2CH3), which matches. The OCH2CH3 would be a quartet around 4.5 ppm. Wait, no. Wait, in the benzoate ester, the ethyl group is OCH2CH3, which would be a quartet for the CH2 next to O, which is at 4.5. Then the CH3 would be triplet at 1.2. The 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet of 2H. That doesn't fit because in the ester, ethyl is OCH2CH3, so the ethyl is split into quartet and triplet. But the NMR shows 4.0 (singlet, 2H) and 4.5 (quartet, 2H). Wait, so that would be two separate CH2 groups.

Wait, let me think again. The NMR has 1.20 (t, 3H) – that's a CH3 attached to a CH2. Then 4.5 (q, 2H) – that's a CH2 adjacent to another CH2 (like in OCH2CH3, but the quartet suggests each proton is adjacent to two others – wait, OCH2CH3 would be a quartet for the OCH2 (since the CH2 is next to the CH3, which has 3 H, so quartet). Then 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, maybe it's a NH group, but in D, the amine is in the para position. So the amine protons would be broad, but where? They might appear around 1-5 ppm, maybe as a broad peak. But in the given NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet, but 2H. That doesn't fit. Also, the aromatic protons in D would be 4-aminobenzoate, so the ring would have substituents at para positions. The ortho and para protons would be split into doublets. So in the NMR, the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. That makes sense with para substitution.

Wait, but looking back at the NMR:

- 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). So that's two doublets, each with 2H. So for a para-substituted benzene, maybe two substituents. Or perhaps one substituent causing the two doublets.

Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted ring with two substituents? Or maybe it's a meta substitution? Wait, para substitution would typically have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. For example, if there are two substituents in the para positions, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, if there's one substituent in the para position, the ortho and para protons would be split into doublets. Wait, no, in para substitution, each proton is next to substituents.

Wait, maybe it's a benzamide or something similar with substituents. Let me think about each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy at position 3. So the benzamide has a CONH2 group at position 1, ethoxy at position 3. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2, 4, 5,6. Wait, but that might lead to more than two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution is such that only two sets of equivalent protons remain, but I'm not sure. Also, the IR's carbonyl is 1720, which for an amide might be a bit high. Benzamide's carbonyl is around 1680, but substitution could shift it up.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure: formamide (HCON-) attached to a phenyl group with ethoxy at para. So the phenyl has ethoxy and formamide at para. The formamide's carbonyl is around 1720, which matches the IR. The NH in formamide would give the broad IR peaks. The ethoxy would give the triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. The NMR has 4.0 ppm as a singlet; formamide's NH would be around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak, but that's not present. Wait, the NMR doesn't show a peak around 8 ppm except for the aromatic. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, looking back at the NMR data: the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Hmm. What could that be? Maybe a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative group, like an oxygen or nitrogen. Wait, in formamide, the N is attached directly to the carbonyl. So the formamide structure is HCONR2. Wait, in option B, the formamide is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which would be HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the structure is HCO-N(Ph-OEt). The NH would be present as a singlet, perhaps as a broad peak. But in the NMR given, the only peaks are at 1.20,4.0,4.5,7.0,8.0. There's no peak around 8 ppm for the NH. So maybe that's a problem. Unless the NH is exchanged and not showing up, but that's less likely.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: the benzene ring has an amino group at para and an ester group (OEt) at another position. Wait, no, the benzoate would be the COOEt group. So benzene has COOEt and NH2 in para. The ester group would have the ethyl as OCH2CH3. So in NMR, the ethyl ester would show triplet (1.2, 3H), quartet (4.5, 2H). The amine group would have NH2, which would show up as a broad peak in IR (they do), but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Because the amine protons are usually broad and might appear at lower ppm, around 1-5 perhaps, but not necessarily as a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's the amino group, but I'm not sure.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a propionate ester attached to the benzene ring. So the structure is CH2CH2COO-PhNH2. Wait, wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count the carbons. Phenyl (6 carbons), propionate (3 carbons from COOCH2CH2CH3?), but wait no, propionate would be CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, wait, let me think. The formula is C9H11NO2. Let's break down each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding ethoxy (C2H5O) gives C9H11NO2. So yes, matches the formula. The structure would be OEt group and CON
