Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. The solution has 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters, right? And it contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Wait, I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but wait, no. Orthophosphate is actually the fully deprotonated form, which is PO4^3-. But wait, I thought phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The species can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3-.

The problem gives me the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So that's the first, second, and third dissociations.

The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Oh, right, those are the disodium hydrogen phosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate. So they're related in the phosphate buffer system.

So, when I mix these two salts, they should form a buffer solution. Because KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (since K+ is a spectator ion), and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (since Na+ is a spectator). So the solution will contain H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Hmm. But in this solution, given the pH, will PO4^3- be present significantly? Because HPO4^2- can deprotonate to form PO4^3- if the pH is high enough.

Wait, but the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; this is a buffer between H
