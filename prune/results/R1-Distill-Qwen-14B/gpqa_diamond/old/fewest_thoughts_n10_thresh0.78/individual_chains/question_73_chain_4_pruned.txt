Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember a bit about relativity from my classes, but I'm a bit rusty, so let me think through this.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting velocities like in classical mechanics. Oh right! Relativistic velocities don't add linearly. I think the formula involves some gamma factors or something. Oh wait, the velocity addition formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, wait, wait. Let me get this right. When you're moving at velocity u and another object is moving at velocity v in the same direction, their relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Or is it (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²)? Because direction matters here.

In this case, both are moving in the same direction, positive x. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's B's speed? It would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.5 - 0.6 is -0.1c. So numerator is -0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) → 1 - 0.3 → 0.7. So it's (-0.1c)/0.7 → approximately -0.1428c. Oh wait, but speed can't be negative. Since the relative speed is how fast B is moving relative to A, but since B is behind, the speed is 0.1428c in the negative direction? Or is it just the magnitude? Hmm, but the options are given as positive, so maybe they just take the magnitude. So the relative speed would be about 0.14c, which is like option C or D.

Wait, but wait a second. Which astronaut is moving faster? A is moving at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c*0.6c)/(c²)). Which gives ( -0.1c ) / (1 - 0.3) → -0.1/0.7 c → approximately -0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, so about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c.

Now for the total energy. Total energy in relativity is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy, but wait no, actually total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy would be gamma * m * c². So I need to calculate gamma for each.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c): gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) → v is 0.6c, so v² is 0.36c². So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 → 1.25. So energy is gamma * m * c² → 1.25 * 2m * c² → 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the mass is 2m,
