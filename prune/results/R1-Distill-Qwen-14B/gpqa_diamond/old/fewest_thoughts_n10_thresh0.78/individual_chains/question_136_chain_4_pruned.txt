Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The problem is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Hmm, I remember that divergence is a measure of how much the field is expanding or contracting at a point. 

The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. So, first, I need to figure out the divergence of this field. Wait, I think the divergence of a radial vector field can be found using a specific formula. Oh right! For a vector field that's purely radial and depends only on the radius r, the divergence is (d/dr)(f(r)) * (1) or something like that. Let me think. Oh yes, the divergence in spherical coordinates for a radial vector field F = F(r) r_hat is (1/r²) d/dr (r² F(r)).

So in this case, F(r) is 1/r². Plugging that in, the divergence should be (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ].

Let me compute that. The expression inside the derivative is r² * (1/r²) which simplifies to 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. That means the divergence of F is zero? Wait, but wait, if F is 1/r² radial, then isn't that the electric field of a point charge? Oh right, because for a point charge, E is proportional to 1/r². But wait, the divergence of E is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it has a delta function due to the charge enclosed.

So, in this problem, when we compute the divergence of f, which is 1/r² radial, the divergence would be zero except at r=0. But because the integral is over a volume (a sphere of radius R), maybe we should consider whether the origin is included.

Wait, the problem doesn't mention any sources or sinks except for the behavior of the field. But in the divergence formula, as I calculated earlier, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. Wait, no, let's recalculate.

Wait, let's do it again carefully. The divergence formula for a radial field F(r) is:

∇ · F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F(r)).

So F(r) is 1/r². So r² F(r) = r² * (1/r²) = 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is 0. So ∇ · F = (1/r²)(0) = 0.

Hmm, but wait, that's true everywhere except at r=0, where the function isn't defined smoothly because F(r) has a singularity there. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's undefined.

But when we integrate the divergence over a volume that includes the origin, like the sphere of radius R centered at the origin, what does that give us? Because the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, but the origin is a point of zero volume. However, in the context of Gauss's law, the integral of the divergence of E over a volume that includes a charge would be equal to the charge enclosed divided by ε₀. But wait, in this case, the field is similar to E, but I don't know if there's a charge here. Alternatively, perhaps the divergence theorem applies here.

Wait, the divergence theorem states that the integral of the divergence of F over a volume V is equal to the flux of F through the surface S enclosing V. So, if I compute the flux of F through the surface of radius R, that should be equal to the volume integral of ∇·F over the sphere.

But wait, for F = (1/r²) r_hat, the flux through the surface of radius R would be the integral of F · n over the surface, where n is the outward normal (which is r_hat here). So F · n is (1/R²) * R² = 1? No, wait, F(r) is 1/r², and when r=R, it's 1/R². So the flux is the integral over the sphere of F · n dA. Since F is radial, n is in the same direction, so F · n = F(r) = 1/R². The integral becomes 1/R² * 4π R² (since the surface area of a sphere is 4π R²) → 4π.

So according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of ∇·F is equal to the flux, which is 4π. Wait, but earlier I thought that ∇·F is zero everywhere except at r=0. This suggests that the integral is 4π, which is non-zero. But according to the divergence formula, ∇·F is zero everywhere except at the origin. So how does that reconcile?

Ah, I think it's because the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. The origin is a point where the divergence is not defined, and in the integral, it's treated as a delta function. So the integral over any volume that includes the origin would be 4π, which is the flux. So the integral of ∇·F over the sphere would be 4π, regardless of the divergence being zero elsewhere because the singularity at r=0 contributes that 4π.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the divergence of F is zero everywhere except the origin, then the volume integral would be zero except for the origin's contribution. But how much does the origin contribute? That's where the delta function comes into play. So the
