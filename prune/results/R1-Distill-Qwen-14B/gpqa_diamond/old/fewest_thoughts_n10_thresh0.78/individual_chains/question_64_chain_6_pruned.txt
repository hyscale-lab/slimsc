Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem involves heating an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, to 200°C without air. The result is a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes: first through anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. 

The results are:
- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60 g.
- Tube 3 (copper) gains 0.80 g, producing CuO.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2) doesn't change weight.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A) 13, B) 19, C) 17, D) 15.

Hmm, I need to figure out what's happening here. Let's try to outline the steps.

First, heating the salts. Since it's without air, probably no oxygen is present. So decomposition reactions occur. The gases produced must be a combination of some products from the salts.

The gases pass through Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, but in this case, it's anhydrous. So when the gases pass through, water vapor would be absorbed because Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant. So the weight gain of 3.60 g in tube 1 is probably the mass of water absorbed.

Next, the gases go into Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight of this tube doesn't change. Well, Ca(OH)2 is a base that reacts with acidic gases like CO2. So if the gas mixture had CO2, it should react with Ca(OH)2, forming CaCO3 and water. But since there's no change in weight, maybe there was no CO2 in the gases, or perhaps all of it was already absorbed elsewhere.

Then, the gases pass through red-hot copper. Copper is typically used to react with CO, converting it to CO2 and Cu. The mass gain of 0.80 g in tube 3 suggests that some CO was present. Because when CO reacts with Cu, it produces CuO. The amount of CO can be calculated from the mass of CuO formed.

The remaining gas is 2.24 liters at STP. Since 1 mole of gas at STP is 22.4 liters, that's 0.1 moles. So gas C is 0.1 moles. Let me think about possible gases. If the initial decomposition produced H2O (as absorbed by tube 1), CO (reacted in tube 3), and another gas, perhaps N2? But wait, maybe it's CO2 or something else.

Wait, but the Ca(OH)2 didn't react, so maybe the gas is something like NH3? No, because NH3 is a base too, and might react. Alternatively, maybe it's another gas that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2. Let's think about possible gases from the decomposition of the salts.

Wait, another possibility: the remaining gas could be N2, O2, or maybe an inert gas. But without more info, it's a bit tricky.

Let's try to figure out the amounts. 

From tube 1: 3.60 g of H2O. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 moles of H2O.

Tube 3: 0.80 g of CuO. Molar mass of CuO is 80 g/mol (Cu:63.55, O:16; total ~80). So 0.80 /80 = 0.01 moles of CuO. The reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So for each mole of CO, 1 mole of CuO is formed. So 0.01 moles of CO were consumed. Therefore, 0.01 moles of CO were present.

The remaining gas C is 2.24 L at STP, which is 0.1 moles. Let's assume it's CO2. Alternatively, maybe it's N2 or another gas. Let me see.

So the total gas produced includes H2O (as vapor), CO, and C (maybe CO2 or another).

Wait, but the gases passed through Mg(ClO4)2, which absorbs H2O. Then, after that, any CO would react with Cu, right?

Wait, the gases pass through tube 1 (absorbs H2O), then tube 2 (no reaction), then tube 3 (CO reacts). So the remaining gas is C, which could be CO2 or something else that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2.

But Ca(OH)2 didn't react, so maybe gas C is N2? Because N2 is inert. Alternatively, if gas C is CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2, but the problem says the weight didn't change, so maybe gas C isn't CO2. Hmm, perhaps the initial decomposition produces a mix of CO, H2O, and another gas that doesn't react.

Alternatively, maybe the other gas is NH3, but it would react with Mg(ClO4)2? Wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent, but I don't think it reacts with NH3. Or maybe it does. Not sure.

Wait, the problem says that after all the tubes, only 2.24 L of gas C remains. So the initial gas mixture must have included H2O (absorbed by tube 1), CO (absorbed by tube 3), and another gas that passed through all the tubes unchanged. So gas C is that gas.

So, the initial gases are H2O vapor, CO, and gas C (like N2 or something else).

Let me list the moles:

H2O: 0.2 mol.

CO: 0.01 mol.

Gas C: 0.1 mol.

So the total moles of gas produced are 0.2 + 0.01 + 0.1 = 0.31 mol.

Wait, but wait, when CO reacts with Cu, it's converted to CO2 and CuO. So the 0.01 mol CO would produce 0.01 mol CO2. So in the final gas, maybe we have CO2 and gas C. Wait, but according to the problem, only gas C remained. So perhaps the other gases are completely consumed.

Wait, I need to think again. The setup is:

- Gases pass through tube 1 (H2O absorbed): so only non-water gases go further.

- Then, through tube 2 (Ca(OH)2). If the gas is CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2, but in this case, the weight didn't change. So CO2 must not have been present, or it's all reacted? Wait, but Ca(OH)2 is a solution, so if CO2 was present, it would form CaCO3 precipitate, which would increase the tube's weight. But the problem states that the tube's weight didn't change, which suggests that there was no CO2 in the gas mixture. So gas C can't be CO2. Then, what's gas C?

So, the possible gases after tube 1 are CO and gas C. Then, these go to tube 3, where CO reacts with Cu to form CuO and CO2. So the CO is consumed, and CO2 is formed. Then, the remaining gas is gas C plus the CO2 produced.

Wait, but according to the problem, after all the tubes, only gas C remains. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the CO is consumed, so any CO2 may have reacted with something else, but the only thing after that is the final gas. Alternatively, maybe the other gas is N2, which doesn't react
