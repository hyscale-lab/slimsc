Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is a bit involved, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions leading from some starting material to a final product, and we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Let me read through the steps again to understand what's happening.

1. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. It's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1.

Hmm. I think this might be a Diels-Alder reaction. The starting bicyclo structure is a norbornene derivative. The other compound has two dibromomethyl groups, which suggests it's a dienophile, but wait, norbornene is a diene. So maybe the norbornene is the diene, and the other compound is the dienophile. But the substituents are dibromomethyl.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexadiene has two substituents at positions 5 and 6, each being a dibromomethyl group. So two CH2Br2 groups attached, I think.

Sodium iodide and elevated temperature. Oh, sodium iodide is often used in elimination reactions. But wait, in the presence of dienes and dienophiles, maybe it's a Diels-Alder. Alternatively, the dibromomethyl groups could be involved in some substitution.

Wait, the other starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which is norbornadiene. And it's substituted with a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So the structure is norbornene with an oxygen substituent.

So when norbornadiene (a diene) reacts with a dienophile, perhaps the cyclohexa-1,3-diene derivative, but wait, the dienophile usually has a good electron-withdrawing group. The dienophile in this case is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, but the dienophile might be the cyclohexadiene with the dibromomethyl groups as substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups, so this could be a substitution reaction. But since there are two equivalents, maybe it's a diels-alder reaction adding two groups.

Wait, in a Diels-Alder reaction, one diene and one dienophile combine to form a six-membered ring with two substituents. But if we have two equivalents of the dienophile, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions happen, adding two substituents to the norbornene.

Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4 addition in each case.

Wait, maybe the starting norbornene has a substituent that's an oxygen, but the other reagent is dienophile with Br
