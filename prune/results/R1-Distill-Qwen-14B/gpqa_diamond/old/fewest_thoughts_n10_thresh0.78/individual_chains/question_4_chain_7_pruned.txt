Okay, so I'm trying to answer this Maxwell equations question. Let me think through it. The question is about a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles, meaning you can have a magnet with just a single pole, like a lone north or south. That's different from our universe where magnets always have two poles, north and south, right?

In our universe, Maxwell's equations have certain forms. I remember Maxwell's equations consist of four laws. Let me list them mentally. 

First is Gauss's Law for electricity, which deals with the divergence of the electric field E and relates it to charge density. The equation is ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. Then, Gauss's Law for magnetism, which is ∇·B = 0. Oh wait, because in our universe, magnetic monopoles don't exist, so the divergence of B is zero. 

Next, Faraday's Law of induction, which involves the curl of the electric field E and the time derivative of the magnetic field B. The equation is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. 

And finally, Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, which is about the curl of the magnetic field B and the current density J plus the displacement current ε₀ ∂E/∂t. The equation is ∇×B = μ₀(J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t).

Now, the question states that in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles. So that implies that magnetic monopoles exist there. How would that affect Maxwell's equations?

In our world, because there are no magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B is zero. But if there were monopoles, say a magnetic charge density ρ_m, then Gauss's Law for magnetism would change. Instead of ∇·B = 0, it would be ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, similar to how Gauss's Law works for electric fields with charge density.

So which of Maxwell's equations would change? The second equation, Gauss's Law for magnetism. That's equation number two, which is about the divergence of the magnetic field. So that equation would now be different because the divergence wouldn't be zero anymore—it would relate to the magnetic charge density.

Wait, but the question is asking which equations are different in that universe. So if they have magnetic monopoles, which equations in Maxwell's set are affected?

Looking at the options:

Option A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. That would be the second equation. So that's correct, because in their universe, ∇·B isn't zero anymore.

Option B) The ones related to the circulation of E and divergence of B. Wait, the circulation of E is Faraday's law, which is about ∇×E. But in our universe, that's about the time derivative of B. How would magnetic monopoles affect that? Hmm. Well, if you have monopoles, does Faraday's law change? I'm not sure. Maybe not directly, because Faraday's law relates the changing B to the curl of E. But if B can have sources (div B non-zero), would that affect Faraday's law
