Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The problem has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each. Let's start with part A.

Part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. BuLi is a strong base, and it's often used for deprotonation or in coupling reactions. Wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition or some kind of organometallic reaction.

So the starting structure is a benzene ring with a substituent. Let me draw this out. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy connected to a methyl group. So the benzene has a -O-CH2- group attached. The but-2-en-1-yl part is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no: but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but in this case, it's 3-methyl. So the substituent is OCH2-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the first and second? Wait, no. Let's break it down.

But-2-en-1-yl: position 1 is the end, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, but it's but-2-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between
