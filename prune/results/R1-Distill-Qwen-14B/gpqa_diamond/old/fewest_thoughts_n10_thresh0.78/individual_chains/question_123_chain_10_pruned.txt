Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but let me think it through step by step.

Alright, so the setup is that a supernova occurs in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused about the frames of reference here. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some speed. But in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta. But since both are inertial frames, I think I'll need to use the concept of relative velocity and possibly time dilation due to special relativity, because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. But wait, let me check the numbers.

60,000 km/s. Let me think about the speed of light. I remember it's approximately 299,792 km/s, so 60,000 is about 20% of the speed of light. Hmm, so relativistic effects might be important here. But wait, the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Do I need to consider time dilation?

Let me recall the basics. When two objects are moving relative to each other, their measurements of time can differ. The time in one frame is related to the other by the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where v is the relative speed between the frames.

So, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at the same speed but in the opposite direction. Because when two frames are moving towards each other, their relative speeds add up in the classical sense, but in relativity, it's a bit different. Oh wait, no—relativistic velocity addition is more complicated. But perhaps in this problem, since
