Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The question involves several reactions starting from Compound A and ending up with Compound D. I need to figure out what each compound looks like.

First, let's look at Compound A's proton NMR. It shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, the triplet suggests that the protons are adjacent to two other protons each. Wait, wait. In NMR, the splitting is based on neighboring protons. So a triplet would mean each proton is next to two equivalent protons. Like maybe something like CH2CH2CH3? Or perhaps two sets of CH2 groups adjacent.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm is typical for methyl groups (CH3), since they're usually around 0.9-1.0 ppm. And a quartet at 1.3 ppmâ€”quartet means each proton is next to three equivalent protons. So maybe a CH2 adjacent to a CH3 group. Like, if you have a structure like CH2CH2CH3, but wait, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe a butyl group? Let me think.

So, the triplet for 6H and quartet for 4H. Let me think about possible structures. Six hydrogens as triplet: that's two CH3 groups each as triplet. Each CH3 could be connected to a CH2 group. So maybe a structure like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, let's count.

Wait, if it's two CH3 groups, each as triplet, that would mean each CH3 is next to a CH2. So maybe a diethyl group or something. Wait, diethyl ether has two ethyl groups: each ethyl has a CH2CH3. Let's see, the NMR for diethyl ether would have: the CH2 adjacent to O would be split into a quartet, and the CH3 would be
