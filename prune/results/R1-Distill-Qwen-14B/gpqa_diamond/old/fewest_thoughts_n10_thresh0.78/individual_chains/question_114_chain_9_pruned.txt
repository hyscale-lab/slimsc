Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Then, the options given are A, B, C, D, each with specific A and B reagents.

Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. So NaCN in some conditions... But wait, what is the exact mechanism?

So, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, perhaps in an acidic condition, it forms a cyanohydrin. Oh right, the formation of cyanohydrin from a ketone typically uses a strong acid as a catalyst. The reaction is where the nucleophile (CN-) attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the proton from the acid adds to the oxygen, making it a better leaving group. So the product would be an alcohol and a nitrile group on adjacent carbons.

Wait, in the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's draw that.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see: the structure would be (CH(CH3)(OH)CH2CN). Wait, but wait: butanenitrile has four carbons, right? So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but wait no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN, perhaps. Wait, no. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2
