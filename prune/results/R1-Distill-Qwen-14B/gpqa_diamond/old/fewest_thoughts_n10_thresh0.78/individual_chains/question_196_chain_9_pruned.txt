Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are systems that experience a restoring force proportional to their displacement. In the classical case, it's F = -kx. But this is relativistic, so I guess we need to incorporate special relativity effects.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D, and they all have different forms involving c (speed of light), k (spring constant), m (mass), and A (maximum amplitude).

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², and at maximum speed (when x=0), all that potential is converted into kinetic, which is (1/2)mv_max². So setting them equal: ½kA² = ½mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But this is a relativistic problem, so I can't use that directly.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The total energy is gamma times mc². But wait, for small speeds, the non-relativistic approximation works, but when speeds approach c, we can't ignore relativistic effects.

So the system is a harmonic oscillator, which in the relativistic case... How does that work? Oh right, the force is still F = -kx, but we have to use relativistic momentum and energy.

Let me think
