Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. So, the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r². It also says that the field has a non-zero component only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The answer should be one of the given options.

Hmm, right. So, the question is about calculating the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume. I remember from Maxwell's equations that Gauss's law relates the divergence of an electric field to the charge density. But wait, I'm not sure if this is an electric field scenario or something else. But regardless, I think the process is similar.

The vector field f(r) is radial, which in spherical coordinates is the direction of the unit vector r̂. So, f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. Because the field is only radial, the other components (like θ̂ and φ̂) are zero. So, when I compute the divergence, I only need to consider the radial part.

I recall that the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates for a field that depends only on r is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r), where F_r is the radial component of the field. So, in this case, F_r is 1/r². Let me write that formula down.

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ). Let's compute that.

Wait, wait. Let's compute the term inside first. r² times F_r is r² * (1/r²) = 1. So, the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, ∇·f = (1/(r²)) * 0 = 0. But wait, that can't be right because that would imply that the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin. But let me think again.

Wait, but wait. Suppose F_r = A(r), then ∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² A(r)). So here, A(r) = 1/r², so r² A(r) is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero, so ∇·f = 0 for all r except r=0. But wait, at r=0, the field might not be defined. So, perhaps the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. 

But then, the problem is about the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere of radius R. If ∇·f is zero everywhere except perhaps at a point (the origin), then how does that affect the integral?

Wait, but if the divergence is zero everywhere inside the volume except exactly at the origin, then the integral would be zero. But wait, the origin is a point of zero volume, so maybe
