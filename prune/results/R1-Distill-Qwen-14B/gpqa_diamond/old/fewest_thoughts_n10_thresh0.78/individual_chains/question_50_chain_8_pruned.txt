Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many loops are in the Feynman diagram based on the given expression. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the topology of the diagram. Each loop contributes to the integral's structure, and certain factors come into play based on the number of loops.

Looking at the expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

I need to recall the scaling factors for loop integrals. I think that for each loop, the integral typically contributes a factor of 1/(16π²) from the four-dimensional integration. Wait, no, actually, in 4 dimensions, a loop integral usually includes a factor like (1/( (4π)^2 ))^L, where L is the number of loops. Hmm, but let me think again.

Wait, for a one-loop diagram, the integral might bring a factor of something like (1/( (4π)^2 )) multiplied by log terms or other functions. But sometimes, in higher loops, the powers of (4π) increase. For example, a two-loop diagram would have (1/( (4π)^4 )) because each loop contributes a factor of (1/(4π)^2 ). So, the denominator in the expression is (4π)^6, which would come from three loops, right? Because 2 * 3 =6. Wait, no, 4π squared per loop. So 3 loops would give (4π)^6 in the denominator.

Wait, let me think again. For a one-loop integral, the typical factor after regularization is something like (1/( (4π)^2 )) multiplied by some other terms. Maybe it's (1/( (16π²) )). Or wait, 4π squared is in the denominator. So for each loop, the factor is 1/( (4π)^2 ), so for L loops, it's 1/( (4π)^{2L} )). So in the given expression, the denominator is (4π)^6, so 2L=6 → L=3.

So the number of loops should be 3. Let me check the other
