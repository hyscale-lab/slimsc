Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The options are four different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the given spectral data.

Alright, let's start by looking at the IR data. The FTIR shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters typically have strong absorption around 1730 cm-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that tells me the compound has an ester functional group somewhere in its structure. 

Now, moving on to the 1H NMR spectrum. The description says there are six signals. Let me parse that. Two signals are from aromatic Hs. Wait, but it's a di-substituted benzene ring, right? So a di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns: para, meta, or ortho. The number of distinct aromatic protons depends on the substitution pattern. For example, para substitution would result in two sets of aromatic protons (two Hs each), while meta would have three sets (maybe two each if symmetry allows). But the NMR shows two signals for aromatic Hs, which suggests that the substitution is para. Because para substitution would give two equivalent sets of Hs. Wait, no, wait. Di-substituted para would have two equivalent Hs on each ring position. So the aromatic region would show two doublets or something, each integrating to two Hs each. So two signals, each integrating to 2 H. So that fits with para substitution.

Then, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-Hs. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl Hs are adjacent to double bonds, like in an enol group or an ester group. Wait, so if it's an ester, perhaps the substituents on the benzene include an ester group. Let's think: an ester would be something like O-C-O, connected to an R group. So maybe the substituent is an ester group attached to the benzene ring. So, for example, maybe it's a benzene ring with two ester groups? Or perhaps an ester and something else, but wait, the question says it's di-substituted. So two substituents on the ring.

Wait, but the substituents could be an ester group and something else. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a substituent. Let's think about the structure. For an ester group attached to benzene, like in phenyl acetate, the substituent would be OAc (O-CO-OCH3 or something). Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows that besides the aromatic Hs, there are two vinyl H signals. Vinyl Hs suggest double bonds, so maybe one of the substituents is an ester with a vinyl group, like an allyl ester or something. Or perhaps the substituent is a group like an ester that has a vinyl structure, like maybe an acrylate group.

Also, the NMR shows two signals for –CH3 groups. And importantly, there are no –CH2 signals. So the molecule has two sets of –CH3
