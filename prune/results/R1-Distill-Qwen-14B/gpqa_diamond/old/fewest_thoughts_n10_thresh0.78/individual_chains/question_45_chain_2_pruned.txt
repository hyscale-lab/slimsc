Okay, so I've got this physics problem about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and the answer should be one of them. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²), where n is the quantum number, which is a positive integer (n=1,2,3,...). Oh wait, wait, the question gives E as equal to (π² ħ²)/(2mL²), so that must be E_1, the ground state energy for a single particle. So E = E_1, which would mean each particle's energy is E multiplied by the square of their quantum number. So E_n = n² E.

Now, the particles are spin-1/2, which means each can have a spin of +1/2 or -1/2. But wait, because they are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. So when they're in the same spatial state, their spins must be different. But wait, no—if they have the same spatial wavefunction, their spins must be different. However, if the spatial part isn't the same, they can have the same spin.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's clarify: each particle has a spatial part and a spin part to its wavefunction. Since the particles are identical fermions, the total wavefunction must be anti-symmetric. So if two particles are in the same spatial state, their spin state must be anti-symmetric (like a singlet state with total spin 0), and vice versa.

But in the case of four particles, each with spin-1/2, how does that affect their possible quantum states? Maybe the way to approach this is to consider the possible ways to fill the energy levels with the four particles, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, since the particles are spin-1/2, each spatial orbital (each distinct n) can hold up to two particles with opposite spins. So for each energy level n, we can have two fermions: one with spin up and one with spin down.

So, the strategy is to figure out how the four particles fill up the lowest available energy levels, considering each level can hold two particles.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the order of energy levels. The lowest energy is n=1, then n=2, n=3, etc.
2. Each level can hold two particles.
3. Since we have four particles, we'll need to fill the first two levels: n=1 and n=2, each with two particles.

Wait, but wait. No, if each n level can hold two particles, then n=1 can have two, n=2 can have two, which would sum to four. So all four particles are in the first two energy levels.

Wait, but wait a second. The ground state configuration would be that each lower energy level is filled first. So for the ground state, all four particles would be in the lowest possible energy states, which would be n
