Okay, so I need to figure out which of these assumptions lead to the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, the question is about the impulse approximation, which is a common assumption where nucleons behave like free particles. I remember that this approximation simplifies the calculations by treating each nucleon independently, ignoring their interactions with the nucleus as a whole.

Let me look at the question again. The options are four statements, and I need to pick which three are correct. The choices are A, B, C, D, each combining three of the four statements.

First, what's the impulse approximation about? Oh right, it's treating each nucleon as if they don't feel the average field of the nucleus. So when an interaction happens, it's as if each nucleon is free. That probably means we're neglecting things like the binding forces or the overall nucleus's effect beyond individual interactions.

Now, let's go through each of the four statements.

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
   - So the interaction isn't considering the nucleus as a whole but just one nucleon at a time. That makes sense because in the impulse approximation, each interaction is with a single nucleon, not the nucleus collectively. So statement 1 is probably part of the assumptions.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
   - Wait, what does that mean? If the nucleus is transparent except for the selected nucleon, maybe it's saying that most of the nucleus doesn't interact, only a single nucleon does. Or perhaps it's saying that the other nucleons don't block or affect the interaction. So this would imply that the rest of the nucleus doesn't influence the interaction, which fits with the idea of each nucleon being free. So statement 2 is likely correct.

3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
   - Hmm, this seems a bit unrelated. Quarks' behavior being non-relativistic might affect how the nucleon behaves, but I'm not sure how that ties into the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation is more about the nucleon's interaction with the rest of the nucleus, not the internal structure being relativistic or not. So maybe statement 3 isn't part of the assumptions for this approximation. Or perhaps it is, but I'm not certain.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.
   - Oh, that definitely fits. If the nucleon feels no binding forces, it's acting like a free particle. So statement 4 is part of the assumptions.

So which statements are part of the impulse approximation? Statements 1, 2, and 4 seem to be correct. Let's check the options. Option A is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4. So which is correct?

Wait, statement 3: quarks being non-relativistic. Does that relate to the impulse approximation? The impulse approximation is about how the nucleon interacts with the rest of the nucleus, not about the internal structure of the nucleon. Non-relativistic quarks would affect their internal movement, but for the purpose of the impulse approximation, perhaps it's not a necessary assumption. Or maybe it is, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the impulse approximation doesn't make any assumption about the quarks' behavior beyond their interaction.

Wait, let me think again. The impulse approximation is a way to model interactions in a nucleus where each nucleon is treated as if it's free. So for each interaction, only one nucleon is involved, and the others are considered as a sort of spectator. The nucleus is transparent except for the one nucleon, meaning that the other nucleons don't block the interaction. So statement 2 is about the transparency, which would be part of the assumption. Statement 4 says that the selected nucleon doesn't feel binding forces, which aligns with the idea of being free.

So the three correct statements are 1,2,4. Let me check the options. Option A is
