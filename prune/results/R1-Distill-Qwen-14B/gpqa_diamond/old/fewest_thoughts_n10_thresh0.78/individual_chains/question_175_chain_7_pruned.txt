Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with its symmetry along the z-axis. The question is about the radiated power and some characteristics of the radiation. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation, and the distribution depends on the shape and how it's moving.

The problem states that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda (the wavelength) and theta (the angle from the z-axis). We're told that the maximum power is A, and we need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of f as a function of lambda.

I think this has to do with the radiation pattern of a dipole antenna or something similar. Wait, because the charge distribution is oscillating, it's probably acting like a dipole radiator. For a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is given by a certain formula.

Wait, I remember that the electric field for a dipole radiates and the intensity is proportional to (sin theta)^2, where theta is the polar angle. Oh right, that's the standard dipole radiation pattern. The intensity, which relates to power per unit area, peaks in the equatorial plane (theta = 90 degrees), and is zero along the axis (theta=0 and 180). So the maximum intensity is when sin theta is maximum, which is at theta =90, but here the question is about theta=30 degrees.

Wait, but the question is about the power per unit solid angle, which I think is the intensity. So the function f would be proportional to (sin theta)^2, times some dependence on lambda, maybe. But what about the variation with lambda?

Wait, the problem says the radiation has a wavelength lambda, so I suppose the function f depends on lambda as well. Let me think about the power radiated. For an oscillating dipole, the power radiated is proportional to the square of the acceleration (or the square of the charge's oscillation), but in terms of the far field, the radiated electric field is proportional to (1/r) and the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to (1/r^2). But in terms of power per unit solid angle, which is intensity,
