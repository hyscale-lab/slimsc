Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let me think. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So the more mass and smaller the volume, the higher the density. Let me break down each option.

Option a is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? Because Earth is made of rock and metal. So this one would have that density.

Option b is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait. If the density is given, that's the value. So regardless of mass, if density is 5.5, that's the value. But wait, how is density related to mass? Because density depends on mass and radius. So if the mass is 2 Earths but the same density, then the radius must be larger. Oh, but in this case, the density is given as 5.5, so maybe it's a different composition? Or perhaps it's not relevant because the question is asking which has the highest density. So option b's density is 5.5, which is same as Earth.

Option c is a planet with the same composition as Earth but five times more massive. Same composition means same density, right? Because density is an intensive property. So if it's made of the same stuff as Earth, density is same. So Earth's density is about 5.5, so this planet's density is also 5.5. But wait, its mass is 5 Earth
