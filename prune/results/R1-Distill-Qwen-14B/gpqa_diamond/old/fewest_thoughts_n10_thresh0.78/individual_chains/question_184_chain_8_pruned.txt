Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. The goal is to figure out which sequence of reactions will lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a bunch of steps. 

First, let's visualize the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene is a ring with six carbons. The numbering would be such that the substituents are in specific positions. Let me clarify: the formula is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So numbering the ring, the substituents are at positions 1,2,3. Wait, noâ€”benzene is a six-membered ring. So positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. But wait, the numbering: I think the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, which are adjacent. Wait, but that would make the substituents all in a row. Wait, I think I might be miscounting. Let me try to draw it mentally.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me imagine the substituents attached to the benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are at positions 1,2,3. So 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro. So the substituents are in the order (assuming numbering starts at the ethoxy group) ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So the three substituents are adjacent? Because 1,2,3 are next to each other in a ring.

But wait, wait. Wait, in benzene, each carbon is connected to two others. So positions
