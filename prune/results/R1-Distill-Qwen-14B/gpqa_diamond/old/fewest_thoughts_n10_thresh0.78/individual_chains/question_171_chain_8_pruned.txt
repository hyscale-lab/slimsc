Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's try to break it down.

The question is about the substitution of bromine on different aromatic compounds. Each substance from 1 to 6 is undergoing an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. Hmm, wait, increasing order of para-isomer yield? Or maybe it's the other way around. Oh, the question says arrange in order of increasing weight fraction, which means from lowest to highest para yield.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no: the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each compound, we're looking at how much of the para-substituted product is formed. Then, we arrange the substances from the one with the least para product to the one with the most.

But wait, no. Wait, the question says "increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer." So we arrange them so that the first has the lowest para yield, and the last has the highest.

Right. So first, I need to figure out for each compound which positions the substituent directs incoming electrophiles to. Because in electrophilic substitution, substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct the incoming groups to ortho, meta, or para positions.

Let me list the compounds:

1) C6H5-CH3 → methylbenzene (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 → phenyl acetate? Wait, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So it's a benzene ring with a COOEt group. So that's an ester group, specifically O-acetyl.
3) C6H5-Cl → chlorobenzene
4) C6H5-NO2 → nitrobenzene
5) C6H5-C2H5 → ethylbenzene
6) C6H5-COOH → benzoic acid

Wait, wait, for compound 5, C6H5-C2H5 is ethylbenzene, correct. And compound 6, it's benzoic acid.

Now, each substituent directs the incoming electrophile (bromine) to certain positions. Let's consider each substituent's directing effects.

First, I need to determine if each substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para directing or meta directing.

1) Methyl group (-CH3): activating (since it's an electron-donating group, being an alkyl group), ortho/para director. So in electrophilic substitution, the incoming Br will go to para and ortho positions.

Wait, but wait: methyl is a strong activating group. So when the substituent is activating, the ring is more reactive, and the incoming electrophile is more likely to attack at the ortho and para positions relative to the substituent.

But wait, the substituent could also be para directing. For example, in toluene, the methyl group is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, it's more likely to add para to the methyl group, but also ortho.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the para-isomer yield. So for each substituent, we want to know the percentage of para product.

But when there are multiple substituents, like if the substituent is meta directing, then the para product would be less. For example, nitro groups are meta directors, so the incoming Br would go meta to the nitro group. So in nitrobenzene, the Br would add meta to the nitro group. But wait, nitro is a meta director, so it would direct incoming groups to meta positions. So when nitrobenzene reacts with Br2, the Br adds in the meta position relative to the nitro group, so the major product would be the meta isomer, not the para.

Wait, but wait: nitro groups are meta
