Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle in a potential. Let me see what I can remember about this. The question is about finding the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Hmm.

The potential given is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential, but in three dimensions and isotropic, meaning it's the same in all directions. So this is like a 3D quantum harmonic oscillator. I remember that in 3D, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. 

In one dimension, the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). But in three dimensions, since the potential is isotropic, the energy depends on the total number of quanta in each direction. So for 3D, the energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω, because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, and adding them gives the total.

Wait, another approach I recall is that in 3D, the energy levels can be expressed in terms of a single quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy would be E = (N + 3/2) ħω. So each energy level corresponds to a specific N value.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Excited states are counted starting from the lowest energy state. So the ground state is the lowest, then first excited, second, etc. So the ground state is N=0, first excited N=1, second N=2, third N=3. Wait, no, wait. Because sometimes the ground state is considered as the 0th state, so first excited would be the next one.

Wait, let me think. The ground state is the state with the lowest energy. For the 3D harmonic oscillator, the ground state is when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0, so N=0. Then the first excited state would be the first state with higher energy. That would be when N=1. The second excited would be N=2, and third excited would be N=3. So the third excited state has N=3.

So the energy for N=3 would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that part would match option A or C, since they have (9/2) ħω.

Now, the second part of the question is how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to that energy eigenvalue. So we need to find the degeneracy of the N=3 level.

The degeneracy in 3D harmonic oscillator is given by the number of ways to have n_x + n_y + n_z = N. So for N=3, how many non-negative integer solutions are there to that equation?

I can calculate that. It's a stars and bars problem. The number of solutions is (N + 3 -1) choose (3 -1) ) = (3 + 2) choose 2 = 5 choose 2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10. That matches option A, which says (9/2) ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up N. So N is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So for N=3, the degeneracy is (3 + 2) choose 2 = 10, yes.

Looking back at the options, option A is (9/2) ħω, 10. Option C is the same energy but with 3, which would be wrong. So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves a quantum harmonic oscillator in three dimensions with an isotropic potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels in such a system are determined by the total quantum number \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \), where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are the quantum numbers in the three spatial directions. The energy of a state is given by:

\[
E = \left(N + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega
\]

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state. Since the ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \), the first, second, and third excited states correspond to \( N = 1, 2, 3 \), respectively. For \( N = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

Next, the degeneracy of the \( N = 3 \) level is determined by the number of ways to write \( N = 3 \) as the sum of three non-negative integers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \). This is a combinatorial problem solved using the "stars and bars" method, which gives:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{N + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \)**

Answer: A
