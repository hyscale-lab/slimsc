Okay, let me try to figure out this Maxwell's equations question. So the question is about a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. How does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Hmm, in our universe, we know that magnets always have both North and South poles; you can't isolate just one. This is because of Gauss's Law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero everywhere. So ∇·B = 0. That's one of Maxwell's equations.

But if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, like a single North or South pole, that would change things. Because if you have isolated poles, they would act sort of like magnetic charges. So Gauss's Law for magnetism would no longer hold. Instead of the divergence being zero, it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. So instead of ∇·B = 0, it would be ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. That changes the divergence equation for B.

Wait, but Maxwell's equations have four parts. Let me think about each one. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

In our universe, equation 2 is ∇·B = 0. But in this other scenario where isolated poles exist, equation 2 would change. So equation 2 would no longer be zero divergence. So that equation is definitely different.

Wait, what about the other equations? If magnetic monopoles exist, would that affect the other equations? Let me think. Faraday's Law involves the curl of E. How would that change? Well, when we have magnetic charges, another equation comes into play. I remember that in the presence of magnetic charges, the curl of E would have a term involving the magnetic current density. So Faraday's Law would change. Wait, but in our universe, the curl of E is -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic charges, maybe there's another term.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. When there are magnetic monopoles, the symmetry between electric and magnetic fields is broken. So the modified Maxwell's equations would have:

∇·B = ρ_m (instead of zero)
∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m (where J_m is the magnetic current)
And perhaps the other equations change too.

Wait, no. The other equations would change as well. Ampère's Law, which is equation 4, would include a term for the time derivative of E in the presence of electric currents and displacement. But if there are magnetic charges, would equation 4 change? Let me think. Ampère's Law relates the curl of B to the current and displacement. So, if we have magnetic current, perhaps equation 4 remains the same because it
