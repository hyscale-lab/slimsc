Okay, so I've got a quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which is the same as what's given. So the particle is undergoing a force proportional to r, like a spring, so it's a harmonic oscillator in three dimensions.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that same energy. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's tackle each part step by step.

First, the energy levels. I remember that in three dimensions, for a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. Each state is described by the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z, which are non-negative integers (0,1,2, ...). The energy for each state is given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Oh wait, wait. Because in three dimensions, each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them gives E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2).

But wait, another way to think about it is that the energy levels are degenerate. The energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers, which is often denoted as n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy can be written as E_n = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is the total number of quanta, so n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Now, the ground state is when n is the smallest possible, which is 0 (all n_x, n_y, n_z are zero). The first excited state would be when n=1, the second excited state when n=2, and so on.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the third excited state. So let's count:

- Ground state: n=0 → energy E_0 = (3/2) ħω → this is the lowest energy.
- First excited state: n=1 → E_1 = (5/2) ħω.
- Second excited state: n=2 → E_2 = (7/2) ħω.
- Third excited state: n=3 → E_3 = (9/2) ħω.

So the energy of the third excited state is (9/2) ħω. Looking at the options, option A has (9/2) ħω as the energy. Option C also has (9/2) ħω, but with 3 eigenfunctions, which doesn't seem right because for higher n, the degeneracy increases.

Now, the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions have the same energy eigenvalue? That is, the degeneracy of the third excited state.

The degeneracy depends on the value of n. For each n, the number of distinct (n_x, n_y, n_z) triplets that sum to n. So for n=3 (third excited state), how many triple
