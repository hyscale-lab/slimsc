Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm. Let's break it down.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) → product 1.

I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo elimination reactions, typically E2 mechanisms, leading to alkenes. The formation of an alkene would fit with the IR spectrum showing a peak around 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the IR peak is at 1720, which is more indicative of a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester). But wait, product 1's IR has that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the first step isn't elimination. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons of the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH could lead to elimination (forming a double bond), but if KOH is in excess, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Oh, wait, maybe the product is an epoxide? Because epoxides have a carbonyl-like absorption. No, wait, epoxide IR is usually around 1250-1000 cm⁻¹ for the C-O stretch. So that 1720 is probably a ketone.

Wait, maybe the first step is a substitution reaction. But with KOH, which is a strong base, more likely to eliminate. Unless it
