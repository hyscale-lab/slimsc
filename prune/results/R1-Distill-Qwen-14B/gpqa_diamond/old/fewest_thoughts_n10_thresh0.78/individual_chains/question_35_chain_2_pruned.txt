Okay, I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the problem says that the operator A_y is given by c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. 

I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices, which are used for spin-1/2 particles. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Wait, the matrix S given here looks a lot like the Pauli Y matrix. Let me think: the Pauli Y matrix is usually [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches exactly with the S matrix provided. So, S is σ_y.

The operator A_y is c multiplied by σ_y. So, A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. The eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue, and φ is the eigenvector.

The eigenvalues of a matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0. Let me compute that.

First, let's write A_y explicitly. σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Multiplying by c = h/(4π), A_y becomes [[0, (-i)(h/(4π))], [(i)(h/(4π)), 0]]. 

So, the matrix is:
[ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

The characteristic equation is determinant of (A_y - a I) = 0. So,

| -a        (-i h)/(4π)       |
| (i h)/(4π)   -a        | = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Wait, that would be a^2 minus [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h^2)/( (4π)^2 ) ) ]

Let's compute that term inside the brackets. (-i)(i) is equal to -i^2, and since i^2 is -1, so that's -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (1) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) = h²/(16 π²).

So the equation becomes a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0. So a² = h²/(16 π²), which means a = ± h/(4π). Wait, but wait, because the determinant equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0 → a = ± h/(4π) * sqrt(1) → a = h/(4π) or -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4
