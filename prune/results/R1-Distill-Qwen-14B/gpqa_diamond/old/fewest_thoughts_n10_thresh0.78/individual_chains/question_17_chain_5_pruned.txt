Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again first.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I know about EDTA and complex formation. EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions, forming a complex. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable.

In this case, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Since it's a 1:1 complex (I think Ca typically forms a 1:1 complex with EDTA), the stoichiometry is 1 Ca²+ to 1 EDTA^4-.

Wait, but what exactly do they mean by "concentration of calcium ions"? Since the complex is formed, the free calcium ions in solution should be very low because almost all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be the answer. That makes sense because the K is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much.

So the formula I think I need is the one that relates the formation constant to the concentrations. The formation constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, I also remember that EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on pH. But the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I probably don't have to worry about that. I can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4- is known or can be calculated. Hmm, but wait, when the pH is ideal, the fraction of EDTA in the Y^4- form (the deprotonated form) is 1. So [EDTA^4-] is equal to the total EDTA concentration.

Wait, but in the complex solution, the total EDTA comes from two sources: the free EDTA and the EDTA bound to Ca²+. So the total concentration of EDTA is [ED
