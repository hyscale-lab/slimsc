Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors, right? So the state vector is |ψ> = [3i, 4]^T. I need to find the expectation value of S_y, which is the spin operator along y.

I remember that the spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices! The spin operator S_y is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y. And the Pauli matrix σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as <ψ| S |ψ>, where S is the operator in question. So for S_y, this would be <ψ| S_y |ψ>.

Let me write down the components. The state vector ψ is [3i, 4], so ψ† (the conjugate transpose) would be [ -3, 4i ].

Wait, no. Wait, ψ is a column vector. So ψ† should be the row vector with the complex conjugate of each element. So the first component is 3i, whose conjugate is -3i? Wait, no. Wait, 3i is the first component. The conjugate is -3i? Wait, no: (3i)* is -3i? No, wait, the complex conjugate of a + bi is a - bi. So 3i is 0 + 3i, so its conjugate is 0 -3i, which is -3i. So ψ† is [ -3i , 4 ]? Wait, wait, ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So ψ† should be [3i*, 4*], which is [-3i, 4], because 4 is real, so its conjugate is 4.

Wait, no, wait. 3i is a complex number. Its complex conjugate is -3i. So ψ† is the row vector [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. So let's compute ψ† S
