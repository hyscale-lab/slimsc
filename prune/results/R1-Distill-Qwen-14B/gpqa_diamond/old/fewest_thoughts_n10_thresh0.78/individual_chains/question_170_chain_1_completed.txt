Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think when they say spin state, they mean a two-component spinor. So the state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T. Right, because electrons have spin-1/2, so the state is a two-component vector.

The operator for spin along the y-direction, S_y, is given. Oh wait, the matrix σ_y is provided, and the note says that σ_y is that matrix. So σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y. But wait, S_y is the spin operator, which for spin-1/2 particles is (ħ/2)σ_y. Oh right, because the spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So I need to remember that factor of ħ/2.

The expectation value of S_y is given by the formula <S_y> = ⟨χ | S_y | χ⟩. So I need to compute this expectation value.

Let me break this down. First, I'll write out S_y. S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. The σ_y matrix is:
[0, -i;
i, 0]

So S_y would be (ħ/2) times that matrix. So S_y is:
[0, -iħ/2;
iħ/2, 0]

Wait, but to compute the expectation value, I can calculate χ† S_y χ, where † denotes the conjugate transpose. Alternatively, since S_y is proportional to σ_y, I can just compute the expectation of σ_y and then multiply by ħ/2.

So first, compute ⟨σ_y⟩ = χ† σ_y χ. Then multiply by ħ/2 to get ⟨S_y⟩.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

The state vector χ is [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate transpose, χ†, would be [ -3, 4* ]? Wait, no. Wait, the original vector is [3i, 4], so when you take the conjugate, each component becomes its complex conjugate. So the first component is 3i, which becomes -3i. The second component is 4, which is real, so it stays 4. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector.

Wait, no, wait a second. The original vector is [3i, 4]^T. So χ† is [ (3i)* , (4)* ] which is [ -3i, 4 ] because (3i)* is -3i.

Wait, no, wait. The complex conjugate of 3i is -3i? No, wait, 3i is a purely imaginary number. So (3i)* is -3i. Because 3i is 3 multiplied by i, and the complex conjugate of i is -i. So yeah, (3i)* = 3*(-i) = -3i.

So χ† is [ -3i   4 ].

Now, let's compute χ† σ_y χ.

Sigma y matrix is:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

So, let's compute χ† σ_y χ.

Breaking it down, χ† is [ a, b ] where a = -3i, b=4. So:

χ† σ_y χ = [ a, b ] * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] * [3i,4]^T.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute step by step.

Alternatively, let's compute χ† multiplied by σ_y, then multiply by χ.

Alternatively, maybe compute the matrix product step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write it as a sum.

The expectation value of σ_y is χ† σ_y χ.

So let's compute each part.

Let me write out σ_y multiplied by χ.

σ_y χ:
= [0*(-3i) + (-i)*4, ? ] no, wait. Wait, more accurately:

Wait, wait. No, σ_y is a 2x2 matrix, and χ is a 2x1 column vector. So σ_y χ would be:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-i)(4) = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y χ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Then, χ† multiplied by σ_y χ is [ -3i, 4 ] times [ -4i, -3 ].

So the product is (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So total is -12 -12 = -24.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me recheck.

Wait, σ_y χ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T. Then χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the product is (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Wait, (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So χ† σ_y χ is -24.

Wait, but that's the expectation value of σ_y. So the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) times that, right? Because S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but wait, none of the options have -12 ħ. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) -12*hbar/25

B) 12*hbar/25

C) 25*hbar/2

D) -25*hbar/2

Hmm, that's confusing because my calculation gives -12 ħ, which isn't among the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me go back through the calculations carefully.

Wait, perhaps the initial state vector is not normalized. Because the state is given as (3i,4), and the sum of squares of the absolute values is |3i|² + |4|² = 9 + 16 =25. So the norm is 5. So the state is not normalized. Oh wait! That's an important point. So the state vector is not normalized. The expectation value formula uses the unnormalized state, but in that case, the expectation value would be (χ† S_y χ) divided by (χ† χ).

Wait, no. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state should be normalized. So perhaps when the problem gives (3i,4), it's assumed to be the state vector, but perhaps the expectation value is computed as (χ† S_y χ)/(χ† χ), because the state might not be normalized.

So let me recalculate.

First, compute the norm squared of χ: |3i|² + |4|² = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is 5. So the normalization factor is 1/5.

Wait, but wait. The expectation value formula is ⟨A⟩ = (χ† A χ) / (χ† χ) when the state is not normalized. Because ⟨A⟩ is (ψ† A ψ)/(ψ† ψ).

So in this problem, since the state is not normalized, I need to calculate (χ† S_y χ) divided by (χ† χ).

So let's recompute.

First, calculate χ† S_y χ:

As before, χ† S_y χ is (-3i, 4) multiplied by (S_y) matrix, then multiplied by χ.

Wait, but S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, so perhaps it's easier to compute χ† σ_y χ first, then multiply by ħ/2.

So, χ† σ_y χ we computed as -24.

So χ† S_y χ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Now, the denominator is χ† χ = |3i|² + |4|² =9 +16=25.

Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (-12 ħ) / 25.

Which is -12 ħ /25.

Looking back at the options, option A is -12 ħ /25.

So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought I made a mistake because I didn't normalize, and that's why my initial answer didn't match the options. So yes, this makes sense now.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator along the y-direction is given by \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Thus, \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \).

2. **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\chi^\dagger S_y \chi}{\chi^\dagger \chi}.
   \]
   Here, \( \chi^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \chi \), and \( \chi^\dagger \chi \) ensures normalization.

3. **Conjugate Transpose of \( \chi \)**: The conjugate transpose of \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \) is:
   \[
   \chi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi \)**:
   - First, compute \( \sigma_y \chi \):
     \[
     \sigma_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]
   - Then, compute \( \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi \):
     \[
     \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]
     Breaking this into components:
     \[
     (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12(-1) + (-12) = -12 - 12 = -24.
     \]

5. **Normalization Factor**: Compute \( \chi^\dagger \chi \):
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \chi = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]

6. **Expectation Value of \( S_y \)**:
   - The expectation value of \( \sigma_y \) is:
     \[
     \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi}{\chi^\dagger \chi} = \frac{-24}{25}.
     \]
   - Since \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), the expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
     \[
     \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
     \]

7. **Final Answer**: Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
   \[
   \text{A) } \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

Answer: A
