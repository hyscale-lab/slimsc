Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves some mixtures of liquids and their reactions. Let me try to break down the information given.

So, there's a mixture X, which is equimolar of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water. I remember that decolorizing bromine water is a test for unsaturation, like alkenes or alkynes. So the mixture X must contain compounds with double bonds or triple bonds.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y. Mixture Y is also equimolar but consists of two other liquids. Importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So after the reaction, the products don't have any double or triple bonds—they've probably been hydrogenated or something.

Next, both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, and only one substance Z is formed. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. And Z is a constituent of Y, meaning Y must have included Z. Also, Z is widely used as a solvent, which makes me think of something like hexane, but I'm not sure yet.

Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, which suggests it's fully saturated—no more double or triple bonds. So Z is probably an alkane.

The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28% (which is 1/7). So, let's calculate the molecular formula of Z. Let me think: mass fraction H is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So, for a hydrocarbon, the formula is CnH2n+2 (since it's an alkane). The percentage of hydrogen is (2n+2)/(12n + 2) * 100 = 14.28%.

Wait, let me set that up as an equation. Let's let Z be CnH2n+2.

The mass fraction of H is (2n + 2)*1 / (12n + 2*(1)) ) * 100 = 14.28.

Wait, actually, the formula for percentage composition is (mass of H)/(molar mass of Z) * 100. So, for Z, which is CnH2n+2:

Molar mass of Z = 12n + (2n+2)*1 = 14n +2.

Mass of H is (2n+2)*1. So, percentage H is [(2n+2)/(14n +2)] * 100 =14.28.

Let me compute that:

(2n +2)/(14n +2) =0.1428

Multiply both sides by (14n +2):

2n +2 =0.1428*(14n +2)

Let me compute 0.1428 *14n
