Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

So the setup is that particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles produce new types of particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

The question is asking: what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the detector's inner walls?

Hmm. I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma relates to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. But how does that connect to the particles reaching the detector's walls?

Wait, the particles are produced at the center, so they have to travel a certain distance to reach the wall. The detector's radius is 30 meters, so the distance each particle must travel is 30 meters. But since they're moving at a high velocity, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma times their proper lifetime. If the proper lifetime is tau, then the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

The decay length of a particle is the distance it travels before decaying. The decay length L is the particle's velocity v multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame, so L = v * gamma * tau.

But wait, the velocity v is related to the Lorentz factor gamma. At ultra-relativistic speeds, v is approximately the speed of light c. So we can approximate v ≈ c. So the decay length L ≈ c * gamma * tau.

The particles will reach the detector's wall if their decay length is at least equal to the radius of the detector, right? So L >= R, where R is 30 meters.

So, c * gamma * tau >= R.

The fraction of particles reaching the wall depends on how much their decay length exceeds the radius. So if a particle's decay length is longer than R, it will reach the wall before decaying. So the probability of a particle reaching the wall is the probability that its decay length is greater than R.

But wait, in reality, since the particles are produced at the center, maybe the decay length needs to be exactly R for them to reach the wall. So particles with decay lengths longer than R will definitely reach the wall.

But wait, the problem states that at gamma ~20,
