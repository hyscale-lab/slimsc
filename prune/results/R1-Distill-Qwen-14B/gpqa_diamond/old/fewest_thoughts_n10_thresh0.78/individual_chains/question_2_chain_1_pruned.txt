Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Let me start by breaking down each step and see what's happening.

First, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a benzene ring connected to a propenal group. Trans means the double bond has the substituents on opposite sides. So its structure is something like benzaldehyde where the aldehyde is part of a double bond with a CH2 group attached. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is actually benzene with a CH2CH2CHO group, but more accurately, it's benzene attached to CH2CH=CHCHO? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. No, cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a double bond. The structure is actually CH2=CH-C6H4-CHO? No, wait. No, wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is the aldehyde of cinnamic acid. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, that's not right. Oh wait, no, cinnamic acid is Ph-CH2-CH2-COOH. But aldehyde would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but I think that's incorrect. Wait, no, wait, cinnamaldehyde is more accurately Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? Or is it Ph-CH=CH-CHO? Hmm, no, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a double bond. So the structure is benzene ring connected to a propenal group. So the aldehyde is at the end of a double bond. So it's benzaldehyde where the CH2 is replaced by CH=CH2. Wait, no, let me get this right. The structure of cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. So it's Ph-CH2-CHO? No, no, wait. Or is it Ph-CH=CH-CHO? No, that can't be right because that would have three substituents on the same carbon. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that's not correct because that would be a saturated chain. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH=CH-CHO, but that would imply the structure is Ph-CH2-CH=CHO, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. No, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should just think that trans-cinnamaldehyde has a benzene ring attached to a CH2 group, which is double bonded to another CH, and then the aldehyde group. So, structure like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO is incorrect. Let's get this right.

Wait, wait, perhaps cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH=CH-CHO. So the double bond is between the two CH groups, and the aldehyde is on the end. So the structure is benzaldehyde with a vinyl group, making the structure Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, I think that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that's not right either.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but maybe it's better to move forward and see how the reaction steps proceed, as the exact structure might not be needed for the number of carbons.

So the first step is treating trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide. That's a Grignard reagent, which typically adds to carbonyl groups. So, aldehyde group would react. So, the Grignard would add a methyl group to the carbonyl carbon.

So, trans-cinnamaldehyde has a structure where there's an aldehyde group (CHO) attached to a benzene ring. So when methyl MgBr is added, the Grignard would add a methyl group to the aldehyde, forming a secondary alcohol. Wait, but wait, the starting material is
