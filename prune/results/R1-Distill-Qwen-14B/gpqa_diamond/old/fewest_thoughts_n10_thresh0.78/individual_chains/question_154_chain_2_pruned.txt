Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on its spectral data. The chemist has given us information from mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, and 1H NMR. Our job is to match this data to one of the four options provided.

First, let's break down each piece of data.

The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%) and another peak at m/z 158 (32%). I know that the molecular ion peak gives the molecular weight. So the molecular formula must have a molecular weight of 156. The other peak at 158 is 32%, which is about a third of the base peak. I'm thinking maybe this could be a fragment with an added something, like maybe a chlorine isotope? But wait, chlorine has isotopes; the common ones are around 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%). So if the molecule has a chlorine atom, the molecular ion would split into peaks. Let me think: the molecular ion is at 156, and the other is at 158. The abundance is 32%, which is roughly 33% of 100%â€”so maybe it's the M+2 peak, which suggests a chlorine is present because Cl has two main isotopes. So the molecular formula probably includes a Cl atom.

Now, the IR data: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. The broadness is because of hydrogen bonding, which O-H (like in carboxylic acids or phenols) typically shows. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. 1720 is a bit on the lower side for carbonyl. For carboxylic acids, it's usually around 1700-1725, right? Esters or amides can be similar. So a carbonyl group is present.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there's a singlet at 11.0 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (like around 9-10 ppm), but wait, 11 is even higher. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids usually have protons around 10-12 ppm, often as singlets because they exchange rapidly and can appear as broad or sharp singlets. Another set of peaks: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). The doublets suggest two sets of protons, each integrating for two. This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, if there are two substituents on the benzene ring which are para to each other, the protons would be in two pairs, each as doublets. So maybe something like a para-substituted benzaldehyde or a para-substituted benzoic acid.

Let me think about the options given.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzaldehyde with Cl on carbon 3 and OH on 2. Wait, but that's adjacent positions, which would be meta? No, wait numbering. Benzaldehyde is position 1 as the aldehyde. So 3-Chloro-2-hydroxy would be on positions 2 and 3. That's adjacent, so the substituents would be meta to each other? Or is it ortho? Hmm, wait, if the aldehyde is position 1, then position 2 is adjacent (ortho), and position 3 is meta. So in that case, the substituents would be on positions 2 and 3, making them adjacent. The NMR would show more complex splitting if they are adjacent, but in this case
