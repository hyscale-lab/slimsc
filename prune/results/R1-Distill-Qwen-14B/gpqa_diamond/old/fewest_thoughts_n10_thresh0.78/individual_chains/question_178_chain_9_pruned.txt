Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm. Let me try to recall what I know.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, σ matrices are antisymmetric, I think.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should look at the dimensions of all the other terms in the Lagrangian and then solve for κ's dimension. Because the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (since the action is dimensionless, and the integral over spacetime gives four dimensions, so the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4).

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because it's integrated over four spacetime dimensions, making the action (which is dimensionless) have units of [Lagrangian]^4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So each term in L_int must have [L_int] = 4.

Let me break down the terms in L_int:

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ multiplied by F^{μν}.

So write each part's dimension.

First, ψ is a spinor field, so its mass dimension is [ψ] = 3/2. Because for Dirac fields, the mass dimension is (d-1)/2 where d is spacetime dimensions, but assuming we're in 4D, so 3/2 each. So ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, also 3/2.

σ_{μν} is a matrix, but since it's part of the term with ψ and ψ̄, which are spinor indices, the structure σ_{μν} is a Lorentz tensor of rank 2. But in terms of mass dimension, it's dimensionless because it's a product of gamma matrices (which are dimensionless) and the structure is just a number. So [σ_{μν}] = 0. So when I multiply ψ̄, σ, and ψ, that part is (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) = 3.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For a gauge field like electromagnetism, F is a tensor with dimension 2. Because the field A has dimension 1 (since it's a gauge field, which is like a 1-form, and in 4D, each derivative gives dimension 1, but wait, wait. Let me think again. The field strength tensor F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each ∂ is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1 (since the covariant derivative includes A, and the derivative has dimension 1, so A must have dimension 1 to balance when it's in the covariant derivative: ∂ has [∂] = 1, and [D] = 1, so [A] must be 1).

So F has dimension [∂][A] = 1 +1 = 2.

Now putting it all together: the term is κ * ψ̄ σ ψ * F. So each ψ is 3/2, σ is 0, F is 2.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions:

(3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 3 + 2 =
