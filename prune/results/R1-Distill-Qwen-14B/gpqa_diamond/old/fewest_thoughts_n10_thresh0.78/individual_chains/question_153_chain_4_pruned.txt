Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Let me start by recalling what the Michael reaction is. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. The product is usually a conjugate addition product, and it can form an enolate intermediate.

The question has three different reactions, labeled (A), (B), and (C), and I need to find out the major products for each. Then, match them with the options provided.

Let's break down each reaction one by one.

**Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ (A)**

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of another alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, which in this case is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

So, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be: 
- The acrylate part is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but the substituent is at the 3 position, so the structure is CH2-C(=O)-OCH3, but wait no, actually, wait. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a p-tolyl group in the middle? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. But wait, that might not be right. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would imply the substituent is on the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, the numbering is a bit confusing. Acrylate is propenoate: CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, but wait, that doesn't make sense because propenoate is only three carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. The acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. The 3-position would be the CH2's first carbon, but that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe it's the middle carbon. So the substituent is on the central carbon of the acrylate group. So the structure would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but that would make it a double bond between the first and second carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. No, wait, that would be 2-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Hmm, maybe I
