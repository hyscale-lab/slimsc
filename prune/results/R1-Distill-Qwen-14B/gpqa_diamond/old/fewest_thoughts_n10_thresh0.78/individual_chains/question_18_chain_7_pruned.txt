Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, so the question gives me data about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I don't think the masses matter directly for this problem. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. And the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7. So I need to find [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], or wait, the ratio of silicon in each star's photosphere.

Wait, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2]? Or maybe [Si/H] for each and then take the ratio? Hmm, wait, no. Because [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. But in this case, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as Sun. Similarly for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so nMg/nH is same as Sun.

Wait, but the question is about silicon. So I need to find the [Si/H] for each star, then find the ratio of those two.

Let me think. For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. And [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means [Fe/H] =0. So [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as Sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe/nH is the same as Sun. So nFe = nH * (Fe/H)_sun. Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5? Let me see: 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 =-4.5. So nFe/nH
