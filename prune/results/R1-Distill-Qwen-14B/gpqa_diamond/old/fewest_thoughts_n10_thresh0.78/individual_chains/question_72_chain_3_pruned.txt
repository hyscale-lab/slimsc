Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. I remember that these kinds of problems involve a series of reactions leading to a final product, and then determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Hmm.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I think that's a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound, right? The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group. So it's attached at position 7 of the norbornene system.

Then, this compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. I'm trying to remember what kind of reaction this is. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and when it's used with dibromo compounds, it often leads to elimination or substitution reactions. Wait, but when you have two equivalents, maybe it's a di-addition.

Wait, the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups attached to the cyclohexadiene. Each dibromomethyl is like -CH2Br2. So each of those groups might undergo substitution. Sodium iodide (NaI) is a source of iodide ions, which are good nucleophiles. But wait, if it's a substitution, like SN2, each CH2Br2 would react. But wait, CH2Br2 is not prone to SN2 because it's a primary center but with two leaving groups. Alternatively, maybe it's more about elimination? Or maybe it's a ring-opening metathesis? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, norbornene derivatives can act as dienophiles. Oh, wait, the starting material is a diene. The norbornene system has a conjugated diene. So perhaps when it reacts with another diene, it's a Diels-Alder reaction. But 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene—it's a diene (1,3-diene), so maybe each of the dibromomethyl groups is a substituent on the diene.

Wait, but the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So that's a bicyclic compound with two double bonds. Oh wait no, the bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene has two double bonds? Or is that a single conjugated diene? Let me think: bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two rings, and the numbering is such that positions 2,5 are double bonds. So the structure has two double bonds? Or a conjugated diene system.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a [2+4] Diels-Alder with itself? That doesn't make sense. Or perhaps with the other diene.

Wait, the other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the 5 and 6 positions on the cyclohexadiene has a CH2Br2 group. So that's two substituents on the cyclohexadiene.

So when you have a dienophile reacting with a diene, and perhaps this is a Diels-Alder reaction. So the norbornene compound acts as the dienophile, and the cyclohexadiene as the diene. But wait, the cyclohexadiene has two dienophilic groups? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but the reaction is with two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene. So perhaps it's a diels-alder forming a bicyclic structure, adding two rings or something. Alternatively, maybe each of the dibromomethyl groups is undergoing some kind of substitution.

Wait, the presence of NaI and elevated temperature. I'm thinking elimination. Maybe each CH2Br2 group loses HBr twice, becoming CH2, but that's just a thought. Or maybe we're doing a ring-opening. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are undergoing substitution.

Wait, another possibility is that the norbornene is undergoing a ring-opening reaction with the dienophile. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible mechanisms.

Another approach: maybe the first reaction is forming a bridge. Since the starting norbornene has a bridge, maybe the cyclohexadiene is adding across it, leading to a larger ring.

Alternatively, maybe each cyclohexadiene is undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction with the norbornene. But with two equivalents, perhaps each bridge gets a substituent.

Wait, let's think about the first step. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. It's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI. The product is 1.

Wait, the NaI would likely deprotonate something or act as a nucleophile. The dibromomethyl groups have two bromides on a CH2. So perhaps each of these is undergoing elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, when CH2Br2 is treated with a base, it can eliminate to form a double bond. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2Br, but wait, no. Wait, no, if you have two Br groups on a CH2, and perhaps elimination, perhaps it would form a double bond. So CH2Br2 → CH2Br plus HBr? Or perhaps it's more about the neighboring group. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by iodide, but that would require a substitution.

Wait, the reaction is with NaI, which is an ionic compound. Maybe Na+ is a counterion, and I- is the nucleophile. So perhaps each of the CH2Br2 groups is undergoing substitution. But substitution of two bromides on the same carbon with iodide? That's possible but maybe not common as SN2 for each. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single substitution, but with two equivalents, maybe two substitutions happen.

Wait, but if each CH2Br2 group reacts with I-, perhaps replacing one Br with I. So each becomes CH2BrI. Hmm, but that's a less likely scenario. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2Br2 is converted to CH2I2, but that seems unlikely. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. Since norbornene can react with dienes in Diels-Alder reactions. Wait, but the norbornene is a bicyclic diene. So maybe each of the cyclohexadiene molecules is adding to the norbornene.

Wait, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction where the norbornene is the dienophile. Because norbornene is a good dienophile. So in the Diels-Alder, the diene (cyclohexadiene) would react with the dienophile (norbornene) to form a six-membered ring. But considering that the norbornene is the bicyclo structure, adding a diene to it would form a larger ring.

Wait, the starting norbornene has a bridge. So when it reacts
