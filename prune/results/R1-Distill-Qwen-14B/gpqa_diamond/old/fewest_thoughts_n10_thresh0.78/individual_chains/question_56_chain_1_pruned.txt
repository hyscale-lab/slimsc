Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and probabilities.

Wait, first, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by the selection rules. Dipole transitions specifically have certain selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m.

Right, the selection rules for dipole transitions are usually: Δl = ±1 (the orbital angular momentum changes by one unit), and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, the principal quantum number n can change by any integer, but in practice, transitions are usually between adjacent energy levels because that's where the probability is highest, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, but in this case, the initial state is n=3, and the final is n=1, so two steps: 3→2→1, or maybe 3→1 directly? Wait, no, the question says it's via two dipole transitions, so it can't be a single transition from 3→1 because that would be a change of Δn= -2, which isn't allowed for dipole transitions. Dipole transitions require Δn = ±1, right? Because higher-order terms are much weaker. So the decay must happen in two steps: 3→2 and then 2→1.

So the first transition from 3,0,0 to something. What's allowed? The initial state has l=0, so after the dipole transition, l must change by ±1. So the next state has to have l=1. So the first step must go to a state with l=1. So the possible states are |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Then, from |2,1,m⟩, the next transition must go to a state with l=0 because the final state is |1,0,0⟩. So for the second transition, l changes from 1 to 0, which is Δl = -1. So that's allowed (Δl = ±1). Also, n changes from 2 to 1, which is Δn = -1, allowed.

So the first step is from (3,0,0) to a state with n=2, l=1, and m could be -1, 0, +1. Then from that state, the next step is to (1,0,0), which imposes that the m must go from whatever it was to 0. So for the second transition, the m can change by 0 or ±1. So if the first state was |2,1, m1⟩, the second state must have m2 = m1 ±1 or m1. But the final state has m=0, so m1 must be either 0, +1, or -1, but in the second transition, m can only change by 0, ±1.

Wait, let's think about the possible transitions. From m1, can you get to m2=0?

If the first transition goes to m=1, then in the second transition, m can go to 0 (since Δm = -1) or 2 (which is not allowed because the final state m=0, but wait, the final state is |1,0,0⟩, so m=0. So the second transition must change m from 1 to 0, or from -1 to 0, or from 0 to 0.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, so m=0. In the first step, m can change
