Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, I need to figure out the sequence of reactions that would lead to this compound starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a different sequence of reactions.

First, I should probably sketch the structure of the target molecule to visualize where each substituent is. So, benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, 3 would be adjacent to each other. Let me imagine the structure.

In aromatic substitution reactions, the directing effects of substituents matter a lot. The substituents can be meta or para directors, and activating or deactivating. Also, the order in which substituents are introduced can influence where new groups attach.

Let's think about the substituents:

1. tert-butyl group: This is a bulky, alkyl group. Alkyl groups are activating (since they're electron-donating via +I effect) and are ortho/para directors. But since tert-butyl is bulky, it's more likely to direct incoming groups to the para position, but when possible, ortho as well, but steric hindrance can make para the major product.

2. Ethoxy group: This is an ether group; oxygen is more electronegative, but the lone pairs on oxygen can donate electrons through resonance. So the ethoxy group is activating and an ortho/para director.

3. Nitro group: Nitro is a strong deactivating group (due to the -I effect) and meta-directing. So it deactivates the ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position relative to itself.

So the target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl at 2, ethoxy at 1, nitro at 3. Wait, if I number the benzene such that the ethoxy is in position 1, then the tert-butyl is in position 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro is in position 3 (meta to ethoxy? Or relative to the tert-butyl?)

Wait, maybe I should number the substituents in the order they're added. Because the order of adding substituents will determine the positions of subsequent groups based on the directing effects of the existing substituents.

So, starting with benzene. Let's think about how each substituent is added.

The target has nitro at position 3. Let me think about how to get that. If the nitro group is added after some other substituent, the position it ends up depends on the directing effect of the existing groups.

But wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering each option and see which one makes sense.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: Steps
