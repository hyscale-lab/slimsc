Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question says that an electron is moving at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I remember it's something like Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Oh wait, sometimes people just use ΔxΔp ≈ ħ. So maybe I should use that approximation here.

So, first, I need to find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Since Δx is given, I can rearrange the uncertainty principle formula to solve for Δp. So Δp ≈ ħ / (2Δx), but sometimes people drop the 2 for an approximate calculation, so maybe just ħ/Δx.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? Which is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Oh wait, but sometimes the approximate value is taken as 1e-34 for quick calculations.

So the given Δx is 0.1 nm. Wait, nanometers are 1e-9 meters. So 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters.

So plugging into Δp = ħ / Δx. So ħ is roughly 1e-34 J·s, divided by 1e-10 m. That gives 1e-24 kg·m/s. Wait, because J·s divided by m is (kg·m²/s²)·s ) / m → kg·m/s. Yeah, that makes sense.

So Δp ≈ 1e-34 / 1e-10 = 1e-24 kg·m/s. Wait, wait, is that right? Wait, 1e-34 divided by 1e-10 is 1e-24? Let me check exponents: 10^-34 divided by 10^-10 is 10^(-34 +10) = 10^-24. Yes, correct.

Now, once I have Δp, I need to find the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Hmm, how does that work? I think I need to relate the momentum uncertainty to energy. For a free particle, the energy is kinetic, so E = p²/(2m). But since we're dealing with uncertainties, maybe the uncertainty in energy comes from the uncertainty in momentum.

Wait, the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to the change in kinetic energy due to the uncertainty in momentum. So, ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

The mass of the electron is approximately 9.109e-31 kg. So plugging in the numbers: (1e-24)^2 / (2 * 9.1e-31). Let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1e-24)^2 = 1e-48 (kg²·m²/s²).

Denominator: 2 * 9.1e-31 ≈ 1.82e-30 kg.

So 1e-48 / 1.82e-30 = approximately (1/1.82) * 10^(-48 +30) = 0.55 * 1e-18 → about 5.5e-19 J.

Wait, wait, let me redo that division. 1e-48 divided by 1.82e-30 is 1/(1.82) * 1e-18. Because 1e-48 / 1e-30 is 1e-18. So 1/1.82 is approx 0.55. So 0.55e-18, which is 5.5e-19 J. So ΔE is about 1e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: could there be a relativistic effect here? The speed v is given as 2e8 m/s, which is 20% the speed of light (since c is about 3e8 m/s). So v is 0.2c. Hmm, does that require using relativistic equations? Because the non-relativistic formula for kinetic energy is only valid when v is much less than c.

Let me think. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by (gamma - 1) mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But if the speed is 0.2c, then v²/c² is 0.04, so 1 - 0.04 = 0.96, sqrt(0.96) is about 0.98, so gamma is about 1.02. So the kinetic energy is (1.02 - 1) * mc² = 0.02 mc².

Wait, but that's the actual kinetic energy. The uncertainty in energy would be a small fraction of that. But wait, in our case, we're calculating ΔE based on Δp. Does the non-relativistic approach hold?

Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic approach is acceptable here because even though v is a significant fraction of c, the error might still be manageable, especially considering that the momentum uncertainty is small.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the non-relativistic approach regardless of the speed given. Maybe the question is designed for the non-relativistic case.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but let me recheck the calculation.

So, going back: Δp = ħ / Δx = (1e-34) / (1e-10) = 1e-24 kg·m/s.

Kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m). So ( (1e-24)^2 ) / (2 * 9.1e-31) → (1e-48)/(1.82e-30) = 5.5e-19 J. So 5.5e-19 is about 1e-19, so option C.

But wait, another point: the uncertainty in energy is related not just to the kinetic energy, but perhaps considering potential energy as well. But in the case of a free particle, potential energy is zero, so the entire energy is kinetic.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relation between energy and momentum more directly. For a free particle, E = p²/(2m). So the uncertainty in E comes from the uncertainty in p. So yes, the approach is correct.

So the minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1e-19 J, which is option C.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta x \) is the uncertainty in position, \( \Delta p \) is the uncertainty in momentum, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). For an approximate calculation, we can use:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta x}.
\]

The uncertainty in position is given as \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{1 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, we relate the uncertainty in momentum to the uncertainty in energy. For a free particle, the kinetic energy is given by:

\[
E = \frac{p^2}{2m},
\]

where \( m \) is the mass of the electron (\( m \approx 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)). The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) can be approximated as:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}.
\]

Substituting \( \Delta p = 1 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) and \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(1 \times 10^{-24})^2}{2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31}} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-48}}{1.8218 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 5.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

This value is approximately \( 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option C. The relativistic effects are negligible here because the speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is only 20% of the speed of light (\( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)), and the non-relativistic approximation is valid for this calculation.

Answer: C
