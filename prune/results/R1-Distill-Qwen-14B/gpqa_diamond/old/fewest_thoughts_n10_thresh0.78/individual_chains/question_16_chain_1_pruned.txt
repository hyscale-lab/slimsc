Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it's not superimposable on its mirror image. But wait, I remember that some compounds might have elements of symmetry that prevent them from being chiral even if they have stereogenic centers. So I need to check each compound one by one.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. At C1, there's a Cl and a CH2CH(CH3) group. Wait, wait, maybe I should think about the substituents. The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3, but wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, actually, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH2? No, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-C(=CH2-CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, not sure. Maybe it's better to think about the geometry. The (Z) configuration means higher priority groups are on the same side. But does the molecule have any stereogenic centers? Wait, does it have a chiral center? The chlorine is on C1, which is double-bonded to C2. So C1 has Cl, C2 has CH(CH3), maybe? Wait, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1
