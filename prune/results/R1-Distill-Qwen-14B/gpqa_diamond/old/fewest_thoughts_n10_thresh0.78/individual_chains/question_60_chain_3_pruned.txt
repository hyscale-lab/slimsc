Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, time dilation... I remember that from my physics classes. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about an astronaut from an alien civilization traveling to Earth at a high speed, specifically 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their spacecraft is super fast, so I guess time dilation effects must come into play here.

Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. We need to find out how long it will take from their perspective to reach Earth. Oh wait, no, the question says "from the point of view of the astronaut." So we're looking at the proper time experienced by the astronaut, right?

Wait, but first, I should figure out how far away Earth is from the Large Magellanic Cloud. Oh, right, the Large Magellanic Cloud is one of the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. I think its distance is about 160,000 light-years away. But wait, I'm not 100% sure. I remember the Milky Way is about 100,000 light-years in diameter, and the LMC is a bit further. So maybe 160,000 light-years. Or perhaps I should double-check that number. Hmm, but I'll proceed with 160,000 light-years as the distance.

So the speed given is 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really close to the speed of light. The speed is v = 0.9
