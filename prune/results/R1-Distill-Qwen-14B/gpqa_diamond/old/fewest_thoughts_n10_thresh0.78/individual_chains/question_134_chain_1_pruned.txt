Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. 

Let me read the problem again. We have three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. All these are being mixed together. Wait, wait a minute. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, right? So each molecule can donate two H+ ions. And Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and since it's Ba, which is a +2 ion, I think each Ba(OH)2 can provide two OH- ions. 

First, I think I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- from each solution. Because the reaction between acids and bases is about the H+ and OH- combining to form water. The overall reaction will depend on how much H+ and OH- are available.

Let me break it down:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl:
HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. So moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). 
HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

2. Calculate moles of H+ from H2SO4:
H2SO4 is a strong acid, it dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-. So each mole gives two H+. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So H+ is 0.09 *2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

3. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2:
Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-. Each mole gives two OH-. 
Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So the H+ from acids is 0.28 moles, and OH- is 0.2 moles. Now, when these mix, they'll neutralize each other. The reaction will be H+ + OH- → H2O. 

But wait, which is in excess here? Let's see: 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So OH- is the limiting reagent. Because 0.2 moles of OH- can react with 0.2 moles of H+. So after reaction, we'll have 0.08 moles of H+ left (0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08). But wait, does that matter for the neutralization enthalpy? Because the enthalpy is calculated based on the amount that actually neutralizes.

Wait, but the neutralization enthalpy is usually considered per mole of H+ and OH- reacting. For strong acids and bases, the enthalpy change per mole is approximately the same, around -57 kJ/mol or something like that. But wait, let me think—what's the value? I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases
