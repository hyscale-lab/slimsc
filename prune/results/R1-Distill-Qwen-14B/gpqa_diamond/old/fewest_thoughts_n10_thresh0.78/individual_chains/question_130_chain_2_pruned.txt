Okay, so I have this question about redshift and detecting objects using neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, let's think. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I remember that neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs light at a specific wavelength called the Lyman alpha line. Oh right, the Lyman alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But ground-based telescopes can't see that because the atmosphere absorbs UV light. So how does this work?

Oh, right! When a quasar's light passes through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs some of that light at the Lyman alpha wavelength. But because the cloud is moving away from us (due to the expansion of the universe), there's a redshift involved. So the absorbed wavelength shifts into a longer wavelength, maybe into the optical range which telescopes can detect.

Wait, the quasar itself emits light across the spectrum, but the absorption happens at a specific redshifted wavelength. So if the cloud is at a high redshift, the Lyman alpha line from the cloud would shift into the optical range. But what's the minimum redshift needed for that?

I think the key is that the Lyman alpha line must be shifted into the observed wavelength range of optical telescopes. Let's see, the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers (since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms = 121.6 nm, which is 0.1216 micrometers). But optical telescopes typically observe from about 0.4 micrometers (visible light) up to maybe 1 or 2 micrometers.

So the observed wavelength λ_obs must be >= 0.4 micrometers, right? Because anything below that (like UV) can't be detected from the ground.

The formula for redshift is z = (λ_obs - λ_rest) / λ_rest. We need to find the minimum z such that λ_obs is at least 0.4 micrometers.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that formula. Yes, z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1. So λ_obs = λ_rest*(1 + z).

We want λ_obs >= 0.4 micrometers. The rest wavelength is
