Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spins and the partition function. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we have three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. And we need to find the partition function Z. The options are given as A to D. 

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Because β is 1/(kT). So for each possible state, which is a combination of S1, S2, S3, I need to compute the energy E and then sum the exponentials.

But wait, each spin can be +1 or -1. So each of S1, S2, S3 has two possibilities. That makes 2^3 =8 possible states in total. But maybe some states have the same energy, so I can group them to simplify the calculation.

Let me list all possible states and compute E for each. Hmm, but that might take time. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the possible values of the term inside E, which is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. 

Each term like S1S2 can be either +1 or -1 because S1 and S2 are each ±1. So when multiplied, if they are the same (both +1 or both -1), product is +1. If different, product is -1.

Wait, no. Let me think: S1 and S2 can be same or different. If same, S1S2=1, else -1.

So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can range from -3 to +3, but not all numbers in between may be possible. Let's see.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to categorize the states based on how many pairs are aligned (same spin) or anti-aligned (opposite).

Each possible state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3). Let me list all 8 possibilities and compute the sum.

1. (+1, +1, +1): S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum=3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. (+1, +1, -1): S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum=1-1= -1? Wait, 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E= -J*(-1) = J.

3. (+1, -1, +1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum= -1 +1 + (-1) = -1. E= J.

4. (+1, -1, -1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1. E= J.

5. (-1, +1, +1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1. E= J.

6. (-1, +1, -1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1. E= J.

7. (-1, -1, +1): S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. E= J.

8. (-1, -1, -1): S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum=3. E= -3J.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check some of these. For example, state 2: +1, +1, -1.

S1S2 is (+1)(+1)=1. S1S3 is (+1)(-1)=-1. S2S3 is (+1)(-1)=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Yep, that's correct.

Another example, state 5: (-1, +1, +1). S1S2 is (-1)(+1)=-1. S1S3 is (-1)(+1)=-1. S2S3 is (+1)(+1)=1. Sum is (-1) + (-1) +1= -1.

Wait,
