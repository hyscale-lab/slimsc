Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate a single pole. But what does that mean for Maxwell's equations?

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me list them out to think through each. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

In our universe, the second equation, Gauss's Law for magnetism, says that the divergence of B is zero. That's because magnetic monopoles (isolated N or S poles) don't exist. But the question is about a universe where they do exist. So what changes?

If magnetic monopoles exist, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Because you can have a point where, say, the magnetic charge is concentrated. So the equation ∇·B would equal something like μ (magnetic charge density) divided by some constant, similar to how Gauss's law for E has the electric charge density.

So in the altered universe, the second equation would change. That equation would no longer be ∇·B=0.

But wait, what about the other equations? The first equation is about electric charge, so that's the same. The third equation, Faraday's Law, deals with the curl of E and the time derivative of B. I don't think that would change because the existence of magnetic monopoles affects the divergence, not the curl. Unless... Wait, I think in the presence of magnetic monopoles, there might be another term added elsewhere.

Wait, in our universe, the curl of E is related to the negative time derivative of B. If magnetic monopoles exist, does that change Faraday's Law? Or does it change Ampère's Law?

Wait, Ampère's Law (the fourth equation) includes the current density and the time derivative of E. I don't think monopoles affect that directly. But wait, if you have a magnetic current, then there might be a term added to Faraday's Law.

Wait, in the case of magnetic monopoles, I remember that the Maxwell equations become symmetric. So, Gauss's Law for magnetism becomes ∇·B = ρ_m / μ₀, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. And then, Ampère's Law would get a term involving the time derivative of B, just like Faraday's Law has the term involving the time derivative of E.

Wait, no, actually, Faraday's Law remains the same. Let me think: if there are magnetic charges, then the equations are modified in a way that the equations for E and B become more similar. So, the original equations have:

∇·E = ρ/ε₀
