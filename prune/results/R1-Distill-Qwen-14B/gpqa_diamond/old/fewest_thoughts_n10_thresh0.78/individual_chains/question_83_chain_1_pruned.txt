Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction. The reaction should produce acetate ions and water.

First, I think I need to determine the concentrations after dilution and before titration. Let me calculate the initial concentration after dilution.

The initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid can be found by Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

After dilution to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the problem asks about the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, let's tackle the two parts: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Starting with 25% titration (2.5 cm³ of NaOH). Let's find the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O, the moles of CH3COOH will decrease by 0.00025, and moles of CH3COO^- will increase by the
