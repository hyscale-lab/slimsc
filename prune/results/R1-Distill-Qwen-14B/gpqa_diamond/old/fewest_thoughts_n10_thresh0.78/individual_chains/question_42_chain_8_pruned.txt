Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Astronomers are studying three exoplanets using the TTV method. The TTV method, I remember, stands for Transit Timing Variations. It's a technique used to detect exoplanets by observing the changes in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. The variations happen because of gravitational interactions between the planets, affecting each other's orbits. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here—the problem is more about the temperatures and orbital periods.

The given data includes the ratios of equilibrium temperatures between the planets and the mass ratios. The question is about finding the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's. Also, all have the same albedo of 0.3, which is similar to Earth's.

Let me jot down the given information:

- Equilibrium temperature ratio Planet1/Planet2 = 1.4. So T1/T2 =1.4 → T2 = T1 /1.4.
Wait, wait, no. Wait, the ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, so T1 is larger than T2. So T1 =1.4*T2.

Similarly, the ratio of Planet2 to Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 =2.3 → T3 = T2 /2.3.

Wait, but I need to relate the temperatures to the orbital periods. I remember the equilibrium temperature formula. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

Te = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ) ]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star (semi-major axis, since the orbits are circular). 

But since we're comparing planets around the same star, L and σ are constants. Albedo is given as the same (0.3) for all, so (1 - a) is the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature depends only on the distance D.

So Te is inversely proportional to the square root of D. So, Te ∝ 1/√D.

Therefore, the ratio of Te between two planets would be (D2/D1)^(1/2) = Te1/Te2.

Wait, no: Let me think again. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So, Te = (L (1-a)/(16 π σ D²))^(1/4) => Te ∝ 1/√D.

So, the ratio of Te for Planet1 to Planet2 is (D2/D1)^(1/2) = T1/T2.

Because:

Te1 / Te2 = (D2 / D1)^(1/2)

So, D2/D1 = (Te1/Te2)^2.

Wait, let me get this right. Let me write it:

Te1 = (L (1-a)/(16 π σ D1²))^(1/4)
Te2 = (L (1-a)/(16 π σ D2²))^(1/4)

Dividing Te1 by Te2:

Te1/Te2 = [ (1/D1²) / (1/D2²) ) ]^(1/4) = [ (D2²/D1²) ) ]^(1/4) = (D2/D1)^(1/2)

So,

Te1/Te2 = sqrt(D2/D1)

Which gives:

D2/D1 = (Te1/Te2)^2

So, D2 = D1 * (Te1/Te2)^2

Wait, no. Wait, if Te1/Te2 = sqrt(D2/D1), then squaring both sides:

(Te1/Te2)^2 = D2/D1 → D1 = D2 * (Te2/Te1)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

Te1/Te2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

So,

Te1^4 / Te2^4 = D2^2 / D1^2 → (Te1/Te2)^4 = (D2/D1)^2 → (Te1/Te2)^2 = D2/D1 → D2 = D1 * (Te1/Te2)^2

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think numerically. Let's say Planet1 is closer to the star than Planet2. So D1 < D2. Then Te1 would be larger than Te2 because it's closer. So the ratio Te1/Te2 is 1.4. So the ratio D2/D1 would be (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 is about twice D1? Hmm, that makes sense because if a planet is farther, its temperature is lower. So if D2 is larger, Te2 would be smaller.

So for Planet1 and Planet2:

Te1/Te2 = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 → D2 = D1 * (1.4)^2 = D1 * 1.96.

Similarly, between Planet2 and Planet3, Te2/Te3 =2.3 → D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 =5.29 → D3= D2 *5.29.

So D3 = D2 *5.29 = D1 *1.96 *5.2
