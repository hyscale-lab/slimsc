Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass—similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets based on the RV method observations.

RV method, right. That's when you look for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells you about the planet's presence and some of its characteristics.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, so the key here is understanding what causes the Doppler shift in the RV method. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) multiplied by (something with the orbital period). Or wait, more accurately, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 day) )^(1/3) ) * [some factor]

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) )

But since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars (Neptune is about 17 Earth masses, and the stars are Sun-like, which is much more massive), M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so we can approximate that term as M_*^(2/3).

So, K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) ) * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, does that mean K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3) ? Because K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Yes. Because for a larger P (orbital period), the semi-amplitude K would be smaller, since it's inversely related to the cube root of P.

So, Planet #1 has a semi-amplitude K1 of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has K2 of 7. Since the stars have the same mass, M_* is same for both. And the planet masses are similar (Neptune-like), so M_p is same for both.

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = (constant) / P1^(1/3),
