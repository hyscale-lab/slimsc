Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. So, the catalyst facilitates the redistribution of alkene bonds. Metathesis usually involves breaking and reforming double bonds, right? So the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. 

3-methylpent-1-ene would have a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, wait. Wait, wait, pent-1-ene is five carbons with the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on the third carbon of the main chain. So the main chain is five carbons, but wait, no. Wait,
