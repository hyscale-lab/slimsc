Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about the synthesis of a specific nitro compound starting from benzene. Hmm, let's see what the target molecule is. Oh right, it's 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. That's a mouthful. So I need to figure out the sequence of reactions that would lead to this compound with high yield.

Wait, let me draw the structure to visualize. Benzene ring, substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has ethoxy group, position 2 has tert-butyl, and position 3 has nitro. So numbering is such that when you go around the ring, the substituents are in the order ethoxy (1), tert-butyl (2), nitro (3). Or maybe I should think about their positions relative to each other. Oh, wait, I think the numbering should be such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers, but the exact positions here are fixed because each substituent is in a specific spot.

So the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. That means the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. So the ring looks like this: substituent at position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So they are adjacent to each other in a row. Wait, but benzene is a ring, so the positions are 1, 2, 3 in order, each adjacent to the next. So like 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro. So each substituent is next to the other. So the ring has three substituents in a row.

So the starting material is benzene. I need to add these groups in the correct order. The key here is the directing effects of the groups since benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution.

First, I should think about the order in which the substituents are added. Because each substitution will direct the next substitution. For example, if I add a nitro group first, which is a meta-director, then the next substitution will go meta to it.

Wait, but the substituents here are nitro, tert-butyl, and ethoxy. Let me think about their directing effects. Nitro is a strong meta-director. Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating group via the lone pairs on the oxygen), so it's an ortho/para director. tert-Butyl is a bulky, activating group (since it's an alkyl group, which donates electrons through induction), so it's an ortho/para director as well, but bulky.

So the plan is to add the substituents in an order that allows each new group to be added in the correct position relative to the existing groups.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the substituents and their positions. The target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl at position 2, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and nitro (position 3). So when adding substituents, the groups should be added in a way that each new group directs the next correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents can be added in a way that each new group is added in the correct position relative to the existing substituents.

Let me think about the possible reaction steps.

The substituents are:

1. Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH2CH3, actually wait, ethoxy is -OCH2CH3, right?)

Wait, no. Wait, ethoxy is -OCH2CH3. Yes.

2. tert-Butyl group: that's a bulky substituent, -C(CH3)3.

3. Nitro group: -NO2.

So the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the positions are 1,2,3,
