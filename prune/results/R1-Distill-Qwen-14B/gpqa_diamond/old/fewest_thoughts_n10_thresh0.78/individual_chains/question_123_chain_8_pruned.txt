Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta relative to the Galaxy. Hmm, I need to figure out how far the ejecta travels from the Galaxy's perspective when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Let me think.

Wait, the question says both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So they're moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. That probably means I can use the Galilean transformation or maybe special relativity. But wait, the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me check what the speed of light is. Oh right, the speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is a fifth of that, which is 0.2c. Hmm, that's significant. So relativistic effects might be important here.

Wait, the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s as well, right? Because in different frames, velocities just add in the opposite direction.

But wait, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So I think I need to find how much distance the ejecta covers in 50 seconds of the ejecta's time. But wait, time might dil
