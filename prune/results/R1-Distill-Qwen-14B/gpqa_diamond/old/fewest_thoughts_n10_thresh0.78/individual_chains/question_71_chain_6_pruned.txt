Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature relates to how much heat a planet absorbs from its star and how much it radiates back. Since all these planets have the same albedo, the difference in temperature should come from their distances from the star. 

The question says the planets are in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and Planet_5 the longest. The equilibrium temperature formula I think is T = T_star * ( ( L / (16πσ) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - A) / (2) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1) / (a^(0.5)) ), where a is the semi-major axis. But wait, another way I remember is that the temperature depends on the square root of the inverse of the orbital period, but I need to think about the relation between period and distance.

Oh right, Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P² ∝ a³. Therefore, a ∝ P^(2/3). So if I take the ratio of periods between two planets, I can find the ratio of their semi-major axes.

We're looking for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_eff * ( (1 - A)/2 )^(1/4) * ( L / (16πσ) )^(1/4) ) * (1/a)^(1/2). Since all have the same albedo and same star, the ratio T4/T2 will be sqrt( (P2/P4)^(1/2) ) or something like that. Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, no. Because a ∝ P^(2/3), so a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). Then, the ratio of temperatures would be (a2/a4)^(1/2), because temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. So T4/T2 = sqrt( (a2/a4) ) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, let's think carefully. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - A)/2 )^(1/4) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), but T_star is the star's effective temperature. But since all planets are around the same star, T_star is the same for all, so it cancels out in the ratio. So the ratio T4/T2 is inversely proportional to sqrt(a4/a2). But a4 is larger than a2 if its period is longer, which it is. Because Planet_4 has a longer period than Planet_2.

Wait, the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_2's period is 2 units, Planet_4's period is 3.5 units. So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So the ratio a
