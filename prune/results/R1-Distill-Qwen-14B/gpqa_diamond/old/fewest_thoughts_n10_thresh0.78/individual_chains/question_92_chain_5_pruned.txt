Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, the question gives me some bond energies instead of directly giving the formation values. So I need to use bond energies to find the enthalpy of formation.

The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me try to visualize its structure. Maybe it's a diene or something with multiple double bonds? Let me count the carbons. Each (CH3)2C=CH- part has four carbons, but wait, maybe the overall structure is longer.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule. The options given are numbers, so I need to figure out the total bond energy and then relate that to the enthalpy of formation.

Enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol for carbon. I think that's the energy required to break a carbon atom into its constituent parts. But how does that tie into bond energies? Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies and the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

The formula I remember is: 

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies in the reactants) - (sum of bond energies in the products)

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, the standard approach is to calculate the enthalpy change using the bonds broken and formed. For the formation of the molecule from its elements, we have to consider the bonds made and the bonds broken.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of formation (Î”Hf) can be calculated by subtracting the sum of the bond energies of the reactant bonds from the sum of the product bonds. Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, when forming the molecule from its elements, you break the bonds in the elements (like H-H and C-C) and form the bonds in the compound.

Wait, no. Let me think: the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when the compound is formed from the elements (in their standard states, like H2 and O2 for something like water). The bond energies given here are for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C
