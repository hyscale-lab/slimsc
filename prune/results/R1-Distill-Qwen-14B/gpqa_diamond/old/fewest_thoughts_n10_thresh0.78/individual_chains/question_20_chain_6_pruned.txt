Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about nuclear physics, specifically about the impulse approximation used in many-body nuclear calculations. Hmm, I remember that the impulse approximation is a simplifying assumption where nucleons in a nucleus behave like free particles. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so I need to think this through.

The question asks which of the four assumptions imply this impulse approximation. The options are combinations of 1,2,3,4. Let me go through each assumption one by one.

Assumption 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So this means that the force or interaction is considered to act directly on each nucleon without considering their collective behavior. If the current only interacts with individual particles, that suggests each is treated independently, which aligns with the idea of free nucleons. So assumption 1 supports the impulse approximation.

Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Transparent here probably means that other nucleons don't affect the interaction. Like, when a nucleon interacts, the others just pass through unaffected. So if the nucleus is mostly transparent except for the one nucleon involved, then the other nucleons don't contribute to the interactionâ€”meaning the selected nucleon is treated as free from the rest. That would imply the impulse approximation because the other nucleons don't influence the process. So assumption 2 also supports it.

Assumption 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Wait, quarks are part of the nucleon. Non-relativistic quarks would imply that the internal structure of the nucleon doesn't involve high speeds, so maybe their binding is weak. But how does that tie into the impulse approximation? If the quarks are non-relativistic, that might mean the nucleon is not under significant internal stress, so it doesn't emit or absorb much energy during the interaction. But I'm not entirely sure how this directly leads to the impulse assumption. It might affect the treatment of the nucleon, treating it as a point particle without considering internal dynamics, which could be part of the approximation.

Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. No binding forces would mean the nucleon is free, as if it's not part of a nucleus. If the binding is ignored, the nucleon moves as if it's free. So this definitely supports the impulse approximation.

Now, putting this together. The impulse approximation assumes that each nucleon behaves as a free particle. So the assumptions that support this are probably 1, 2, and 4. Because:

1. Interaction is individual, no collective effect.

2. Other nucleons don't interfere, so the selected one is treated alone.

4. No binding forces, so the nucleon is free.

What about assumption 3? It's about the quarks being non-relativistic. I'm not entirely sure if that's directly related. The impulse approximation deals with how the nucleon interacts with external fields, not necessarily the internal quark dynamics. If the quarks are non-relativistic, perhaps it's about treating the nucleon as a single particle without considering its internal structure in detail. But I'm not certain
