Okay, so I'm looking at this problem here, and I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, let me restate what I know from the question. Both stars have masses greater than the Sun: Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 is 1.2. But wait, does their mass matter here? I'm not sure yet, but maybe it's more about their compositions.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method, assuming LTE. The values provided are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Oh, and the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5, and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. So, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, the ratio is [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], right? Or maybe it's the ratio of their silicon abundances. I'm a bit confused, but let's see.

Let me recall what these notations mean. The notation [X/Y] means log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, minus the same ratio in the Sun. So, when [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun. If it's negative, X is less abundant.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times higher than in the Sun. So, n_Si/n_Fe (Star_1) = 10^0.3 *
