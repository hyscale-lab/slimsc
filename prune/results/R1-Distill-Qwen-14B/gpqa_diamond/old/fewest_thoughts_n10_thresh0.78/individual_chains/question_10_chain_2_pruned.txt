Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is asking which of the four options has the highest density.

The options are a, b, c, d. Each describes a different planet's characteristics.

Wait, density is mass divided by volume, right? So I need to figure out the density of each option.

Starting with option a: It's an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's density is known. Earth's average density is around 5.5 g/cm³. So I guess option a has a density of 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but the question says 'which has the highest density', so if it's already 5.5, same as Earth, maybe? Unless another option has a higher number.

Option c: Planet same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Since it's same composition, same density as Earth. So its density is 5.5, same as a and b. Hmm, but wait, does the mass affect density if composition is the same? Well, density is mass/volume. If composition is same, then density should stay the same. Because if you have more mass but same composition, the volume increases proportionally. So density remains same. So c's density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same density, 5.5.

Wait
