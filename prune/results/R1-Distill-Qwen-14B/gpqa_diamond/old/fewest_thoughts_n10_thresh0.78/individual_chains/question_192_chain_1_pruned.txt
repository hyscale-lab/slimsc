Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. I remember that conductors have charges on the surface when they're charged, but here the conductor is initially uncharged.

So, the setup: there's a spherical conductor of radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity's center is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. 

The question asks about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, I need to find the magnitude of the electric field E at point P. The options are various expressions involving q, l, s, theta, and constants.

I remember that when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So, how does this work? Oh right, charges in a conductor move to the surfaces. But since the conductor is uncharged, any charges induced by the cavity's charge must be balanced.

Let me think. Inside the cavity, there's a +q charge. Since the conductor was neutral, the charges inside the conductor will rearrange. The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, right? Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, the inner surface has -q (opposite to the enclosed +q), and the outer surface must have +q to balance, so the conductor as a whole is neutral.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So the total charge of the conductor is zero. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is
