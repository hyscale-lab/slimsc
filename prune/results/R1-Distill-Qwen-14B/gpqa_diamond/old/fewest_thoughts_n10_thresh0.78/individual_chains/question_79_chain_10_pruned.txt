Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts under certain conditions to give a product with specific NMR spectra. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the reaction conditions: Compound X is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DBU) in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. DBU is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, often used as a catalyst in various reactions, especially in epoxidation. Wait, but wait—epoxidation usually involves peracids, right? Oh, unless there's another reaction here. Alternatively, maybe this is an elimination reaction. Hmm.

Looking at the product, the product's NMR data is given. So, the product's structure can be determined from the NMR, then we can figure out what X was.

The 1H NMR of the product has the following signals:
- δ 2.28 (3H, singlet)
- δ 2.31 (3H, singlet)
- δ 6.75 (1H, doublet)
- δ 7.08 (2H, doublet)
- δ 7.68 (1H, doublet)
- δ 7.71 (2H, doublet)

The 13C NMR has:
- δ 21.3 (1C, singlet)
- δ 28.4 (1C, singlet)
- δ 126.9 (2C, singlet)
- δ 127.1 (1C, singlet)
- δ 129.1 (2C, singlet)
- δ 130.3 (1C, singlet)
- δ 141.5 (1C, singlet)
- δ 144.1 (1C, singlet)
- δ 197.7 (1C, singlet)

Okay, let's analyze the 13C first. The highest value is 197.7, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester. Wait, but another possibility is an epoxide. Oh wait, no, epoxide carbons are usually around 50-60 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl, like a ketone. But wait, the product is after reacting with DBU. If X is an epoxide, what would happen? Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide.

Wait, but looking at the 1H NMR, I don't see any obvious triplet or other splitting typical of epoxide protons. Epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm, but maybe not in this case? Or perhaps they're deshielded due to neighboring groups. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure. Let me try to sketch possible structures based on the NMR.

Looking at the 1H NMR: There's a singlet at 2.28 and another at 2.31, each integrating to 3H. So two methyl groups, both as singlets, meaning they are probably attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like being attached to a carbon with no adjacent Hs. Maybe they're on carbonyl groups, or on a benzene ring, perhaps as substituents.

Then, the aromatic region: there are four doublets. Let me think about the splitting. If it's a substituted benzene, perhaps a para substitution would lead to two doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group attached to something else.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows several carbons in the 126-130 ppm range, which are typical for sp2 carbons, like those in aromatic rings or double bonds. The 141.5 and 144.1 ppm are probably carbons attached to substituents in an aromatic ring, like para positions.

The 197.7 ppm carbon is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. That's a high value; maybe a ketone or an ester. But wait, an epoxide wouldn't have that. So perhaps the product is a ketone. Or maybe it's an epoxide and another group.

Wait, but the starting material is compound X, so the product would be X after reaction with DBU. Since DBU is a base, perhaps it's deprotonating something, or maybe it's involved in elimination.

Wait, another thought: If X is an epoxide, and DBU is a base, perhaps the reaction is ring-opening. But I'm not sure how that would lead to the product. Alternatively, maybe X is a diene or something else that reacts with DBU to form an epoxide.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the options and see what they are, then think about the reaction.

Option A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So that's oxirane (epoxide) with a styryl group attached at position 2. The styryl part would be a benzene ring connected via a double bond to a CH2-O-CH2 structure? Hmm, not sure. Wait, the structure would be something like benzene-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2- something? Or perhaps a styryl group is a vinyl group connected to a benzene, so 4-methylstyryl would be a benzene ring with a methyl at the para position and a vinyl group attached.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2 group? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, the oxirane is a three-membered ring with two oxygen atoms? No, oxirane is the common name for ethylene oxide, a three-membered epoxide ring.

Option B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So that's oxirane where one of the substituents is a 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl group. So the substituent would be a group like CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH(Ph)-CH2? No, wait, no, propene is CH2=CH-CH2. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2- attached at the second carbon? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent like CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 attached to the oxirane ring.

Option C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane ring (epoxide) has substituents at positions 2 and 3. Position 2 has a methyl group, and position 3 has a styryl group (vinyl-benzene). So the structure would be oxirane where one substituent is a methyl and the other is a styryl group.

Option D) 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide ring has a styryl group attached at position 2. So the structure would be an epoxide with a substituent that's a styryl group (vinylbenzene) on one of the carbons.

So, the product after reaction with DBU is given. Let's think about what reaction would occur. If X is an epoxide, then what would DBU do? DBU is a strong base; perhaps it's involved in ring-opening. Alternatively, if X is an epoxide, and DBU is used, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed ring opening, but DBU is a base. Maybe it's deprotonating something.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps X is a diene and reacts with something else. Or maybe X is an epoxide that undergoes some reaction, like acid-catalyzed ring opening, but with a base? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the product. The product has a carbonyl group (197.7 ppm) in 1
