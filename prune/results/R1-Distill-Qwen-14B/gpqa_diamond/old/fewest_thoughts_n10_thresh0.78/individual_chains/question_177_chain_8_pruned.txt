Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's going on. 

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Interesting. Through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature via Wien's Law. Oh right, Wien's Law says that lambda_max is proportional to 1/T, so if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T_1 equals T_2. That's a key point.

The radial velocities are given as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But I'm not sure how that affects the observed luminosity. Oh, wait, the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosities using the black body radiation, so maybe the velocities are a red herring or maybe they affect the observed wavelength, but since we are talking about the actual emitted luminosities, perhaps the velocity doesn't matter here. Or maybe it's about the Doppler shift. Hmm. But the problem statement says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, which suggests that any Doppler shift due to their velocities has been accounted for, so their intrinsic temperatures are the same. So I can probably ignore the radial velocities for the purpose of calculating luminosity.

So, both stars have the same temperature T. Now, the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars are black bodies, this formula applies.

We need to find the ratio of their luminosities, L1/L2. Let's write that:

L1/L2 = (4π R1² σ T1⁴) / (4π R2² σ T2⁴)

But R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2. So substituting:
