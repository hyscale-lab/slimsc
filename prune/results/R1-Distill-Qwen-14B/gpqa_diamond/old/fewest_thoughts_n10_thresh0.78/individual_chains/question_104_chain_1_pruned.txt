Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The idea is that as the planet tugs the star, the star moves towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits, so their velocities are steady, I guess.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift in the spectral line, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. So, the ratio P2/P1 is what we're looking for.

Wait, I remember that the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is something like v = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))).

But maybe I can simplify this because the masses of the stars are the same, and the planet masses are similar. Since both stars are like the Sun and planets are like Neptune, their masses M_p are roughly the same, and M_star is same for both.

So, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to M_p sin i / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ) * (something). Wait, I think the formula for the semi-amplitude is K = (v) = [ (27 * π * G) / (4 c^3) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) ] * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But wait, since M_p is much less than M_star (Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, Sun is about 1047 Earth masses), so M_p/M_star is small. So the denominator (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) is approximately 1
