Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, okay, I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 and the classical approximation of T1. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So, I remember that rest-mass energy is calculated using Einstein's equation E=mc². So the initial energy is all rest energy since it's at rest.

Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. Let me denote the masses. Let the lighter fragment have mass m, so the heavier one is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, m + 2m = 0.99 M → 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the masses are m = (1/3)*0.99 M = 0.33 M and 2m = 0.66 M. Wait, wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the two masses are 0.33 M and 0.66 M. Since M is the initial mass.

But wait, the initial nucleus has rest mass M, but the sum of the two fragments is 0.99 M. So, the total mass after fission is less than before. That suggests some mass was converted into energy, which makes sense because in fission, some mass is converted into kinetic energy and possibly other forms.

The nucleus is initially at rest, so total momentum must be conserved. Since it's at rest, the total momentum after fission should also be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with momenta that cancel each other out.

So, the heavier fragment (mass 2m) and the lighter (mass m) move in opposite directions. Let me denote their velocities as v1 (heavier) and v2 (lighter). Their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, (2m) v1 = (m) v2 → 2 v1 = v2.

Wait, but since it
