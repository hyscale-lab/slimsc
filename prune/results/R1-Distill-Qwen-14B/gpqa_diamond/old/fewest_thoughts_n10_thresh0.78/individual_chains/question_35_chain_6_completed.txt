Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to recall what I know.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, S looks like [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Let me start by writing down the matrix for A_y. Since c is h/(4π), A_y would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by S. So,

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Which is the same as:

A_y = [[0, -i h/(4π)], [i h/(4π), 0]]

Wait, no, because each element is multiplied by c. So yeah, that's correct.

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So, the matrix A_y - a I would be:

[ -a        -i h/(4π)     ]
[ i h/(4π)   -a          ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ]

Calculating the determinant:

= a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is -i², which is -( -1 ) = 1. So,

= a² - [ (1) (h²/(16 π²) ) ]

So determinant equation: a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So, a² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π )

Wait, but wait, the options talk about eigenvalues with imaginary parts? Or real parts? Because I thought angular momentum components are Hermitian operators, so their eigenvalues should be real.

Wait, no. Wait, A is the angular momentum operator. Intrinsic angular momentum for spin-½ particles. So, the components of angular momentum are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues should be real.

Wait, but in this problem, the operator is A_y. So the matrix given for S is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Let me check if S is Hermitian.

The conjugate transpose of S would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not the same as S. So S is anti-Hermitian? Because S† = -S. Because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is -S.

So S is anti-Hermitian, meaning S† = -S. Then, A_y = c S. Since c is real, A_y is also anti-Hermitian. Because (A_y)† = c S† = c (-S) = -c S = -A_y.

Wait, but for Hermitian operators, eigenvalues are real. Anti-Hermitian operators have eigenvalues purely imaginary. So A_y is anti-Hermitian. So its eigenvalues should be purely imaginary, not real.

Wait, but the problem says Ay is an intrinsic angular momentum operator. Oh wait, wait. The standard angular momentum operators (like L_x, L_y, L_z) are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. But this is the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I got something wrong. Because for spin-½ particles, the Pauli matrices are used. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Let me think.

Wait, the matrix S given here is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute S†:

S† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]].

Which is equal to -S, because S is original [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]] = -S. So S is anti-Hermitian. So A_y is c times anti-Hermitian. So A_y is anti-Hermitian, so eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

Wait, but the standard spin matrices are Hermitian? Or are they not?

Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are Hermitian. So where is S in this context?

Wait, perhaps S is the Pauli matrix σ_y multiplied by i. Let me see. The standard σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the same as S here. So S is σ_y, which is Hermitian? Or wait, let me check σ_y.

Wait, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as σ_y, because i becomes -i, and -i becomes i. So actually, σ_y is Hermitian. Oh wait, wait, no: wait, σ_y's elements are [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements, so [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Then, the conjugate of σ_y is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as the transpose. So σ_y is Hermitian. So why is S in this problem anti-Hermitian?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check S again. S is first row (0, -i), second row (i, 0). So S is same as σ_y. So S is Hermitian. Because S† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]] which equals S. Because S has 0 on diagonal and -i and i on off-diagonal, so their conjugates would be i and -i, which when you transpose, gives the same matrix. So S is Hermitian. So A_y is c times a Hermitian matrix, so A_y is Hermitian.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the determinant, I thought the eigenvalues were real?

Wait, that's conflicting with my initial thought. Let me recheck. Let's compute the determinant again.

The matrix is A_y = c S, and S is Hermitian, so A_y is Hermitian.

Wait, so A_y is Hermitian, which means its eigenvalues are real. So any eigenvalues I find must be real numbers.

But earlier, I found a² = (h/(4π))^2, so a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real. So the options that talk about imaginary parts don't make sense.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That can't be right because the eigenvalues should be real.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But that would imply complex eigenvalues, which can't be correct because A_y is Hermitian. So options A and B are likely incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Let me think about that. Well, A² is the square of the angular momentum operator. For a spin-½ particle, A² would be (ħ/2)^2 * 3 I, I think. Because for spin, the total angular momentum squared is s(s+1)ħ², where s=1/2. So A² would have eigenvalues (3/4)ħ². So if the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², then it's possible. But wait, for angular momentum, the eigenfunctions of a component (like A_y) are eigenfunctions of A², because the total angular momentum (A) commutes with its components. Or wait, no, because [A², A_y] =0. So any eigenfunction of A_y should also be an eigenfunction of A². So option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Well, that's possible, because an eigenstate of Ay might not be an eigenstate of Az, unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which isn't generally the case. So option C could be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Well, the matrix is 2x2, so it's in the spin-½ space. The basis functions would typically be the eigenvectors of some operator, perhaps the z-component. If Ay is represented in the standard basis (eigenbasis of, say, Az), then its eigenvectors wouldn't be the same as the basis unless Ay is diagonal in that basis. But Ay isn't diagonal in the standard basis. So the eigenfunctions of Ay aren't the basis functions of Ay. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says that the matrix operator is given, and the eigenvectors of that matrix would form the basis for the operator. Wait, no, because the basis is a set of vectors, but the eigenvectors of Ay would span the space, but the operator's matrix is in a certain basis. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is just referring to the standard basis, but I'm not sure. I'll come back to this.

Wait, but let's think about eigenvalues again. The eigenvalues I found were ± h/(4π). Wait, but that can't be right. Because for spin-½ particles, the spin components have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So let's compute what h/(4π) is in terms of ħ.

Wait, Planck's constant h is 2πħ. So h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) ) = ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So my earlier calculation was correct. The eigenvalues are a = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the question says c = h/(4π), so Ay = c S. And S is the Pauli matrix σ_y. So for σ_y, the eigenvalues are ±1. So when multiplied by c, which is ħ/2 (since h = 2πħ, so c= (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2)) ), the eigenvalues are ± ħ/(2). So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. 

Wait, but in the options, looking back:

Option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B says imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. But again, eigenvalues are real, so this is wrong.

So options A and B are out. Now, between C and D.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. As I thought, since A² and Ay commute, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So the first part is correct. But the second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Well, for a spin-½ system, the eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az. So the statement in option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Hmm. The basis for a matrix operator is typically the standard basis, which for spin-½ particles would be the eigenstates of Sz (the z-component). The eigenvectors of Ay are not the same as the standard basis, so this statement is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), where \( a \) is the eigenvalue. Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the matrix \( A_y - aI \) becomes:

\[
A_y - aI = \begin{bmatrix} -a & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -a \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = a^2 - \left(-i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right).
\]

Simplifying the second term, \( (-i)(i) = 1 \), so:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = a^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2.
\]

Setting the determinant to zero:

\[
a^2 = \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 \implies a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Since \( h = 2\pi\hbar \), we find \( \frac{h}{4\pi} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \). Thus, the eigenvalues are:

\[
a = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

These eigenvalues are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) can be computed, but the problem does not require explicit calculation. Instead, we analyze the given options.

### Step 3: Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: This option claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \)).

- **Option B**: This option claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), which are real.

- **Option C**: This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \) commute (\( [A_y, A^2] = 0 \)), meaning eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \), as the components of angular momentum do not commute.

- **Option D**: This option claims the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is incorrect because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not the same as the standard basis (eigenfunctions of \( A_z \)).

### Conclusion
The correct option is **C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and the other operators.

Answer: C
