Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

So the question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Wait, but the masses are the same for both. Oh, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because shorter orbital period usually means the planet is orbiting closer in.

Then both have circular orbits, which is good because that simplifies things. The host stars' masses and radii are also given. The star for Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. But despite that, both stars have the same radii. Interesting, so more massive but same size. That might imply something about their luminosity or temperature, but maybe that's a tangent.

The question is about transit probability. The researchers want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. So which one is more likely to transit?

Wait, transit probability depends on the orbital inclination. For a planet to transit, its orbital plane needs to be edge-on relative to our line of sight. The probability of that happening is related to the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the formula:

P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_planet / a)^2)))

Wait, not sure if that's exactly right. Alternatively, I think the formula is P = (R*/a) / (sqrt(1 - (b)^2)), where b is the impact parameter. But maybe that's complicating things. Let me think again.

Oh wait, another approach: the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) where R_star is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance, so the chance that the planet's path crosses our line of sight.

Wait, more accurately, the probability is roughly (R* / a) *
