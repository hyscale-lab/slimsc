Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism has to do with the magnetic properties of materials due to their electrons' spin. The coupling term probably refers to the energy associated with the interaction between the magnetic field and the electron's spin.

The magnetic field B is given as 1 Tesla and is parallel to the Oz axis. Oh wait, Oz is the z-axis, so the field is pointing along that. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so I guess that's m = 0, ±1, etc., but since m is small, maybe those are the possible values.

The problem also mentions the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, 0.4861 micrometers is about 486.1 nanometers. Oh, that's the wavelength for the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, which is a transition from n=3 to n=2. Or wait, no, actually the Balmer series is transitions down to n=2. H-alpha is n=3 to n=2, right? And the wavelength is about 656 nm, but wait, the given wavelength is 486 nm. That must be the H-beta line, which is n=4 to n=2. Because 486 nm is in the blue-green part of the spectrum.

But I might be getting the exact lines mixed up. Anyway, the point is that the transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength λ. Using the formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

So first, I need to compute ΔE. Let me jot that down. 

h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, c is about 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 x 10^-9 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 Js)(3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m) 

Calculating that:

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 486.1e-9 m is 4.861e-7 m.

So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately 4.088e-19 J.

Hmm, but wait, I remember that the energy levels of hydrogen are often given in electron volts. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.088e-19 J is about 2.55 eV. That makes sense because the Balmer series (n=2 to n=3) corresponds to about 1.89 eV, but maybe I'm mixing up the exact numbers.

Wait, no, the H-alpha line is around 656 nm and has a transition energy of about 1.89 eV. Wait, but our given wavelength is 486 nm, which is H-beta, so the energy should be higher. Let me double-check the calculation. Let's compute it again:

ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (486.1e-9)

So that's (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7) = 4.088e-19 J.

Convert that to eV: 4.088e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. So yes, H-beta (n=4→2) has a higher energy than H-alpha, which is about 1.89 eV. So that makes sense.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. I think this refers to the Zeeman effect, where the energy levels split in a magnetic field. The Zeeman effect involves the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field.

The energy term for the Zeeman effect is given by ΔE_Zeeman = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * (eħ/(2m)) * m_s, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, e is the charge, ħ is h-bar, m is the mass of the electron, and m_s is the spin quantum number.

Wait, another approach: The Zeeman energy is often expressed as ΔE = (μ_B * B * m_s) / (something), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, for an electron with spin, the magnetic dipole moment is μ = -g_s * μ_B * S, where S is the spin angular momentum. The Zeeman energy is the dot product of μ and B, which is μ·B = -g_s μ_B B S_z.

For an electron, g_s is approximately 2. The spin quantum number m_s can be ±1/2. So the energy shift is ΔE = - (g_s μ_B B m_s).

But wait, for hydrogen, the orbital and spin magnetic moments are considered. Oh wait, the question is about the paramagnetic coupling term, which is different from the Zeeman effect. Or is it the same? Hmm.

Paramagnetic materials have their magnetic moments due to unpaired electrons. The paramagnetic coupling might refer to the exchange interaction, but I think in this context, it's more likely the Zeeman effect, which is the interaction of the magnetic moment with the external field.

So the paramagnetic coupling term would be the energy due to this interaction. So let's compute μ_B * B.

The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T.

So ΔE_paramagnetic = μ_B * B * m_s.

Wait, but m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number, which for an electron is ±1/2. So let's compute that.

B is 1 T, so μ_B * B = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J.

Multiply by m_s = 0.5 (since m can be ±1/2). So 9.274e-24 * 0.5 ≈ 4.637e-24 J.

Wait, but the transition energy ΔE was on the order of 4e-19 J, which is much larger than 4.6e-24 J. Wait, 4e-19 is larger than 4e-24 by a factor of 1e5. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The paramagnetic term is the energy shift due to the magnetic field. So for each electron, the shift is on the order of μ_B * B. Which is about 9e-24 J as above.

But the transition energy is 4e-19 J. So the paramagnetic coupling term is 9e-24, which is way smaller than 4e-19. So comparing the two: the paramagnetic term is much smaller than ΔE.

So the question is asking which is bigger: ⟨H⟩ (which is the paramagnetic term) compared to ΔE. So ⟨H⟩ is the energy shift due to the magnetic field, and we just found that it's much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Because the paramagnetic term for the Hamiltonian might involve m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, the question states that m is small. So m could be 0, ±1, etc. Let me think about that.

The paramagnetic term could also involve the orbital angular momentum. So the energy shift due to the orbital magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by ΔE_orbital = μ
