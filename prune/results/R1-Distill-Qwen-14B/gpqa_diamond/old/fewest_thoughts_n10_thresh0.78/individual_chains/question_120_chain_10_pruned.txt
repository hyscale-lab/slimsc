Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, so probably it's about the relationship between the number of stars and the parallax.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So the larger the parallax, the closer the star is. But wait, no, wait. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means a closer star because plx = 1/d. So small plx means distant stars.

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed. That probably means that the number density of stars is constant in space. So, in any region of space, there's the same number of stars per volume. But how does that translate to parallax?

I think I should model this. Let's consider a volume of space. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume dV would be n * dV, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

But how does this relate to parallax? Parallax depends on the distance. For a given volume, if we consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But we need to express this in terms of parallax (plx). Since plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that into the equation.

So, number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx. Wait, no, the number per unit parallax. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of how the number of stars varies as a function of plx.

The volume element in terms of parallax: Let me see, if plx is a small change, then dV = 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/plx, then d² = 1/plx². And dd is the change in distance, but plx is 1/d, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.
