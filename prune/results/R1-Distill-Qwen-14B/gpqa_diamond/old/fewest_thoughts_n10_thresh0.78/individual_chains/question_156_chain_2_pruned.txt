Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reactions with mCPBA and what happens when the products are run through HPLC columns. Hmm, I remember mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is an oxidizing agent. It's used in epoxidation reactions, right? So when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides.

The question mentions two reactions. Both are treating different enenes with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Reaction 1 is (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 is (Z)-oct-4-ene.

Wait, so each reaction forms an epoxide. But wait, since the starting alkenes are E and Z, their epoxides might be different. Let me think about that. Epoxidation tends to form trans epoxides when the starting alkene is trans. No, wait, actually, the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's configuration. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide will form with the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides. Like, when the alkene is E, the substituents are opposite, so the epoxide adds across, making the oxygen atoms on the same side? Or is it the opposite? Oh wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall: mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond in a way that the configuration of the starting alkene influences the epoxide's stereochemistry. So for a trans (E) double bond, the epoxide will have the oxygens on the same face, making it cis in the epoxide? No, wait, I think the epoxide is formed such that the stereochemistry is retained. So the E double bond would lead to a trans epoxide? Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I might need to visualize this. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the groups on either end of the double bond are opposite. When mCPBA adds across, it does so in a way that the oxygen adds to each carbon from the same face, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the mechanism. mCPBA is an electrophilic reagent;
