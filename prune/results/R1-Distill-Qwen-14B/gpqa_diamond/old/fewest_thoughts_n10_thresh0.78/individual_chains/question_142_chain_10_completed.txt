Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix and where it's located in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, I think this represents a completely mixed state. Because when you have equal probabilities for both states |0⟩ and |1⟩, and there's no coherence between them, the density matrix takes on this form.

So, I remember that for a qubit, the state can be represented in a Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), where the state is usually written as (cos(θ/2), 0, sin(θ/2)) or something like that. Wait, no, more precisely, the general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (x, y, z) with |r| ≤ 1. Oh right, because the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r.

So, if I expand the given ρ, let's see. Let's compute each term. The identity matrix is 2x2, and each term is |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|.

Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0 on the diagonal. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. So adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]] which is the identity matrix. So ρ equals (1/2)(I), since I is the identity matrix, which is 2x2.

So ρ = (I)/2. If I write this out, I get [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. 

Now, the general form of a density matrix is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So if I set that equal to [[0.5, 0],[0,0.5]], then I can compare the two matrices.

Let me write out the general form. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So (I + r·σ)/2 would be:

(1/2)[ [1, 0; 0, 1] + r_x [ [0,1],[1,0] ] + r_y [ [0,-i],[i,0] ] + r_z [ [1,0],[0,-1] ] ]

So combining terms, the diagonal elements would be (1 + r_z)/2 for the top-left, and (1 - r_z)/2 for the bottom-right. The off-diagonal elements would be (r_x - i r_y)/2 and (r_x + i r_y)/2.

But in our case, the given ρ has all diagonal elements 0.5 and off-diagonal elements zero. So let's see:

From the diagonal:
(1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.
(1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5 → same as above.

For the off-diagonal elements, (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0. So r_x must be zero, and r_y must be zero. Because if r_x and r_y are zero, then the off-diagonal terms are zero.

So all components of r are zero. Which means the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That corresponds to the completely mixed state, which makes sense because this density matrix is (I/2), which is the maximally mixed state.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we note that any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed in the form 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(I + \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}\right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. The Bloch vector determines the position of the density matrix on the Bloch sphere.

For the given \(\rho\), expanding the terms shows that it simplifies to:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This corresponds to \(\rho = \frac{1}{2}I\), which is the maximally mixed state. Comparing this with the general form of the density matrix, we see that the off-diagonal terms vanish (\(r_x = 0, r_y = 0\)) and the diagonal terms are equal (\(r_z = 0\)). Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the density matrix is located at the origin in qubit space.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the Bloch vector is \((0,0,0)\). 

Answer: C
