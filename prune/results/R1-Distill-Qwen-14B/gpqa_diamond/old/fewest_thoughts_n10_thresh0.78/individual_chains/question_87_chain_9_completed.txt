Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Wait, di-substituted means it has two substituents attached, right? And the ring is six-membered, so probably benzene or something similar since it's aromatic.

The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Hmm, so the benzene ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents add 2 more. Wait, no. Let me think. If it's a di-substituted benzene, each substituent is attached to the ring. Each substituent is a group that adds some carbons. So the total carbons in the molecule are 8.

Wait, the ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents add 2 more, so each substituent must have one carbon each? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none? But wait, no, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents. So maybe each substituent is a single carbon group? Like two methyl groups? But then the total would be 6 (ring) + 2 (two methyl) = 8. That makes sense.

Wait, but the question also mentions that the FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, so the substituents must include a carbonyl group and a halogen. Because in IR, a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1 would indicate a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester or something. And the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond suggests a halogen substituent, like Cl or Br attached to the aromatic ring.

So, putting that together, the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. But wait, how can a substituent have a carbonyl group? Let me think. For a di-substituted benzene, substituents could be groups like -COOR (ester), -COOH (carboxylic acid), -COR (ketone), or maybe an acyl group.

Wait, but the substituents are attached to the benzene ring. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like an acetyl group (COCH3), but that would add 2 carbons (the CO and CH3). Oh wait, wait, let's count again.

The ring has 6 carbons. The substituents are two groups. The carbonyl group is part of a substituent. So, for example, if one substituent is a carbonyl group, like –CO–, but that's not possible on its own. Oh wait, maybe the substituent is an acyl group, like –CO–R where R is another carbon group.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone (e.g., –CO–R), and the other is a halogen (like –Cl or –Br). So the substituents are –CO–R and –X, where X is Cl, Br, etc.

But wait, the total number of carbons is 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents must contribute 2 carbons. So, if one substituent is –CO–R, and R is a methyl group (CH3), then the substituent would be –COCH3. That's 2 carbons (C from CO and CH3). The other substituent is a halogen, which doesn't add any carbons. So total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (COCH3) + 0 (X) = 8. That adds up.

So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: one acetyl (COCH3) and one halogen (like Cl). So the molecule would be something like para-substituted benzene with COCH3 and Cl, but the positions could vary.

Wait, but the substituents are di-substituted, so they could be in the para, ortho, or meta positions. But the NMR data might help us figure that out.

Now, looking at the options for the NMR data:

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)
That's a singlet at 9.9, which might be an aldehyde proton, but wait, if there's a carbonyl, but no aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic proton in a very deshielded environment, like attached to an electron-withdrawing group. The 3.7 ppm is a singlet of 2H—maybe a OCH2 group or something else. Wait, but our substituents are COCH3 and X.

Alternatively, maybe the singlet is from an aromatic proton. Wait, in a di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are in the para position, the aromatic protons would have certain splitting patterns. But I'm not sure yet.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)
These look like two sets of doublets around 4.8 and 4.6, maybe from an ethylene group adjacent to oxygen, like OCH2CH2O or something. The 1.3 is a singlet for probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded. Not sure how this fits with our substituents.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)
The 7.8 and 7.6 are doublets, suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring perhaps. 2.3 ppm is a singlet for 3H, which could be a methyl group attached to something, like a carbonyl. So maybe the substituent is a COCH3 group. Let me think: if the ring has substituents like COCH3 and another group (like Cl), then the aromatic protons would have certain chemical shifts.

Wait, but the COCH3 would be attached to the ring. So the ring is para-substituted with COCH3 and Cl, for example. Then the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That fits with option C's 7.8 and 7.6. The 2.3 is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl. So that seems to fit. But wait, what about the halogen? The IR shows an aromatic-halogen bond, so the substituent is X (Cl or Br).

So in option C, the substituents would be COCH3 and X. So the NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets (because of the para substitution), the COCH3 methyl as a singlet at around 2.3, and then the X might not show up in the H NMR because it's a halogen, but wait, in the substituents, the X is attached to the ring, but if the X is Cl, for example, it's an electronegative substituent and would deshield the adjacent protons. But in the para position, the substituents are opposite each other, so the two H's adjacent to each substituent would be equivalent and give a doublet each.

Wait, but another thought: an aromatic ring with two substituents, COCH3 and Cl, in the para position would have the aromatic protons as two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The COCH3 would show up as a singlet at ~2.3 ppm, and the Cl would be a substituent but doesn't have any protons. So the NMR would match option C, which has three signals: two doublets for the aromatic H's and a singlet for the COCH3.

Wait, but the question mentioned it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So the substituents are in the para position. So option C's data would fit that.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)
The 6.9 is a singlet for 1H, which might be a proton in a symmetric environment. The 4.8 and 4.6 could be from a group like OCH2CH2O, but I'm not sure. The 1.3 is a singlet for 2H, maybe a methyl group attached somewhere.

Hmm, but our expected substituents are COCH3 and X. So in that case, option C seems more likely.

Wait, but let me think about the integration. In option C, the aromatic signals are 2H and 2H, which sums to 4H. The COCH3 is 3H. So total is 4 + 3 =7 H. But the molecule is C8H? Let me count the hydrogens.

The benzene ring has 6 carbons, but with two substituents, each taking up a position. So each substituent is an X and a COCH3. So benzene would have 6 H normally, but with two substituents, it would have 4 H remaining, because each substituent replaces one H. So 4 H on the ring. The substituents: COCH3 has 3 H, and the X doesn't add any H. So total H would be 4 (aromatic) +3 (COCH3) =7 H. So the NMR in option C shows 2+2+3=7 H, which matches. So integration looks correct.

Alternatively, let's look at option A. It's 1H (singlet), 2H, 2H, 2H. Total 7 H. So that's 1+2+2+2=7 H. But what's that mean? The singlet at 9.9 could be an aldehyde proton, but I don't think there's an aldehyde in the structure. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic proton that's isolated, perhaps in the meta position. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the substituents are COCH3 and X. If X is in the para position to COCH3, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each of 2H, which matches option C. So that's more likely.

Wait, but could the substituents be in the meta position? Let me think: if substituents are in the meta positions, the aromatic protons would be more complex. Maybe a triplet or something else.

But in the case of para substituents, the ring's protons would be two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that's what option C shows.

So I think option C is the correct one.

But wait, looking again at the substituents. The IR shows a carbonyl group. So the substituent must have a carbonyl. The COCH3 group does have a carbonyl. And the X is a halogen, which would show a peak in the IR for the C-X bond.

So putting it all together, the structure is a para-substituted benzene with substituents of COCH3 and X (Cl, Br, etc.). The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (each 2H), the COCH3 as a singlet (3H), and no other signals because X doesn't have H.

So option C matches this: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).

Wait, but another thought: the carbonyl group (like in COCH3) would be around 1700 cm^-1 in IR. The C-X (aromatic halogen) would have a peak around 600 cm^-1 or so. So the FTIR data fits that.

So the correct NMR is option C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The substituents include a carbonyl group and a halogen, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum showing peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (C-X). The benzene ring has 6 carbons, and the two substituents contribute the remaining 2 carbons. One substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, such as an acetyl group (-COCH₃), and the other is a halogen (-X, e.g., Cl or Br).

The NMR data must reflect the aromatic protons, the carbonyl group, and the halogen substituent. The aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring (with -COCH₃ and -X) would appear as two doublets (2H each) due to the symmetry of the substituents. The methyl group attached to the carbonyl (from -COCH₃) would appear as a singlet at ~2.3 ppm. The halogen substituent does not contribute to the ¹H NMR spectrum.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A singlet at 9.9 ppm could indicate an aldehyde proton, but there is no aldehyde in the structure. This option does not fit the expected substituents.
- **Option B**: The signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest a group like -OCH₂CH₂O, which is inconsistent with the expected substituents (-COCH₃ and -X).
- **Option C**: The signals at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm correspond to two doublets (2H each), consistent with aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm matches the methyl group of the -COCH₃ substituent. This option aligns with the structure.
- **Option D**: The singlet at 6.9 ppm could indicate an aromatic proton in a unique environment, but the signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest a group like -OCH₂CH₂O, which is inconsistent with the expected substituents.

The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, which matches the expected structure of a para-substituted benzene ring with -COCH₃ and -X substituents.
