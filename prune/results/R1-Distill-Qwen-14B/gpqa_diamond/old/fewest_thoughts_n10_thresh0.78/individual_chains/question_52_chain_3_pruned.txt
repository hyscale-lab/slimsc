Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it again carefully.

The question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I think this involves the Saha equation and maybe some blackbody radiation concepts.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, wait. How does that work? I remember that spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so when spots cover part of the surface, the total emitted radiation would decrease. But the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. That's interesting because the effective temperature is a measure of the total emitted radiation, so the presence of spots lowers the overall Teff.

Now, the main question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or visible range. Oh wait, 1448 Å is in the blue part, but not too sure. But what's important is that the Saha equation relates the ionization state to temperature, and the Boltzmann equation handles the population ratio between energy levels.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Let me think about what affects these ratios. The Saha equation tells us about ionization, but the question is about the ratio of two specific energy levels of neutral Ti. So that's more about the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor for the ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but in
