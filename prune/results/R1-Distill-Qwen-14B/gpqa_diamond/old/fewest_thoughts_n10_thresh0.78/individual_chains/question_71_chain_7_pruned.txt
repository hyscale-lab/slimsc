Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. 

The question says that there are five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They all have the same albedo, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula should be T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A)/S ), where A is albedo and S is the solar constant. But wait, since all planets have the same albedo and same star, maybe some parts cancel out.

Wait, the formula I remember is the equilibrium temperature (T) as T ≈ T_sun * sqrt(R_sun/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), but I might be mixing some constants. Alternatively, another version I've heard is T = ( (L / (16πσ a²) )^(1/4 ), but I think the first approach might be more applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the general formula is T = T_eff (star) * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ). Because the star's effective temperature is T_eff, and the planet's equilibrium temperature depends on the distance a. Oh, right, because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, so the planet's temperature scales with the inverse square root of the distance.

So in this problem, since all planets have the same albedo (A), the (1 - A) term is the same for all, so it cancels out when taking the ratio of two planets. So, the ratio of their temperatures will only depend on their distances from the star.

Wait, but the question gives the orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 P2=2P1, and so on. 

But how does the orbital period relate to the distance? Using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P^2 is proportional to a^3, or a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So for each planet, a_i = k * P_i^(2/3), where k is a constant of proportionality that's the same for all planets because they orbit the same star. So, the semi-major axis (distance) is proportional to the period raised to the 2/3 power.

Therefore, the ratio of the distances between any two planets will be (P_i / P_j)^(2/3). So, the equilibrium temperature ratio would be inverse square root of the distance ratio. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T_i / T_j = sqrt( a_j / a_i )

So, T4 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a4 )

Since a is proportional to P^(2/3), then a2 = (P2)^(2/3) * k, and a4 = (P4)^(2/3) *k, where k is the same for all.

So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3)

So T4/T2 = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3)

Wait, let me make sure. Let me write this step by step.

a ∝ P^(2/3), so a_i = (P_i)^(2/3) * C, where C is a constant.

So a2 = (P2)^(2/3) * C, a4 = (P4)
