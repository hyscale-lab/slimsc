Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where ε is an energy constant, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices used in quantum mechanics for spin-½ systems.

Wait, the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix when it's multiplied by a vector... right, because when you take the dot product of σ with a unit vector n, you get another Pauli-like matrix. The eigenvalues of such matrices are ± something. Let me think.

I recall that for any Pauli matrix σ_i, its eigenvalues are ±1. But when you have a combination like σ · n, where n is a unit vector, the resulting matrix would have eigenvalues ±1 as well. Because each component σ·n is just a direction in spin space, and the eigenvalues should correspond to the spin in that direction.

So let's break it down. The expression σ · n is the sum of each Pauli matrix component multiplied by the corresponding component of n. Since n is a unit vector, the sum would be something like n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Each of these σ matrices has eigenvalues ±1. But when you add them together, what happens to the eigenvalues?

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Each σ_i has eigenvalues ±1, but when you take a linear combination like aσ_x + bσ_y + cσ_z, where a² + b² + c² =1, the eigenvalues of that matrix are ±1 as well. Because the trace is zero, and the determinant is -1. So the eigenvalues would be 1 and -1. But wait, isn't the trace the sum of eigenvalues, which is zero, so they must be ± something.

Wait, no, the trace of σ · n is zero because each σ_i has trace zero. So if the eigenvalues are λ and -λ, their sum is zero, which fits. So the product of the eigenvalues is the determinant. Let me compute the determinant of σ · n.

The determinant of σ · n would be the product of eigenvalues, which
