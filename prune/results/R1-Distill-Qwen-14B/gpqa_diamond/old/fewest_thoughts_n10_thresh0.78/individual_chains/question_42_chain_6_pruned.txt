Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the question is about three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variations, I think. But I don't know if that's relevant for this problem. The question gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and I need to find out how much larger the orbital period of Planet3 is compared to Planet1. 

The given data:
- Ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So, T_eq(Planet1) / T_eq(Planet2) = 1.4? Or the other way around? Wait, the question says the ratio of Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. Hmm, I think it's T1/T2 = 1.4. Because if Planet1 is hotter, then its temperature is higher, so the ratio would be more than 1. But wait, I'm not sure if it's T1 over T2 or T2 over T1. The wording says "between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." So I think it's 1.4 meaning T1 is 1.4 times T2. So T1 = 1.4 * T2. 

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3? Or T3/T2? If it's T2 over T3, that would make Planet2 hotter than Planet3. So T2 = 2.3 * T3. So T1 is 1.4 * T2, which is 1.4 * 2.3 T3 = 3.22 T3. So T1 is about 3.22 times T3. 

Mass ratios:
- Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15. So M1/M2 = 1.15. So M1 is 1.15 * M2. 
- Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So M2/M3 = 1.35, meaning M2 = 1.35 * M3. So M1 = 1.15 * 1.35 * M3 = 1.5525 * M3. 

The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. Albedo affects how much light is reflected, so it plays a role in equilibrium temperature. 

I'm supposed to find the orbital period of Planet3 relative to Planet1. So Period3 / Period1 = ?

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = [( (1 - a) * L ) / (16 * π * σ * D^2 ) ]^(1/4), where a is albedo, L
