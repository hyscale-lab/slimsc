Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Michael addition. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition reaction. The options provided give possible products for each, and I need to determine which option correctly lists all three.

First, let's break down each reaction.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that in the Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it forms the enolate ion. The enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which in this case is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate structure: the acrylate part is CH2=CH-COOCH3, but with the substituents on the double bond. Wait, no: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-O-Me, with the p-tolyl group on the beta position. So the structure is CH2-C(=O)-O-Me, connected to a CH2-Ph (p-tolyl) group. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-Me, and the p-tolyl is on the CH2 group. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons, with the p-tolyl on the second carbon.

So, the Michael donor is dimethyl malonate; it's the enolate that acts as the nucleophile. The acceptor is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

The enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. So the malonate enolate (which is a
