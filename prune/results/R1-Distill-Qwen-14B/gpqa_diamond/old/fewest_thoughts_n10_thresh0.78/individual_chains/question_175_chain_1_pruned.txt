Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. The question is about the radiation it emits, specifically the power radiated per unit solid angle as a function of wavelength lambda and the angle theta from the z-axis.

The problem says the maximum power is A, and we need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f(lambda, theta). The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that when charges oscillate, they radiate electromagnetic waves. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution and the direction from which you're measuring the power.

Since the charge distribution is spheroidal with symmetry along the z-axis, I think the radiation pattern is symmetric around that axis. So, it should have some angular dependence in the polar direction (theta), but be isotropic in the azimuthal (phi) direction, perhaps?

Wait, no, wait. Actually, a dipole radiator has a specific radiation pattern. For a dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is given by the dipole radiation formula. The intensity (power per unit area) in the far zone depends on the angle theta.

The intensity for a dipole is proportional to (sin theta)^2, I think. Because the radiation is maximum at theta = 90 degrees (perpendicular to the dipole axis) and falls off as you move towards theta = 0 or 180 degrees.

But wait, the problem is about the power per unit solid angle. Oh right, the power per unit solid angle is the intensity multiplied by the area element. Wait, no, intensity is power per unit area. But when considering radiation in spherical coordinates, the power per unit solid angle (dP/dOmega) would be the intensity times the area element, which for a sphere is r^2 sin theta dtheta dphi. But in the far field, I think for a dipole, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to (sin theta)^2, and the total power is the integral over all solid angles of this.

Wait, let me think. The total power radiated by an
