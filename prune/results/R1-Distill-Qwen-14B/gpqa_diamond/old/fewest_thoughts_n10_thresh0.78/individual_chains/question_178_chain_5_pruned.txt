Okay, so I have this question about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember from my QFT class that renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants. Let me think through this step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I know that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. But for the purpose of calculating dimensions, maybe I don't need to get into the details of that structure. 

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension [L] = 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c =1). So each term in the Lagrangian should have dimension 4.

Let's break down each part of the term. The fields: ψ is a Dirac spinor, so its mass dimension [ψ] is 3/2. F^μν is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, which is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. The gauge field A has dimension 1, so F would have dimension 2 because each derivative is dimension 1, and each A is 1, so F is [∂A] = 1 + 1 = 2.

Now, putting it all together. The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's figure out the dimensions of each component:

ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices and derivatives? Wait, no, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. But that's just a commutator of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} itself is dimensionless. So the ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ part has dimensions [ψ̄][ψ] = (3/2) * (3/2) = 9/4. Then, we have F^{μν}, which is dimension 2. So the entire term without κ is 9/4 + 2 = 17/4. 

But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So κ multiplied by (17/4) must give 4. So [κ] = 4 / (17/4) )? Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, because I think I'm mixing up how to calculate. Let me double-check.

Wait, no. The term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F. So the dimensions are [κ] * [ψ̄][σ][ψ][F]. Since σ is dimensionless, [ψ̄][ψ] is (3/2 + 3/2) = 3. [F] is 2. So the product is [κ] * 3 * 2 = [κ] *6. And since the term must have dimension 4, [κ]*6 =4 → [κ] =4/6 = 2/3. Wait, that can't be right because 2/3 isn't among the options. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the dimensions.

Wait, maybe I messed up F's dimension. Let me think again. The field strength tensor F^{μν} is made from ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Each derivative is dimension 1, and each A is dimension 1 (since A is a gauge field, which has dimension 1 because the action for a photon is ∫ F², and F has dimension 2 to make F² dimension 4, and the integral is dimension 4 so F must be 2). So F has dimension 2. That part was correct.

Wait, but the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ. Wait, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu], which is made from gamma matrices. Gamma matrices are dimensionless. So σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ is (3/2) * (3/2) = 9/4? Or wait, ψ̄ is (3/2), and ψ is (3/2), so multiplied together, 3/2 *3/2 = 9/4, yes. Then multiplied
