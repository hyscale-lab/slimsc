Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about reacting a specific epoxide with an organocuprate. Hmm, I remember that epoxides reacting with nucleophiles usually involve some kind of ring-opening. Oh right, organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and they attack epoxides in a specific way.

The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Wait, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane... that means it's a norbornane structure, right? Norbornane is a bicyclic structure with two rings, a five-membered and a three-membered bridge. The 7-oxa part means there's an oxygen in the bridge, so it's an epoxide.

So the epoxide is part of this norbornane system. Now, when you react an epoxide with an organocuprate, like Me2CuLi, the cuprate acts as a nucleophile (Nu). I remember that in epoxide ring opening, the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon because the more substituted epoxide would have more strain if the nucleophile adds there. But wait, in disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile adds.

Wait, let me think. In disubstituted epoxides, each carbon of the epoxide is connected to two carbons (like in a cyclopropane ring). So when the nucleophile attacks,
