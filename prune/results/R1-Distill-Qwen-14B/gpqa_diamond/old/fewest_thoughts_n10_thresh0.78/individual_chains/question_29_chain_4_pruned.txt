Okay, so I have this question about barley and gene mutations. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and found changes in the first exon. The goal is to find which mutation will eliminate the compound.

The intact gene and the mutants are given. I need to look for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. Since the anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by the gene, a mutation that disrupts the gene's coding sequence would probably stop the compound's production.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene.

Intact:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact, I see that the third codon is different. Intact is TTT, which is Phe. Mutant1 is TTC, which is also Phe. Wait, no, wait: Let me check. The first part: the first few nucleotides.

Wait, the first line for intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT … TGA.

Mutant1 is ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGC … TGA.

Wait, let's look at the first part. The intact gene starts with ATG TTT CTC... So that's Methionine, Phe, Leu.

Mutant1's sequence is ATG TTC TAC... So Methionine, Phe, Tyr. So the second codon is TTC (Phe) same as TTT (Phe). Wait, no, wait: TTT is Phe, TTC is also Phe. So that's a silent mutation. Then the third codon in the intact is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant1 it's TAC (Tyr). So that's a change in the amino acid.

Wait, let me make sure. So the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant1 it's TAC (Tyr). So the amino acid changes from Leu to Tyr. That's a missense mutation. Not a frameshift or a stop codon, though. So the gene product would have a different amino acid, but the rest of the protein could still be made.

Mutant2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
First few nucleotides: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...
Intact was ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...

So the first codon is same (ATG: Met), second TTC (Phe) same as TTT (Phe). Third codon: TAA in mutant2 vs TCT in intact. Wait, let's check.

Wait, the intact's third codon is CTC (Leu). Mutant2's third codon is TAA. Wait, TAA is a stop codon. Oh! So in Mutant2, after the second codon (Phe), the third codon is TAA, which is a stop signal. That would cause the translation to stop early. So the protein would be truncated. If this happens in the middle of the gene, the resulting protein might be nonfunctional. That could disrupt the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The initial part: Intact is ATG TTT CTC...

Mutant2 is ATG TTC TAA. So the first two codons are same, third is TAA. So the third codon in mutant2 would be TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would be much shorter. If this gene is responsible for the compound, a truncated protein might not function. So this could be a candidate.

Mutant3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Looking at the beginning: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC
