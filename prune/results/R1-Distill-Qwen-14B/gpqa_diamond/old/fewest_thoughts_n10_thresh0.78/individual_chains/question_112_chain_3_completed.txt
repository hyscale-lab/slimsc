Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I remember that when dealing with quantum states, probabilities are related to the squared magnitudes of the coefficients in the state vector.

The given state is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, so it's a two-level system, probably spin-1/2 since up and down are spin states. But the operator A isn't the usual spin operator; it's given with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait. So the matrix for A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2. So that would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, no, wait. The problem says Aij = ħ/2 if i is different from j. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2. So yes, the matrix is:

[ 0      ħ/2  ]
[ ħ/2    0   ]

Wait, but that's a 2x2 matrix. So that's a spin-flip operator maybe? Or perhaps it's proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (ħ/2) times X.

So the operator A is (ħ/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix. Because the diagonal elements are zero, and off-diagonal are 1. So yeah, that makes sense.

Now, the state |alpha> is given as a linear combination of |up> and |down>. But wait, the first part of the question is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A. Oh, right, because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator, and the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the projection onto each eigenstate.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of operator A. Because the measurement probabilities depend on how |alpha> is expressed in terms of those eigenstates.

Wait, but A has the same form as sigma_x, so its eigenstates should be the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x. Let me recall: the eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So for operator A, which is (ħ/2) sigma_x, the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the measurement probabilities are the square of the inner product between |alpha> and each eigenstate |+x> and |−x>.

But wait, first I need to normalize |alpha>, because the given state is proportional to that combination. The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2−i) for |down>. Let me find the normalization constant.

The normalization factor is 1/sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2), where a is (1+i) and b is (2−i).

Compute |a|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1 = 2. Because |1+i|² = 1^2 +1^2 = 2.

|b|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. Because |2−i|² is (2)^2 + (−1)^2 =4+1=5.

So the denominator is sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> all divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to find the probability of each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, I can compute the inner product between |alpha> and each eigenstate, and then take the square of the absolute value.

Let me compute the inner product with |+x> first.

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product < +x | alpha > is:

[ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> / sqrt(7) ]

Which equals (1+i)/sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) + (2−i)/sqrt(2)*sqrt(7).

Wait, no, more correctly:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2−i) <down|up> ] / sqrt(7) ?

Wait no, maybe I should approach this as:

Compute the inner product:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ]

Because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so when you take the inner product with |alpha>, which is (a|up> + b|down>), it's (a + b)/sqrt(2), but considering normalization.

Wait, let me compute < up | alpha > and < down | alpha > first.

< up | alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), because |alpha> is (1+i)|up>/sqrt(7) + ... .

Similarly, < down | alpha> is (2−i)/sqrt(7).

So < +x | alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2−i)/sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2) )

= [ (1+i + 2 −i ) / sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify numerator: 1+2 is 3, i -i cancels, so numerator is 3.

So < +x | alpha> = 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is |< +x | alpha>|² = (9)/(14).

Similarly, for |−x>, the eigenstate is (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < −x | alpha> = ( <up|alpha> - <down|alpha> ) / sqrt(2)

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2−i)/sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)

= [ (1 +i −2 +i ) / sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)

= [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)

So the absolute value squared is [ (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) ] multiplied by its conjugate.

So | (-1 +2i) |^2 is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 )=1+4=5. So |<−x | alpha> |^2 = 5/(14).

Wait, because (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))^2 is 14, so denominator is 14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14?

Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, which are close to these values. But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the inner products. Let me recompute.

Wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So,

< +x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2−i)/sqrt(7) ].

So inside the brackets, (1+i +2−i) = 3, so 3/sqrt(7).

Multiply by 1/sqrt(2): 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) = 3/sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is (9)/(14). So probability for +x is 9/14 ≈ 0.6428.

For |−x>, the eigenstate is (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So <−x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> − <down|alpha> ].

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) − (2−i)/sqrt(7) ].

Inside the brackets: (1+i −2 +i) = (-1 + 2i).

So [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(7).

Multiply by 1/sqrt(2): (-1 +2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is |(-1 +2i)|² divided by 14.

|(-1 +2i)|² is (1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1+4=5. So 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571, which would correspond to about 0.64 and 0.36. So looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, let me check the other parts of the question. The problem also asks for the average value of operator A.

The average value <A> is the expectation value of A in the state |alpha>, which is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is given as (ħ/2) sigma_x, and |alpha> is in the z-basis, perhaps it's easier to compute using the expectation value of sigma_x.

The expectation value of sigma_x is <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Wait, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so its matrix elements are:

sigma_x |up> = |down>, sigma_x |down> = |up>.

So <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down| ] * sigma_x [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Because sigma_x = |up><down| + |down><up|.

So <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = <alpha| up><down| alpha> + <alpha| down><up| alpha>.

Compute each term:

First term: <alpha| up> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and <down| alpha> is (2−i)/sqrt(7).

So the first term is [(1+i)(2−i)] / (7).

Second term: <alpha| down> is (2−i)/sqrt(7), and <up| alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7).

So the second term is [(2−i)(1+i)] / (7).

So sum the two terms:

(1+i)(2−i) + (2−i)(1+i) all over 7.

Compute (1+i)(2−i):

1*2 +1*(-i) +i*2 +i*(-i) = 2 −i +2i −i^2.

i^2 = -1 so becomes 2 +i +1 = 3 +i.

Similarly, (2−i)(1+i) = same as above, 3 +i.

So sum is (3 +i) + (3 +i) = 6 + 2i.

So <sigma_x> = (6 +2i)/7.

Wait, but sigma_x has eigenvalues ±1, so the expectation value is (6 +2i)/7.

Wait, but that can't be right because the expectation value of a Hermitian operator should be real. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, when I compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>, perhaps I missed something. Let me think again.

Wait, sigma_x is Hermitian, so its expectation value must be real. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me try another approach. Compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Another way: sigma_x is a matrix, so compute the expectation value as the sum over the matrix elements in the computational basis.

|alpha> = [ a, b ]^T where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2−i)/sqrt(7).

So sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So <sigma_x> = [ a*, b* ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [a; b ].

Which is (a* * 0 * a) + (a* * 1 * b) + (b* * 1 * a) + (b* * 0 * b).

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

The expectation value is [a*, b*] multiplied by sigma_x multiplied by [a; b].

So sigma_x * [a; b] = [b; a].

Then [a*, b*] [b; a] = a* b + b* a.

Which is 2 Re(a* b).

So <sigma_x> = 2 Re( a* b ).

Compute a* = (1 - i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7.

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 −i −2i + i².

i² is -1, so 2 −3i −1 = 1 −3i.

So a* b = (1−3i)/7.

The real part is (1)/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2*(1/7) )= 2/7.

So the expectation value of sigma_x is 2/7.

Since operator A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, the expectation value of A is (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says the average is ħ/7. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So option A would fit.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average ħ/7. So that's consistent.

But wait, the probabilities I computed earlier were 9/14 and 5/14. 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 ≈ 0.357, which is about 0.36. So that matches.

So the correct option is A.


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the same as those of the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{| \uparrow \rangle + | \downarrow \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{| \uparrow \rangle - | \downarrow \rangle}{\sqrt{2}},
\]

with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \), compute the normalization factor:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are determined by the squared magnitudes of the inner products \( \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \) and \( \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \). Compute these inner products:

\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle + \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle \right),
\]

where:

\[
\langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Substituting:

\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{3}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) is:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6428.
\]

Similarly, for \( |-x\rangle \):

\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle - \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle \right),
\]

\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( |-x\rangle \) is:

\[
P(-x) = \left| \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \frac{|-1+2i|^2}{14} = \frac{(-1)^2 + (2)^2}{14} = \frac{1+4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), which match the first part of option A.

Next, calculate the average value of \( A \), which is the expectation value \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle \). Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \alpha| \sigma_x |\alpha\rangle = 2 \, \text{Re} \left( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle^* \right).
\]

Compute \( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle^* \):

\[
\langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle^* = \frac{2+i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

\[
\langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle^* = \frac{(1+i)(2+i)}{7} = \frac{2+i+2i+i^2}{7} = \frac{2+3i-1}{7} = \frac{1+3i}{7}.
\]

The real part is \( \frac{1}{7} \), so:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

This matches the third part of option A. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
