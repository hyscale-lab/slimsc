Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the question is about planets transiting and occulting around a star. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

So, the setup: there's a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. There's a first planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. Its orbital period is 3 days. Then there's a second planet, bigger—2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have so that it both transits and occults. Both are in the same orbital plane, circular orbits.

Wait, what's transit and occultation? Oh right, transit is when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked—so we don't see that either. But for both events to happen, the alignment has to be just right.

I remember that for a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be edge-on (or close enough) such that from our perspective, it passes directly in front of the star. Similarly, occultation requires that the planet is behind the star as seen from Earth. So the orbital periods must be such that the two events happen in a way that the alignment occurs when the planet is both in front and behind.

Wait, but how does orbital period come into play here? Oh, right, the orbital period affects how often they transit and when they'd be in certain positions relative to the star and us.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum orbital period of the second planet. So perhaps it's about the orbital periods of the two planets and their synodic periods? Or maybe the condition that their orbital periods are such that they align in these specific ways.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Both planets are in the same orbital plane, which is good for transits. The first planet transits, so its orbital plane is edge-on. The second planet would also need to be in the same plane for it to transit, which it is. But to have occultation, the second planet must pass behind the star, which requires that the star is larger than some size relative to the planet's orbit.

Wait, no. The occultation happens when the planet is behind the star. For that to be visible, the planet must be in a position where it's in the line of sight behind the star. So, the star must block the planet from view. But the star's size matters because if the planet is too far, the star can't block it.

Wait, no, the distance is about the orbital radius. For the planet to be occulted, the planet must pass directly behind the star from our viewpoint. So, the orbital plane must be aligned so that the line of sight allows that.

But more importantly, for the planet to be occulted, the planet must be within the star's apparent disk. So the star's angular size as seen from the planet's position must be large enough that when the planet is directly behind the star, the planet is within the star's disk.

Wait, perhaps another approach. For a planet to be occulted, the planet must be in the same line of sight but on the opposite side of the star. So, the planet's orbit must be such that when it's on the far side of the star, it's aligned as seen from Earth.

But how does that affect the orbital period? Maybe the orbital periods must be such that the two planets are in a configuration where the second can be occulted. Hmm, maybe the second planet's orbital period has to be shorter than the first's? Or longer?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the conditions for occultation. The planet must pass directly behind the star, so the planet's orbital distance must be such that when it's behind the star, it's within the star's apparent size from Earth. But that's not directly about the planet's orbital period, but more about the orbital radius.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum orbital period of the second planet. So perhaps if the second planet is too far out, its orbital period is longer, and it won't pass behind the star often enough, but maybe that's not the issue here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem relates to the alignment of the two planets' orbital periods. Maybe their orbital periods need to be such that the alignment for transit and occultation can happen. Maybe the second planet's period must be a harmonic of the first planet's period.

Wait, but the first planet has a period of 3 days. The options are all in days as well. Looking at the options, they're much longer than 3 days. So maybe it's not about being harmonics but about the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the second planet must be close enough to the star that when it's in the same line of sight as the star from Earth, it can pass both in front (transit) and behind (occultation). The size of the star and the planet's orbital radius determine whether it can do so.

Wait, the star's radius is 1.5 times the Sun's. But the planet is orbiting the star, so the star's radius is much smaller than the planet's orbital radius. Hmm, but for the planet to transit, the planet must pass directly in front of the star. The impact parameter is 0.2 for the first planet. Impact parameter is the distance (in units of the star's radius) from the center of the star that the planet passes when transiting. A lower impact parameter means a closer approach to the star's center—so a transit that's more central.

But how does that impact the possibility of an occultation for the second planet? Hmm, maybe not much directly. Let me think about the occultation. When the planet is behind the star, the planet's position relative to the star's disk matters. The planet must be within the star's apparent disk from our point of view. So the star's angular size as seen from Earth and the planet's position must allow that.

Wait, but the star's size is fixed. So for the second planet to be occulted, its orbital radius must be such that when it's behind the star, the planet is within the star's disk as observed from Earth. But the star's disk as seen from Earth is determined by its actual size and distance from us.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Maybe the key is the Hill sphere or the Roche limit, but that might not be it.

Wait, perhaps the second planet can undergo both transit and occultation only if its orbital period is such that its orbit is within a certain range relative to the star's size and the first planet. Alternatively, maybe the second planet must be in a position that allows for both events, which relates to the planet's orbital radius.

Wait, another thought: For a planet to transit, the inclination of its orbit must be such that it's edge-on. The same applies for the second planet. But beyond that, for an occultation to occur, the planet must be on the opposite side of the star from our viewpoint. So the orbital distance must allow that. The planet's orbital radius must be such that when it's in the far side of the star, the planet is within the star's apparent disk.

Wait, but perhaps that's more of a question of whether the planet can be seen in occultation. The occultation occurs when the planet is behind the star, so we can't see the planet's light. But for that to happen, the planet must be within the star's disk as seen from Earth. So the star's angular size from Earth must be larger than the planet's apparent size when viewed from Earth.

Wait, but the star's angular size is determined by its actual size and its distance from us. So the star is 1.5 times the Sun's radius. But the distance to the star isn't given, so maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, let's think about the transit. The transit requires that the planet passes in front of the star. The impact parameter is 0.2, which is the distance from the center of the star (in units of the star's radius) where the planet transits. So for a planet with impact parameter b, the minimum distance from the center is (b * R_star). So for the first planet, R_star is 1.5 R_sun. But I'm not sure if that helps for the second planet.

Wait, perhaps the key is that both planets are orbiting the same star, so their orbital periods are determined by Kepler's third law. But how does that tie into transit and occultation?

Wait, Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (for a circular orbit, it's just the radius). So P^2 = (4π²/GM) * a^3, where M is the mass of the star. Since the star's mass isn't given, maybe we can relate the two planets' orbital periods using Kepler's law.

So the first planet has a period P1 = 3 days, radius a1. The second planet has period P2 and radius a2. So (P2/P1)^2 = (a2/a1)^3.

But how does the radius of the planets come into play? The planet's size affects whether it can transit or occult, but Kepler's law depends on the orbital radius, not the planet's size.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum P2 such that both transit and occultation occur. So perhaps the condition is that the second planet's orbital radius must be such that when it transits, the star is large enough to cause the transit, and when it's behind, the star is large enough to cause the occultation.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the transit and occultation events. For both to happen, the planet must be in the same orbital plane, which they are, and their orbital periods must allow for the necessary alignment.

Wait, perhaps it's about the synodic period—the time between similar configurations as seen from Earth. For the first planet, transiting every 3 days. If the second planet has a longer period, the time between transits of the first and second might not allow for both events. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum orbital period is determined by the condition that the second planet must be able to both transit and be occulted, which relates to the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, another approach: The maximum orbital period occurs when the second planet is just barely able to transit and occult. For transit, the planet must pass in front of the star, which requires that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on. For occultation, the planet must pass behind the star, which requires that the planet's orbital distance is such that when it's on the far side, it's within the star's disk.

Wait, but the star's disk is determined by its radius and the distance from us. Without knowing the distance, perhaps it's not the right way. Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the second planet must be in a position where it can pass in front and behind the star, which would mean that its orbital distance allows for both events.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the condition that the two planets are in a configuration where one's orbit is a multiple of the other's, allowing for mutual eclipses. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's think about the star's radius. The star has a radius of 1.5 R_sun. The first planet has Earth's radius, so when it transits, the impact parameter is 0.2. The transit depth is (R_planet / R_star)^2. But how does that tie into the second planet?

The second planet has a radius of 2.5 R_earth. For it to transit, the star must be larger than the planet, which it is—since 2.5 R_earth is much smaller than 1.5 R_sun (since Sun is about 109 R_earth, so 1.5 is 163.5 R_earth. So, 2.5 is much smaller than that.)

Wait, but transit isn't the main issue here. The question is about the maximum period for the second planet so that it can both transit and experience occultation.

Ah, occultation—if the planet is too far, when it's behind the star, the star might not block the planet from our view because the planet is too small compared to the star's disk. Wait, no. The star's disk is much larger, so the planet would be blocked. But perhaps the issue is the orbital radius—if the planet is too far, the star's apparent size is smaller, so the planet can't be occulted because it's outside the star's apparent disk.

Wait, but the star's apparent size is determined by its actual size and its distance from us. Since the distance isn't given, maybe we can't directly use that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the maximum orbital period where the second planet can still be within the star's Hill sphere, but I think that's more about orbital stability rather than transit/occultation.

Wait, perhaps the key is that for the planet to be occulted, the planet must lie within the star's disk when it's behind. So the planet's orbital radius can't be so large that when it's behind, it's outside the star's apparent disk.

But without knowing the distance to the star, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about the Roche limit, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The first planet transits, so its orbital period is 3 days. The second planet's orbital period must be such that both can transit and occultate.

Wait, perhaps the maximum period is when the second planet is in a 5:1 resonance with the first. Because the options are 3, 7.5, 12.5, 33.5, 37.5 days. Hmm, 7.5 is 3 * 2.5, but that might not be it.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum period is determined by the requirement that the second planet's orbital radius is such that when it's behind the star, it's within the star's disk. So the star's radius must be larger than the planet's radius, but that's not it because the star is 1.5 R_sun, which is way larger than Earth.

Wait, another thought: The transit depth is (R_p / R_s)^2. For the second planet, it's (2.5 R_e / 1.5 R_sun)^2. Since R_sun is about 109 R_e, so 1.5 R_sun is about 163.5 R_e. So R_p is 2.5 R_e. So (2.5 / 163.5) squared is very small, about 0.00024, which is why the transit depth is small but detectable. But how does that help with the period?

Wait, perhaps the maximum period is when the second planet's orbital radius is such that it's just possible for it to both transit and occult. So, for transit, the planet must pass in front of the star, and for occultation, it must pass behind.

Wait, but the orbital radius might not directly affect whether the planet can pass behind. It's more about the orbital inclination.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the relative orbital periods. For both events to occur, the second planet's period must be such that it can be in the correct position relative to the first.

Wait, another approach: The first planet's orbit is such that it transits with an impact parameter. The impact parameter (b) is given by b = (distance of closest approach in star's radius units) = 0.2.

The formula for the impact parameter is b = a * sin(i), where a is the orbital radius in star radii, and i is the inclination. Wait, no, the formula for impact parameter is when the planet's orbit is such that it passes in front. So, perhaps the impact parameter is related to the planet's orbital radius and the inclination.

Wait, but I'm not exactly remembering the formula correctly. Let me think again. The impact parameter (b) is the distance (in units of the star's radius) from the center of the star that the planet's path comes closest. So, if b is zero, it's a central transit. For a circular orbit, the minimum distance is (R_p + R_s), but wait, no, the impact parameter is more about the geometry of the transit.

Alternatively, the impact parameter can be thought of as b = a * sin(i), where a is the semi-major axis in terms of the star's radius, and i is the inclination (90 degrees for edge-on). So, for the first planet, impact parameter is 0.2. So, a*sin(i) = 0.2.

But if the planet is in a circular orbit and edge-on (i=90), then a = 0.2 * R_star / (R_star) ? Wait, no, a is in terms of the star's radius? Or is a in actual units?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of orbital radius. Let me denote the star's radius as R_s = 1.5 R_sun. The first planet's radius R_p1 = R_earth.

The impact parameter b is given as 0.2 R_s. So, b = a1 * sin(i). Since the orbit is edge-on (transit), i=90, so sin(i)=1. Therefore, a1 = b = 0.2 R_s.

Wait, no, wait. a1 is the orbital radius, but in terms of the star's radius? Or in actual units? Hmm, perhaps I should clarify.

Wait, no, I think a1 is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, in the same units as the star's radius. So, a1 = (distance from star to planet) / R_s.

So, a1 = (distance) / (1.5 R_sun). But wait, the impact parameter is 0.2 R_s. So, a1 would be the distance from the star to the planet in terms of R_s, but perhaps I'm mixing units.

Wait, perhaps the impact parameter is given as b = (distance in front) / R_s, so for the first planet, it's 0.2 * R_s.

Thus, the orbital radius a1 (in terms of R_s) would be a1 = (distance from star to planet) / R_s. But is this connected to the impact parameter?

Wait, perhaps the impact parameter is given by b = a * sin(i), where a is the semi-major axis (in R_s units), and i is the inclination. For the first planet, i=90 degrees, so sin(i)=1, so a1 = b = 0.2.

So, the semi-major axis (a1) of the first planet is 0.2 R_s.

Wait, but Kepler's third law states that P^2 = (4π²/GM) * a^3. Since both planets are orbiting the same star, the mass M is the same. So for both planets, P^2 is proportional to a^3.

So, for the first planet, P1 = 3 days, a1 = 0.2 R_s.

For the second planet, a2 is its semi-major axis in R_s units, and P2 is its period.

So, (P2 / 3)^2 = (a2 / 0.2)^3.

But we need to find the maximum P2 such that the second planet can both transit and occult.

Wait, but what determines the maximum P2? Maybe the condition that the second planet's orbital radius is such that when it's in the same line of sight as the first planet, it can be both in front and behind.

Wait, perhaps the maximum P2 occurs when the second planet's orbital period is such that it can be in a position to transit and then, in another part of its orbit, be occulted.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum P2 is when the second planet's orbital radius is such that when it's in the same line of sight as the star, it can pass in front (transit) and behind (occultation). For this, the star's size must allow the planet to fit behind it when viewed from Earth.

Wait, but the star's size is 1.5 R_sun, and the planet's size is 2.5 R_earth. So, the star is much larger.

Wait, perhaps the maximum period occurs when the second planet's orbital radius is such that when it's at the maximum distance from the star in its orbit, it can still pass behind the star. But that doesn't directly affect the orbital period.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the maximum possible period before the second planet's orbital radius is so large that the planet cannot be occulted because it's outside the star's apparent disk when it's behind.

But without knowing the distance to the star, this is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the alignment of the two planets' orbits so that they can both transit and occult at the same time, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is that for the second planet to occult, it must be that when it's directly behind the star from our perspective, the star's disk must be large enough to block the planet.

But considering the star's size, 1.5 R_sun, which is much larger than the planet. So, the planet's position being behind the star would block it, but how does that affect the orbital period?

Wait, perhaps the maximum period is determined by the requirement that the second planet's orbit must be such that when it transits, the impact parameter is less than some value. But the impact parameter for the second planet would be different, but it's not given.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options. The options are A) ~37.5, B) ~12.5, C) ~33.5, D) ~7.5. The first planet is 3 days. So the options are much longer periods.

Hmm, perhaps the second planet's period must be longer than some value. But why?

Wait, perhaps the maximum period is when the second planet's orbital period is such that the synodic period (the time between transits of the same planet) is such that both planets can align properly. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: For the second planet to transit, it must have an orbital period such that its orbital radius is greater than the first planet's. Because the first planet is at a1=0.2 R_s, and the second would be at a2> a1. So, using Kepler's law, P2 would be longer than P1.

But the options are all longer than 3 days, so that's consistent.

But the question is about the maximum possible P2. So, perhaps the maximum occurs when the second planet's orbital radius is such that when it transits, it's as close as possible to the star's limb, causing maximum possible period.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of Kepler's law.

Using Kepler's third law: P^2 proportional to a^3.

So, P1 = 3 days, a1 = 0.2 R_s (in terms of R_s units).

For the second planet, a2 = ?

What condition determines the maximum a2? Perhaps that the star's radius must be large enough to cause both transit and occultation. But again, without knowing the distance, maybe it's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the maximum period is determined by the condition that the second planet's orbital radius is such that it can be in the same orbital plane and have a similar alignment as the first planet. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the maximum period is when the second planet's orbital radius is the same as the first's. But that would make P2 = P1, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum period is when the second planet's orbital period is such that the two planets have an orbital period ratio that allows for mutual transits and occultations. But I'm not familiar with that specific condition.

Wait, perhaps the key is the relative sizes of the planets and the star. The second planet is larger, so the transit depth would be larger, but that doesn't directly affect the period.

Another angle: For the second planet to have both a transit and an occultation, it must be that when it's in front, it transits, and when it's behind, it occults. But how does the orbital period affect this?

Wait, perhaps the time between transits and occultations would depend on the orbital period. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the maximum period such that the second planet's orbital radius is within the star's radius. But that would make a2 < 1 R_s, but with a1 = 0.2 R_s, the second planet could be further out, but how?

Wait, no, the orbital radius is much larger than the star's radius. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the maximum period is when the second planet's orbital radius is such that its orbital period is as large as possible, but it can still be in the same system. But that doesn't make sense because the system can have planets with a wide range of periods.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Hill sphere. The Hill sphere defines the region where a planet can orbit without being torn away by the star's gravity. The Hill radius is approximately R_H = a * (m_p/(3M))^(1/3), but that's for a planet's moon. However, perhaps the second planet's orbital radius can't be too large relative to the first's.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum period is when the second planet's orbital radius is such that when it's in the same line of sight as the star, it can transit and occult. But without more info, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the answer is based on the ratio of the planet's radii. The second planet is 2.5 times the first, but since the star's radius is 1.5 R_sun, which is about 163.5 R_earth, transit depth is small, but the planet's size doesn't directly affect the orbital period.

Wait, perhaps the maximum period is when the second planet's orbital radius is the same as the first's but scaled by some factor. Wait, but if the second planet is larger, it would transit deeper, but not necessarily affect the period.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the problem differently. Since the first planet has P1=3 days, and the second must have a longer period, the options suggest that 7.5 days is an option, which is 3 * 2.5. So if P2 is 7.5 days, then using Kepler's law, a2^3 = (P2/P1)^2 * a1^3.

Wait, let's compute that.

a1 = 0.2 R_s (units in R_s).

a2^3 = (7.5 /3 )^2 * (0.2)^3.

Compute 7.5 /3 = 2.5.

(2.5)^2 =6.25.

0.2^3=0.008.

So a2^3=6.25 * 0.008=0.05.

a2= cube root of 0.05 ≈ 0.368 R_s.

So a2 is 0.368 R_s, which is larger than a1=0.2 R_s. That makes sense as P2 is larger.

But how does that relate to the condition of occultation?

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum period is determined by the condition that the second planet's orbital radius must be such that when it's behind the star, it's within the star's apparent disk.

Wait, but from our point of view, the star's apparent size is about 0.5 degrees (for Sun-like stars). So the planet's apparent size must be smaller than the star's apparent size for the occultation to occur.

The planet's apparent size is (R_p / D) * (1 AU / D)^{-1}, where D is the distance to the star.

Wait, that's getting complicated because we don't know D. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum period is when the second planet's orbital radius is such that the star's apparent size as seen from the planet is larger than the planet's apparent size as seen from Earth.

Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the second planet must be in a position where it can both transit and be occulted, which would require that the star's radius is large enough relative to the planet's orbital radius and its size.

But I'm still not making progress. Maybe I should try to think of the answer based on Kepler's law and the given options.

We have P1=3 days, a1=0.2 R_s.

If we assume that the second planet must have a period such that a2 is as large as possible, but let's see what the options give.

Looking at option C: ~33.5 days.

Compute a2 for P2=33.5.

a2^3 = (33.5/3)^2 * (0.2)^3.

33.5/3 ≈ 11.1667.

11.1667 squared is approximately 124.7.

0.2^3=0.008.

a2^3 = 124.7 * 0.008 ≈ 0.998.

a2≈ cube root of 0.998≈ ~0.999 R_s.

So, a2 is almost 1 R_s, which is the star's radius.

Wait, so if the second planet's orbital radius is about 1 R_s, that would be extremely close, but possible.

But how does that relate to the occultation? The planet would need to be within the star's apparent disk when it's behind. If the orbital radius is 1 R_s, which is the same as the star's radius, the planet would be at the surface of the star when it's in that position. That's not possible because it's a planet, not a star. So perhaps 33.5 days is too long.

Wait, but perhaps the maximum period is when the second planet's orbital radius is such that when it's in the same line of sight, it's just on the edge of the star. So, perhaps a2 can't be larger than the star's radius. But that would mean a2 is limited by the star's radius, but the star's radius is 1.5 R_sun, which is way larger than the orbit.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to think about it differently.

Wait, another approach: For a planet to transit, the orbital inclination must be 90 degrees (edge-on). For it to also be occulted, the planet must also pass behind the star. So, the same inclination allows both events, but the timing depends on the orbital periods.

Perhaps the maximum period is when the second planet's orbital period is such that when it transits, the first planet is in a position to cause an occultation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum period is when the second planet's orbital radius is as large as possible, but still allowing for both events. But without a constraint on the distance, this doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute for each option and see which makes sense.

Taking option C: 33.5 days.

Using Kepler's law, (33.5/3)^2 = (a2/0.2)^3.

So, (11.1667)^2 = (a2/0.2)^3.

11.1667^2 ≈ 124.7.

So, (a2/0.2)^3 = 124.7 → a2^3 = 124.7 * (0.2)^3 = 124.7 * 0.008 ≈ 0.9976.

a2 ≈ cube root(0.9976) ≈ 0.999 R_s.

So, the second planet's orbital radius is ~1 R_s, which is the same as the star's radius.

But that would place the planet's orbit right at the star's surface. That doesn't make sense because planets have to orbit outside the star. So perhaps this is the maximum possible a2.

But why would the maximum a2 be when the planet is at the star's radius? Because beyond that, the star's gravity would not allow the planet to orbit. But in reality, the Hill sphere defines the region where a planet can orbit without being ripped away, but I don't have the star's mass.

Alternatively, perhaps this is the correct approach. So, the maximum a2 is when a2 is as large as possible, so the period would be maximum when a2 is as large as possible.

But in this case, a2 can't be larger than the star's radius, because otherwise, the planet would be inside the star, which is impossible.

So, if a2 is maximum at R_s = 1.5 R_sun, but wait, a1 is 0.2 R_s, and a2 would be 1 R_s, which is less than 1.5 R_sun. So perhaps it's possible.

Wait, but the star's radius is 1.5 R_sun. The planet's orbital radius is a2 = 1 R_s, which is 1 * 1.5 R_sun = 1.5 R_sun. So the planet's orbit is just at the star's surface. That's not possible because the planet would be on the star's surface, but perhaps in reality, the star's radius is 1.5 R_sun, and the planet's orbit is a2 in the same units, so a2 would be 1, which is 1 R_s = 1.5 R_sun. That's possible, but the planet would be very close.

But regardless, using Kepler's law, the period for a2=1 R_s is P2= cube root( ( (1 / 0.2)^3 ) * (3 days)^2 ) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let's redo the calculation.

From Kepler's law: (P2/P1)^2 = (a2/a1)^3.

So, (P2/3)^2 = (a2/0.2)^3.

If a2 is maximum, say a2_max = 1 R_s.

Then,

(P2/3)^2 = (1/0.2)^3 = (5)^3 = 125.

So,

(P2/3)^2 = 125 → P2/3 = sqrt(125) ≈ 11.18.

P2 ≈ 3 * 11.18 ≈ 33.54 days.

So that's approximately 33.5 days, which is option C.

So, the maximum possible period for the second planet is when its orbital radius is 1 R_s, giving a period of ~33.5 days.

Therefore, the answer should be option C.


To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that allows it to exhibit both transit and occultation events, we analyze the problem using Kepler's third law and the given conditions.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**: The star has a radius of \( R_s = 1.5 R_\odot \).
2. **First Planet**: Radius \( R_{p1} = R_\oplus \), orbital period \( P_1 = 3 \, \text{days} \), and transit impact parameter \( b = 0.2 \, R_s \). The semi-major axis of the first planet's orbit is \( a_1 = b = 0.2 \, R_s \).
3. **Second Planet**: Radius \( R_{p2} = 2.5 R_\oplus \), circular orbit, and the same orbital plane as the first planet. The goal is to find the maximum orbital period \( P_2 \) such that it can both transit and occult.

### Analysis:
- For the second planet to transit and occult, its orbital radius \( a_2 \) must be such that it aligns with the star's disk from Earth's perspective. The maximum \( a_2 \) occurs when the planet's orbital radius is as large as possible while still allowing both events.
- Using Kepler's third law:  
  \[
  \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^3
  \]
  Substituting \( P_1 = 3 \, \text{days} \) and \( a_1 = 0.2 \, R_s \), we can solve for \( a_2 \) and \( P_2 \).

### Calculation:
Assume the maximum \( a_2 \) is \( 1 \, R_s \) (the star's radius). Substituting into Kepler's law:
\[
\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.2}\right)^3
\]
\[
\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = 5^3 = 125
\]
\[
\frac{P_2}{3} = \sqrt{125} \approx 11.18
\]
\[
P_2 \approx 3 \times 11.18 \approx 33.5 \, \text{days}
\]

### Conclusion:
The maximum orbital period of the second planet that allows it to both transit and occult is approximately **33.5 days**, corresponding to option C.
