Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question says: In a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents on r.

Hmm, I think I need to relate parallax to distance because the question is about distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. The formula I remember is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if d increases, plx decreases.

Wait, but in this case, they're talking about 1/(plx)^5. Let me write down the relationship. So plx is 1/d, meaning d = 1/plx. So substituting that into the equation for N: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that.

So 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is equal to d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I think it's about the differential—like the number per unit distance.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the number of stars as a function of distance. Let's think again. If N ∝ d^5, then for a small change in distance, the change in N would be the derivative dN/dr. So let's model this.

Let me formalize it. Let’s say N = k * d^5, where k is a constant. Then the number of stars per unit distance would be dN/dr, which is the derivative of d^5 with respect to d. The derivative of d^5 is 5d^4. So dN/dr ∝ d^4.

Wait, but the question is phrased a bit differently. It says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So perhaps it's asking for the rate of change of N with respect to r, which is the derivative dN/dr.

So if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr = 5 d^4. But since d is distance, and
