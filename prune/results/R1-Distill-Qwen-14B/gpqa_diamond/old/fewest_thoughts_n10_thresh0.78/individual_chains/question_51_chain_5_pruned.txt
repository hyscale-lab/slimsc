Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics here.

Alright, let's start by visualizing the setup. There's a conducting sphere with radius R, and it's grounded. So, grounding means that the sphere is connected to the Earth, which implies that any excess charge on the sphere can flow to the ground. But wait, if the sphere is conducting and grounded, does that mean its potential is zero? Because in electrostatics, a grounded conductor has a potential of zero, right?

Then there's a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of this sphere. Wait, wait, I think I need to clarify: is d the distance from the center of the sphere, so the distance from the charge to the sphere's surface would be (d - R) if d > R, or (R - d) if inside? But since the sphere is grounded, I think the charge on it will adjust accordingly.

But wait, the charge q is placed outside the sphere. So when the charge q is placed near the sphere, the induced charges on the sphere will rearrange. But since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges would adjust such that the sphere remains at zero potential. Hmm, maybe.

I remember that the potential on the surface of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is the same everywhere. So if the sphere is grounded, its potential must be zero because the ground is at zero potential.

Now, the potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charges. But since the sphere is grounded and conducting, any induced charges would be on the surface, and the sphere's potential is zero.

Wait, but the charge q is a point charge. So the potential energy of the system would be the work done in bringing this charge q from infinity to a point d away from the sphere's center. But I also have to consider the induced charges on the sphere. Hmm.

Wait, I think the key here is that the sphere is a conductor, so the induced charges will reside on its surface. For a conducting sphere, the potential due to external charges is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the
