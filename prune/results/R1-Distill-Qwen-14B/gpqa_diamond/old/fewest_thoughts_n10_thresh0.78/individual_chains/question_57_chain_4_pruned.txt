Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, I remember something about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts from my studies.

The given phase shifts are δ₀=90 degrees, δ₁=67 degrees, δ₂=55 degrees, δ₃=30 degrees, and δ₄=13 degrees. Oh wait, but the question says to ignore the rest, so I think that means only these five are considered, and higher ones are zero or negligible.

I think the formula for the scattering amplitude comes into play here. Oh wait, right! The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the partial waves. Each partial wave contributes a term involving the spherical harmonics and the phase shifts. But since the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which I think relates to the forward direction, maybe θ=0 degrees.

Wait, the incident beam direction is probably at an angle θ=0, so the direction is along the beam. So the question is asking for the imaginary part of f(0).

I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed as a sum from l=0 to some maximum of ( (2l +1)/(2k) ) [ sin(δ_l - lθ) / sin(δ_l) ] e^{i(lθ)} ), but I'm not sure about the exact terms. Alternatively, another expression comes to mind involving the sum of e^{2iδ_l} multiplied by some terms.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l(cosθ)

where P_l are the Legendre polynomials, and k is related to the momentum. But wait, the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0. So P_l(cos0)=P_l(1)=1 for all l, right? Because the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for any l. So the sum simplifies a lot when θ=0.
