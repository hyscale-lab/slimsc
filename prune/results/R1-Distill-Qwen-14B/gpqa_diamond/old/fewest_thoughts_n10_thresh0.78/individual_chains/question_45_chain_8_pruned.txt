Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined and have quantized energy levels. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles, so I think their spin has to do with their possible states but maybe not directly with the energy levels here.

The setup is for four particles in a 1D infinite well of length L. The task is to find the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states. The energy given is E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each energy level is a multiple of this E.

Wait, I remember that the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = n² E, where n is a positive integer (like 1, 2, 3, ...). So each particle's energy depends on its quantum number n.

But wait, these are four identical fermions, right? Because spin-1/2 particles are fermions, and they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Which means that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. So each fermion's state is defined by its quantum numbers, including spin.

But in a 1D box, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n, right? But wait, spin is also a factor. So each n can have a certain number of possible spin states that can be occupied. For spin-1/2 particles, each can have spin up or down. So for each n, there are two possible spin states.

So when we place four fermions into this well, we have to fill up the available states according to the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each n can hold two particles at most (since two spin states).

So the ground state would have the lowest possible n's filled. Let's think about the filling order.

Each energy level is E_n = n² E.

So the ground state (lowest energy) would be when the particles are in the lowest possible n's, each with their spin states filled.

Let's think about how to arrange four fermions.

The first level, n=1: can hold 2 particles (spin up and down). So two go here.

The next level, n=2: another 2 particles. But wait, four particles in total. So n=1 and n=2 would each hold two particles each? Wait, no, n=1 holds two, and then n=2 holds the other two? But wait, the total number of particles is four.

Wait, but in the ground state, the particles would fill the lowest possible n's. So two in n=1, and two in n=2? Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of each particle's state.

Wait, each particle's quantum state is determined by its n and spin. So for each n, there are two possible states (spin up and down). So for four particles, each n can only take two particles, but with multiple n's.

So the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins). Then the next two go into n=2 (each with opposite spins). So the four particles would be in n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So the total energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

Each particle in n
