Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm.

Alright, the first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So, when a ketone reacts with cyanide, what usually happens? I think that's a nucleophilic addition. So, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, right? The ketone has a carbonyl group, so adding NaCN (which provides CN- as a nucleophile) should form a cyanohydrin.

But wait, what about the conditions? So, for cyanohydrin formation, we typically use a strong acid as a catalyst. Because the reaction is acid-catalyzed. So, H3O+ or something like sulfuric acid. Because the acid helps in protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group. So, the reagent A should be an acid. Looking at the options, A could be H3O+ or NaHSO3 maybe?

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I remember it's used in the formation of bisulfite adducts, but maybe also as an acid source because HSO3- is a weak acid. But in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin, which requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl. So, A is probably an acid.

Looking at the options, A in option A is H3O+, and option D's A is NaHSO3. So, which is correct? I think H3O+ is the more direct acid here. But wait, sometimes NaHSO3 can also act as an acid because HSO3- can donate a proton, but it's a weaker acid than H3O+.

Moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. That's a bit of a mouthful. The structure has a benzyl group attached to a phenyl ring, then a hydroxy group and a nitrile. So, the molecule is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile with a benzyl substituent.

The reagent B is either H2O or
