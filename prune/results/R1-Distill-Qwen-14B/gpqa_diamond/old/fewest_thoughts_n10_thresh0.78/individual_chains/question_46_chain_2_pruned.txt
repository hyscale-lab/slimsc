Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions, which involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. 

The compound given is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, let's draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at the first carbon. So, it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, no, wait. Let's count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. Position 1 is the first carbon, so the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, wait, let me count again: position 1 is double bond, so structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? No, because pent has five carbons. Let me see: 1,2,3,4,5. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂? Wait, that's four carbons. Oh wait, maybe I'm not counting right. Oh, wait, wait: 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH
