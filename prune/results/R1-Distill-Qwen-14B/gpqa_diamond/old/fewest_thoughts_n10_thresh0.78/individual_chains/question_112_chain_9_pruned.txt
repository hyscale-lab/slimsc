Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state. Because when you have a quantum state, it has to be normalized so that the probabilities add up to 1.

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional, so maybe I need to compute the normalization factor. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal eigenstates of the spin-z operator. So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), respectively.

The normalization condition is that the inner product of |alpha> with itself should be 1. So |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 = 1, where c1 and c2 are the coefficients. Let's compute that. |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. |2-i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5. So total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next, the problem asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise.

Wait, so the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me think: for a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2. So A_12 and A_21 are ħ/2, and the diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are zero. So matrix A looks like:
[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Hmm, I remember that when an operator has such a form, it's often related to the Pauli matrices. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A might be proportional to sigma_x. Let me check: yes, because sigma_x has the same structure. So A = (ħ/2) sigma_x.

Wait, but sigma_x is a Hermitian matrix, so A is Hermitian as well. And since it's Hermitian, its eigenstates form a basis for the Hilbert space. So when the problem mentions the eigenstates of the operator A, those are the states we're to project |alpha> onto to find the probabilities.

So, the eigenvalues of A are what? For sigma_x, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So for A = (ħ/2) sigma_x, the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ħ/2 and -ħ/2. But for the probabilities, each eigenstate corresponds to a possible outcome, and the probability is the square of the amplitude in that eigenstate.

Wait, but the operator A is given, and we need to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate. So, we need to find the eigenstates of A, then compute the projection of |alpha> onto each of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the eigenvectors of A. Let me try that. For the matrix A given above, the eigen
