Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, but in quantum mechanics states are supposed to be normalized, right? So I should check if this state is normalized. 

To normalize, I think I need to calculate the inner product of the state with itself. The state vector is a column vector: [-1, 2, 1]^T. The inner product is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2. That's 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh wait, so the norm squared is 6. That means the state isn't normalized. So, maybe the vector needs to be divided by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector. Because in QM, states are usually represented as unit vectors. So I'll keep that in mind for later.

The observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down matrix P as given. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, so P looks like this:

0      1/sqrt(2)  0
1/sqrt(2) 0      1/sqrt(2)
0      1/sqrt(2)  0

Wait, I should probably confirm if this is a Hermitian matrix because observables must be Hermitian. Let's see. For matrix P, the (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (2,1) element is also 1/sqrt(2). The (1,3) and (3,1) are zero. The (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), and (3,2) is 1/sqrt(2). So all the off-diagonal elements are real and symmetric. The diagonal elements are zero, which are real. So yes, P is Hermitian. Good.

The question is asking for the probability that measuring observable P will yield 0. So I need to find the probability that the eigenvalue 0 is measured.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I think the process involves finding the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then projecting the given state onto these eigenvectors. The sum of the squares of the absolute values of these projections will give the probability.

But first, perhaps I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, let's think. The state is given as a vector, but I should first normalize it. So the state vector is ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is ψ_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * ψ.

Wait, but in the measurement, do I need to use the normalized state? Because probabilities depend on the projection, which requires the state to be normalized. So yes, I should proceed with the normalized state.

So the normalized state is:
ψ = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ]

Now, to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then compute the inner product of ψ with each of these eigenvectors, square the absolute value, and sum them all.

Alternatively, another approach is to note that the expectation value of P is given by <ψ| P |ψ>, but that might not directly help with the probability unless I know all the eigenvalues.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the eigenvalues of P. Let's find them. The matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it again:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix (P - λ I) is:

[-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]

Calculating the determinant:

| -λ       1/√2        0     |
|1/√2     -λ      1/√2   |
| 0        1/√2     -λ    |

Hmm, calculating 3x3 determinant. Let me expand along the first row since it has a zero which might make it easier.

The determinant is:
-λ * det( submatrix ) 
- 1/√2 * det( submatrix )
+ 0 * det( ... )

Wait, the expansion would be:
-λ * determinant of the 2x2 matrix:
[ -λ, 1/√2 ]
[1/√2, -λ ]

Minus 1/√2 multiplied by the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:
[1/√2, 1/√2 ]
[0,    -λ   ]

Plus 0 multiplied by something, which is zero.

So let's compute each part.

First term: (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ]
= (-λ) * [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: (-1/√2) * determinant of [1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ]
= (-1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)*0 ) ]
= (-1/√2) * ( -λ /√2 )
= (-1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (λ) / 2

Wait, wait, let me recheck that. The determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = (-λ/√2).

So the second term is (-1/√2) * (-λ/√2) ) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) = λ/(2).

So putting it all together, the determinant is:

-λ*(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) ) = 0

So the equation is:

-λ*(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) = 0

Let me expand this:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0
-λ³ + λ = 0

Factor out λ:

λ*(-λ² +1 ) = 0

So the solutions are λ=0, or -λ² +1=0 → λ²=1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the equation is -λ³ + λ = 0. Let's see: 

-λ³ + λ = 0 → λ( -λ² +1 ) =0 → λ=0, or λ²=1 → λ=1 or λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. So P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.

Therefore, the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.

So the probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to 0 in the state ψ.

So I need to find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

So for λ=0, the equation (P - 0 I) x =0 → P x =0.

So let's write the equations:

From P's rows:

Row 1: (0)x + (1/√2) y + 0 z = 0 → y = 0

Row2: (1/√2) x + 0 y + (1/√2) z = 0 → x + z =0 → x = -z

Row3: 0 x + (1/√2) y + 0 z =0 → y=0

So from row1 and row3, y=0.

From row2, x = -z.

So the eigenvectors are of the form x = a, y=0, z= -a. So the eigenvectors are a * [1; 0; -1].

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by [1;0;-1].

So the eigenvector (normalized) is [1;0;-1] divided by its norm.

The norm of [1;0;-1] is sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1;0;-1].

So the eigenvector is |v0> = [1;0;-1]/sqrt(2).

Now, the state ψ is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1; 2; 1].

So to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to compute |<v0 | ψ>|^2.

Compute the inner product <v0 | ψ>.

v0 is [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2), and ψ is [-1, 2,1]/sqrt(6).

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) [1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ]

Simplify the numerator:

1*(-1) = -1, 0*2=0, (-1)*1= -1. Sum is -2.

So inner product is (1/sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) * (-2).

Wait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(6) is sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3). So denominator is 2 sqrt(3).

So inner product is (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is [ (-1)/sqrt(3) ]^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me compute each part again.

v0 = [1; 0; -1] / sqrt(2)
ψ = [-1;2;1] / sqrt(6)

The inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) * [ (1)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)(1) ]

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) * ( -1 -1 ) 
= (1/(sqrt(12))) * (-2)
= (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )
= (-1)/sqrt(3)

So the absolute value squared is (1/3).

So the probability is 1/3. So the correct option is C) 1/3.


To determine the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the eigenvalue \( 0 \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Normalize the state vector
The given state vector is \( \psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is calculated as:
\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
\psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Find the eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is given as:
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
To find the eigenvalues, solve \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The characteristic equation is:
\[
-\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0 \implies \lambda(-\lambda^2 + 1) = 0.
\]
The eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 3: Find the eigenvectors of \( P \) for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), solve \( P \psi = 0 \):
\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} y = 0 \implies y = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} z = 0 \implies x = -z, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} y = 0 \implies y = 0.
\end{cases}
\]
Thus, the eigenvectors are of the form \( \begin{bmatrix} a \\ 0 \\ -a \end{bmatrix} \). Normalizing this vector gives:
\[
v_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the probability of measuring \( 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \( \psi_{\text{normalized}} \) onto \( v_0 \):
\[
\text{Probability} = \left| \langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \right|^2.
\]
Compute the inner product:
\[
\langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \left[ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (-2) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
The absolute value squared is:
\[
\left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
