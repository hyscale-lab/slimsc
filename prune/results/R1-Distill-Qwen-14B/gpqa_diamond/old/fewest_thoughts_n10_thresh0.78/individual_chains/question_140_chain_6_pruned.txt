Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's try to break this down. First, the reaction between X and Y. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. That's interesting. Also, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B, whose melting point is around 277 K. I know that 277 K is about 4°C, so B must be a solid at that temperature. What substances have melting points around there? Maybe something like water, but wait, water freezes at 273 K, which is close. But 277 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe something else.

Wait, 277 K is 4 degrees Celsius. So substances that are solid at that temperature... Maybe some metal or another compound. Hmm.

The product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. Keto acids are like ketones, but wait, no, keto acids are a class of organic acids where the carbonyl group is not adjacent to the COOH group. For example, beta-keto acids. When a keto acid reacts with X, it forms a product with two oxygen atoms. That suggests maybe X is something that deprotonates or adds to the acid.

Wait, X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like NaOH, KOH, HCl, etc. But it's a solid, perhaps. Oh, wait, it also incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe it's an element where isotopes are common. Like, for example, chlorine has several isotopes. But I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about the reaction. X reacts with liquid Y. Liquids could be things like water, maybe. Or maybe something else. The product is a precipitate, G. Precipitates usually form when a reaction produces an insoluble compound. So perhaps a salt.

When G is heated, it releases B, which is solid at 277 K. So heating G gives B. So B must be something that is a product of decomposition upon heating. For example, maybe if G is a carbonate, heating it could give CO2 and a metal oxide. But if B's melting point is around 277 K, which is about 4°C, perhaps B is something like water. Wait, water's melting point
