Okay, so I have this question about the color of light absorbed by a textile dye. Hmm, I remember that when something absorbs light, it doesn't emit that color. Instead, it emits the complementary color. Wait, complementary colors are like the ones opposite on the color wheel, right? Like if something absorbs blue, it emits orange or something.

The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. So I think I need to find out what color that corresponds to. I remember the energy of light is related to its wavelength, so I should probably use the equation E = hc/λ. Oh right, Planck's equation.

Wait, what's the value of h and c again? Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. Oh, and since energy is in eV, maybe I should convert it using 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J. So E in joules would be 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV.

Let me calculate that. 2.3393 multiplied by 1.602e-19. Let's see: 2 * 1.602 is 3.204, so 2.3393 is a bit more than 2, so maybe around 3.75e-19 J? Wait, wait, 2.3393 * 1.602e-19. Let me compute that more accurately.

2.3393 * 1.602 = let's see. 2 * 1.602 is 3.204. Then 0.3393 * 1.602. Hmm, 0.3 * 1.602 is 0.4806, and 0.0393 *1.602 ≈ 0.063. So total roughly 0.4806 + 0.063 = 0.5436. So 3.204 + 0.5436 = 3.7476. So E ≈ 3.7476e-19 J.

Now, using E = hc/λ, so λ = hc/E.

Plugging in the numbers: (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.0e8 m/s) divided by (3.7476e-19 J).

Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then divide by 3.7476e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 / 3.7476e-19 = ?

Hmm, let's compute the exponents: 1e-25 / 1e-19 = 1e-6. So 1.9878 /3.7476 is approximately 0.53. So 0.53e-6 meters, which is 530 nm. Oh wait, 530 nm is green light. So the compound emits green.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. Oh right, because when something emits light, it's because it's excited and then releases the energy. So the absorbed light is what's causing the excitation. The energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted one? Or maybe the same? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited to a higher energy state, and then maybe emits a photon when it returns to a lower state. So the energy of the absorbed photon should be higher. Because the energy difference between the states is what's involved.

Wait, no. Let me think. The energy of the emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference between
