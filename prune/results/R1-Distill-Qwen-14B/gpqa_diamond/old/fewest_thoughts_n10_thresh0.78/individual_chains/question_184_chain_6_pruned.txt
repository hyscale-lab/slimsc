Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Let's take it step by step.

First, I'm going to look at the target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. That means the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, no, wait. Actually, numbering the benzene ring, let's make sure. The positions are 1, 2, 3. So let me think: if the ethoxy is at position 1, then the tert-butyl is at position 2, and nitro at position 3. Alternatively, sometimes numbering is done to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers, but I think in this case, the substituents are given in a specific order.

So, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me think about how to introduce these groups. Since benzene is symmetric, the order in which you add substituents can affect the product.

I remember that when adding substituents via electrophilic substitution, the position where the substituent adds depends on the directing groups present.

So, let's think about each substituent: tert-butyl is a bulky group, and it's a strong activating group because it's an alkyl substituent. The ethoxy group is also an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, but once a substituent is added, it affects where the next substituent goes. So the order of addition is key. Also, some reactions are better done at specific stages. For example, nitration is typically done before introducing strong activating groups because nitration is a nitro group which is deactivating, which can slow down subsequent reactions that require activation.

Wait, but in this case, the nitro group is at position 3. So maybe the nitro group is introduced later. Or maybe it's introduced first because nitro groups are meta directors, which could
