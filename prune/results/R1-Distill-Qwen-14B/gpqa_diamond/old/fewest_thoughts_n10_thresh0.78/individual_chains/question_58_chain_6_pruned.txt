Okay, so I've got this question here about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations give infinite results, which don't make physical sense. Regularization helps to make these infinities manageable by introducing a temporary cutoff, which is then removed after renormalization.

So, the question is about which theory doesn't need this step at high energies. Let's go through each option.

A) Superstring Theory: I think string theory deals with particles as strings, and it's a candidate for a theory of everything. From what I've heard, string theories are supposed to be finite or at least not require the same kind of divergent regularization as other quantum field theories. Because in string theory, the fundamental objects are not point particles, so maybe the divergences that occur in QFT don't happen the same way. So this theory might not require regularization.

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD does have issues with things like the quark confinement and asymptotic freedom. But wait, in perturbative calculations, QCD does require renormalization, which implies regularization. Because you can get loop diagrams with divergences, so you have to regularize them. So B would need regularization.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED): QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED is a renormalizable theory, which means that despite having divergences, you can handle them through renormalization. But during the process, you must regularize the divergent integrals. So QED requires regularization, right? So option C would need it.

D) Classical Electrodynamics: Classical ED is a non-quantum theory, so it doesn't involve the same divergences as quantum theories. For instance, in Maxwell's equations, you don't get issues like infinite charge densities because everything is treated classically. So for classical ED, you don't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory and doesn't have the same infinities. Wait, but the question
