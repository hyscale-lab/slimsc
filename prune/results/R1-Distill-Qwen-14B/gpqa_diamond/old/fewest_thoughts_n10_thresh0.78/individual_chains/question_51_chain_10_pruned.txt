Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember from my studies that potential energy in such systems can be a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup is that there's a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I think the key here is to figure out the potential energy associated with bringing the charge q near the sphere and also considering any induced charges on the sphere itself.

Wait, since the sphere is conducting and grounded, any induced charges will reside on the surface. Oh right, when a charge is brought near a conductor, it induces opposite charges on the near side and same charges on the far side. But because the sphere is grounded, the charges can actually flow to the ground, right? So, maybe the sphere ends up with a charge that's a response to the external charge q.

Wait, no. Wait, the sphere is grounded, so any induced charge would cause a current until the electric field inside the conductor is zero. Hmm, but wait, the sphere is a conductor, so the charges redistribute until the field inside is zero. So if an external charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. But because it's grounded, does that mean the sphere can lose or gain electrons?

Let me think. The charge q induces a charge on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface must be zero. Because the sphere is a conductor, its entire surface is at
