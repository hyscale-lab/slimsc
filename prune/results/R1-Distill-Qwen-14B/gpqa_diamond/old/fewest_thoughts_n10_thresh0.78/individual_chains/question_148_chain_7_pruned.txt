Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem involves five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So, Y is some element that forms multiple fluorides. The compounds are labeled A1 to A5, and the question is about determining the molecular weight range of A4.

Let's break down the information given:

1. **A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine.**
   - Decomposes into A2 and F2. So, the reaction might be something like A1 â†’ A2 + F2 when heated (since 293 K is about room temperature, maybe it's not that hot).
   - Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 oxidizes it, A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, so maybe A1 is a fluoride that's highly oxidizing.

2. **A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y.**
   - So, A3 is a binary compound of Y and F, likely YF_n where n is some number. Since it's obtained by fluorinating Y, it's probably the first product of fluorination. Maybe YF3 or YF7, depending on Y's valence.

3. **Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4 produces A5.**
   - A4 is a binary compound of Y and F. When Y is added, perhaps a displacement reaction occurs. Since adding Y in a 1:1 ratio, maybe A4 is YF3, and adding Y (Y metal) would displace some F, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if A4 is YF6, adding Y might produce something else.

4. **In water, A5 decomposes to form two substances.**
   - So when A5 is placed in water, it breaks down into two products. Maybe it's an acid or something that reacts with water. For example, if A5 is YF3, adding water could hydrolyze it into HF and something else.

The goal is to find the molecular weight range of A4. The options are A) 140-160, B) 220-240, C) 160-180, D) 110-130.

Hmm. Let's try to figure out what Y is. Since we're dealing with fluorides, Y is likely a halogen or a metal.

Wait, fluorine is F, and the compounds are binary, so the other element Y is forming fluorides. Let's think about elements that form multiple fluorides. For example, oxygen can form OF2 and OF4, but that's probably not the case here. Alternatively, metals like tin, lead, or others.

Wait, maybe Y is oxygen? But oxygen's fluorides are OF2 and OF4, which are not necessarily strong oxidizers. Alternatively, think about elements like chlorine, but that's a halogen, not a metal. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: think about the decomposition of A1. If A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, then A2 is probably a less oxidized form. So perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride, and A2 is a lower one.

Wait, another thought: think about fluorine's behavior. If A1 is a compound that can release F2 gas upon decomposition, maybe A1 is a perfluoride or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a fluorine-rich compound, like YF4 decomposing into YF2 and F2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the first clue again. A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is usually unreactive, but under certain conditions, like high pressure or with strong oxidizing agents, it can react. For example, Xe can form compounds like XeO3 or XeF4 in the presence of strong oxidizers.

So A1 must be a powerful oxidizing agent. Fluorine itself is a strong oxidizer, but fluor
