Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see, I need to figure out what the unknown white solid is based on the spectral data provided. Hmm, the options are A to D, each a different compound. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. Then there's a peak at 158, 32% intensity. So that's a molecular ion plus something—maybe a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has isotopes, so that could be Cl in the molecule. The molecular weight is around 156, and the next peak is 158, which would fit if there's a Cl (atomic weight about 35.5), so Cl would have isotopes around 35 and 37. So the molecular ion plus a Cl isotope would that make sense? Wait, the molecular ion is 156, but if the molecular formula includes Cl, then the parent ion would be 156, and the next peak would be 156 + 2 (Cl-37 vs Cl-35), so 158. So that fits. So the molecular formula probably includes one Cl atom.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate OH groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but sometimes O-H in phenols or maybe a carbonyl oxygen, but more likely an OH. A strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700-1725. But wait, if it's an acid chlorides, the carbonyl is higher, like around 1800. So 1720 is more in line with a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an ester or ketone but the broadness might suggest something else.

Looking at the 1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). That's a very downfield proton. A singlet at 11 ppm—could that be an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid? Because in D, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH proton would be around there. In option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, same thing. For A, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but wait, the NMR shows 11.0, which is higher than aldehyde. Also, if it's a benzoic acid, the COOH proton would be around 10-12 ppm. So that fits.

Then, the 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H) suggest a substituted benzene ring with two substituents. Let me think. For a para-substituted benzene, like if the substituents are opposite each other, you'd have two doublets each integrating to 2H. For example, if there's a substituent in the para position, the protons on either side would split into two doublets. Alternatively, it could be an ortho substitution, but that's less likely as the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, let me think about the NMR shifts. The 8.02 ppm is more upfield than the 7.72. So perhaps the substituents are electron-withdrawing groups, which deshield the aromatic protons and cause them to appear downfield. For example, a nitro group or a carbonyl group. So, let's think about the options.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure would be Cl in the para position, and COOH in the ortho position? Wait, no. Benzoic acid is a benzene ring with a COOH group. If it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the Cl is in the para position relative to the COOH. So the substituents are COOH and Cl on the benzene ring, para to each other.

In that case, the benzene ring would have two sets of protons: the ones adjacent to COOH and Cl. Wait, no, let's clarify. For a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents, the positions would be 1 (COOH), 4 (Cl) perhaps? Wait, maybe not. Wait, benzoic acid is benzene with -COOH. So 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have Cl in the para position relative to the COOH. So the substituents are para to each other. That would mean that each substituent is across from each other. Then the ring protons would be in two sets: the two protons adjacent to COOH and the two adjacent to Cl. Each pair would be equivalent, leading to two doublets in the NMR.

The NMR shows 8.02 as a doublet integrating 2H and 7.72 as another doublet integrating 2H. So the more downfield (8.02) would be closer to an electron-withdrawing group. Benzoic acid has a -COOH which is electron-withdrawing. Chlorine is also an electron-withdrawing group. So the protons adjacent to COOH (which is a stronger EWG) would be more deshielded and appear downfield. So let's say the two protons next to COOH are at 8.02, and the two next to Cl are at 7.72.

That makes sense. So the NMR fits 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Looking at the other options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That's a benzaldehyde with Cl and OH substituents. The aldehyde proton would be around 9.5-10 ppm as a singlet, which doesn't match the 11 ppm here. Also, the NMR for the ring would be more complex because of the substituents. Plus, the IR would show a strong aldehyde peak around 1720? Wait, aldehydes have a peak around 1720? No, I think that's more for ketones and aldehydes. Wait, the 1720 peak here is a strong C=O. So that could be aldehyde, but the NMR doesn't fit because the aldehyde proton is usually around 9.5-1
