Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure out what's going on here. Hmm, the question is about the probability of getting specific outcomes when measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. 

Alright, the setup: The system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, actually, I think I should note that the state is a vector with components [-1, 2, 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they have to be normalized. So I should check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute its norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Oh, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must have a norm of 1. So maybe this is a non-normalized state, or perhaps I'm forgetting something. Hmm, but the problem might proceed without normalizing it, or perhaps the matrices will take care of that. Alternatively, maybe I need to normalize the state first. Let me think about that.

Wait, maybe the state given is not normalized, and I should normalize it before proceeding. Because otherwise, the probabilities won't add up to 1. So the vector is [-1, 2, 1]. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) times that vector. But does this matter for the probabilities? I think so. Because when I calculate the probabilities, I need to use the correct inner products. So perhaps I should start by normalizing the state.

So the state vector is |Ïˆ> = (-1, 2, 1)/sqrt(6). Let me note that down.

Next, the operators P and Q are given. Let me look at their matrices.

Operator P's matrix is:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third
