Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles moving in a detector, and I'm supposed to find the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of them to reach the detector's inner walls. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

So the setup is that particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are ultra-relativistic, moving at a high Lorentz factor, around 20 on average. Now, one third of them reach the inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the walls?

Wait, wait. I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma affects how far a particle can travel from the center before decaying. Oh right, because if a particle has a lifetime longer (from the lab frame's perspective) due to time dilation, it can travel farther before decaying. So the distance it travels is related to gamma.

But wait, the problem says that one third reach the wall when gamma is about 20. So when gamma is 20, the average distance they travel is the radius, which is 30 meters. Because the detector's radius is 30, so particles need to reach 30 meters to hit the walls.

Wait, but the particles are produced at the center, so the maximum possible distance they can travel is the radius. If they don't decay, they'll reach the wall. But in reality, they decay after some distance. So the fraction that makes it to the wall depends on their lifetime and their speed.

I think the fraction is given by the probability that the particle hasn't decayed before traveling the distance R (30 meters). So the proper lifetime of the particle is tau, and from the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = R / (v), but since they're ultra-relativistic, v is approximately c. So t = R/(c).

The decay probability is governed by the exponential decay law. The probability P that the particle hasn't decayed after time t is P = exp(-t / (gamma tau)). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the decay time in the lab frame is gamma tau, so the time the particle has is t. So the probability that it doesn't decay is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, but I might be mixing something up. Let me think again. The proper lifetime is tau. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. The time available for the particle to travel R is t = R/(beta c), because beta is v/c. But for ultra-relativistic particles, beta is approximately 1, so t ≈ R/(c).

So the decay probability after time t is P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, but wait. The particle's decay is a Poisson process. The probability that it hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

So when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the wall. That means that the probability when gamma is 20 is 1/3, so P = 1/3.

So setting up the equation: 1/3 = exp(- R/(c gamma tau)).

Wait, but what is tau? Oh, tau is the proper lifetime of the particle. But I don't know tau. But maybe I don't need it because when I change gamma, the ratio of the probabilities might not depend on tau.

Wait, because when I change gamma, I'm changing the Lorentz factor, so let's call the new gamma gamma_new. The original condition is when gamma = 20, P = 1/3. The new condition is P_new = 2/3.

But wait, the radius R is the same, so the time t is the same if beta is the same. Wait, but beta might change with gamma. Hmm, but the problem says the particles are traveling at ultra-relativistic velocities "highly centered around" gamma ~20. But when we change gamma, beta changes. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1-beta^2). So as gamma increases, beta approaches 1, but for a given gamma, beta can be calculated.

Wait, but perhaps in this problem beta is approximately 1, so maybe we can approximate t as R/(c) for both cases. Because if beta is nearly 1, R/(beta c) ≈ R/c. Let's proceed with that approximation.

So for the initial case:

P_initial = 1/3 = exp( - R/(c gamma_initial tau) )

For the new case:

P_new = 2/3 = exp( - R/(c gamma_new tau) )

We can take the ratio of the two equations to eliminate R/(c tau).

Taking natural logs of both equations.

ln(1/3) = - R/(c gamma_initial tau )

ln(2/3) = - R/(c gamma_new tau )

Divide the two equations:

[ ln(2/3) ] / [ ln(1/3) ] = [ R/(c gamma_new tau) ] / [ R/(c gamma_initial tau) ]

Simplifying, the R, c, and tau terms cancel out.

So [ ln(2/3) ] / [ ln(1/3) ] = gamma_initial / gamma_new

Wait, let me compute the left-hand side.

Compute ln(2/3) and ln(1/3).

ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) ≈ 0.6931 - 1.0986 = -0.4055

ln(1/3) = -ln(3) ≈ -1.0986

So the ratio is (-0.4055) / (-1.0986) ≈ 0.369.

So 0.369 = gamma_initial / gamma_new

But wait, wait. Because the equation is:

ln(2/3) = - R/(c gamma_new tau )

ln(1/3) = - R/(c gamma_initial tau )

So ln(2/3) / ln(1/3) = [ - R/(c gamma_new tau) ] / [ - R/(c gamma_initial tau) ]

Which is (R/(c gamma_new tau)) / (R/(c gamma_initial tau)) ) * (ln(1/3)/ln(2/3)) )?

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equations.

Let me write:

Equation 1: ln(1/3) = - R/(c gamma_initial tau )

Equation 2: ln(2/3) = - R/(c gamma_new tau )

Divide equation 2 by equation 1:

[ ln(2/3) ] / [ ln(1/3) ] = [ (- R/(c gamma_new tau) ) ] / [ (- R/(c gamma_initial tau) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negatives cancel, and R/(c tau) cancels.

So the ratio is [ 1/gamma_new ] / [ 1/gamma_initial ] = gamma_initial / gamma_new

So,

[ ln(2/3) ] / [ ln(1/3) ] = gamma_initial / gamma_new

We can compute the left side:

ln(2/3) = ln(0.6667) ≈ -0.4055

ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986

So the ratio is (-0.4055) / (-1.0986) ≈ 0.369.

So,

0.369 = gamma_initial / gamma_new

We can solve for gamma_new.

gamma_initial is 20.

So, gamma_new = gamma_initial / 0.369 ≈ 20 / 0.369 ≈ 54.17.

Hmm, that's approximately 54. So looking at the options, option A is 54.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, no, wait. Gamma_new is in the denominator, because the equation is:

ln(2/3)/ln(1/3) = gamma_initial / gamma_new.

Wait, the equation is:

gamma_initial / gamma_new = (ln(2/3))/(ln(1/3)).

Wait, let me compute this ratio again.

Wait, ln(2/3) is about -0.4055, ln(1/3) is about -1.0986.

So, (ln(2/3))/(ln(1/3)) = (-0.4055)/(-1.0986) ≈ 0.369.

So,

gamma_initial / gamma_new = 0.369.

So,

gamma_new = gamma_initial / 0.369.

Gamma_initial is 20.

20 / 0.369 ≈ 54.17. So around 54, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't mix up gamma_initial and gamma_new. Because in the problem, when gamma is 20, the probability is 1/3, and they want to find the gamma that makes the probability 2/3.

Wait, because when the Lorentz factor increases, the lifetime increases, so the particles live longer and have a higher chance of reaching the detector walls. So, if at gamma=20, 1/3 reach the wall, then for a higher gamma, more than 1/3 would reach. So the desired probability is 2/3, which is higher than 1/3. So gamma_new must be higher than 20. But according to our calculation, gamma_new is about 54, which is higher than 20. That makes sense.

Alternatively, let me think about the formula again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

The probability P is e^{-t/(gamma tau)}, where t is the time available.

t is R/(beta c). Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, beta is approximately 1, so t ≈ R/(c).

So,

P = e^{-(R/(c)) / (gamma tau)} = e^{- R/(c gamma tau) }.

Wait, but if I denote R/(c tau) as a constant, say, K, then P = e^{- K / gamma }.

So when gamma is higher, the exponent is smaller, so P is larger. So higher gamma leads to higher P, which makes sense.

So when gamma increases, P increases.

So, for the initial case, gamma=20, P=1/3.

We can write (1/3) = e^{ - K / 20 }.

For the desired case, P=2/3 = e^{ - K / gamma_new }.

Taking the ratio:

(2/3) / (1/3) = e^{ - K / gamma_new } / e^{ - K / 20 }

Which simplifies to 2 = e^{ K (1/20 - 1/gamma_new) }.

Taking ln of both sides:

ln 2 = K (1/20 - 1/gamma_new).

But K is R/(c tau) = [30 m]/(c tau).

Wait, but I can't compute K directly because I don't know tau. But perhaps I can eliminate K.

From the initial equation:

(1/3) = e^{ - K / 20 }.

Take ln of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - K / 20 → K = -20 ln(1/3) = 20 ln(3) ≈ 20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972.

So K ≈ 21.972 (units of 1/time, since R is in meters and c is in m/s, so K would be 1/s).

Plugging into the equation for the desired case:

ln(2) = K (1/20 - 1/gamma_new )

We know K ≈ (30 m)/(c tau) = 21.972. Wait, no, K is R/(c tau) which I calculated as 21.972 (1/s).

So,

ln(2) = 21.972 ( (1/20) - (1/gamma_new) )

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So,

0.6931 = 21.972 ( (1/20) - (1/gamma_new) )

Divide both sides by 21.972:

0.6931 / 21.972 ≈ 0.03156 ≈ (1/20 - 1/gamma_new )

Compute 1/20 is 0.05.

So,

0.03156 = 0.05 - 1/gamma_new → 1/gamma_new = 0.05 - 0.03156 ≈ 0.01844.

So,

gamma_new ≈ 1 / 0.01844 ≈ 54.23.

So approximately 54, which is option A.

So the answer should be A) 54.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor $\gamma$, the probability $P$ of a particle reaching the wall, and the exponential decay law.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Decay Probability**: The probability $P$ that a particle does not decay before reaching the detector's wall is given by:
   \[
   P = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right),
   \]
   where $t$ is the time available for the particle to travel the distance $R$, $\tau$ is the proper lifetime of the particle, and $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor. For ultra-relativistic particles, $t \approx \frac{R}{c}$, so:
   \[
   P = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\gamma c \tau}\right).
   \]

2. **Initial Condition**: When $\gamma = 20$, the probability $P$ is $\frac{1}{3}$. Using the formula:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{20 c \tau}\right).
   \]

3. **Desired Condition**: For the probability $P$ to be $\frac{2}{3}$, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\gamma_{\text{new}} c \tau}\right).
   \]

4. **Ratio of Probabilities**: By dividing the equations for $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$, we eliminate $R$, $c$, and $\tau$:
   \[
   \frac{\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)}{\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)} = \frac{\gamma_{\text{new}}}{20}.
   \]

5. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - Compute $\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055$ and $\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx -1.0986$.
   - The ratio is:
     \[
     \frac{\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)}{\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)} = \frac{-0.4055}{-1.0986} \approx 0.369.
     \]
   - Solving for $\gamma_{\text{new}}$:
     \[
     \gamma_{\text{new}} = 20 \div 0.369 \approx 54.17.
     \]

6. **Conclusion**: The Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is approximately $54$.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **A) 54**.
