Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let me read the question again.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits, and they were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe it's just context about how they were found.

The problem gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 are approximately 1.4. So, Planet1's temperature is about 1.4 times Planet2's. Then, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3, meaning Planet2's temperature is 2.3 times Planet3's. So, Planet3 is cooler than Planet2, and Planet1 is hotter than Planet2.

The mass ratios are given too: Planet1 and Planet2 have a mass ratio of about 1.15. So Planet1 is 1.15 times more massive than Planet2. Then Planet2 and Planet3 have a mass ratio of 1.35, so Planet2 is 1.35 times more massive than Planet3. So Planet3 is less massive than Planet2, and Planet1 is more massive than Planet2.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So, Period3 / Period1 = ?

They also mention that the albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. Albedo affects how much light is reflected, so it would influence the equilibrium temperature. But since all albedos are the same, maybe that cancels out when we take ratios.

I remember the equilibrium temperature formula. The equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is given by the equation:

T = [ (L * (1 - a)) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ) ]^(1/4)

Where:
- L is the star's luminosity
- a is the albedo
- D is the distance from the star
- σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant

Wait, but in this problem, the star's luminosity (L) is the same for all three planets because they orbit the same star. Also, the albedo (a) is the same for all. So, when we're looking at the ratios of the equilibrium temperatures, the L and a terms would cancel out.

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T) between two planets should depend on the inverse square root of the distance ratio. Because D is in the denominator squared, and the whole thing is to the 1/4 power.

Let me write the equilibrium temperature equation for each planet.

For Planet1: T1 = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D1²) ) ]^(1/4)
For Planet2: T2 = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D2²) ) ]^(1/4)
For Planet3: T3 = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D3²) ) ]^(1/4)

If I take the ratio T1/T2, it should be equal to [ (D2²) / (D1²) ]^(1/4) because everything else is the same.

So, T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2)

Wait, let's see. Let's compute T1 / T2.

T1/T2 = [ ( (L (1-a)) / (16πσ D1²) ) / ( (L (1-a)) / (16πσ D2²) ) ) ]^(1/4)
The L, 1-a, 16πσ terms cancel out. So we have (D2² / D1²) )^(1/4) = (D2/D1)^(1/2).

So T1 / T2 = sqrt(D2/D1).

Given that T1/T2 is 1.4, so sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4.

Then, D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96.

So D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1 is higher than T2. So, T1 = 1.4 * T2.

Wait, but according to the equation, T1 would be higher if D1 is smaller. Because if Planet1 is closer to the star (smaller D), its temperature would be higher. So if T1 is higher, D1 must be smaller than D2.

But from our calculation, D2 =
