Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this nuclear decay question. Let's see what it says. The problem describes a decay process where two nucleons of flavor A convert into two B nucleons and emit particles E and V. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, they emit one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the energy spectrum of E changes in this new scenario.

Hmm, I remember something about particle decay and energy spectra. Oh right, in beta decay, when a nucleus emits a beta particle and an antineutrino, the beta has a continuous spectrum because the total energy is divided among the emitted particles. The maximum energy (endpoint) occurs when the neutrino takes negligible energy, right?

Wait, so in the original decay, each E and V must carry some energy. Since the E's have a continuous spectrum, that suggests that their energies can vary, implying that their production isn't fixed. So maybe the V particles are carrying away some energy as well, and that's why E's spectrum is continuous.

Now, in the variant, instead of two V particles, they emit one M, which is massless. So let's think about this. If M is massless and the system is emitting it, how does that affect the energy distribution?

In the original case, each E and V would share the available energy, but in the new case, the energy is distributed among E, E, and M. Since M is massless, does that affect the energy each E can take?

Wait, in the first scenario (original decay), the E particles' energy is continuous because their energy can vary based on how much energy the V's take. So the endpoint Q is the maximum energy each E can have, which would be when the V particles take as little as possible (like zero). But wait, V particles can't have zero energy because they are emitted. Hmm, maybe it's when the V's are moving in the opposite direction, but I'm not sure.

In the variant, the total energy available for E and M is the same as before, but now it's being split between E, E, and
