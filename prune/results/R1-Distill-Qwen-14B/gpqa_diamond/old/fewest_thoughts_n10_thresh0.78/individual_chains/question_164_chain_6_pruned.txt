Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Let me think through this step by step.

Wait, the question says both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. So the orbital period for system_1 is 2 years, and for system_2, it's 1 year. I remember that in binary systems, the period is the time it takes for the stars to orbit each other once.

Then there's some spectroscopic data. For system_1, the radial velocity (RV) variations have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I think the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of stars because the Doppler shift tells us how fast the stars are moving toward or away from us.

I remember that the mass of a star in a binary system can be determined from the radial velocity curve. The formula involves Kepler's laws, right? Oh wait, the formula for the mass function comes into play here. The mass function relates the velocities of the stars to their masses. But wait, I think there's a way to find the mass ratio first.

The mass function in a spectroscopic binary gives (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ), where i is the inclination angle. But I'm not sure if I can directly apply that here because I don't know the inclination. But wait, since both systems are eclipsing, the inclination must be close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. That simplifies things because sin i ≈ 1, so we can ignore it.

So each star's velocity is related to the mass of the other star. The more massive a star, the smaller its velocity because it's less likely to move due to the gravitational influence of the other. So for a binary system, M1/M2 = V2/V1, where V1 and V2 are the velocities of each star. Because the center of mass is where M1 V1 = M2 V2.

Wait, right. The mass ratio is inversely proportional to the velocity ratio. So M1/M2 = V2/V1.

So for system_1: the two stars have velocities of 10 and 5 km/s. Let me say star A has velocity 10, star B 5. Then M_A / M_B = 5 / 10 = 0.5. So the mass ratio is 1:2, but wait, no, mass ratio M_A/M_B is 0.5, so M_A is half of M_B. So the total mass of system_1 is M_A + M_B = (0.5 M_B) + M_B = 1.5 M_B.

Wait, but I need the mass of each system. How do I connect the velocities to the masses?

I think the formula for the mass in a binary system uses the period and the velocities. Oh, right, the formula for the mass comes from the radial velocity semi-amplitude. The formula is M = (v * P) / (2π G) ) * (something?),
