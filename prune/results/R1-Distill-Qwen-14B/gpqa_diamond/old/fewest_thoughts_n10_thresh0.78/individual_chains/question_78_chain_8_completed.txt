Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about scalar and vector potentials in the context of electromagnetic fields.

So, the question gives me a point charge q moving along some trajectory s(t), and we're observing the field at point r. The vector d is from where the field was generated (at time tr) to our observation point r. The velocity of the charge at that earlier time is v.

I remember that when charges are moving, the potentials can be found using certain formulas. The scalar potential V is usually associated with the electric field, and the vector potential A is tied to the magnetic field. 

Wait, the potentials are functions of position and time. For static charges, V would be straightforward, like Coulomb's law. But since this charge is moving, there's probably some relativistic effects or retarded time factors involved.

The problem options give various expressions. Let me think about how these potentials are derived. Oh right, in the context of retarded potentials, the fields are based on the position and velocity of the charge at an earlier time (tr), which is when the field was generated. The distance from that point to the observation point is vector d, so d is the displacement vector between the charge's position at tr and the field's observation point.

Wait, the options have different denominators. Let me think about the form of the potentials. For the scalar potential V, when the charge is moving, I think it's still similar to Coulomb's law but adjusted for the movement. But wait, no—wait, in the case of a moving charge, especially for the scalar potential, I think the expression is similar to Coulomb's law but scaled by some factor involving the velocity.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the potentials can be written in terms of the charge's motion. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by some factor involving the velocity and the direction of observation.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expressions. Let me try to recall. The scalar potential V for a moving charge is often written as (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v t')/c²)], something like that. Or maybe it's (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - v t')/(c²)]? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, I think the scalar potential is given by the same Coulomb's law expression as a static charge when the charge is moving with velocity v, but maybe there's a correction term involving the velocity. Or perhaps that's the vector potential. Oh wait, the vector potential A is usually proportional to the velocity.

Wait, the options have different forms. Let's look at the options. Option B says V is (q/(4πε₀ r)), which is the static case. But if the charge is moving, why would V be static? That doesn't seem right. Unless perhaps the problem is considering the potentials in the Coulomb gauge or something else.

Wait, but the problem says "satisfying t > tr", which suggests retarded time. So I think the potentials should depend on the position and velocity at time tr, which is earlier than t. So the denominator might involve (d c - d · v), something like that.

Wait, another thought: the potentials are generally calculated using the retarded time. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [something], and the vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) multiplied by something.

Wait, I remember that the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) times the scalar potential. Because A is proportional to velocity. So like A = (v/c²) V, but I'm not sure about the constants.

Looking at the options, option B has A as (v/c²) V. So let's see, V is (q/(4πε₀ r)). So A would be (v/(c²)) * (q/(4πε₀ r)).

But wait, the denominator in the options for V and A in the other options involve (d c - d · v) instead of r. So perhaps the correct expressions include that.

Wait, I think the general form for the scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/(d - (v t)/c²), but no, perhaps it's [d c - (d · v)] in the denominator. Because when you have a moving charge, the denominator involves the Lorentz contraction effect, so it's (d c) minus the dot product of d and v, divided by c squared or something like that.

Wait, another angle: the potentials are obtained using the Lienard's formulas. The scalar potential V(r, t) is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v t')/c²)], where t' is the retarded time. Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) * [v(t')/(r - (v t')/c²)].

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the forms of the potentials more carefully.

Wait, the denominator in the options is in the form of (d c - d · v). So if d is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point, then (d c - d·v) would be like c d - v·d. Hmm, maybe that's how it comes into play.

Wait, another thought: in the expression for the potentials, the denominator is (r - (v t_r)/c²), but t_r is the retarded time. The vector d is r - r_q, where r_q is the charge's position at tr. So perhaps d is r - r_q, which is the displacement vector.

In that case, r - (v t_r) would be related to d. But I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about how the denominator arises.

Wait, maybe the denominator is (d c - (d · v)), which can also be written as c d - (v · d). If I factor that, it's c d - v · d = d (c - (v · d)/(d c)) ), wait no, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c^2 t_r - d · v), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, going back to the expressions for the potentials. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r' - (v t')/c²)] evaluated at the retarded time. But r' is the position of the charge at time t', which is perhaps r - d.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in terms of d is (d c - (d · v)), because d is the vector from the charge's position to the field point. So if the charge is moving, the denominator would involve the distance and the velocity factor.

Wait, another approach: in the standard expressions for the potentials due to a moving charge, the scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v t')/c²)], where t' is the retarded time. So for a point charge moving with velocity v, the retarded time t' is such that the light travel time from the charge's position at t' to the observation point at (t, r) is accounted for.

But perhaps in the denominator, it's (r - (v t')/c²) which can be expressed in terms of the vector d. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the denominator becomes (d c - (d · v)) because d is the vector from the charge's position to the observation point at the retarded time.

Wait, another thought: the denominator in the potentials is (d c - (d · v)) when expressed in terms of d, v, and c. So if I have (d c - (d · v)) = c |d| - (d · v). Hmm, but maybe it's written as (d c - (d · v)).

So, looking at the options, option C has V as (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v)) and A as (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d · v)).

Wait, V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v)). That seems a bit different from what I was thinking. Because I thought V is (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by 1 over something. But option C's denominator is (d c - d · v), and multiplied by c in the numerator.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the units. Let's see: scalar potential V should have units of volts (V), which are (charge)/(permittivity * distance) → (C)/(F·m). But let me check each option's units.

Option A: V is (q/(4πε₀ r)). The denominator is distance, so units are (C)/( (F·m) * m ) → C/(F m²). Wait, F is C²/(J), and J is N·m, so F → C²/(N·m²). So 1/(4π ε₀ r) has units (N·m²/C²) * (1/m) ) → N·m / C². Hmm, V is N·m/C, so that units match? Wait, no: V is (J/C) which is (N·m)/(C), so yes, (N·m²/C²) * (1/m) ) is N·m/C², which is J/(C²) → Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, I'll think in terms of SI units: ε₀ has units of F/m (C²/(N·m²)). So 1/(4π ε₀) is (m/(C²/(N·m²)) )) → (N·m²)/(C²·m) ) → N·m/C² → J/(C²) → (V·C)/(C²) ) → V/C. Hmm, getting a bit stuck on the units, maybe that's not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relation between the potentials. I remember that the vector potential A is related to the scalar potential by A = (v/c²) V, but I'm not sure about that. Wait, wait, in the case of a static charge, the vector potential would be zero because there's no magnetic field. But when the charge is moving, A becomes non-zero.

Wait, another approach: the potentials should satisfy Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to both electric and magnetic fields.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the general expressions. The scalar potential due to a moving charge is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * (1 / (d c - (d · v))) ), multiplied by some factor.

Wait, no, maybe the correct expression for V is (q c) / (4πε₀ (d c - (d · v)) ), which is option C's V. Because when I think about the denominator, it's (d c - (d · v)) which is a scalar, so the denominator is a length.

Wait, but why would the scalar potential have a c in the numerator? Because when you have a moving charge, the potentials may involve factors of c. Let me think about the form of the potentials when the charge is moving.

Wait, for a charge moving with velocity v, the potential can be written in terms of the charge's velocity, but I'm not recalling the exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the expressions for static and moving charges.

In the static case, V is Coulomb's law: V = (q/(4πε₀ r)). But when the charge is moving, the expression changes because of the time delay in the field's propagation.

Wait, maybe the denominator becomes (d c - (d · v)). Let me think: d is the displacement vector from the charge to the observation point. So, when the charge is moving, the denominator would involve how much the charge has moved during the time it took for the field to reach the observation point.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (d · v)) because during the time it takes the field to reach the observation point, the charge has moved a distance (v t), and the vector from the charge's current position to the observation point is d, which is r - position of charge at tr. So, the denominator is c multiplied by the distance d, minus the component of v along d multiplied by the time.

Wait, perhaps. Let me think in terms of the standard expression. The scalar potential due to a moving charge is given by:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v t_r)/c²)]

where t_r is the retarded time. But r is the position vector of the charge at time t_r, so from the observation point's perspective, the distance is d = r_obs - r_charge(tr).

So, perhaps r - (v t_r)/c² is d c - (v · d)/c, but not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator can be expressed as (d c - (v · d)).

So, V would be (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - (v · d)) ), but I'm not certain.

Similarly, the vector potential A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π (d c - (v · d)) ), as in option C.

Wait, let me think about the units for A. The vector potential has units of (V·s)/m. Let's see; option C's A has numerator μ₀ q c v. μ₀ has units of H/m (kg·m/(s²·A²)), q is in Coulombs, c is m/s, v is m/s. So numerator units: (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * C * m/s * m/s → kg·m/(s²·A²) * C * m²/s².

Wait, denominator is 4π(d c - (d·v)), which is meters. So overall, A has units (kg·m/(s²·A²) * C * m²/s²) / m → kg·m/(s²·A²) * C m/s².

But C is Ampere-seconds (A·s), so substituting:

kg·m/(s²·A²) * A·s * m/s² → kg·m²/(s^4·A) )

But vector potential's SI units are kg·m²/(s³·A). Hmm, maybe I'm not calculating this correctly, or perhaps the units check out.

Wait, no, because Vector potential A's units are indeed kg·m²/(s³·A). Let me compute the units of option C's A:

Numerator: μ₀ (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * q (C=A·s) * c (m/s) * v (m/s) → 

= kg·m/(s²·A²) * A·s * m/s * m/s 
= kg·m/(s²·A²) * A·s * m²/s²
= kg·m * A·s * m² / (s² * A² * s²)
= kg·m^3/(s^3·A)

Denominator: 4π (d c - (d·v)) → meters.

So total units: (kg·m^3/(s^3·A )) / m → kg·m²/(s^3·A ), which matches the correct units for A. So option C's A has the correct units.

Similarly, option C's V has numerator q c → C·m/s. Denominator is (d c - (d·v)) → meters. So V's units would be (C·m/s)/m = C/(s) → which is Ampere. Wait, no, that's not right. Because scalar potential V has units of volts (V), which is J/C → (N·m)/C → (kg·m²/s²)/C → kg·m²/(s²·C).

Wait, option C's V is (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - d·v)).

So q is in C, c is m/s, denominator is (m * m/s - m * m/s) → units are m²/s. Wait, no, denominator is dimensionless? No, (d c) is m*(m/s) = m²/s, and (d·v) is m*(m/s) = m²/s. So denominator is (m²/s), so overall V is (C * m/s) / (m²/s) ) → (C * m/s) * (s/m²) ) = C/(m). But that's not right. Because V should be C/(F·m), and F is C²/(N·m²) → 1/F is N·m²/C².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me calculate V's units again.

V has units of volts, which is J/C → (N·m)/C → (kg·m²/s²)/C.

Option C's V is (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - d·v)).

q → C, c → m/s.

Denominator: d c → m*(m/s) = m²/s.

So V's units: (C * m/s) / (m²/s) ) → C * (m/s) * (s/m²) ) → C/(m).

Wait, that's C per meter, which is (A·s)/m. But volts are (J/C) → (N·m)/C → (kg·m²/s²)/C.

So C/m is A·s/m, which is different. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the correct option has the right units.

Wait, let's see option B's V: (q/(4π ε₀ r)).

Units of V: q is C, 4π ε₀ r is (F/m)*m = F → C²/(N·m²). So 1/(4π ε₀ r) → N·m²/(C²·m) → N·m/(C²) → (kg·m²/s²)/(C²). So V would be (C) * (kg·m²/s²)/(C²·m) ) → kg·m/(s²·C), which is (kg·m²/(s²·C·m)) → (kg·m)/(s²·C). Hmm, that's not matching volts. Wait, what's wrong here.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate. 1/(4π ε₀ r) has units (1/(F/m * m)) ) → 1/(F) → (N·m²)/C². Because F is C²/(N·m²), so 1/F is N·m²/C².

So V is (q) * (1/(4π ε₀ r)) → (C) * (N·m²/C²) → N·m²/(C). But N·m is J, so V is J/(C), which is correct for volts.

So option B's V units are correct. But in option C, as I computed earlier, the units don't seem to match. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider another approach. The potentials propagate at the speed of light, so the expressions should involve terms where the distance and velocity contribute to the denominator.

Also, the vector potential A is usually proportional to the velocity of the charge. So in the vector potential, the presence of v in the numerator makes sense.

Looking again at option C: 

V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - (d · v)) )

A = (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - (d · v)) )

Wait, so the denominator is same for both. That makes sense because both would involve the same geometric factor.

Hmm, but why the factor of c in the numerator of V?

Wait, perhaps considering that V is (q/(4π ε₀)) * [1/( (d) - (v t)/(c²) ) ] but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The denominator in the potentials is (d c - (d · v)). So if I factor out d, it's d (c - (v · d̂)), where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. So perhaps this comes into play when considering the motion of the charge.

Alternatively, think about the potentials in terms of the displacement vector.

Wait, I think the correct expressions for the potentials are given in option C. Because the denominator in both V and A is the same, which makes sense as they depend on the same geometric factor. Also, the vector potential has a factor of v, which is correct.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) due to a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Context of the Problem**:  
   The charge \( q \) is moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the field-generating instant \( t_r \). The observation point \( \vec{r} \) is separated from the charge's position at \( t_r \) by the vector \( \vec{d} \). The potentials must account for the motion of the charge and the retarded time effects.

2. **Key Observations**:  
   - The scalar potential \( V \) is related to the electric field and typically resembles Coulomb's law but adjusted for the motion of the charge.  
   - The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and contributes to the magnetic field.  
   - Both potentials depend on the same geometric factor, which involves the displacement vector \( \vec{d} \) and the velocity \( \vec{v} \).  

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: The scalar potential \( V \) is given as \( \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which corresponds to the static case for a stationary charge. However, this does not account for the motion of the charge, making it incorrect.  
   - **Option B**: Here, \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which again represents the static case, and \( \vec{A} = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V \). While the form of \( \vec{A} \) is reasonable, the scalar potential \( V \) is static and does not include the motion of the charge, so this option is also incorrect.  
   - **Option C**: The scalar potential \( V = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \) and the vector potential \( \vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \) are consistent with the retarded potential formulation. Both potentials share the same denominator, which accounts for the displacement vector \( \vec{d} \) and the velocity \( \vec{v} \). The numerator for \( \vec{A} \) includes the velocity \( \vec{v} \), as expected.  
   - **Option D**: The scalar potential \( V = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \) and the vector potential \( \vec{A} = \frac{\mu qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \) have incorrect signs in the denominator. The denominator should involve \( dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), not \( dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), making this option incorrect.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Option C correctly incorporates the effects of the moving charge and satisfies the expected form of the potentials in terms of the displacement vector \( \vec{d} \), the velocity \( \vec{v} \), and the constants \( \epsilon_0 \), \( \mu_0 \), and \( c \).

**Answer: C**
