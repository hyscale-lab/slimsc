Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's see.

The question says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well of length L. We need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and E is defined as pi²ħ²/(2mL²).

Wait, so each particle is a spin-1/2, which means they have spin up or down. But since they're identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh right, because fermions can't occupy the same quantum state, so each unique state can hold at most two particles (with opposite spins).

In a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²) = n²E, where E is as given. So each energy level is a multiple of E based on the quantum number n.

Now, for four particles, we need to figure out how they fill up the energy levels considering the Pauli exclusion.

In the ground state, the lowest energy configuration is when the particles fill the lowest available levels with the lowest possible quantum numbers n, but each n can hold two particles (because of spin up and down).

So let's list out the possible n values and their capacities:

n=1: can hold 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: another 2
n=3: 2
n=4: 2, etc.

We have four particles. So let's see:

n=1 holds 2, n=2 holds another 2. So that's four particles in total. So the ground state would have particles in n=1 and n=2, each with both spin states filled. So the energies are 1²E and 2²E, which are E and 4E. But since the particles are in different n states, the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, no, the system's total energy is the sum of the energies of each particle. Each particle in n=1 contributes E, and each in n=2 contributes 4E. So two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So total energy for ground state is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but wait, no. Because each particle in the same n has the same energy. So for the ground state, each particle in n=1 is E, two of them, so 2E. Each of the two in n=2 is 4E, so 8E. Total 10E.

But wait, the options don't have the ground state as 10E. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E, 10E, 50E

C)4E, 10E,15E

D)10E, 15E,18E

Hmm. Wait, the question is about the energies of the ground, first, and second excited states
