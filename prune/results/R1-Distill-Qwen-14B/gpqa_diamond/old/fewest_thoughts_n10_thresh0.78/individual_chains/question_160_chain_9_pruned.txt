Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. Hmm, interesting.

Wait, first I need to understand the setup. The aperture is a regular N-gon, right? Because all apothems are equal, so it's a regular polygon. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is related to the side length and the number of sides.

But the question says N is infinitely large. Oh, right, when N becomes very large, the polygon approaches a circle. So in the limit as N approaches infinity, the aperture becomes a circular aperture. That’s a key point because I remember that the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is the Airy disk.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the angular distance between the first two minima. In the case of a circular aperture, the minima occur at specific angles. The first minimum is at θ where sinθ = λ/(π a), because I remember that for a single slit, the minima are at λ/a, but for a circular aperture (which is a kind of single slit in 2D), the first minimum is at a different ratio.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The formula for the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture (like a pinhole) is that the angle θ for the m-th minimum is given by m * λ = a * sinθ. Wait, no, that can't be right because for a single slit, the minima are at mλ = a sinθ. But for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at θ where sinθ = λ/(π a). Because in the Airy disk, the first dark ring is the first minimum. Let me confirm that.

Yes, the first minimum for circular aperture occurs at (approximately) θ where sinθ = λ/(π a). Wait, actually, I think it's the first minimum at about λ/(π a), but perhaps I should look up the exact formula. But I'm recalling that the first minimum is at a certain condition. Hmm.

Wait, no. Wait, the first minimum for a single slit (which is a 1D problem) is at a
