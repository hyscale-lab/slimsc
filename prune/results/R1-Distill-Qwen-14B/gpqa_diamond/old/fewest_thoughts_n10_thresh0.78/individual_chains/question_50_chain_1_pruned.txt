Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that a colleague has a new theory and is regularizing higher-order loop diagrams. There's a note with a string of constants and their factors: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I need to figure out how many loops the diagram had based on this expression.

Wait, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of perturbation theory. Each loop typically contributes a factor that depends on the coupling constants and possibly the energy scales.

The general idea is that each loop brings in a factor of the coupling constant (like alpha for electromagnetism) and also introduces factors from integrals, which often involve terms like (4π)^n, where n is the number of loops. So for example, a one-loop diagram would have terms like (4π)^something in the denominator.

Looking at the given factors: the denominator has (4π)^6. So that would suggest that there are 6 factors of 4π, each possibly from a loop. But wait, I'm not sure if each loop contributes exactly one 4π factor or more. Let me think: in a loop integral, each loop in four dimensions typically gives a factor of (4π)^2, but wait, maybe it's (4π)^something else.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall. For a loop integral in four-dimensional spacetime, the integral might have a result that includes (4π)^2 multiplied by a term like sqrt(π) or something else, depending on the specifics of the integral. But perhaps when you regularize, you might end up with factors of (4π)^something in the denominator.

Wait, let's think about dimensional regularization. Oh, but the problem mentions "regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams." So perhaps the method used is cutoff regularization or Pauli-Villars, but more likely, dimensional regularization is common. Hmm, but the note has (4pi)^6, which makes me think of loop integrals in a different regularization scheme, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: the
