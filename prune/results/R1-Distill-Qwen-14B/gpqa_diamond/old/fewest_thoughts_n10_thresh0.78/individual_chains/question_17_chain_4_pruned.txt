Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

The question says the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, stochiometric means it's in a 1:1 ratio, right? So each Ca²+ is bound to one EDTA^4-.

The problem gives the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. I remember that the formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- with Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, wait. The solution contains the complex, which is 0.02 M. Assuming that the pH is ideal, which I think means that the concentration of free EDTA is not a problem. Because EDTA's availability depends on pH, but the question says pH is ideal, so maybe [EDTA^4-] is sufficient or we can assume it's a certain value.

Wait, another approach: when a complex is formed, the concentration of the complex is related to the concentrations of the ions and the formation constant.

But I think the key is that in solution, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions.
