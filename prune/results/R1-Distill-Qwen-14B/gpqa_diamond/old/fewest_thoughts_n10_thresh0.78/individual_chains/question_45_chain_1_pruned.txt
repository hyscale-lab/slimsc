Okay, so I've got this problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's see if I can work this out.

The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The particles are spin-1/2, so they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, right? That means each energy level can have a limited number of particles.

First, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. Oh wait, the problem says E is defined as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so E is basically E_1, right? Because when n=1, E_1 = E.

So each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n. Since the particles are fermions (spin-1/2), they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. But wait, in a 1D box, the quantum state is determined by the quantum number n and the spin state. Since spin is 1/2, each n can have two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, no, the potential well is 1D, so the only quantum number is n. Spin gives two possible states for each n. So each n level can hold two particles.

But how does this work when there are multiple particles? Let's think about filling up the energy levels with the available particles.

We have four particles. Each energy level (n=1, 2, 3, ...) can hold two particles. So let's try to arrange them.

Ground state: The lowest energy state. The lowest n is 1, which can hold two particles. Then the next is n=2, which can hold another two. But wait, we have four particles, so maybe we need n=1 and n=2 each filled with two particles.

Wait, but wait, spin comes into play. Let me think again. For each n, you can have two spins (up and down). So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), the next two go into n=2. So in the ground state, all four are filled in n=1 and n=2. So energy would be the sum of each particle
