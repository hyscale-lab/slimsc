Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me see. So the question is about an alien astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth using a super fast spacecraft. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super close to c. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes from their perspective to reach Earth. The options are whether they die before reaching, or choose between 72, 81, or 77 years.

Wait, wait. So the first thing I remember is that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Time dilation is part of Einstein's theory of relativity, right? So from the astronaut's perspective, their own time is the proper time, and the time experienced in the Earth's frame (like the time it takes for the trip) is longer due to the effects of relativity.

But wait, no, wait. Let's clarify. The astronaut is in the spacecraft, which is their rest frame, so the proper time is the time they experience. The Earth would see the spacecraft moving very fast, so for Earth, the time would be longer because of time dilation. But the question is about the astronaut's own time, so we need to calculate the proper time.

So the key here is to compute the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the shortest time measured by the traveler, because in their frame, the Earth and the spacecraft are moving, but they themselves are at rest. So using the time dilation formula, the proper time τ is related to the coordinate time t by τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where v is the velocity.

Wait, but actually, in special relativity, the time experienced by the moving observer (the astronaut) is less than the time experienced in the Earth frame. So if we calculate the time from Earth's perspective, then multiply by the Lorentz factor, but wait no, the Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so tau (the astronaut's time) is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is 1/gamma.

So to find the time the astronaut experiences, we need to find the Earth's frame time (the time it takes to travel the distance as observed from Earth) multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait
