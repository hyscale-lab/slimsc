Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity equations, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So nucleus X is a lithium-6 nucleus.

Next, I should find the mass of this nucleus. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass of the electrons. But for a nucleus, electrons are part of the atom, so for a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. Since Li has 3 protons, it has 3 electrons.

But wait, when considering the nucleus itself, we're talking about the atomic mass unit, so the electrons aren't part of the nucleus. No, wait, the nucleus is just protons and neutrons. So to find the mass of the nucleus, I can use the mass of Li-6.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0175863238 amu. But wait, this includes the electrons as well? No, wait, the atomic mass is for the atom, which includes electrons. So to get the mass of the nucleus, I subtract the mass of the electrons. Since there are 3 electrons, each with a mass of about 0.00054858 amu (electron mass is about 5.4858e-4 amu), so 3 times that is 0.00164574 amu.

So the mass of the nucleus would be 6.0175863238 amu minus 0.00164574 amu. Let me calculate that: 6.0175863238 - 0.00164574 = approximately 6.01594058 amu. Wait, but wait a second, is that right? Or should I have just considered the mass of the nucleus as the sum of protons and neutrons? Because the atomic mass is the mass of the atom, which includes electrons, so for the nucleus, it's the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Alternatively, I can look up the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Another approach is to use the mass number. Wait, but perhaps I should just proceed with the atomic mass given.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The mass of the nucleus can be found using the mass of the atom minus the electrons. So let's proceed with that.

So for Li-6: atomic mass is approximately 6.0175863238 u. Number of electrons is 3, each with mass 0.00054858 u.
