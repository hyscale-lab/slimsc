Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through each part step by step.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. After both reactions are completed, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral stationary phase. The question is asking how many peaks the chemist would observe in each case.

Let me break down the problem.

First, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. Hexan-3-one is a ketone. So, when a ketone is treated with LAH, it gets reduced to a secondary alcohol. Since the starting material is (S)-configured at the 5-methoxy group, but wait, wait, the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

Wait, hexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at C3. So the structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2-O-Me. Wait, no, wait: 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon. Let me draw the structure.

Hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3? But wait, the 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon from the ketone. Let me number the carbons:

1   2   3   4   5   6
CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3

Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. The 5 position would be the fifth carbon from the start, but actually, numbering from the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)2-CH3. So the carbonyl is at position 3. The 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon of the six-carbon chain.
