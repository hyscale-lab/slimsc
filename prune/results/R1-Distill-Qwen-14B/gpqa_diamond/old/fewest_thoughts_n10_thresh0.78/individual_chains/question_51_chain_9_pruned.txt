Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question says: A charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of this system.

I remember that potential energy in electrostatics often involves the work done in bringing charges together. Since one of the objects is a conducting sphere, which is a conductor, I should consider how charges distribute on it.

Wait, the sphere is grounded. Oh right, grounding means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can flow to or from the Earth. For a conducting sphere, the charges will reside on the surface. But since it's grounded, if we bring a charge near it, the sphere can either gain or lose charge to maintain equilibrium.

Wait, but in this problem, I think the sphere is initially neutral. Because the charge q is placed near it, and the sphere is grounded, the sphere will induce charges. Let me think: when you place a charge near a conductor, charges are induced. Since the sphere is grounded, electrons can move in or out. If q is positive, the sphere's near side would have negative charges (attracted), and the far side positive. But because it's grounded, the sphere can lose electrons, so maybe the sphere's net charge remains zero? Or does it change?

Wait no, when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges can't just disappear. Wait, but if the sphere is isolated, then the induced charges would be on the surface. But if it's grounded, any excess charge can leave or enter the sphere. So, if the sphere is initially neutral, and you bring a charge q near it, the sphere's induced charges would be such that the sphere's net charge remains zero because it's connected to the Earth. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the sphere is conducting, so the induced charges are surface charges. But because it's grounded, the sphere's potential is zero. So the electric potential at the surface of the sphere is the same as the Earth's potential, which is zero.

So when a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center, it's outside the sphere because the sphere's radius is R. So the charge q is outside, and the sphere is a conductor, so the potential inside
