Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different l values. Oh right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) has an imaginary part that depends on these phase shifts. The formula I remember is something like Im f = (1/(2ik)) times the sum of (2l+1) times e^{iδ_l} multiplied by sin δ_l, right?

Wait, wait. Let me write that down. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude would be (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum over l of (2l + 1) multiplied by sin δ_l. Because e^{iδ} is cos δ + i sin δ, so when you take the imaginary part, the other terms disappear, leaving just the sin part.

But wait, what's k here? Oh right, k is the wave number. And since the electrons are 50 MeV, I need to calculate k. The formula for k is sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but I think it's easier to remember in terms of the Compton wavelength or use some constants.

Wait, the mass of an electron is 9.109e-31 kg. The energy E is 50 MeV. Oh wait, I should probably convert that into joules. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 50 MeV is 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-14 J.

But wait, electrons have rest mass energy. Let me calculate E in terms of their rest energy. The rest energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much larger, so the non-relativistic approximation might not hold, but perhaps the problem expects me to proceed regardless.

Wait, no. Wait, in scattering experiments, especially for electrons, relativistic effects can be significant. But maybe in this problem, we just proceed with the given data regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression for k uses the momentum p, where p = sqrt(2mE), assuming E is kinetic. Wait, but at 50 MeV, the kinetic energy would be much higher than the rest mass energy, so relativistic effects are significant. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should use the relativistic expression for the momentum. The energy of a relativistic particle is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So if E is given as 50 MeV, then the momentum p would be (sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )) / c.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, in high-energy physics, sometimes the relation p ≈ E is used because the rest mass is negligible compared to the energy. So if E is in MeV, then p ≈ E in MeV/c. So p would be about 50 MeV/c.

Wait, but for the Compton wavelength, the formula is λ = h/(m c), but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Alternatively, the wave number k is p / ħ c. Because p is in units of MeV/c, and ħ is in units that would make k dimensionless. So let's compute k.

Wait, let me think. Let's compute k in units that work. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV fm (since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm). So if p is in MeV/c, then k = p/(ħ c) would be p/(197.33 MeV fm) * (fm) because k is in 1/fm.

So for E=50 MeV, I need to find p. Using the relativistic energy formula E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 ). Solving for pc:

pc = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

But E is 50 MeV, m c^2 is 0.511 MeV. So (m c^2)^2 is negligible compared to E^2, so pc ≈ E. So pc ≈ 50 MeV.

Therefore, p ≈ 50 MeV / c. So k = p/( ħ c ) = (50 MeV/c) ) / (197.33 MeV fm) ). Because ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm, so the c cancels. So k ≈ 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that exactly: 50 divided by 197.33 is approximately 0.2535 fm^-1.

So k is approximately 0.2535 fm^-1.

Now, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by Im f = (1/(2ik)) * sum over l of (2l + 1) sin δ_l.

Wait, but the problem states to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. Wait, no, the measured phase shifts are given as δ_o, δ_1, δ_2, etc. So I guess we take those into account.

Wait, the problem says: "Ignore rest of the phase shifts." Hmm, perhaps it means you only consider the given δ's, perhaps they mean that higher l's beyond what is given are zero, but I'm not sure. But given the data δ0=90, δ1=67, δ2=55, δ3=30, δ4=13 degrees. Are these in radians? Probably in degrees, but I'll need to convert them.

Wait, the formula requires the phase shifts δ_l in radians. So I need to convert each δ from degrees to radians.

So, let's list them:

δ0 = 90 degrees → π/2 radians ≈ 1.5708 radians.

δ1 =67 degrees → 67 * π/180 ≈ 1.16937 radians.

δ2=55 degrees → 55 * π/180 ≈ 0.95993 radians.

δ3=30 degrees → 30 * π/180 = π/6 ≈ 0.5236 radians.

δ4=13 degrees → 13 * π/180 ≈ 0.2269 radians.

So the sum is over l=0 to l=4. So each term is (2l +1) * sin δ_l.

Let me compute each term:

For l=0: (2*0 +1)=1. sin(1.5708) is sin(90 degrees) = 1. So term is 1 * 1 =1.

l=1: 2*1 +1=3. sin(1.16937) → approximately sin(67 degrees)=0.9205 (I can compute it more accurately, but perhaps I can just calculate each using calculator steps.)

Wait, let me compute each sin(δ_l):

δ0: sin(90) =1.

δ1: sin(67°) ≈ 0.92050.

δ2: sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192.

δ3: sin(30°)=0.5.

δ4: sin(13°)≈0.22495.

Now, the terms:

l=0: 1 * 1 =1.

l=1: 3 * 0.92050 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2:5 * 0.8192 ≈4.096.

l=3:7 * 0.5 =3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495 ≈2.02455.

Sum these terms:

1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615.

3.7615 +4.096=7.8575.

7.8575 +3.5=11.3575.

11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

So the sum is approximately 13.382.

Now, compute Im f = (1/(2ik)) * sum.

Wait, the formula is (1/(2ik)) * sum. And I have k≈0.2535 fm^-1.

So 2ik is 2i *0.2535 fm^-1 = 0.507i fm^-1.

So 1/(2ik)= 1/(0.507i fm^-1) = (1/0.507i) * fm.

Hmm, reciprocal of i is -i, because 1/i = -i.

So 1/(0.507i) = (1/0.507) * (-i) = approximately (1.972) * (-i) ≈ -1.972i.

Wait, but wait, I think I should be careful with units here. Because k is in fm^-1, so 1/(2ik) would have units of fm.

Wait, but let me proceed.

So 1/(2ik) = 1/(2i * 0.2535 fm^-1) = 1/(0.507i fm^-1) = (1/0.507i) fm.

Which is (1/0.507) * (1/i) fm.

Which is the same as (1.972) * (-i) fm, because 1/i = -i.

So 1/(2ik) = (1.972)(-i) fm.

Now, multiply by the sum (13.382) to get Im f.

Im f = (13.382) * (1.972)(-i) fm.

Wait, but wait, no, the formula is (1/(2ik)) * sum, so:

Im f = (1/(2 i k)) * sum_of_terms.

Sum_of_terms is 13.382.

So Im f = (1/(2 i k)) * 13.382.

Plugging in the numbers:

(13.382) * (1/(2 i *0.2535)) )

Wait, 2 *0.2535=0.507.

So denominator is 0.507 i.

So 13.382/(0.507 i) = (13.382/0.507) * (1/i) = approximately (26.4) * (-i) ≈ -26.4i.

Wait, but that gives Im f in units of fm. So Im f is -26.4i fm.

Wait, but the question asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, I'm not sure about that. Wait, in scattering, the imaginary part of the amplitude is related to the cross-section, but perhaps I'm getting off track.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me go through the steps again.

First, sum up all the (2l+1)*sin δ_l terms:

l=0: 1*1=1.

l=1: 3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.0245=13.382.

So sum is 13.382.

Now, 2ik = 2 * i * k.

k is 50 MeV/(197.33 MeV fm) ) → 50/197.33 ≈ 0.2535 fm^-1.

So 2ik = 2i *0.2535 = 0.507i.

Now, 1/(2ik) = 1/(0.507 i ) = (1/0.507) * (1/i) ) = (1.972) * (-i) = -1.972 i.

Multiply by the sum:

Im f = (-1.972 i ) *13.382.

So Im f = (-1.972 *13.382) * i.

Calculating 1.972 *13.382:

1.972 *13 = 25.636.

1.972 *0.382 ≈ 0.753.

So total is approximately 25.636 + 0.753 = 26.389.

So Im f ≈ (-26.389) i.

The magnitude is 26.389, but since the question asks for the imaginary part (along the incident beam), perhaps the sign is unimportant, but the options are all positive.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula for the imaginary part is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, 1/(2ik) is (1/(2i k)).

But when I calculated this, with k positive, it becomes negative i times a positive number. So Im f is negative, but the options are positive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let's think again.

The formula for the scattering amplitude: f(θ) = sum [ (2l+1) ( sin δ_l )/(k r) ) ] e^{i δ_l} }, but maybe I'm mixing up the exact form.

Alternatively, the imaginary part of f is (1/(k)) sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1/(2i)).

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

The general expression for the scattering amplitude f is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l / (1 - cos δ_l) ) ] P_l (cos θ )

Wait, no, perhaps that's not right. Let me think. The partial wave expansion is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ (e^{2i δ_l} -1)/(2i k) ) ] P_l(cos θ)

So the amplitude is f = sum [ (2l +1) ( e^{i δ_l} ) ( e^{i δ_l} - e^{-i δ_l} )/(2i k) ) ] P_l.

Which simplifies to sum [ (2l +1) ( e^{i δ_l} ) ( 2i sin δ_l ) )/(2i k) ) ] P_l.

The 2i cancels, so (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l} / (k) * (1/(2i k)) ? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled here.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) e^{2i δ_l} P_l (cos θ)

But then the imaginary part would involve the imaginary component of e^{2i δ_l}.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for the imaginary part of f is:

Im f = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) P_l (cos θ)

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me look for another approach.

Wait, I think the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction is given by:

Im f = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, because when you take the imaginary part, the exponential terms may contribute.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula earlier. Let me re-examine.

The partial wave expansion for f(θ) is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ (e^{2i δ_l} - 1)/(2i k) ) ] P_l (cos θ)

So, let's compute this.

Each term is (2l+1) * (e^{2i δ_l} -1) / (2i k) ) * P_l.

Taking the imaginary part:

Im f = sum (2l+1) * Im [ (e^{2i δ_l} -1) / (2i k) ) ] * P_l (cos θ)

Because P_l is a real function. So:

Im [ (e^{2i δ} -1)/(2i k) ) ] = [ ( (cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ)) -1 )/(2i k) ) ].

Which simplifies to:

[ (cos 2δ -1) + i sin 2δ ) ] / (2i k )

Taking the imaginary part of that expression:

The imaginary part of the numerator is sin 2δ, and the denominator is 2i k. So the imaginary part is:

[ sin 2δ ] / (2i k ) * 1/(2i k )? Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, consider the expression:

(e^{iθ} -1) = e^{iθ/2} ( e^{iθ/2} - e^{-iθ/2} ) = 2i e^{iθ/2} sin(θ/2).

So, (e^{2i δ} -1) = 2i e^{iδ} sin δ.

So putting this back into the term:

(2i e^{i δ} sin δ ) / (2i k) ) = (e^{i δ} sin δ ) / k.

So the term becomes (2l+1) * (e^{i δ} sin δ ) / (k) ) * P_l.

So f(θ) = sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ /k ) P_l ].

The imaginary part of f is then the imaginary part of this sum.

Which would be sum [ (2l+1) ( sin δ * Im(e^{i δ} ) ) / k ) P_l ].

Since Im(e^{i δ}) = sin δ, this becomes sum [ (2l+1) sin^2 δ / k ) P_l ].

Wait, but that can't be right because then the imaginary part would be positive, but in our earlier approach, we had a negative value.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct formula for the imaginary part along the incident direction (θ=0, so cos θ=1) is:

Im f(θ=0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Because when θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for even l and 0 for odd l. Wait, no, P_l(1)=1 for all l. Because P_l(1)= 1, since it's the value at the pole.

Wait, so when θ=0, cos θ=1, so P_l(1) =1 for all l.

So the imaginary part would be Im f(0) = sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1/(2k)).

Wait, that makes sense. So the formula is Im f = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Ah, that's the correct formula! Earlier I thought it was (1/(2ik)), but with this approach, it's (1/(2k)).

Okay, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier by including the i in the denominator.

So, let me recalculate using this correct formula.

So Im f = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So, sum is 13.382 as before.

k is approximately 0.2535 fm^-1.

So Im f = (13.382) / (2 * 0.2535) ) fm.

Compute denominator: 2*0.2535=0.507.

So 13.382 / 0.507 ≈ 26.4.

So approximately 26.4 fm.

Looking at the options:

A) 87163.4 fm → way too big.

B)355.351 fm → larger.

C) 177.675 fm → bigger than our 26.4.

D)251.271 fm→ also larger.

Wait, none of the options match 26.4. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was correct, but I made a mistake with the formula.

Wait, let's recalculate. If the correct formula is Im f = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, then let's compute that.

sum is 13.382.

k=50 / 197.33 ≈0.2535 fm^-1.

so 2ik = 2i *0.2535=0.507i.

1/(0.507i) = (1/0.507) * (1/i) = 1.972 * (-i) ≈ -1.972i.

So, (1/(2ik)) = -1.972i.

Multiply by sum: 13.382 * (-1.972i) ≈ -26.389i.

So Im f is -26.389i fm. So the magnitude is 26.389 fm, but the options don't have this.

Wait, but the options are all much larger, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated k.

Wait, let's re-calculate k more accurately.

E is 50 MeV. The energy is in the center of mass frame? Or in the lab frame? Hmm, perhaps I should compute the momentum correctly.

In high-energy physics, the relation between energy and momentum is given by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So, solving for p:

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

E is 50 MeV. m c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

So E^2 = (50)^2 (MeV)^2 = 2500 (MeV)^2.

(m c^2)^2 = (0.511)^2 ≈0.261 (MeV)^2.

So p c = sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈49.99739 MeV.

So p c ≈49.99739 MeV.

So p = (49.99739 MeV)/ c.

k is given by k = p/(ħ c).

Because ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm, so:

k = (49.99739 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) = (49.99739 ) / (197.33) (1/(fm)).

So 49.99739 /197.33 ≈0.2535 fm^-1.

So same as before.

Wait, so why is the calculation giving me around 26 fm, but options are much larger, like 177, 251, etc.? Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps the formula should be Im f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f = sum [ (2l+1)/(2ik) ) ( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) P_l (cos θ) ]

So the imaginary part would be Im f = sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) Im( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) P_l (cos θ) ]

Because 1/(2ik) is (1/(2i k)), and when multiplied by (e^{2i δ} -1 ), which is (cos 2δ + i sin 2δ ) -1.

So (e^{2i δ} -1 ) = (cos 2δ -1) + i sin 2δ.

So when multiplied by (1/(2ik)), which is (1/(2i k )) = -i/(2k ), the imaginary part becomes:

sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) * sin 2δ_l * P_l (cos θ) ]

Because Im( (e^{2i δ} -1 ) ) is sin 2δ, and multiplied by (-i/(2k )) gives a real term.

So Im f = sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k) ) P_l (cos θ) ]

Along the incident direction, θ=0, so P_l(1)=1.

So Im f = sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k) ) ]

So that's the correct formula.

Ah, so I think I made a mistake earlier by using sin δ instead of sin(2 δ).

So now, I need to compute sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Let me compute each term.

l=0: 2*0+1=1. δ0=90 degrees. sin(180 degrees)=0. So term= 1*0=0.

l=1: 3. δ1=67. sin(134) ≈ sin(180-46)=sin(46)≈0.7193.

So term=3 * 0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2:5. δ2=55. 2δ=110. sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397.

So term=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7. δ3=30. 2δ=60. sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

Term=7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9. δ4=13. 2δ=26. sin(26)≈0.4384.

Term=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Now, sum these:

0 +2.1579=2.1579.

+4.6985=6.8564.

+6.062=12.9184.

+3.9456=16.864.

So the sum is approximately 16.864.

Now, compute Im f = sum / (2k).

k=0.2535 fm^-1.

So 2k=0.507 fm^-1.

So Im f = 16.864 / 0.507 ≈33.25 fm.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D:251.271 fm. Wait, no, 33 isn't close. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck the sum.

l=0 term is 1 * sin(180) =0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134) → 3 * 0.6691 ≈ 2.0073.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, sin(134 degrees) is sin(180-46)= sin(46)= approximately 0.7193.

Wait, 3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2: sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397. 5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3: sin(60)=0.8660. 7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4: sin(26)=0.4384.9 *0.4384=3.9456.

So sum is 0 +2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 = 16.864.

Hmm, 16.864 divided by (2k)=0.507.

16.864 /0.507≈33.25 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was correct and I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would give Im f = (sum) / (2ik).

But with sum=13.382, k=0.2535.

So 2ik=0.507i.

So 1/(2ik) = (1/0.507i ) = (1/0.507) * (-i) )=1.972 * (-i) ≈ -1.972i.

Multiply by sum: 13.382 * (-1.972i )= -26.389i.

So the magnitude is 26.389 fm. But none of the options match.

Wait, the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should use the non-relativistic expression for k. Let me try that.

In non-relativistic case, E ≈ p²/(2m).

So p = sqrt(2mE).

m is electron mass =9.109e-31 kg.

E=50 MeV=50e6 * 1.602e-19 J=8.01e-14 J.

p = sqrt( 2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-14 J ) = sqrt( 1.458e-44 ) ≈ 3.82e-22 kg m/s.

Then, k= p/ħ. ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

k=3.82e-22 /1.05457e-34 ≈3.62e12 m^-1.

Convert to fm^-1: 1 m=1e15 fm, so 3.62e12 m^-1 =3.62e12 / (1e15 fm) )=3.62e-3 fm^-1.

Wait, that's about 0.00362 fm^-1.

So k =0.00362 fm^-1.

Then, using the formula Im f= (sum)/(2k ), sum=13.382.

So Im f=13.382/(2*0.00362) ≈13.382/(0.00724 )≈1851 fm.

But that's even bigger than the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of something else. Wait, perhaps the units are off.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is given in the lab frame, and the target is a nucleus, so the nuclear target's mass is much larger, so the electron's energy is non-relativistic in the nucleus' rest frame.

Wait, but the problem states that the electrons are 50 MeV, which is much higher than their rest mass (~0.5 MeV), so relativistic.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the wave number using relativistic energy.

Earlier, I got k ≈0.2535 fm^-1.

But perhaps I should calculate k more accurately.

Wait, with E=50 MeV, the momentum is p = sqrt(E^2 - (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / c ≈50 MeV /c.

So p = 50 MeV/c.

k = p/(ħ c) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm ) =50/(197.33) fm^-1 ≈0.2535 fm^-1.

So k≈0.2535 fm^-1.

If using the correct formula, Im f=(sum sin 2δ )/(2k ), sum=16.864, k=0.2535.

So Im f=16.864/(2*0.2535 )=16.864/(0.507)=33.25 fm.

But none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A)87163.4 fm → way too big.

B)355.351 fm.

C)177.675 fm.

D)251.271 fm.

Hmm, 33 is not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would make Im f = (sum) * (1/(2ik )).

sum is 13.382.

k=0.2535.

So 2ik=0.507i.

1/(0.507i )= (1/0.507) * (-i )= -1.972 i.

So Im f = 13.382 * (-1.972 i ) = -26.389 i.

So the magnitude is 26.389 fm, but the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10^something in the calculation of k.

Wait, when calculating hbar c, it's about 197.33 MeV fm. So 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) =0.2535 fm^-1.

But perhaps I should express k in units of 1/m instead.

Wait, 1 fm=1e-15 m, so 0.2535 fm^-1=0.2535e15 m^-1.

But that's a huge number. Then, in Im f calculation:

If Im f = (sum)/(2k ), with sum=13.382, and k=0.2535e15 m^-1.

Wait, 2k=0.507e15 m^-1.

So 13.382 / (0.507e15 )=approx 2.64e-15 m.

Wait, 2.64e-15 meters is 2.64 femtometers, which is 2.64 fm.

No, same as before.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should have a factor of ħ c.

Wait, maybe I should express the phase shifts in terms of radians and recheck.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives Im f ≈ -26.389i fm.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2ik )

Which is sum=13.382, 2ik=0.507i.

So 13.382/(0.507i )= (26.4 )/(i )=26.4*(-i ), so magnitude of 26.4.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the units again. Perhaps the formula should have k in units of inverse meters, but then the result would be in meters, which is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the angular dependence.

Wait, the problem asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0. So perhaps the formula is Im f(θ=0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But perhaps the formula is slightly different. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the differential cross-section, which is |f|^2, but the question is about the imaginary part of f.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(k).

So Im f=13.382 /0.2535 ≈52.77 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the sum. Let me recheck.

Sum for l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) sin δ_l (in degrees):

l=0: (1)*sin(90)=1.

l=1:3*sin(67)≈3*0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5*sin(55)≈5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7*sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*sin(13)=9*0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615. +4.096=7.8575. +3.5=11.3575. +2.02455=13.382.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, and the actual formula is Im f = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2ik ) * something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the optical theorem, which says that the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

The optical theorem states that σ_total =4π |f(0)|^2, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, no, the optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

The theorem says:

σ_total = (4π/k) Im [ f(0) ]

So σ_total =4π/k * Im f(0).

So if I can compute Im f(0), I can find the cross-section, but the problem is asking for Im f, not the cross-section.

But perhaps the formula is Im f = k/(4π) σ_total.

But I don't have the cross-section given, so that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im f is (1/ (2ik )) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives Im f= -26.389i fm. But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the magnitude of Im f, which is 26.389 fm.

But the options don't have that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the formula. Let me look for a reference.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

Im f = (1/(2ik )) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives, as calculated, Im f= -26.389i fm.

But the options are in the hundreds or thousands of fm. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in k.

Wait, another approach to compute k:

E = 50 MeV.

The wavelength λ = h/(p c).

Wait, p= gamma m v. But perhaps it's easier to compute with E=pc for relativistic cases, so λ=h/(E c) ).

Wait, h=6.626e-34 J s.

But E=50 MeV =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J=8.01e-14 J.

So λ= (6.626e-34 J s ) / (8.01e-14 J * 3e8 m/s ) )=6.626e-34/(2.403e-5)=≈2.757e-29 m=2.757e-14 fm.

So k=1/λ= (1/(2.757e-14 fm )) )=3.626e13 fm^-1.

Wait, that's way larger than before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me compute it again.

E=50 MeV =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J =8.01e-14 J.

p=E/c (since E=pc for relativistic).

So p=8.01e-14 J / (3e8 m/s )=2.67e-22 kg m/s.

k= p/ħ=2.67e-22 /1.05457e-34 ≈2.53e12 m^-1.

Convert to fm^-1: 1 m=1e15 fm, so 2.53e12 m^-1 =2.53e12 /1e15 fm^-1=2.53e-3 fm^-1.

Hmm, that's 0.00253 fm^-1.

So k=0.00253 fm^-1.

Now, using the formula Im f= sum/(2k ), sum=13.382.

Im f=13.382 / (2*0.00253 )=13.382 /0.00506 ≈2646 fm.

Which is close to option B (355) and D (251), but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, 13.382 / (2 *0.00253 )=13.382 /0.00506≈2644.

Hmm, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the units for k. Let me try using the value of k as 0.2535 fm^-1.

Im f= sum/(2k )=13.382/(2*0.2535 )=13.382/0.507≈26.4 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f= sum/(k ), not divided by 2.

Then 13.382 /0.2535 ≈52.77 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiply by (1/k ) / (2i ).

Wait, let me think: Im f= (1/(2ik )) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So with k=0.2535, sum=13.382.

Im f= (13.382 )/(2i *0.2535 )=13.382 / (0.507i )= (13.382 /0.507 ) * (1/i )=26.4 * (-i ).

Thus, Im f= -26.4 i fm. So magnitude 26.4 fm.

Not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (k ).

Which gives 13.382 / 0.2535 ≈52.77 fm.

Again, not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the units.

The options are in fm. My calculation gives approximately 26.4 fm, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f = (1/(2ik )) * sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} ) * sin δ_l.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using the given phase shifts, compute the sum, then multiply by (1/(2ik )).

But I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the sum to be multiplied by  (e^{i δ_l } - e^{-i δ_l} )/(2i ), which would give sin δ_l.

But perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im f = (1/(2ik )) * sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l } - e^{-i δ_l } ) * something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im f = (1/k ) * sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/2 ).

Which is the same as the formula I used earlier.

I'm stuck. The only possibility is that I made a miscalculation in the sum or somewhere else.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum with the formula Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k ).

sum=13.382, 2k=0.507.

13.382 /0.507≈26.4.

But the options don't have this.

Looking at the options, C is 177.675 fm. If I made a mistake and multiplied by 6.72, I would get 177.

Wait, 26.4 *6.72≈177.6.

How? Where would 6.72 come from?

Wait, perhaps I should have multiplied by (ħ c) somewhere.

Wait, the formula Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k ), and k= p/(ħ c ).

So, k= p/(ħ c )= (50 MeV/c )/(197.33 MeV fm )=0.2535 fm^-1.

Wait, but Im f= (sum )/(2k )=13.382/(0.507 )=26.4 fm.

But wait, if I instead compute sum * (ħ c )/(2k ), then:

sum=13.382.

(ħ c )=197.33 MeV fm.

So sum*(197.33 )/(2k )=13.382 *197.33/(2*0.2535 )

Denominator:2 *0.2535 =0.507.

So 13.382 *197.33 ≈2644.

2644 /0.507 ≈5223 fm.

But that's way bigger than options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute Im f in units of fm, but using k in units of 1/m.

Wait, k=0.2535 fm^-1=0.2535e15 m^-1.

So 1/(2k )=1/(0.507e15 )=1.97e-15 m.

So Im f= sum *1.97e-15 m.

Wait, sum=13.382.

So 13.382 *1.97e-15 ≈2.64e-14 m=26.4 fm.

Again, same result.

Hmm. I'm stuck. All calculations lead to Im f≈26.4 fm, but none of the options match. Perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shift values.

Wait, the given phase shifts are δ0=90, δ1=67, δ2=55, δ3=30, δ4=13.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the phase shifts in radians, but perhaps I should have used a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(2ik )) * (ħ c )^2.

Wait, but that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2k ).

Which would be sum * (197.33 MeV fm )/(2k ).

k=0.2535 fm^-1.

So Im f=13.382 *197.33 MeV fm/(2 *0.2535 )=13.382 *197.33/(0.507 ) fm.

13.382 *197.33=2644.0.

2644.0 /0.507≈5222.8 fm.

Which is way larger than the options.

Hmm. I'm really confused. Perhaps I should look at the options and see if any are close to 26.4 and see if any are in the same ballpark. But the options are A: ~8e4 fm, B: ~355 fm, C: ~177 fm, D: ~251 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * ħ c / (2k ).

So Im f= sum * ħ c/(2k ).

sum=13.382.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

k=0.2535 fm^-1.

So Im f=13.382 *197.33 / (2 *0.2535 ) fm.

13.382 *197.33 ≈2644.

Divide by (0.507 ): 2644 /0.507≈5223 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c )/(2k ).

Which is same as above.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c) / (2ik ).

Which would be sum * (197.33) / (2i *k ).

k=0.2535.

So 2i k=0.507i.

So 197.33 /0.507i = 389.07 /i = -389.07i.

Multiply by sum=13.382:

13.382 * (-389.07i )= -5203.7i.

So Im f= -5203.7i fm.

But that's 5203 fm, which is option A:87163.4, no. But option A is much larger.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should give up and choose the closest option, which is C:177.675 fm, but I don't see how to get that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and the sum is 13.382 multiplied by 13.382. No, that leads to 179, which is near option C.

Wait, (sum)^2= (13.382)^2 ≈179. So 179 fm. Close to option C:177.675.

But I don't see why I would square the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f= (sum)^2/(2k ), which would be (13.382)^2 / (0.507 )=179/(0.507 )≈353 fm, which is close to option B:355.351.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f= sum * (ħ c )/(2k ), which would be 13.382 *197.33 /0.507 ≈ (2643.7) /0.507≈5223 fm, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f= sum * (1/k ), which would be 13.382/0.2535≈52.77 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the phase shifts in terms of their contribution to the scattering amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula includes the sum multiplied by (1/(2ik )) and 1/k, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm.

But I'm not confident. I'll proceed with the calculation I did earlier and see.


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, the problem involves using the given phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ$, $\delta_1 = 67^\circ$, $\delta_2 = 55^\circ$, $\delta_3 = 30^\circ$, and $\delta_4 = 13^\circ$. The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im } f = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \sin \delta_l,
\]

where $k$ is the wave number, calculated as:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar c},
\]

and $p$ is the momentum of the electron. For a relativistic electron with energy $E = 50 \, \text{MeV}$, the momentum is approximated as $p \approx E/c$. Using $\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}$, the wave number is:

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.2535 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

The sum $\sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \sin \delta_l$ is computed for the given phase shifts:

\[
\begin{aligned}
l=0: & \, (2(0)+1) \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1, \\
l=1: & \, (2(1)+1) \sin(67^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot 0.9205 = 2.7615, \\
l=2: & \, (2(2)+1) \sin(55^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot 0.8192 = 4.096, \\
l=3: & \, (2(3)+1) \sin(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5, \\
l=4: & \, (2(4)+1) \sin(13^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot 0.22495 = 2.02455.
\end{aligned}
\]

Summing these terms gives:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin \delta_l \approx 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.02455 = 13.382.
\]

Substituting into the formula for $\text{Im } f$:

\[
\text{Im } f = \frac{13.382}{2 \cdot 0.2535} \approx \frac{13.382}{0.507} \approx 26.4 \, \text{fm}.
\]

However, none of the provided options match this result. Upon reviewing the options, the closest plausible answer based on potential rounding or alternative interpretations of the formula is **C) 177.675 fm**, though the reasoning to reach this value is unclear. The calculations consistently yield approximately $26.4 \, \text{fm}$, suggesting a possible discrepancy in the problem setup or options.

Answer: C
