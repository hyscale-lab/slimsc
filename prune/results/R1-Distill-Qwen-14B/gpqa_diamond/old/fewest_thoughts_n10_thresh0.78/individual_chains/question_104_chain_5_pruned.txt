Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let's read the question carefully.

So, there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets.

Planet #1 caused a spectral line shift of up to 5 milliangstroms. Planet #2's host star has a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how much longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )^(1/ something...) Hmm, maybe I should look up the exact formula or think about it.

Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/ something) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law. Because both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses, but the RV shifts are different.

Wait, Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis divided by the sum of the masses. But in this case, since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the period squared is proportional to a cubed over M_star.

But how does this relate to the RV method? Oh right, the RV method measures the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/ something) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I can simplify this. Since the two stars are identical (same mass as Sun), and the planets' masses are similar (same as Neptune), sin i would be approximately 1 for both since they're in circular orbits, and edge-on would give maximum shift, but perhaps we can assume both are edge-on for simplicity, though in reality sin i
