Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

The question says we have two nucleons in a 1S0 state. Wait, 1S0—so that term symbol is (2S+1)L J. Right, so S is 0 because it's S0. So 2*0+1 =1, so the (2S+1) part is 1, which makes sense for singlet state. The L is S, so orbital angular momentum l=0. And J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0, and T is the isospin? Wait, maybe I should think about the isospin first.

The problem states that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, no, the given equation is T(NN) = S + L + 1 mod 2. Wait, but the NN system's T is given as 0. So let's plug that in: 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2, that is, odd.

Wait, but the initial state's S and L. The initial state is 1S0, which has S=0, L=0. So before emission, S_initial=0, L_initial=0. So in the initial state, S_initial + L_initial = 0 + 0 = 0. But after emission, the NN state has T=0. So their T is 0, and according to the equation, 0 = S_NN + L_NN +1 mod 2. So S_NN + L_NN = 1 mod 2. So the sum of the NN's spin and orbital angular momentum must be odd.

Now, the process is that the NN emits a particle X. So the initial state is 1S0 (so NN in state S=0, L=0, J=0, isospin T=?), and the final state is NN plus X. Wait, but the problem says the final NN state has T=0. So the total system would be NN and X, but I think the problem is focusing on the NN's state after emission.

Wait, no. The question is about the parity and angular momentum conservation. So when the NN emit X, the total angular momentum and parity must be conserved. Also, the problem states that the particle X has intrinsic parity -1.

So the initial parity is for the 1S0 state. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L, since L is the orbital angular momentum. The initial state has L=0, so parity is (+1). Because (-1)^0 is 1.

The final state is the NN state plus X. The parity of the final state must be the product of the intrinsic parities of the NN state and X. Because parity is multiplicative under tensor products.

Wait, but wait. The initial NN state's parity is (parity of NN initial state) = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0=1. So initial parity is +1.

X has intrinsic parity -1. So the final parity of the system (NN plus X) should be the product of their intrinsic parities. But wait, the parity of the NN state after emission and the X particle.

So, parity_final = parity_NN_final * parity_X. Because when you have two particles, their combined parity is the product of their individual parities.

But the initial parity is 1. So 1 = parity_NN_final * (-1). So parity_NN_final must be -1. Because 1 = (-1) * (-1).

So the NN's final state has parity -1. The parity of the NN state is determined by (-1)^L_final, where L_final is the orbital angular momentum of the NN in the final state. So:

parity_NN_final = (-1)^{L_final} = -1. So (-1)^{L_final} = -1 implies that L_final is odd: L_final = 1, 3, etc. But since we're looking at angular momentum states, the possible L values for the NN would be 0,1,2,... but in the options, we can see the possible L values.

Wait, but each option gives the final state of the NN. Wait, no, the options are about the emitted X. Let me look at the options. Each option is like 1S0 → something. So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is the NN in, say, 7D1, and X is p (proton? Or maybe p stands for some other particle with spin and parity).

Wait, in each option, the final state is given as something like 7D1 + p. So the NN is in a 7D1 state, and X is p.

Wait, no, perhaps the notation is 1S0 → 3S1 + p. So the NN goes from 1S0 to 3S1, and emits a particle p. So the NN's state is 3S1, and X is p.

But I'm not entirely sure about the notation. Alternatively, perhaps the emitted particle is another nucleon, but that's probably not the case. Wait, X is a particle with intrinsic parity -1. So for example, if X is a pion, which has intrinsic parity -1, or perhaps a neutron or proton. Wait, but protons and neutrons have intrinsic parity +1. Wait, no: For the pion, the parity is -1. For nucleons, like protons and neutrons, their intrinsic parity is +1. So if X is a pion, then parity is -1. Alternatively, maybe X is a meson. But the question says X has intrinsic parity -1, so X could be a pion, for instance.

But perhaps that's not essential for solving the problem. Let's get back to the parity consideration.

From the initial state, the parity is 1. The final state parity is (parity of NN final) * (parity of X). So 1 = parity_NN_final * (parity_X). Since parity_X is given as -1, then parity_NN_final must be -1. So parity_NN_final = -1.

Which means that the orbital angular momentum L of the NN final state is odd. So L_final must be odd.

Now, from the Pauli statistics condition, T(NN) = S + L + 1 mod 2, and T(NN)=0. So S + L +1 ≡0 mod 2 → S + L ≡1 mod 2. So S and L have opposite parity.

But what are S and L for the NN in the final state?

The final state of the NN is, for example, in option A: 7D1. So D is l=2. Wait, the notation is (2S+1)L J. So 7D1: (2S+1)=7 → S=3. L is D, which is l=2. J is 1.

Wait, but the NN is a two-nucleon system. So their total spin S is the sum of their individual spins. For identical fermions, the Pauli exclusion applies, and their spin must be antisymmetric if their spatial part is symmetric, etc. But maybe that's getting a bit ahead.

Wait, the final state's NN has some spin S and orbital angular momentum L. So from the term symbol, like 7D1: 7 is (2S+1), so S=3. L is D→2. J is 1.

So for the final state, S=3, L=2. So S + L =5 → odd. So 5 mod 2 is 1, which satisfies S + L ≡1 mod 2. So that would be okay.

Wait, but wait. Let's check each option.

Each option is initial state → final (NN term) + X.

We need to compute for each option:

1. Check whether the parity of the NN in the final state is -1. Because parity_NN_final must be (-1)^L = -1 → L must be odd.

2. Check whether in the final NN state, S and L satisfy S + L ≡1 mod 2. Because T=0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L must be 1 mod 2.

So for each option, let's consider the NN's final state.

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

So the NN in the final state is 7D1. So (2S+1)=7 → S=3. L is D→2. J=1. So S=3, L=2.

Parity: (-1)^2 = +1. But earlier we concluded that parity_NN_final must be -1. So this would require parity_NN_final = -1. So option A would have parity +1. That's a problem. So this would violate the parity conservation, which says that parity_NN_final must be -1. So option A is not allowed.

Wait, but wait. Wait, this might not be correct. Because the parity of the final state is the product of the NN and X's parities. Oh, wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:

The initial parity is 1 (since 1S0 has L=0). The final parity is parity_NN_final * parity_X. So 1 = parity_NN_final * (-1). So parity_NN_final must be -1.

So for the NN's final state, parity_NN_final = (-1)^L_final = -1 → L_final must be odd.

So in option A: final NN state is 7D1. D is L=2. So (-1)^2 = +1. Which doesn't match the required -1. So this would make the final parity (1) * (-1) = -1, which is not the same as the initial parity, which was +1. So in this case, the parity wouldn't be conserved. So option A is not allowed.

Wait, but wait, the initial parity is 1. After emitting X, the total parity is (parity_NN_final) * (parity_X). So 1 = (parity_NN_final) * (-1) → parity_NN_final = -1. So any option where the NN's parity is -1 is okay.

How do we get parity_NN_final = -1? That would require that L_final is odd, because (-1)^L_final = -1 implies L_final is odd.

So let's check each option:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 → even → parity is +1 → parity_NN_final = +1. So the product would be (+1) * (-1) = -1. But initial parity is +1. So 1 = (-1) → No, which is a problem. So option A's parity doesn't match, so it's not allowed.

Option B: 3S1 → L=0 (since S is for spin, but the orbital angular momentum is given by the letter. So 3S1: S is (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S→L=0. So parity_NN_final is (-1)^0 = +1. So again, the product would be +1 * (-1) = -1, which doesn't match initial parity of +1. So option B is also parity violating. So it's not allowed.

Wait, but wait. Let's make sure. Option B is 3S1: so (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S→0. So L=0. So parity is (+1). So same issue as option A.

Option C: 3D3 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is D→2. So parity is (-1)^2 = +1. Again, product would be +1*(-1)=-1. Initial is +1. So this is not allowed. So option C would have parity not conserved.

Option D: 3P0 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is P→1. So parity is (-1)^1 = -1. So product is (-1)*(-1)=1, which matches initial parity. So parity is conserved here.

Wait, but wait, option D: 3P0 → L=1 (since P is l=1). So parity of NN is (-1)^1 =-1. So parity_final = (-1) * (-1) = 1, which matches initial parity of 1. So this is okay.

So from the parity standpoint, only option D has the correct parity.

Wait, but the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. So the other options (A, B, C) have parity issues, but D doesn't.

Wait, no, let's see: the options are A, B, C, D. The correct one must have parity conserved. So only D has parity conserved. The others have parity not conserved, so they're not allowed. But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the options that don't conserve parity are invalid, so which of them is not permitted.

Wait, but the question states that we have to choose the one that is not permitted. So among the options, which one either doesn't conserve parity or doesn't satisfy the isospin condition.

Wait, but I think I need to check both conditions for each option: parity conservation and the isospin condition.

Wait, no, the problem says to make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So both must be conserved.

So let's proceed.

For each option:

We'll check:

1. Parity: Does parity_NN_final * parity_X equal initial parity?

2. Angular momentum: Can the angular momentum of the emitted particle (X) account for the change in angular momentum of the NN?

Wait, but perhaps the angular momentum part is more about whether the partial wave (i.e., the orbital angular momentum l of X) is allowed. Because when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle contributes to the total angular momentum.

Wait, in the case of two particles, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle relative to the NN would have to be such that the initial and final angular momenta are conserved. But the problem is probably considering the orbital angular momentum of X as the partial wave (like s, p, d, f).

Wait, but to model this, the initial state has angular momentum J_initial = 0 (since 1S0). The final state has the NN in some state with J_NN, and X with j_X. So the total angular momentum after emission must sum to J_initial.

But perhaps for each option, the orbital angular momentum of X (given by the lower case letter) must satisfy some condition.

Wait, but the problem states that the emission is accompanied by the NN state. So the process is NN (initial) → NN (final) + X.

So angular momentum must be conserved. The initial angular momentum is J_initial=0.

The final state has the NN with J_NN and X with j_X. But the total angular momentum would be the vector sum of J_NN and j_X, and it must equal 0. But since angular momentum is a vector, the only way their sum is zero is if J_NN and j_X are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But for this to happen, they would have to be the same magnitude. So J_NN and j_X must have the same magnitude but opposite directions.

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to consider the orbital angular momentum of X, which is given in the options as the lower case letter (like p, s, etc.), and consider the change in the NN's orbital angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps the process is an emission via orbital angular momentum. So the initial state is NN with L_initial=0 (1S0). The final state is NN with L_final and X with orbital angular momentum l. So the orbital angular momentum must satisfy L_initial = L_final + l. But since L_initial is 0, L_final + l =0. But orbital angular momentum can't be negative, so this would imply that l = -L_final. But that's not possible. So perhaps a better approach is to think in terms of the total angular momentum conservation.

Wait, maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is l, which is the same as the value given in the options (e.g., p is l=1, s is l=0, d is l=2, f is l=3).

In this case, when X is emitted, the NN's orbital angular momentum changes from L_initial=0 to L_final. So the process would involve the transfer of angular momentum from the X to the NN. So the total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial angular momentum is J_initial =0 (since it's 1S0, J=0). The final state's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN's J and X's j.

But j for X would be its total angular momentum, which depends on its spin and orbital angular momentum. But since X is a spin-0 particle? Or wait, the problem says X is a particle with intrinsic parity -1. But without knowing its spin, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the orbital angular momentum of X, denoted by the lower case letter.

Wait, perhaps the problem is taking the lower case letter as the orbital angular momentum of X. So for example, option A: X is p, which is l=1.

So in that case, the total angular momentum after emission must be zero (since initial is zero). So the vector sum of the NN's J and X's j must be zero. Therefore, the NN's J must equal the X's j in magnitude and opposite in direction.

But for this to happen, the NN's J must have the same magnitude as X's j. So for example, if X has orbital angular momentum l=1 (p), then its j would be sqrt(l(l+1))ħ, so j=1. So the NN's J would have to be 1 as well.

But let's think about each option.

For each option, X's orbital angular momentum is given by the lower case letter.

Option A: X is p → l=1.

So X's j is 1.

NN's final J is 1 (from 7D1: J=1).

So the vector sum could be zero if J_NN and j_X are opposite and equal. So that's possible.

But wait, we also have to consider the orbital angular momentum of the NN.

Wait, the NN's state has S (spin) and L (orbital angular momentum) leading to J. So, for the final state, the NN's J is given by the term symbol, and X's j is given by the lower case letter (its orbital angular momentum l).

But perhaps the problem is more about the allowed values of L_final and l (for X) such that the angular momentum is conserved.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me think again.

The initial state has L_initial=0. The final state has the NN with L_final and X with l. So the orbital angular momentum must satisfy:

L_initial = L_final + l → 0 = L_final + l → L_final = -l.

But l is a non-negative integer, so L_final must be equal to l but in the opposite direction. But since L and l are magnitudes, negative doesn't make sense. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the total angular momentum. The initial state has J=0.

The final state has J_NN and j_X. So J_initial = J_NN + j_X. But since J_initial is 0, the only way this can happen is if J_NN and j_X are equal and opposite. So |J_NN| = |j_X|.

But j_X depends on X's spin and orbital angular momentum. But the problem only gives the orbital angular momentum for X (the lower case letter). Let me assume that X's spin is 0 for simplicity (like a pion, which is a spin-0 particle). Then j_X = l.

So for the final state, J_NN = - j_X → |J_NN| = j_X = l.

So the NN's J in the final state must be equal to l.

Let's check each option:

Option A: X is p → l=1. So j_X=1. NN's J is 1 (from 7D1). So |J_NN|=1 = l=1. So this is allowed.

Option B: X is s → l=0. j_X=0. So NN's J must be 0. The final state is 3S1 → J=1. So |J_NN|=1 which doesn't equal l=0. So this can't happen. So option B would violate angular momentum conservation.

Option C: X is f → l=3. j_X=3. NN's J is 3 (from 3D3). So |J_NN|=3 = l=3. So this is allowed.

Option D: X is s → l=0. j_X=0. So NN's J must be 0. The final state is 3P0 → J=0, which is allowed. So this is allowed.

Wait, but in option B, the NN's J is 1, and X's j is 0. So J_NN + j_X = 1 + 0 =1, which isn't zero. So this violates angular momentum conservation. So option B is not allowed.

But wait, earlier in the parity consideration, all options except D had parity issues. But in the angular momentum consideration, only option B is not allowed.

Hmm, but this seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, the initial state has J_initial=0. The final state must have total J=0. So the vector sum of J_NN and j_X must be zero. So J_NN must equal j_X in magnitude and opposite in direction.

But for this to happen, J_NN and j_X must have the same magnitude. So J_NN = j_X.

So for each option, let's compute J_NN and j_X.

Assuming X has spin 0, j_X = l (its orbital angular momentum).

Option A: X is p → l=1 → j_X=1. NN's J is 1 (from 7D1). So J_NN =1 = j_X. So yes, they can cancel each other, leading to total J=0.

Option B: X is s → l=0 → j_X=0. NN's J is 1. So 1 + 0 can't be zero. So this is not allowed.

Option C: X is f → l=3 → j_X=3. NN's J is 3 (from 3D3). So 3 and 3 can cancel if their directions are opposite. So allowed.

Option D: X is s → j_X=0. NN's J is 0. So 0 +0=0. Allowed.

So from angular momentum conservation, options B is not allowed.

But earlier, from parity conservation, only option D has the correct parity, and others don't. But this can't be, because the problem says that the parity and angular momentum must both be conserved. So the option that doesn't satisfy either condition is not allowed.

But wait, let's think again. The problem says that the final NN state has T=0. So we must also ensure that for the final NN state, T=0, which requires that S + L is odd (from the equation T= S + L +1 mod 2).

So let's check each option's final NN state for this condition.

Option A: NN is 7D1 → S=3 (since (2S+1)=7 → S=3), L=2. S+L=5, which is odd → satisfies S+L ≡1 mod 2. So this is allowed.

Option B: NN is 3S1 → S=1, L=0. S+L=1 → odd → allowed.

Option C: NN is 3D3 → S=1, L=2. S+L=3 → odd → allowed.

Option D: NN is 3P0 → S=1, L=1. S+L=2 → even → doesn't satisfy the condition. Because T=0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L must be 1 mod 2. In option D, S+L=2 → 0 mod 2. So 0 ≡1 mod 2 → no. So this violates the isospin condition.

Wait, but earlier parity considerations said option D's parity is correct. But isospin condition isn't satisfied.

Wait, but the problem states that the final NN state must have T=0, which requires S + L +1 ≡0 mod 2 → S + L ≡1 mod 2.

So for each option, check S and L of the NN final state.

Option A: S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 → 1 mod 2 → yes.

Option B: S=1, L=0 → 1+0=1 → yes.

Option C: S=1, L=2 → 3 → yes.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → 2 → no. So option D's isospin condition isn't satisfied.

So option D is not allowed.

But earlier, from angular momentum consideration, option B is not allowed because J doesn't match. So which one is the correct answer?

Wait, the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So which option either fails parity conservation or the isospin condition.

So let's reevaluate each option:

Option A:

- Parity: NN's L=2 → parity = +1. X's parity = -1. So total parity is (+1)*(-1) = -1, which doesn't match initial parity of +1. So parity not conserved → option A invalid.

Option B:

- Parity: NN's L=0 → parity=+1. X's parity=-1. So total parity = (+1)*(-1) =-1 → doesn't match initial +1. So invalid.

But angular momentum: J_NN=1, j_X=0 → can't sum to 0. So invalid.

Option C:

- Parity: NN's L=2 → parity=+1. X's parity=-1. So total parity = +1 * -1 = -1 → initial is +1 → invalid.

But angular momentum: J_NN=3, j_X=3 → can sum to 0. So invalid because of parity.

Option D:

- Parity: NN's L=1 → parity=-1. X's parity=-1. So total parity = (-1)*(-1)=1 → matches initial. So parity is conserved.

- Angular momentum: J_NN=0, j_X=0 → sum to 0. So allowed.

But isospin condition: S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → even. So T=0 → T= S + L +1 mod 2 → (1 +1 +1)=3 mod 2=1 → T=1, but given T=0. So this violates isospin condition. So option D is invalid.

Wait, but this is getting confusing. So which options are invalid?

Option A: parity invalid, angular momentum allowed, isospin allowed → invalid due to parity.

Option B: parity invalid, angular momentum invalid → invalid.

Option C: parity invalid, angular momentum allowed → invalid.

Option D: parity valid, angular momentum valid, but isospin invalid → invalid.

So all options except D have parity invalid, and D's isospin is invalid.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So let's look for the options that either have parity not conserved, or the isospin condition not satisfied.

Option D: parity is conserved, but isospin condition is not. So it's invalid.

So the valid options are those where all three conditions are met: parity, angular momentum, and isospin.

Looking back, let's see:

Only option D has parity conserved. But its isospin condition is not met. So it's invalid.

The other options have parity not conserved, so they are invalid.

But the problem states that the NN emits X, so the initial state must have the same parity as the product of the final NN and X parities.

So the only option that has correct parity is D.

But D's isospin condition is not met. So it's invalid.

So which of the options is invalid because it either doesn't conserve parity or doesn't meet isospin condition.

So the correct answer would be the option that doesn't satisfy one of these conditions.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer is the one that doesn't conserve either parity or angular momentum or doesn't meet the isospin condition.

So the options are:

A) 1S0 →7D1 + p → parity invalid.

B) →3S1 + s → parity invalid, angular momentum invalid.

C) →3D3 + f → parity invalid.

D) →3P0 + s → parity valid, angular momentum valid (J=0 and j=0), but isospin invalid (S+L=2, even → T= (1+1 +1) mod 2= 3 mod2=1 → T=1, but given T=0 → invalid.

So all options are invalid except none. Wait, this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the isospin condition.

The equation given is T(NN) = S + L + 1 mod 2.

Wait, when I plug in the values for option D:

S=1, L=1.

So T=1 +1 +1 mod2 → 3 mod 2 =1.

But the given T=0. So it's not allowed. So option D is invalid.

So the only option that has correct parity is D, but it fails isospin. The others fail parity.

So the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So looking at the options, the one that doesn't satisfy either parity or isospin is the answer.

But the question is about the partial wave of X, which is given by the lower case letter.

Wait, the options list the emitted particle as p, s, f, etc. So perhaps the 'p' is a pion, which has spin 0 and parity -1. 's' would be a spin 0 particle like a photon? No, wait, photons have spin 1. So perhaps 's' refers to an s-wave, which is orbital angular momentum l=0.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's recap:

The problem is asking which partial wave (denoted by the lower case letter) is not permitted.

Each option lists the emitted particle as p, s, f, etc., which denote the orbital angular momentum l of X.

The allowed orbital angular momentum l must be such that when X is emitted, the total parity and angular momentum are conserved, and the isospin condition is met.

So, the correct answer is the option that fails either parity, angular momentum, or isospin condition.

Option D fails isospin condition but passes parity and angular momentum. So it's invalid.

The other options fail parity, making them invalid.

But the problem is to choose the one that's not permitted.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D because it's the only one that meets parity and angular momentum, but fails isospin. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the angular momentum consideration is more important, and the isospin condition is a separate constraint.

Wait, the problem states that both angular momentum and parity must be conserved, and the isospin condition must hold. So all three must be satisfied.

So for each option, let's check all three:

Option A:

- Parity: (NN parity after) (+1) * (-1) (X) → -1. Initial parity is +1. So parity not conserved. Invalid.

- Angular momentum: J_NN=1, j_X=1 → can sum to zero. So okay.

- Isospin: S=3, L=2 → sum=5 → odd. So T=0. So okay.

But parity is violated, so invalid.

Option B:

- Parity: (+1)*(-1)= -1 → initial +1 → invalid.

- Angular momentum: J_NN=1, j_X=0 → can't sum to zero. Invalid.

- Isospin: S=1, L=0 → sum=1 → allowed.

But parity and angular momentum invalid. So option B invalid.

Option C:

- Parity: (+1)*-1 =-1 → initial +1 → invalid.

- Angular momentum: J=3, j=3 → allowed.

- Isospin: S=1, L=2 → sum=3 → allowed.

But parity invalid → option C invalid.

Option D:

- Parity: (-1)*(-1)=1 → initial parity +1 → allowed.

- Angular momentum: J=0, j=0 → allowed.

- Isospin: S=1, L=1 → sum=2 → even → T=1, but given T=0 → invalid.

So option D is invalid due to isospin condition.

Thus, all options are invalid except none. But this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the isospin condition. Let me recheck.

The problem states: Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

So T(NN) = (S + L +1) mod 2.

Given T(NN)=0.

So 0 = (S + L + 1) mod 2 → S + L +1 ≡0 → S + L ≡1 mod 2.

So S + L must be odd.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → sum=2 → even → S + L=2 → 2 mod2=0 → 0≡1 → no. So isospin not satisfied.

So option D is invalid.

So all options are invalid except none. But that can't be right. Maybe I'm missing something in the angular momentum part.

Wait, perhaps the angular momentum of X isn't just its orbital angular momentum but also includes its spin. For example, if X has spin 1, then its j could be higher. But the problem doesn't specify X's spin, so perhaps we're to assume it's a spin-0 particle.

If X has spin 1, then j could be l + s. But without knowing, it's hard to model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the orbital angular momentum of X, as denoted by the lowercase letter.

In that case, for the angular momentum to be conserved, the initial J=0 must equal the vector sum of the NN's J and X's l.

But for this to happen, NN's J must be equal and opposite to X's l.

But since J is a vector, the only way their sum is zero is if their magnitudes are equal and their directions opposite. So |J_NN| = |l_X|.

So:

Option A: J_NN=1, l_X=1 → allowed.

Option B: J_NN=1, l_X=0 → can't sum to zero. Invalid.

Option C: J_NN=3, l_X=3 → allowed.

Option D: J_NN=0, l_X=0 → allowed.

So only option B's angular momentum is invalid. So among the options, only option B would have angular momentum not conserved.

But what about parity and isospin?

Option B:

- Parity after emission: (parity_NN) * (parity_X) → parity_NN is (+1) since L=0. So (+1)*(-1) =-1. Initial is +1 → parity not conserved.

- Isospin: S=1, L=0 → sum=1 → allowed. T=0.

But parity is violated, so option B is invalid.

So the only option that violates angular momentum is B, but it also has parity violation.

So the problem is to find which partial wave is not permitted. So the options which don't meet any of the conditions are invalid.

The correct answer is option D because it violates the isospin condition, but the others have parity issues. But the question is about which is not permitted.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because it violates the isospin condition.

Wait, no, option C has S=1, L=2 → sum=3 → odd → allowed. So isospin is okay.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which has correct parity and angular momentum, but violates isospin.

So the partial wave in option D is s (l=0), but the isospin condition isn't met. So this partial wave is not permitted.

But wait, the problem is to choose which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer is the option that fails any of the conditions.

But according to the previous analysis, only option D meets parity and angular momentum but fails isospin. The others fail parity.

But the question is to choose which partial wave is not permitted. So the forbidden one is the one that either fails parity or isospin.

So among the options, option D has the correct parity and angular momentum but wrong isospin, so it's forbidden. The others have parity wrong.

But the question is to choose which one is not permitted.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize:

The correct answer must satisfy all three conditions: parity, angular momentum, and isospin.

Looking at each option:

Option A: parity invalid → not allowed.

Option B: parity invalid, angular momentum invalid → not allowed.

Option C: parity invalid → not allowed.

Option D: parity allowed, angular momentum allowed, isospin invalid → not allowed.

So all options are invalid except none, which can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the isospin condition.

Wait, perhaps the isospin condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) mod 2, not +1. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).

So T = S + L + 1 mod 2.

So for T=0:

0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L =1 mod 2.

So for each option:

Option A: S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 →1 mod2 → yes.

Option B: S=1, L=0 →1+0=1 → yes.

Option C: S=1, L=2 →3 →1 mod2 → yes.

Option D: S=1, L=1 →2 →0 mod2 → no. So D is invalid.

So, the only option that meets the isospin condition is D, but it's invalid because parity is okay but isospin is wrong.

Wait, no: option D meets the isospin condition if T is 1. But the problem says the final NN has T=0. So D doesn't meet it.

So the correct answer is the option that doesn't meet any of the conditions. But perhaps the correct answer is option C, which meets the isospin condition (S=1, L=2 → sum 3 →1 mod2) but has parity invalid.

Hmm.

I think I'm missing something here. Let me try a different approach.

The problem is to determine which partial wave is not allowed. The partial wave is the orbital angular momentum of X, given by the lower case letter.

The correct answer would be the one that doesn't satisfy either parity, angular momentum, or isospin conditions.

Looking again:

Option D: 3P0 + s.

s stands for l=0. So X has l=0 → j_X=0 (if spin is 0).

NN's J is 0.

So, J_initial=0 = J_NN + j_X → 0 +0=0 → allowed.

Parity: NN's L=1 → parity (-1)^1 =-1. X's parity=-1. So total parity: (-1)*(-1)=1 → initial parity is 1 → allowed.

Isospin: S=1, L=1 → sum=2 → even → T= (S+L +1) mod2 → (2+1)=3 mod2=1 → T=1. But the given T=0. So this is not allowed.

Thus, option D violates the isospin condition.

So, in this case, the partial wave (s) in option D is not allowed because it violates the isospin condition.

But the problem is to choose which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer is option D.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions: conservation of parity, angular momentum, and the isospin relation \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). The final NN state has \( T(NN) = 0 \), and the emitted particle \( X \) has intrinsic parity \(-1\). Each option is evaluated for parity conservation, angular momentum conservation, and isospin compliance.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state is \( 1S_0 \), with \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).

2. **Final State Conditions**:
   - **Parity Conservation**: The total parity after emission must equal the initial parity. The parity of the final state is the product of the intrinsic parities of the NN state and \( X \):  
     \[
     \text{Parity}_{\text{final}} = \text{Parity}_{NN} \cdot \text{Parity}_X
     \]
     Since \( \text{Parity}_X = -1 \), the NN state must have \( \text{Parity}_{NN} = -1 \) to satisfy \( \text{Parity}_{\text{final}} = +1 \). This implies \( L_{NN} \) must be odd.

   - **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved. Initially, \( J_{\text{initial}} = 0 \). After emission, the total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN's \( J_{NN} \) and \( X \)'s \( j_X \). For the total angular momentum to remain zero, \( J_{NN} \) and \( j_X \) must cancel each other out, meaning their magnitudes must be equal.

   - **Isospin Relation**: For the final NN state, the isospin relation \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \) must hold. Given \( T(NN) = 0 \), this implies:
     \[
     S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)
     \]
     Thus, \( S(NN) + L(NN) \) must be odd.
