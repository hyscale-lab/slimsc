Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and we're trying to understand their developmental fate. The setup involves some genetic constructs and experiments in mice.

The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with some specific structural features: eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets making a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil, which usually means it has two alpha helices that wind around each other.

They used a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? So here, the ligand and receptor are on the same vector. The vector has loxP sites and stop cassettes.

So the vector is set up like this: Ligand ORF is at 5' with mCherry, and receptor is at 3' with eGFP. The ligand is under CBA promoter. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

Wait, I remember that loxP is a site recognized by Cre recombinase. When Cre is present, it excises the loxP sites and the stuff in between. So, the stop cassette would be in the way unless Cre deletes it.

In the setup, they used a bicistronic vector, so without Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent the downstream genes from being expressed. But when Cre is introduced, it would delete the stops, allowing the downstream genes to be expressed.

So, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, I think. The receptor is after the IRES element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so it can drive expression of the receptor even if the upstream gene (ligand) is not being translated. Or wait, no, the IRES is in the middle of the ligand's mRNA? Or is it downstream?

Wait, wait. The vector is two ORFs: ligand first, then receptor. The ligand is under CBA promoter. The receptor is after an IRES. So the CBA promoter would drive the ligand's expression. The IRES would allow for the receptor's expression independently, perhaps in a separate cap-independent manner. But in this case, the presence of the stop cassettes complicates things.

So the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop in a loxP cassette. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed (because promoter is present), but the mCh
