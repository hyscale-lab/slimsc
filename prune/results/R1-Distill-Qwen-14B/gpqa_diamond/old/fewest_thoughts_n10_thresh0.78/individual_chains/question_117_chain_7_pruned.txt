Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, specifically when molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So they can rotate plane-polarized light. But wait, not all molecules can do that. I remember that for a compound to have optical activity, it needs to have a chiral center or another form of stereoisomerism, like geometric (cis-trans) isomerism in some cases, but wait, does geometric isomerism lead to optical activity?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism. So I need to find which of these compounds have stereoisomers, particularly whether they have chiral centers or some other way of being non-superimposable mirror images.

The question lists four compounds, and the options are combinations of which show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So the structure is a biphenyl group, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. At the 6 and 6' positions, there are nitro groups. At the 2 and 2' positions, there are carboxylate groups, and each is methyl esterified. Wait, but the key is whether this molecule has a plane of symmetry.
