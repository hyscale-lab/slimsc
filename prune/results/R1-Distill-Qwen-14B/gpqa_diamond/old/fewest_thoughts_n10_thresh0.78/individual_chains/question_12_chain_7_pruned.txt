Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem states that a Pi-plus pion is at rest and decays into a mu-plus and a neutrino. The equation given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The rest masses are provided: Pi is 139.6 MeV, and mu is 105.7 MeV. I remember that neutrinos are super light, almost massless, but I'm not sure if their mass is considered here. I think for these kinds of problems, neutrinos are often considered to have negligible mass, so maybe I can ignore it or treat it as zero.

Wait, but wait. I should double-check. The problem only gives me the rest masses for Pi and mu, so I think the neutrino's mass is negligible. So that simplifies things a bit.

Since the pion is at rest (initial momentum is zero), the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the mu and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino's mass is almost zero, its kinetic energy would be approximately equal to its energy because E = pc for massless particles. Hmm, but wait, that's only if the mass is zero. I remember that even neutrinos have some mass, but I think in this problem, it's safe to assume their rest mass is zero because it's not given. So I'll proceed with that.

Now, the total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. After decay, each product has their rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. So the total energy after should be the sum of the energies of mu and nu.

But wait, the mu has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, so its energy E_mu is gamma * m_mu c², and the neutrino's energy E_nu is just p_nu c, since its mass is zero. 

But since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after must be zero. So p_mu + p_nu = 0. So p_nu = -p_mu. The magnitudes are the same, but directions opposite.

Hmm, so the total energy after is E_mu + E_nu = (gamma * m_mu c²) + (p_mu c).

But the initial energy is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. So setting them equal:

gamma * m_mu c² + p_mu c = m_pi c².

Wait, but I also know that for the mu, the relation between gamma and momentum is p_mu = gamma m_mu v, and v can be expressed in terms of beta. Also, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use energy and momentum conservation. Let me think.

Let me denote the energy of the mu as E_mu and the neutrino's energy as E_nu.

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

Momentum is conserved
