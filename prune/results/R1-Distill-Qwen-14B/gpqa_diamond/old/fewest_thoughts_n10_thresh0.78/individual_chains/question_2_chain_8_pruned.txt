Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Let me start by breaking down the reactions step by step.

First, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a double bond. Trans means the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite each other. So, the structure would be something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but wait, no, wait. Trans-cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. Wait, no, no, cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a benzene ring attached via a propenyl group. Structure-wise, it's Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait, I think cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no. Let me think. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no. No, wait, I think it's actually Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO would be something else. Oh wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, wait. No, I think it's Ph-CH=CH-CHO. Because the aldehyde is on the end of a double bond. So, it's trans, so the double bond has the benzene ring on one side and the aldehyde on the other. So structure is: benzene ring connected to CH2-CH2-CHO? No, no, wait. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a vinyl group. So, the structure is Ph-CH=CH-CHO. Let me confirm: The formula for cinnamaldehyde is C9H8O. So, benzene (C6H5) connected to a CH2 group? No, wait, maybe it's C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, that would have five carbons in the main chain: the benzene (6 carbons), then CH=CH-CHO. Wait, that's 6 (benzene) + 3 (CH=CH-CHO) = 9 carbons. Yes, that's right. So the structure is benzaldehyde with a
