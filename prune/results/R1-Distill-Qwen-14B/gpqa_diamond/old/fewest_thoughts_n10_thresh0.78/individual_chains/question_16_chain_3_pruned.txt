Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many of these given compounds exhibit optical activity. I remember that optical activity is related to having chiral centers, which are atoms (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups. But wait, there's also something about meso compounds where the compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall because of a plane or center of symmetry. Oh right, meso compounds don't have optical activity because the mirror images cancel each other out.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Hmm, this is an alkene with substituents. Since it's a but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl and another CH2 group? Wait, wait. The structure would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Wait, but it's 1-chloro-2-methyl. So the first carbon (C1) has Cl attached, and the second carbon (C2) has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)(CH2CH2 something) double bond? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl on C2. So the structure would be Cl-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1: Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond starting at C1. Wait, perhaps it's Cl-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3)-something. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2
