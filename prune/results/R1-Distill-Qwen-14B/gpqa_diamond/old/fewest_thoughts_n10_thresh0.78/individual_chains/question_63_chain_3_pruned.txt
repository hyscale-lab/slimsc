Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and some quantum stuff. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They're using the quantum rotation-vibration model, or non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. And they want to know the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. 

Wait, wait. So the molecule is currently in its ground state, and a photon is absorbed, causing a transition to the next state. But what's the next state? I remember that in the rigid rotor model (which I think this is a variation of), the rotational energy levels are quantized. But since it's the non-rigid rotor model, maybe they're considering both rotational and vibrational energy?

Oh, right! In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (which for a diatomic is usually the ground rotational state, which I think is J=0 or J=1? Wait no, for diatomic molecules, the ground rotational state is J=0, but because of the selection rules, transitions might involve changing J by ±1. But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest energy. Hmm.

Wait, the energy states in molecules can be thought of as a combination of vibrational and rotational energy. The total energy is the sum of the vibrational energy and the rotational energy. So the fundamental state is v=0 (lowest vibrational) and the lowest rotational state, which is J=0. But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either change its vibrational state or its rotational state. Which transition gives the lowest energy photon required?

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So what's the next possible state? The next state with the lowest energy. So perhaps it's moving from the ground vibrational state (v=0) to the first excited rotational state (J=1) or the first vibrational excited state (v=1). But which transition requires less energy?

I remember that vibrational transitions are generally higher energy than rotational transitions. Because the vibrational frequency is much higher. So the energy difference between rotational states is lower. But wait, I need to think about the specific energies here.

So the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next state that's just a little higher. So which is smaller: the energy difference between rotational states or vibrational states?

The formula for the vibrational energy levels is E_v = (v + 1/2) h w_vib, where w_vib is the vibrational angular frequency. The first transition would be v=0 to v=1, which would require energy h w_vib.

For rotational energy, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The rotational constant B is given by (h / (8 π² μ R²)), where μ is the reduced mass of the molecule.
