Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond along with a sigma bond. The classic examples are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermally induced and pericyclic, so they're often [3,3] sigmatropic shifts.

Looking at the problem, there are three separate reactions, and I need to find out what each product (A, B, C) is. The options are given, so I'll try to work through each reaction step by step.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to form A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is (CH3O)2CHNH2. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CHCH2OH, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2=CHCH2OH? No, wait no, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2OH with a double bond at position 3? Wait no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHOHCH3? No, perhaps I should draw it. Butene is four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? No, because the double bond is between C3 and C4, but that's not possible for a four-carbon chain. Wait, wait, but-3-en-2-ol must have the double bond at position 3. So the structure is CH2CH2(OH)CH2? No, that can't be. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2OH. Wait, but that would be 2-en-1-ol. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, but that's not possible because the double bond is at position 3, so the structure would be CH2-CH2-
