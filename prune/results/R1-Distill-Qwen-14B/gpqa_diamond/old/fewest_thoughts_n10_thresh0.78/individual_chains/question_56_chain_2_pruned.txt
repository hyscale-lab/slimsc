Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, transitions happen between energy levels, and the selection rules dictate which transitions are allowed.

First, I need to recall the selection rules for dipole transitions. Oh right, for the hydrogen atom, the dipole selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum l can change by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, 1, or -1.

The initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. We're going to transition down to n=1, l=0, m=0. But since it's a two-step process, it goes through an intermediate state.

So, the first transition is from n=3 to some n', then from n' to n=1. Let's think about possible intermediate states.

Wait, the energy levels are quantized, so from n=3, you can go to n=2 because 3-1=2, which is the next lower level. Alternatively, could you go to n=1 in one step? Oh, but the problem says it's via two dipole transitions, so it must go through an intermediate state, probably n=2.

So, the first transition is 3→2, and the second is 2→1.

Now, what about the l and m values in the intermediate state?

Starting with l=0 in 3,0,0. After the first transition, l can change by ±1. So l can go to 1 because 0+1=1. So the intermediate state would have l=1.

So the possible states after the first transition are 2,1,m, where m can be -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, but wait, the transition from l=0 to l=1 is allowed because Δl=+1, which fits the selection rule. So the intermediate state is 2,1,m.

Now, from 2,1,m, the next transition is to 1,0,0.

Wait, from l=1, can we go down to l=0? Yes, because Δl can be -1, which would take l=1 to l=0. So that's allowed.

So the second transition is from l=1 to l=0. Now, what about the m values?

In the intermediate state, m can be -1, 0, or +1. Then, for the second transition, m can change by 0, ±1.

Let's see, the initial m is 0 in the intermediate state. Wait, no, in the first transition, the initial m is 0, so the m of the intermediate state must be 0, ±1. So for example, the intermediate state could be |2,1,0⟩ or |2,1,1⟩ or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, when transitioning from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩, the m needs to go from whatever it was to 0.

So, if the intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩, then in the second transition, m can change by 0, so m=0→0 is allowed. That's possible.

If the intermediate state is |2,1,1⟩, then in the second transition, m can go to 0 (since Δm= -1), which is allowed.

Similarly, if the intermediate state is |2,1,-1⟩, then m can go to 0 via Δm=+1
