Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ plus sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So, I know that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. The task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx, and the options are given.

Hmm, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the system in the given state. So, for an operator O, the expectation is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

The operator here is 10σz +5σx. So, the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes sense because expectation values are linear, so I can separate them.

First, I need to calculate ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ individually. Then multiply each by 10 and 5, respectively, and add them up.

Let me think about the state. The state is a linear combination: ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩. Here, a is 0.5 and b is sqrt(3)/2. Let me compute a squared and b squared just in case. a² is 0.25, b² is (3/4)=0.75. Oh, because (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, right.

Wait, but wait. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. I should check normalization. 0.5² + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So, the state is normalized, which is good.

Now, for ⟨σz⟩. Since σz has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So, the expectation value of σz for a state ψ is the probability of |↑⟩ times +1 plus the probability of |↓⟩ times -1.

In this case, the probability of |↑⟩ is |a|² = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The probability of |↓⟩ is |b|² = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4=0.75.

So, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Got that.

Now, for ⟨σx⟩. I think σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, but since the state is given in the σz basis, I might need to compute it directly.

Alternatively, I can compute ⟨σx⟩ using the formula:

⟨σx⟩ = [ (ψ| σx |ψ) ]

Which can be written as (a*⟨↑| + b*⟨↓|) σx (a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩ )

But I'm not sure about the matrix elements of σx. Oh wait, σx in the σz basis has the matrix representation:

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

So, for a state ψ = [a, b]^T, the expectation value is a* b + b* a, because when you apply σx, it swaps the basis states.

Wait, let's think again. The expectation value is ψ† σx ψ. So, in components, for ψ = [a, b], that would be:

(a*, 0) [ [0,1], [1,0] ] [a,
                          b ]

Wait, no, matrices are multiplied differently. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the state vectors. Let me think, ψ is a column vector [a; b], so σx ψ would be [b; a].

Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ would be [a*, b*] [b; a] = a* b + b* a.

But because a and b are real numbers here. Wait, in this case, a is 0.5, which is real, and b is sqrt(3)/2, also real.

So, a* = a, and b* = b.

So, ⟨σx⟩ = a b + b a = 2ab.

Wait, but wait, let's compute this correctly.

Wait, no, the calculation is:

⟨σx⟩ = a * b + b * a = 2ab.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, because σx is the operator, which swaps the basis vectors. So, σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So, when we compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩:

= [a*, b*] σx [a; b]
= [a*, b*] [b; a]
= a* b + b* a.

Since a and b are real (0.5 and sqrt(3)/2), this simplifies to a b + b a = 2ab.

Wait, but 2ab would be 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So, ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Because sometimes I might mix up the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more directly. The expectation value of σx for a state ψ is given by:

⟨σx⟩ = ( |a|^2 + |b|^2 )? No, that's not right. Wait, no, because σx is the operator, not an observable that's diagonal in this basis.

Wait, another approach: since σx can be written in terms of the outer products:

σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|

So, when we compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩:

= ⟨↑| a* + ⟨↓| b* ) ( |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑| ) (a
