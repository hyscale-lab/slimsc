Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle and some magnetic fields. Hmm, let's see what I can remember. I know that spin 1/2 particles have their magnetic moments related to their spin angular momentum. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, right? So mu = γ S_z. 

The setup is that the magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field because that's the lowest energy state. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system must change too. Originally, the Hamiltonian was probably proportional to S_z, since the field was along Z. When the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y instead. 

So the initial state is the spin-up state along Z, let's say. After the field change, the spin is now in a state that's an eigenstate of S_y? Or not? Because the Hamiltonian is now H = -γ B S_y (since the magnetic moment interacts with the field), but wait, wait. Let me think about the energy. The energy E is given by the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. So E = -μ·B. Since μ is γ S, then E = -γ B S·n, where n is the direction vector of B. So when B is along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ B S_y. 

Wait, but in this problem, when the field is turned off in Z and on in Y, the particle is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So it will start precessing, right? So the expectation value of S_z will oscillate over time.

To find the oscillation frequency, I need to figure out the energy difference between the states. Since the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, the energy levels are determined by the eigenvalues of S_y. But wait, S_y has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for spin 1/2 particles. So the energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ = -γ B (ħ/2) and E_- = γ B (ħ/2) — wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify the signs.

The Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the energy eigenvalues are E = -γ B (± ħ/2) → E_+ = -γ B ħ/2 and E_- = γ B ħ/2? Or is it the other way around? Alternatively, perhaps I should write H = ω S_y, where ω is some angular frequency. Let me think. The energy levels are E = ± (ω ħ/2), where ω is γ B. So the energy difference between the two states is ΔE = E_+ - E_- = ω ħ. 

Wait, no, wait. Let
