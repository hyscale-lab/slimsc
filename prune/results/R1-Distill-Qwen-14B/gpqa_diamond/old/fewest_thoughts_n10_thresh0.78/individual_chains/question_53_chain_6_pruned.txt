Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Okay, the question involves an unknown compound which is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The FTIR spectrum shows ester groups, so that tells me there's an ester functional group present. Ester groups typically show strong absorption around 1730-1750 cm^-1 in the IR, so that makes sense.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let's break them down.

First, two signals correspond to aromatic Hs. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern can influence the NMR. Di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns like para, meta, or ortho. The number of signals and their splitting can give clues. For para substitution, there are two sets of Hs: the two Hs next to each substituent (ortho to both) and the two Hs across (para to substituents). Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution, but that might give more signals or different splitting. But the exact substitution pattern isn't clear yet, but it's something to keep in mind.

Next, two signals are vinyl-Hs. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets or more complex splitting due to coupling with adjacent Hs. The doublet might suggest coupling with one neighboring proton, perhaps in a CH2 group, but since the NMR says no CH2 signals, maybe it's part of an ester group, like the CH2 in an ester's R-O-C-O-R? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Ester groups are R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R', so the structure is something like R-O-CO-R'. So the carbonyl is between the two oxygen atoms. So maybe the vinyl protons are part of a substituent attached to the ring, like a vinyl ester or something.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl protons signals. So perhaps the substituent on the benzene is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Like maybe it's attached via a double bond. So perhaps a structure like benzene with an ester group that has a vinyl substituent. For example, something like benzyl acetate but with a vinyl group instead of a methyl.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with two substituents, each of which is an ester group? But wait, the IR only showed one strong peak for an ester, but maybe that's because of symmetry? Or maybe the ester is part of a substituent on the ring.

Wait, the question says it's di-substituted. So each substituent could be something else, but we know that one is an ester group. Wait, no. Because the IR shows peaks for ester, so perhaps the compound has an ester group attached to the ring. So maybe each substituent is an ester group? But that would make it di-ester. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is something else, but the problem states that the FTIR shows ester peaks,
