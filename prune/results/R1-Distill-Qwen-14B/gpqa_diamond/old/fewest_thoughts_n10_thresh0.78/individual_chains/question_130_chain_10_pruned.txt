Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshifts, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. They're asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm, I remember that Lyman alpha emission is in the ultraviolet range. Oh wait, the Lyman alpha line is actually the transition from n=2 to n=1 in hydrogen, right? And that corresponds to a wavelength of 1216 Angstroms, which is in the far ultraviolet. So if this hydrogen is causing absorption, then the quasar's light at that wavelength is getting absorbed.

But wait, for ground-based optical telescopes, they can't observe in the ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs it. So the quasar's original emission at 1216 Angstroms would be redshifted into a wavelength that's observable. That makes sense. So the key is to find when the observed wavelength is in the optical range, which I think is roughly between 400 and 700 nanometers or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud has a redshift z, then the observed wavelength λ_obs is λ_rest * (1 + z). So λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + z). But we need λ_obs to be in the optical range, say less than 7000 Angstroms because beyond that is infrared, which some telescopes can see, but optical is the visible part.

Wait, but wait, optical is what ground-based telescopes observe. So for the absorption to be in the optical, the redshifted wavelength must be in that range. So we set up the equation: 1216*(1+z) ≤ 7000 Angstroms, because beyond that, it's in the infrared, which optical telescopes can't see.

So let's solve for z. 1216*(1+z) = 7000 → 1+z = 7
