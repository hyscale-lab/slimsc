Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me see what I remember from my studies.

First, let's parse the question. The magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. The field has a strength of 1 Tesla, which is a pretty strong magnetic field, although I'm not sure how that plays into the problem. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so m has a small value. The problem is asking about the paramagnetic coupling term and comparing it to the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom with a specific wavelength.

Wait, what's the paramagnetic coupling term? I think it's related to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. Oh right, the Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of atomic energy levels when a magnetic field is applied. So the paramagnetic coupling term is probably the energy due to this interaction.

The transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm. I remember that the energy of a photon is related to wavelength by E = hc/λ. So I can calculate ΔE using Planck's constant h, the speed of light c, and the given wavelength.

Let me jot down the formula for ΔE. So, ΔE = hc / λ. Let's plug in the numbers. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers or 4.861 x 10^-7 meters.

Calculating that, ΔE would be (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 4.861e-7. Let me compute that. The numerator is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Dividing by 4.861e-7 gives roughly 4.085e-19 J. Hmm, that's the energy in joules. To get a sense of the magnitude, I might want to convert it to electron volts since atomic transitions are often discussed in eV. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so this energy is approximately 2.55 eV. Wait, wait, that can't be right because hydrogen's energy levels are much smaller. Oh wait, no, wait—no, actually, the Balmer series, which is the transition from n=2 to n=1, emits a photon in the visible range. The Balmer-alpha line is about 0.486 micrometers, which is what the problem gives. So the energy ΔE is about 13.6 eV? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. So my calculation earlier was 4.085e-19 J, which is about 2.55 eV. Oh, wait, that makes sense because the visible transitions are in the 1-3 eV range. So ΔE is approximately 2.55 eV.

But wait, the hydrogen atom's energy levels are typically on the order of eV. The ground state is about -13.6 eV, so transitions from higher levels would be in the range of a few eV. So this ΔE is a few eV, let's say around 2.5 eV.

Now, what's the paramagnetic coupling term? The energy due to the magnetic field. The magnetic dipole energy is given by E = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m, where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, no. The orbital magnetic moment is μ = (μ_B) * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, equal to (eħ)/(2m_e). So μ = μ_B * m. Then the energy is E = -μ·B = -μ_B m B.

So the paramagnetic term's expectation value <H> is proportional to m*B*μ_B
