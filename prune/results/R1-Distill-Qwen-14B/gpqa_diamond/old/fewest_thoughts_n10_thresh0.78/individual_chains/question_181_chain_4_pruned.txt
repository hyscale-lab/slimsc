Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux problem. Hmm, let me read the question again. So, the Sun's pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, and I need to find the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D.

Wait, what do I remember about the pp chain and neutrinos? The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? The main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. So, the pp-III branch involves reactions that produce high-energy neutrinos, specifically the Beryllium-7 neutrinos, I think. Those neutrinos are a significant part of the solar neutrino flux.

If the pp-III branch stopped, then the production of those neutrinos would stop. But wait, how much do they contribute to each energy band? I remember that the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in a certain energy range. Let me think: the Beryllium-7 neutrinos have energies around 670 keV to maybe about 800 keV or so. So band 1 is 700-800, which would include a lot of these neutrinos. Band 2 is 800-900, which might be beyond the typical range of the pp-III neutrinos.

But wait, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in the lower energy range. So if that branch stops, then the flux in band 1 would drop significantly, but band 2 might not be affected as much because those neutrinos come from other processes. Wait, does the Sun have other sources of neutrinos besides the pp-III branch in the core?

Oh right, there's the CNO cycle, which is another hydrogen fusion process. But I think the CNO cycle produces neutrinos as well, but in a different energy range. Or do they? Or maybe the majority of solar neutrinos are from the pp chain. So if pp-III stops, what happens?

Alternatively, I should think about the different neutrino energies. The main neutrinos from the pp chain are the Beryllium-7 ones, which peak around 670-800 keV. So when the pp-III stops, those neutrinos stop being produced. So band 1 (700-8
