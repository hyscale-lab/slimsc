Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and how the number of stars relates to distance based on their parallax. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by plx to the fifth power. So, the formula must be N ∝ 1/plx^5. Wait, parallax is inversely related to distance, right? Because parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. 

So if I have plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. I need to express the number of stars in terms of r. Let's substitute plx in the given formula. 

The number N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx with 1/r gives N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. 

1 divided by (1/r)^5 is the same as (r^5)/1, which is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So if N is proportional to r^5, then as r increases, N increases rapidly. 

Looking at the options, option B is r^5. But wait, does that make sense? Because when you're looking at a larger volume of space, more stars would be present, but the way the number depends on distance probably involves volume. Oh, wait, the number of stars in a region should be proportional to the volume, which is r^3, right? But wait, this question is giving a different relation, so maybe it's not about the standard volume assumption. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So we don't need to bring in the standard volume relation; we just need to relate number to distance using the given relation. 

So N is proportional to plx^-5. Since plx is 1/r, then plx^-5 = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance increases, the number of stars increases with r^5. 

But wait, the question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Oh, so perhaps it
