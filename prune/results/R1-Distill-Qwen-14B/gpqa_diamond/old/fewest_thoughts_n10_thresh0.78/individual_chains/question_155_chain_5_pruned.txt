Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of operators and uncertainties. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I think I should first write this state as a vector in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Wait, the question says the basis is already the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is already expressed in that basis. That simplifies things a bit.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]^T. Let's note that the components are in the order of the eigenstates of P_z. Let me also write down the matrix forms of P_x, P_y, and P_z as given.

P_z's matrix is diagonal:
[ ħ    0     0   ]
[ 0    0     0   ]
[ 0    0   -ħ   ]

So when calculating ⟨P_z⟩, it's just the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue, weighted by the square of the amplitude in that state.

Wait, but the state is given as a vector, so each component corresponds to an eigenstate. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of |amplitude_i|^2 * (eigenvalue_i).

Looking at the state vector:
The first component is -1/2. The amplitude squared is (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. The corresponding eigenvalue for P_z is ħ.
The second component is 1/√2. The square is 1/2. The eigenvalue here is 0 because the middle diagonal of P_z is zero.
The third component is -1/2. Squared is 1/4. The eigenvalue is -ħ.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 ħ - 1/4 ħ) = 0. Oh, that's neat. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the squares of the eigenvalues. So each diagonal element becomes (ħ)^2, 0, and (-ħ)^2, which is ħ², 0, and ħ².

So for each component:
First component squared (1/4) multiplied by (ħ)^2.
Second component squared (1/2) multiplied by 0.
Third component squared (1/4) multiplied by (ħ)^2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Now the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this simplifies to sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩) which is sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ / sqrt(2)).

Wait, looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), and option C is ħ/2. So I think the correct answer is B.

But wait, did I do the math correctly? Let me double-check.

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (
