Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when the number of sides N is infinitely large. Let's think about this step by step.

Alright, the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all its apothems are the same length a. The light is monochromatic, so a single wavelength λ, and it's hitting the aperture along the z-axis. The question is about the far field region, so I guess this is the Fraunhofer diffraction scenario.

Wait, for a circular aperture, the first minima occur at an angle θ where sinθ = λ/(π a), right? But that's a circle, and this is a polygon. When N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? So for a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius R as a = R cos(π/N). But when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem would approach R, since cos(0) is 1. Wait, no, wait. For an infinite-sided polygon, the apothem a would equal the radius R of the circle. So in that case, the problem reduces to a circular aperture, but wait the options don't have the 1.22 λ/a, but wait, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, so the diffraction pattern would be the same as a circular aperture. So the first minimum would be at θ where sinθ = λ/(π a), because for a circle, the first minimum (the first dark ring) is at θ where (using the formula from the single slit) sinθ = λ/(π a). Because the formula for the minima in single-slit diffraction are at (m + 1/2) λ / a, but wait wait, no, wait. Wait, for a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles where sinθ = (mλ)/(a), but wait, wait, no, perhaps it's different. Wait, no, for a single slit, the minima are at mλ = a sinθ, where m is an integer, but that's for a single slit. But for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a = λ/(2 sinθ), but wait I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, wait, let's think again. The problem says that the aperture is a polygon with an infinite number of sides, which approximates a circle. So the question is about the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. The angular separation between the first two minima in the far field would then be the angular spacing between the first and second minima.

Wait, no, the first minima in a circular aperture's diffraction pattern (like the Airy disk) are the first dark rings. The first minima occur at θ where sinθ = λ/(π a). Wait, no, I'm not remembering correctly. I think the first minimum for a circular aperture is at θ where sinθ = 1.22 λ/a, because wait, no, wait, for a single slit, the first minimum is at sinθ = λ/a, but for a circular aperture (which is a different scenario), the first minimum is at a higher value. Wait, I'm getting confused because I'm mixing single-slit and circular aperture diffraction.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Single-slit diffraction minima are at mλ = a sinθ (m=1,2,...). For a circular aperture (like a pinhole), the diffraction pattern has minima that occur at angles where the path difference between opposite edges is (m + 0.5)λ, but wait, perhaps it's better to recall the formula for the minima in a circular aperture.

Wait, the formula for the minima in the far field (Fraunhofer) of a circular aperture is given by the zeros of the Bessel functions. The first minimum occurs at θ where a sinθ = λ (m + 0.5), but wait, wait, no. Let me think. The radial intensity pattern for a circular aperture is given by the square of the Bessel function J1, I think. The first minimum is at the first zero of J1, which is approximately 3.8317, so a sinθ = (λ / (2π)) * (3.8317), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should step back. The problem is about a polygonal aperture with N sides, N→infinite. So the shape becomes a circle. So the problem reduces to a circular aperture. So I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in its diffraction pattern.

Wait, but wait, the first minimum for a circular aperture is the first dark ring, which is at θ where sinθ = (1.22 λ)/a. Because I remember that 1.22 comes from the first zero of the Bessel function J1, which is approximately 3.8317, and 3.8317/(2) is about 1.91585, but wait, no, wait, J1's first zero is at x ≈ 3.8317. So the condition is a sinθ = (x) λ/2π? Or maybe a sinθ = (x) λ/(2π). Wait, let me think about the formula.

The intensity in the far field for a circular aperture is given by I = I_0 [J_1(k a sinθ) / (k a sinθ)]^2, where k is 2π/λ. The minima occur when J_1(k a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317. So the condition is k a sinθ = x → sinθ = (x λ)/(2π a). So x is 3.8317, so sinθ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(6.2832) ) λ/a → approximately 0.610 λ/a. So the first minimum is at sinθ ≈ 0.610 λ/a.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at m=1 (x=3.8317), the second at m=2 (x=7.0156), so the angular positions are θ1 = arcsin(3.8317 λ/(2π a)), and θ2 = arcsin(7.0156 λ/(2π a)). But since the angles are small, we can approximate sinθ ≈ θ. So the angular separation Δθ is approximately (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ/(2π a) ) → (3.1839 λ)/(2π a) → approximately (3.1839)/(6.2832) → about 0.506 radians? Wait, but the options are in terms of λ/a.

Wait, wait, no, the angular separation is θ2 - θ1. Since θ is small, θ ≈ sinθ. So θ1 ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a), θ2 ≈ (7.0156 λ)/(2π a). So the difference is (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ/(2π a) = (3.1839 λ)/(2π a). Let me compute 3.1839 / (2π) → 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.506. So 0.506 λ/a. Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at m=1, the second at m=2. So the separation between these would be the difference in their angles. So the angular separation is (x2 - x1) * λ/(2π a). So x2-x1 is 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839. So 3.1839 * λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a. So the answer would be option D.

But wait, another way: for a circular aperture, the minima occur when a sinθ = (m + 0.5) λ / (something). Wait, no, perhaps the formula is a sinθ = (m λ)/(something). Let me think again. The condition for minima is that the path difference between opposite edges leads to destructive interference. But for a circular aperture, the calculation is a bit more involved, hence the involvement of Bessel functions.

But earlier, the calculation using the zeros of J1 gave us the first minimum at about 0.610 λ/a (since 3.8317/(2π) is approximately 0.610, because 3.8317 /6.2832 ≈ 0.610). So the first minimum angle θ1 is approximately 0.610 λ/a. The second minimum is at 7.0156 λ/(2π a) → about (7.0156)/(6.2832) → 1.116 λ/a. So the angular separation is about 1.116 - 0.610 = 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

Hmm, but wait, wait a second. Another approach: for a single slit, the minima are at sinθ = m λ/a, m=1,2,... So the angular separation between two consecutive minima is λ/(a) because each successive minima is spaced by λ/(a a) in sinθ, which for small angles is about θ= λ/a (m+1) - λ/a m = λ/a. But for a circular aperture, the minima are spaced by (x_m+1 - x_m) * λ/(2π a), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1.

Wait, so for J1, the zeros are at x=3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc. So the difference between the first and second zero is 7.0156 - 3.8317 ≈3.1839, so the angular separation would be (3.1839) * λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

Yes, that makes sense. So the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a, which is option D. So the correct answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the diffraction pattern created by an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon, where \( N \to \infty \). In this limit, the aperture becomes circular. The goal is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern.

For a circular aperture, the diffraction minima occur at angles where the Bessel function \( J_1 \) has zeros. The first zero of \( J_1 \) is at \( x_1 \approx 3.8317 \), and the second zero is at \( x_2 \approx 7.0156 \). The condition for the minima is given by:

\[
a \sin\theta = \frac{x \lambda}{2\pi},
\]

where \( a \) is the apothem, \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light, and \( x \) is the zero of \( J_1 \). For small angles, \( \sin\theta \approx \theta \), so the angular positions of the minima are approximately:

\[
\theta_1 \approx \frac{x_1 \lambda}{2\pi a}, \quad \theta_2 \approx \frac{x_2 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

The angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between these angles:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{(x_2 - x_1) \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

Substituting \( x_2 - x_1 = 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839 \), we find:

\[
\Delta\theta = \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

Approximating \( 2\pi \approx 6.2832 \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta\theta \approx \frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately \( 0.506 \lambda / a \), which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
