Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The question has two parts: reaction A and reaction B. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, right? So I'm thinking maybe an aldol reaction or some kind of pericyclic reaction. Wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Oh, right, so when you have a ketone reacting with an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester under basic conditions, it's probably a conjugate addition or maybe a Michael addition.

Wait, but t-BuOK is a strong base. The starting material has a ketone group on a cyclohexane ring. Let me draw the structure. The cyclohexanone is substituted at positions 2 and 6 with ethyl and methyl groups, respectively. Wait, no, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one means the ketone is at position 1, and at position 2 there's an ethyl and a methyl group, and at position 6, a methyl group. So the ring looks like this: positions 1 (ketone), 2 (ethyl and methyl substituents), 6 (methyl). Wait, no, wait. The numbering is a bit confusing. Let me clarify: cyclohexan-1-one means the ketone is at C1. Then, substituents at C2: ethyl and methyl groups (since it's 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl). Oh, wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl would mean that C2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group, and C6 has a methyl group. So the ring is substituted at C1 (ketone), C2 (ethyl and methyl), and C6 (methyl).

When ethyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOEt, reacts
