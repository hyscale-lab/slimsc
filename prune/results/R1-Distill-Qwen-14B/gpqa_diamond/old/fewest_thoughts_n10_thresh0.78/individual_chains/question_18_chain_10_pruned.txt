Okay, so I've got this problem here about two stars and their elemental abundances. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. Using the Equivalent Width (EW) method and assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), some elemental abundances have been determined. The given values are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, we need to find (n_Si1 / n_Si2) or maybe (n_Si2 / n_Si1)? Wait, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. Oh wait, the wording is "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think it's asking for (n_Si1)/(n_Si2). But I'll have to be careful with the math.

Let me start by recalling what the brackets mean in stellar abundances. The notation [X/Y] represents the logarithm of the ratio of the number density of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So, [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe1/n_H1) - log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) = 0. So n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

Wait, in the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, log10(nMg/nH) is 7 -12 = -5, so nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

So in the Sun, nFe = 10^(-4.5) * nH, and similarly for Mg.

Now, Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So for Star_1, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_F
