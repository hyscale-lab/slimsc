Okay, so I'm trying to answer this genetics question about mutations in a gene responsible for an anti-nutritional compound in barley. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

The problem is that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has this compound that makes it unusable for food. They found the gene causing it, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a method to induce point mutations. Then they sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound. So, I think this means we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, probably by creating a premature stop codon or altering the protein enough that it doesn't produce the anti-nutrient.

Looking at the wild-type sequence and the mutants:

Wild type: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the first part is the start codon ATG. Let's see each mutant.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild type, let's line them up:
Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG...
Wait, let me do this more carefully.

Looking at each nucleotide position:

Wild: positions 1-3: ATG (start codon)
Position 4: T
Mutant1 at position 4: T?
Wait, maybe I should look for where they differ.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for where the amino acid changes. Because the question is about the function, the protein product.

Let me think about the structure.

The wild-type gene's first exon starts with ATG (methionine), then TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), etc.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The first change is after ATG. Let me compare:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG...

Wait, let me see the exact differences.

Looking at the first part:

Wild: ... TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...

Mutant1: ... TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT ...

So, in Mutant 1:

- The third codon is CTC in wild (Leu), in Mutant1 it's CTA (Leu as well, since CTA is Leu). So same amino acid there.

Next codon: Wild is GCT (Ala), Mutant1 is CGC (Arg). So that's a change from Ala to Arg. That's a substitution but not a stop.

Then, wild is GGT (Gly), Mutant1 is TGG (Trp). So Gly to Trp, another substitution.

Then, wild is ACT (Thr), Mutant1 is TAC (Tyr). Another substitution.

So, a few amino acid changes, but not any stop codons. So the gene would still produce a protein, but maybe altered. Could that disrupt the compound? Maybe, but not necessarily a frameshift or stop.

Mutant 2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC
