Okay, so I have this NMR question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm with a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options given are various tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene.

First, I remember that the molecular formula C10H14 suggests each compound is a derivative of benzene. Benzene has six carbons, so the substituents should add up to four in total. Wait, because tetramethyl would add four methyl groups. Let me check: benzene (C6H6) plus four methyl groups (each CH3 adds one carbon and three hydrogens) so 6 +4 =10 carbons, and hydrogens would be 6 (from benzene) + 4*3=12, but wait, benzene's H is 6, so 6+12 =18 H. But the formula is C10H14. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, wait, the molecular formula is for each compound. So each compound has C10H14. So benzene is 6 C, each substituent is a methyl or ethyl group. Let me see: if it's four methyl groups (so four substituents each being CH3), then the formula would be C6H6 + 4*(CH3) = C10H14. Oh, because 6+4=10, and 6 hydrogens from benzene plus 4*3=12 gives 18, but wait, the formula is C10H14. Wait, that's a problem. Oh wait, no. Wait, when you add substituents to benzene, each substituent replaces a hydrogen. So benzene has 6H. If you add four substituents, each adds maybe a CH3, but each substitution takes away a H. So for four substituents, you'd have 6-4=2 H
