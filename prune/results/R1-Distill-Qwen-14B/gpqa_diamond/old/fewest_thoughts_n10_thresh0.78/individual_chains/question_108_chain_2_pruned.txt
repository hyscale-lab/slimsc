Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's see. I remember that paramagnetic coupling has to do with the interaction between an atom's magnetic moment and an external magnetic field. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I'll try to work it out.

The question states that the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. It also mentions small m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. I think m being small means that it's close to zero, maybe in a state where the orbital contribution is minimal. But wait, orbital magnetic quantum number is usually for angular momentum, right? Oh wait, in atoms, each electron has a magnetic moment due to its spin and orbital angular momentum. So the magnetic quantum number m is associated with the orbital part. But if m is small, perhaps the orbital contribution is negligible, so the main magnetic moment comes from spin?

Wait, but the problem is about paramagnetic coupling. Paramagnetism arises from the magnetic moments of electrons, which are due to their spin. So in paramagnetic materials, the magnetic moment is dominated by the spin, especially since m is small here. So the coupling term would relate to the spin-orbit interaction or Zeeman effect? Hmm, no, the Zeeman effect is when an external magnetic field splits spectral lines due to the interaction of the magnetic moment with the field.

Wait, the problem mentions the paramagnetic coupling term. So paramagnetic coupling is when an external magnetic field interacts with the magnetic moment of the electrons. The Hamiltonian for this coupling is probably something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * μ_B * m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. But wait, if m is small (the orbital one), but the spin can be ±1/2, so m_s is fixed, I think. So for each electron, the spin contributes a magnetic moment.

But wait, no, the orbital m is small, so perhaps the orbital magnetic moment is negligible, and the main contribution comes from spin. So the paramagnetic coupling term would be proportional to the spin magnetic quantum number, which is either +1/2 or -1/2. So the magnitude would be on the order of μ_B * B.

Now, the transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm. That's the wavelength of the emitted photon during the transition. So ΔE = hc / λ. Let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is the speed of light, about 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.4861e-6 meters because 1 μm is 1e-6 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6)

Let me calculate that. 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ (1.9878 / 0.4861) * 1e-19. Let's calculate 1.9878 / 0.4861. That's approximately 4.1. So ΔE ≈ 4.1e-19 J.

But wait, what about converting
