Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of reaction, maybe a substitution or addition. I think when you have things like that, it might be a dehydrohalogenation or maybe a Hoffman degradation. Wait, no, Hoffman usually involves strong base and heat. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the formation of alcohols from alkenes, maybe through the hydroxylation of alkenes? Or wait, wait, no, that's with Ozone and then workup. Oh wait, maybe it's about the hydrohalogenation of alkenes. Or maybe it's the Prins reaction? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, I recall that red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydroxymercuration reaction, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but that usually involves a base. Hmm.

Alternatively, wait, red phosphorus is often used in the conversion of alcohols to halides. Oh right! When you have an alcohol and treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it's a common method to substitute the hydroxyl group with an iodine. So, for example, if you have a secondary or tertiary alcohol, it would convert to the corresponding iodide. Because red phosphorus helps in activating the substitution by removing the OH group as an O=P species, making it a good leaving group.

So, the initial step is probably that Compound X is an alcohol. Let me check the IR and NMR data to confirm that.

Looking at the IR data: 3400â€“2500 cm-1 suggests the presence of an -OH group, as that's where O-H stretches typically appear. But wait, I thought that alcohols usually have broad O-H stretches around 3300-3500 cm-1. But here, the IR shows a broad region from 3400 to 2500, which might include an O-H stretch. Also, another peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. But if the compound is an alcohol, perhaps it's a ketone as well? Or wait, maybe it's an ester or a carboxylic acid. Hmm. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches, I think. So the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a very downfield shift. The broad singlet could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, which is around 10-12 ppm. Or maybe an acidic proton like an alcohol, but
