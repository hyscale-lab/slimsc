Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see... The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, and then determining the product after a series of reactions.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, so C is 8, H is 9, X (halogens) is 0, and N is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? That doesn't make sense because it has to be an integer. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. 2(8) +2= 18. 18 -9=9. 9 +1 (from N)=10. 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That can be, like, a benzene ring (which is 3) plus a double bond and a ring or another double bond. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet for one proton. That's a strong signal, maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet could mean it's adjacent to two protons, but wait, an aldehyde is RCHO. The adjacent would be the R group. If it's a CH2 group next to the aldehyde, then the aldehyde proton would be a triplet if there's coupling with two protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and don't split much because the J is small or maybe not split at all. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton, like in a conjugated system. Or perhaps it's an acidic proton, like in a phenol, but that would be more around 5 ppm. Or maybe it's an aromatic proton with specific coupling.

Then there's 6.98 ppm as a doublet (2H), and 6.51 ppm as another doublet (2H). Those look like para-substituted aromatic protons. Oh wait, because in para-disub
