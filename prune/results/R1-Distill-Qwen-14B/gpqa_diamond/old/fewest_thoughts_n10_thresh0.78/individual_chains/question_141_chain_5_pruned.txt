Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm supposed to find out how many possible organic products are formed. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm. First, I need to understand what the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d is. Wait, benzene has six carbons. So 1-bromo would be on carbon 1, and then 2-d is probably a deuterium on carbon 2. Because if it's benzene, the numbering starts with the bromine as position 1. Then, deuterium is on position 2. So the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium adjacent to the bromine. Wait, but wait, benzene is symmetric, but with substituents, the positions matter. So 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene?

Wait, but wait, when I have a bromine and a deuterium on adjacent positions, that's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the molecule would have Br on C1 and D on C2.

Now, the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions. Also, in aromatic substitution, especially for dehalogenation or elimination reactions.

Wait, but in benzene rings, if there's a bromide, and we have a strong base, maybe it's an elimination reaction. Because NaNH2 is a strong base, it can abstract protons, leading to elimination of H and Br-.

But wait, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a polar aprotic solvent. Or wait, isn't it more like a liquid ammonia? Because NaNH2 is used in such conditions for dehydrohalogenation. So perhaps this is an E2 elimination, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond.

Wait, but benzene is already an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. So perhaps we're talking about something else. Oh, wait, benzene rings can undergo elimination when there's a halogen adjacent to a hydrogen (like ortho position), leading to the formation of a diene or another ring structure.

Wait, but benzene is already a six-membered ring with conjugated double bonds. If we have Br on one carbon
