Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's read through it carefully.

The question says that an organic chemist performs two reactions, I and II. Then, after workup, the products are combined and run on both normal-phase HPLC and a chiral stationary phase HPLC. The question is about how many peaks they observe in each.

First, I need to understand each reaction. Let's break them down one by one.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. It's known for reducing ketones to secondary alcohols. So the starting material is a ketoneâ€”specifically, a six-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5.

So (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

The structure is CH2CH2(CO)CH2-OCH3, but wait, wait. Let me write it more accurately. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO-(CH2)3CH3, right? So position 3 is the carbonyl. Then, the 5th carbon has a methoxy group.

So, structure-wise, the starting material is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3, but that's not right.

Wait, hexan-3-one would be: 

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons after the carbonyl, no, wait. No, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is:

The formula for hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-(CH2)3-CH3? No, that would be seven carbons. Wait, hexane has six carbons. So, hexan-3-one is: 

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait no, that's seven carbons. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO-(CH2)3CH3? No, that's six carb
