Alright, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, okay, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators that are compatible with the Standard Model symmetries, but with higher dimension terms. So the operators are built to respect the same symmetries as the SM, right?

Let's break down each symmetry:

1. Lorentz symmetry: Oh right, the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant. So any operator in SMEFT must maintain this. Because if it didn't, you'd have physics that depends on the frame of reference, which we don't see in our experiments. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

2. Poincare symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like momentum conservation). Since the SM respects Poincare, I think SMEFT does too. Because the operators are built from the SM fields, their interactions should conserve energy and momentum, so Poincare symmetry holds.

Wait, but wait. Some people say that Poincare includes things like momentum, but SMEFT includes higher dimension terms. Does that affect it? No, because even higher dimension terms are constructed from SM fields, so they transform correctly under Lorentz and translation. So Poincare must be respected.

3. CP symmetry: Hmm, the SM isn't CP symmetric. For example, CP violation is seen in the CKM matrix. So, in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP? I think not necessarily. Because SMEFT allows for all possible operators, including those that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. So the answer probably doesn't include 3.

4. CPT symmetry: CPT is a big one. The SM respects CPT symmetry. I think any theory that is Lorentz invariant must respect CPT. Because the CPT theorem says that in a Lorentz invariant QFT, CPT is a symmetry. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT as well. So
