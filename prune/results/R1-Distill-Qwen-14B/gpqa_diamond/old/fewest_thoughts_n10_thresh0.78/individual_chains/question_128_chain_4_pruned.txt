Okay, so I've just started this job at a structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21 and purify it quickly. The Principal Investigator gave me the amino acid sequence and four plasmid options. I need to figure out which plasmid is the right one to use.

Hmm, I remember that when working with E. coli, especially for protein expression, the plasmid needs to have certain features. E. coli uses specific promoters and ribosome binding sites (like the Shine-Dalgarno sequence) for translation. So the plasmid should have a promoter compatible with E. coli's machinery.

Looking at the options, each is a DNA sequence. I need to check which one has the correct start codon and proper reading frame. The start codon in DNA is ATG. I'll scan each sequence to see where it starts.

Option A starts with ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAAACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCGTTGCCGTCCC... Wait, the first part is ATG followed by GAG, which is correct because that's methionine followed by glutamic acid. But maybe I should check for the presence of the T7 promoter or another promoter commonly used in E. coli.

Wait, E. coli BL21 strains are often used with T7 promoters because they have the T7 RNA polymerase. So the plasmid should have a T7 promoter to drive expression. Do these options include a T7 promoter?

Looking at the first part of the plasmid sequences, I don't see the T7 promoter (which is something like T7GAGGAGCTC...). Alternatively, maybe the plasmid uses a different promoter. Wait, another thought: sometimes plasmids for E. coli use the lacUV5 promoter, which is a strong promoter. But more likely, since BL21 is a strain that is T7 polymerase deficient, the plasmid must have a T7 promoter to initiate transcription.

Wait, but I'm looking at the DNA sequences. Let's look for the presence of the T7 promoter. The T7 promoter is a specific sequence upstream of the gene that the T7 RNA polymerase binds to. So in the
