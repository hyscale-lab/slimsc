Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a supernova occurred, and part of its ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, right. So I'm a bit confused about reference frames here. The ejecta and Galaxy are each in their own inertial frames. So when the ejecta sees the Galaxy moving towards it, that's their relative velocity.

Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center. So I think we need to find out the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame over a certain time, but the time given is in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, because they measure different times due to time dilation if they're moving relative to each other.

Wait, but wait. Since they are inertial frames, maybe we can use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because when two objects are moving relative to each other, their measurements of each other's velocities aren't just the same as the observed speeds. Oh wait, but maybe in this case, since the speeds are high (like 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light), we need to consider relativistic effects.

Wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 20% of that. So definitely, relativistic effects might be important here. So I can't just use classical mechanics here, I think.

So I remember that when two objects are moving towards each other, the speed measured in each frame isn't just the sum. For example, if frame S sees object moving at u, and frame S' is moving at v relative to S, then the speed u' in S' is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/cÂ²). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the velocity addition formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u
