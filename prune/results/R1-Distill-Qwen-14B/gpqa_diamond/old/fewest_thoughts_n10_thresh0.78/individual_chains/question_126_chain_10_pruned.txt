Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

So, the problem says that an organic chemist does two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II. Then, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about the number of peaks observed in each.

First, I need to figure out what each reaction does.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but wait, the compound is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is a six-carbon chain, with a ketone group on carbon 3 and a methoxy group on carbon 5.

So, for reaction I, the ketone (at C3) will be reduced to an alcohol. So the product would be 3-hexanol after the reduction, but wait, wait. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration. So when the ketone is reduced, the configuration will form a new chiral center.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)2-CH3? Wait, wait, 5-methoxy would be on carbon 5. Hexan-3-one is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)
Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? Wait, wait, no, hexan-3-one would be:

Positions 1-6: 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (C=O), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH2), 6 (CH3). So with a methoxy on carbon 5, it's 5-methoxy, so the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2
