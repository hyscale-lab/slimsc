Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly fine except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Also, the coupling can't explain the double peaks because they ruled out spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass, same intensity, and consistent with the expected molecule.

Hmm, let me start by considering each observation. So in NMR, when you see two peaks for a single proton, it usually indicates something is causing the proton to split into two. But wait, the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling, which is the usual reason for splitting. So what else could cause this?

Another possibility is diastereotopic protons. Diastereotopic protons are in a molecule where the two protons are not equivalent due to the molecule's structure. For example, in a chiral environment, two protons that were once equivalent become non-equivalent, so each has a different chemical shift. But wait, in this case, the shifts are similar, and the integrals add up to 1H. So if each was a diastereotopic pair, each would be a singlet, but maybe in a diastereomer, they might split each other? Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a racemic mixture. Enantiomers would have identical NMR spectra because they are mirror images. So if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would show all singlets because each proton would have the same shift in both enantiomers, so no splitting. But wait, wait, that doesn't fit here because the question says that the two peaks are from the same alpha-proton and have similar shifts. So perhaps it's not enantiomers.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diastereomer mixture. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. But how would that affect a single proton? Like, if the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers, each with a different environment for that alpha-proton, you'd see two peaks for each proton in each diastereomer? Hmm, but wait, in a racemic mixture (enantiomers), the NMR would just see all protons as single, but with diastereomers, the peaks would split.

Wait, but in this case, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. So maybe the molecule has two different diastereomers, and in each, that alpha-proton has a slightly different shift. So when you have a mixture, the NMR would show two separate peaks for that proton. But how does that interact with the integration?

So each diastereomer would have one alpha-proton, right? So if the mixture is 50-50 of diastereomer A and B, each would have one proton, so the integral would sum to 1H, which matches the data. And the shifts are similar, so maybe the diastereomers are not too different in that region.

Then looking at the LC-MS: two peaks of equal intensity and same mass. That suggests two different compounds with same mass? But same mass and same molecular formula would mean they are either enantiomers or diastereomers. Enantiomers would have same molecular weight, same retention time? Wait, no, in some cases, same retention time, but maybe in some LC conditions, they might separate. Or if the mixture is a racemic mixture, the LC would show one peak because the retention times are the same. But the question says LC-MS shows two peaks, so that suggests two different compounds with same mass.

Wait, if the molecule is a racemic mixture, the LC might not separate the enantiomers because they are identical in all aspects except chirality. So unless it's a chiral column, which can separate enantiomers, but if the LC didn't use a chiral column, the racemic mixture would elute as a single peak. But the question says two peaks, so racemic mixture is probably not the case here.

But wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. So it's two different molecules with same mass. Same molecular formula? Because the mass is the same. So same molecular formula. So they can't be enantiomers because you need the same molecular formula. So that suggests diastereomers.

So putting it all together. The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, which suggests a diastereomer mixture. The LC-MS shows two peaks same mass, which also supports diastereomers. So the most likely explanation is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. So looking at the options, option D says that.

But wait, another option is C: 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. Double coupling usually refers to when a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, but that would usually cause a more complex splitting, not two peaks. Also, the question states that the coupling can't explain it. So option C is probably not it.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different. But the LC-MS says both have same mass. So that's probably not the case.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. As I thought earlier, if it's a racemic mixture, NMR would not show separate peaks because the shifts are same. But the question says the NMR shows two peaks, so maybe it's not a racemic mixture. Wait, but wait, in some cases, like if the molecule has internal planes of symmetry, but no, wait, enantiomers have identical NMR, so the peaks would overlap, not split.

So B is probably not the correct answer. So that leaves D as the likely option.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, and the LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. The key observations are:

1. **NMR Analysis**: The two peaks for the same alpha-proton suggest a split in the signal, which cannot be explained by spin-spin coupling. This is consistent with diastereotopic protons or a mixture of diastereoisomers, where the two forms have slightly different environments for the alpha-proton, leading to distinct chemical shifts.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**: The two peaks with the same mass and equal intensity indicate two distinct compounds with the same molecular formula. This rules out enantiomers, as enantiomers would co-elute in LC unless a chiral column is used. The presence of two peaks suggests diastereomers, which have different physical properties and can elute separately.

3. **Elimination of Other Options**:
   - **Option A (Contaminated with a precursor)**: A precursor would have a different mass, but the LC-MS shows the same mass for both peaks, so this is unlikely.
   - **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers)**: Enantiomers would have identical NMR spectra and would co-elute in LC unless a chiral column is used. The NMR shows two distinct peaks, which contradicts the behavior of a racemic mixture.
   - **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond formation)**: Double coupling would typically result in more complex splitting patterns, not two distinct peaks. Additionally, the question explicitly rules out coupling as an explanation.

4. **Conclusion**: The most likely explanation is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. This accounts for the two distinct NMR peaks due to different environments for the alpha-proton in each diastereomer and the two LC-MS peaks due to the distinct physical properties of the diastereomers.

Answer: D
