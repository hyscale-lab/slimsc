Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs, ESPRESSO and HIRES. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars each of these instruments can observe based on their apparent magnitudes, right?

Let me start by recalling what each spectrograph can do. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So if a star's apparent V is less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag", meaning lower numbers are brighter. So if the apparent magnitude is brighter (lower) than 17, ESPRESSO can observe it. So anything with V < 17 mag is observable by ESPRESSO.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the apparent V magnitude should be less than 16. So for a star to be observed by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude less than 16, because both have to be able to see it. Because HIRES is more sensitive (can see fainter stars) up to 16, while ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So the overlapping stars would have to be brighter than 16 mag, since that's the stricter condition.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm getting this right. Because the brighter a star (lower magnitude), the easier it is to detect. So a star with V=15 mag is brighter than V=16.5. So if a star's apparent V is V=15, both can see it. But if a star's V is 16.5, then HIRES can't, because it can only go up to 16. So only stars with V <16 can be seen by both.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says for ESPRESSO, stars with V brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So brighter than means less than 17. So if a star's V is 16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 can be seen. So a star with V=15 is brighter than both 16 and 17, so both can see it. But a star with V=17 is too faint for HIRES, only ESPRESSO can see it. But we're looking for stars that both can detect. So the apparent magnitude must be less than 16, because that's the limit for HIRES. So any star with V <16 is within both instruments' capabilities.

Now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star except for those who already have it given. Let me look at each star.

Star1: Absolute magnitude is 15.5, at 10 pc. Oh, wait, the absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So if a star is at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude (m) is equal to M. So Star1's apparent V is 15.5 mag. Because M = m when distance is 10 pc. So Star1's V is 15.5, which is less than 16. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it. But wait, what about extinction? Oh, wait, I see some stars have E(B-V) given. Like Star3 and Star4. So I need to calculate the apparent V for them considering extinction.

Let me go through each star:

Star1: RA 15, DEC -75, Mv=15.5, distance 10 pc. So mV = 15.5. So yes, it's brighter than 16, so can be seen by both. But
