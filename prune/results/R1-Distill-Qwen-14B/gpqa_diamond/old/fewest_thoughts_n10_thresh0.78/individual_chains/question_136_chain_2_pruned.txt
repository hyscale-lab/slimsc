Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of vector calculus. Let me take a deep breath and read it carefully.

The question says: We've got a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r squared. So, the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r². And it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember from my notes that there's this thing called Gauss's Law, which relates the divergence of a vector field to the charge enclosed or something like that. But wait, in electromagnetism, Gauss's Law says the integral of E·dA over a closed surface is equal to the enclosed charge. But I'm not sure if that applies here directly because this question isn't about electric fields or charges. Oh, wait, maybe I can use the divergence theorem here.

Right, the divergence theorem relates the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to the volume integral of its divergence. So the integral of the divergence of f over the volume is equal to the flux of f through the closed surface (the sphere of radius R).

But wait, the problem is asking for the volume integral of the divergence. So, according to the divergence theorem, that should be equal to the flux through the surface. So, if I can find the flux through the sphere, that would give me the answer.

But wait, the vector field f is given as having only a radial component, and the field magnitude is 1/r². So in spherical coordinates, the vector field would be f(r) = (1/r²) * r̂, since the other components (theta and phi) are zero.

So, the flux Φ would be the integral of f · dA over the sphere. Since the field is radial, dA is also radial, so the dot product simplifies to f(r) * dA.

Flux Φ = ∫ f(r) dA over the sphere. But f(r) = 1/r², and on the sphere of radius R, r is R. So f(R) = 1/R².

The surface area of a sphere is 4πR². So Φ = (1/R²) * 4πR² = 4π.

Wait, but according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of ∇·f is equal to Φ. So that would mean that ∫ (∇·f) dV = 4π?

But wait, wait a minute. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The divergence of a vector field F in spherical coordinates, when F has only a radial component F_r and no angular components, is given by (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r). So F_r is 1/r², so let's compute the divergence.

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = (
