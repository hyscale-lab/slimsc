Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my spin states and expectation values. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says: An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are A to D, with some fractions involving hbar.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation. So the formula is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. For spin y, the operator is σ_y multiplied by ħ/2, I think. Because for spin-½ particles, the spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

The spin state given is (3i, 4). I think this is a column vector, so ψ = [3i; 4]. Or wait, sometimes in some notations, the order might be different. But I think for spin-½, the up state is the first component. So ψ is a column vector with 3i in the first entry and 4 in the second.

To find the expectation value, I need to compute ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. Let's break this down.

First, compute S_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Then, the expectation value is:

⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ [3i*, 4*] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i; 4] ]

Wait, but wait: the matrix multiplication order. Let me correct that. The operator S_y is multiplied by |ψ⟩, then ⟨ψ| is applied on the left.

So:

S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) σ_y |ψ⟩.

Then, ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ is the inner product of ψ with S_y ψ.

Alternatively, since S_y is a Hermitian operator (as it's an observable), but wait, σ_y is Hermitian, so S_y is also Hermitian. So the expectation value should be a real number.

Let me first compute σ_y |ψ⟩.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when we multiply σ_y with the vector [3i, 4], we get:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*(4) = i*(3i) = 3i². Since i² is -1, that's 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y |ψ⟩ gives [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, multiply by ħ/2: (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T.

So S_y |ψ⟩ = [ -2i ħ, (-3/2) ħ ]^T.

Next, compute ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, which is the inner product of ψ with S_y |ψ⟩.

Wait, ψ is a column vector [3i; 4], so ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose, which is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, complex conjugate of 3i is -3i. So ⟨ψ| is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the inner product is:

[ -3i, 4 ] * [ (-2i ħ), (-3/2 ħ) ]^T.

So compute this as (-3i)*(-2i ħ) + 4*(-3/2 ħ).

Let's compute each term:

First term: (-3i) * (-2i ħ) = (6 i²) ħ. Since i² is -1, this becomes 6*(-1) ħ = -6 ħ.

Second term: 4 * (-3/2 ħ) = (-12/2) ħ = -6 ħ.

Adding the two terms: (-6 ħ) + (-6 ħ) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but wait, I think I missed a factor of 1/2 because S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. Let me see:

Wait, no, I included that already. Because S_y |ψ⟩ is (ħ/2) σ_y |ψ⟩, which I computed as [ -2i ħ, (-3/2 ħ) ].

Wait, because (ħ/2)* [ -4i, -3 ] is [ (-4i ħ)/2, (-3 ħ)/2 ] → [ -2i ħ, (-3/
