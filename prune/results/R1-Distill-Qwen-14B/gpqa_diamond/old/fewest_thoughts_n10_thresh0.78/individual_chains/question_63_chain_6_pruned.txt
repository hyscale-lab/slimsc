Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and it needs to absorb a photon so it can switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would probably involve some transition in either the rotation or vibration.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor accounts for the vibration of the bond, unlike the rigid rotor which assumes the bond length is fixed. So the energy levels would involve both rotational and vibrational contributions.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to a higher energy state. The question is about the momentum of the photon. I know that the energy of a photon is related to its frequency by E = hÎ½, where h is Planck's constant. Momentum p is related to energy and velocity, but for a photon, the momentum p = E/c, since photons have speed c.

Wait, so if I can find the energy difference between the initial and final states, I can find the photon's energy, then compute the momentum.

The molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state in the rotational-vibrational model is the first vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). But I'm a bit confused about whether the next state would
