Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used for accelerating charged particles, like protons, to high energies. Synchrocyclotron is a type of cyclotron, right? I think it's designed to handle relativistic particles, which cyclotrons might not do as effectively.

The problem states that a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. The options are A to D, with numbers around a few thousand, so I probably need to calculate it using some formulas.

Wait, synchrocyclotron... I think that in synchrocyclotrons, the frequency of the applied voltage is adjusted as the particle's velocity increases, which is why it's called 'synchronous'. So the frequency ν(α) depends on the particle's momentum, I guess.

But how do I connect this to the number of revolutions? Let's think about the basics. Each revolution, the proton gains a certain amount of energy from the electric field. Since the voltage is alternating, the proton is accelerated each time it passes through the gap, but only when the voltage is in the right phase.

Wait, but the cyclotron's operation is based on the principle of resonance. The particles are accelerated each half-cycle, and the frequency of the applied voltage must match the natural cyclotron frequency of the particle. But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency is adjusted as the particle's mass increases relativistically. So the frequency ν(α) is a function of the particle's momentum, which increases as it gains energy.

Hmm, so the number of revolutions would relate to how much energy the proton gains and how many times it circles the synchrocyclotron as it gains that energy.

The initial kinetic energy is zero, and the final is 950 MeV. Each time the proton goes around, it gains some energy. But wait, in cyclotrons, each revolution provides a fixed energy gain in the classical case,
