Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice chemistry question, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question talks about a substance X reacting violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

Hmm, I think I should start by figuring out what each of these substances could be. Let's take it piece by piece.

First, gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Since W is a gas, maybe H2O, NH3, CH4, or something like that. Wait, but same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think: for example, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons in the common isotope). So the molecule would have 2*(1+0) + (8+8) = 18? No, wait, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, O has 8 each. The molecule's total protons: 2*1 +8=10. Neutrons: 0*2 +8=8. Oh, but that doesn't match. So W's molecule must have same number of protons and neutrons in total.

Wait, maybe W is CO2? Let's see: CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 2 O (8 each). So protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. Oh, wait, that's 22 each. So CO2 would fit. But wait, CO2 is a gas, yes. Alternatively, maybe H2O: H2O has 2 Hydrogens (each 1p, 0n) and O (8p,8n). So total protons: 2+8=10, neutrons: 8. Not the same. So that doesn't fit. What about CH4? C has 6p,6n; H has 1p each. So protons:6+4=10, neutrons:6. Not same. Hmm.

Another option: NH3. N has 7p,7n. H has 1 each. So protons:7+3=10, neutrons:7. Not same. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the molecule is something like O2? O has 8p and 8n each, so O2 has 16p and 16n. So that fits. But O2 as a gas in such a reaction... but what would that
