Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. The problem is asking about the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function f(λ, θ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the form of f.

Wait, so first, the maximum power A is the total power radiated, right? Because the power per unit solid angle is a function f, so integrating f over all solid angles (4π steradians) should give A. No, wait, actually, the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles, yes. So if A is the maximum power, maybe A is the total power, or perhaps the maximum value of f multiplied by 4π? Hmm, I need to be careful here.

But wait, the question says the maximum power radiated is A. So perhaps the maximum value of f (per unit solid angle) is A/(4π), but I'm not sure. Or maybe A is the total power, so the maximum per unit solid angle would be A/(4π) at the maximum direction.

Wait, I think I should recall the radiation pattern for a dipole. Since the charge distribution is oscillating, it's probably an oscillating dipole. The radiation from a dipole has a specific angular dependence. The power radiated by a dipole in the far field (radiation zone) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the power per unit solid angle would have a sin²θ dependence.

Wait, let me think. The radiation pattern for an oscillating dipole is sin²θ. So the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ is 1, so maximum. So the power per unit solid angle is maximum at θ=90, which would mean that if the maximum power is A, then at θ=30 degrees, it's (sin30)^2 times A/(some factor). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.
