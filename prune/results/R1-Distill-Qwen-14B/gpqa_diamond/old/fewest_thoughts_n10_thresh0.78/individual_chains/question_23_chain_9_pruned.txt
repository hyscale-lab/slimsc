Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves a reaction where a specific compound is treated with hydrogen bromide, and then they checked the reaction progress using TLC. The result shows that the reactant spot has gotten smaller, and two new spots have appeared. I need to figure out which of the options (A, B, C, D) correctly identifies the products.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me break that down. The benzene ring has an oxygen attached, which is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The substituents on the butenyl are two methyl groups on carbon 2. So the structure would look like a benzene ring with O- attached to a CH2 group, then a CH(CH2CH3) [Wait, no. Let me think again. The but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond in between? Wait no, the buten-3-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with double bond between 3 and 4? Wait, no, wait, but-3-en-1-yl. So the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is actually CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't be right. Wait, but the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, the butenyl group is but-3-en-1-yl, so the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but the substituents are on the second carbon. Oh wait, the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, wait. Let me think again.

The substituents are 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the butenyl group has four carbons. The double

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question involves a reaction between a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. Hmm, I remember that hydrogen bromide (HBr) is commonly involved in addition reactions, especially with alkenes. Oh wait, the compound given is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me visualize that structure.

So the molecule structure: it's a benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a but-3-en-1-yl group, which has two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure would look like OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait no, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. So but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, wait. Wait, butene is CH2=CHCH2CH2, but if it's but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So it's CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond starting at C3? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond between C3 and C4? Wait that can't be right because the double bond can't be after the third carbon in a four-carbon chain. Oh wait, butenyl would be four carbons in total. So numbering from the end, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait no, that would be but-1-en-4-yl or something. I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: so the substituent is attached at the first carbon, and the double bond starts at the third carbon. So structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? But that would mean the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond at
