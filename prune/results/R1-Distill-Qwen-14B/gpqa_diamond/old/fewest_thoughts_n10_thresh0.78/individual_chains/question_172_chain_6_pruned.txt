Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere relates to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the more excited the atoms are because thermal energy excites them.

Wait, the energy difference between the energy levels is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J. I think that's the value of the energy difference ΔE between the two levels we're considering. So, the energy required to excite an iron atom from the lower level to the higher one is ΔE.

Since the stars are in Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where N1 and N2 are the populations, g factors are the statistical weights, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

In this problem, the question is about the ratio of the excitation levels between the two stars. For star 1, the excitation is twice that of star 2. So, for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state (or whatever lower state) is given.

Let me denote N1 as the number of excited atoms in star 1, and N2 as the same in star 2. So N1/N2 = 2. But wait, actually, wait the question says the excitation is twice as high. So maybe the ratio is 2:1 for N1/N2.

But wait, let me get back to the Boltzmann equation. Let me denote T1 as the temperature of star 1 and T2 as that of star 2. So for each star, N1/N2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But wait, in the general case, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, for star 1: (N1')/(N2') = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star 2: (N1'')/(N2'') = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the question says that the excitation is twice as high in star 1. So I think that the ratio N1/N2 for star 1 is twice that of star 2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as (N1_1 / N1_2) = 2, where N1_1 is the number of excited atoms in star 1 and N1_2 is the same in star 2? No, that might not be accurate. Alternatively, the excitation level is the number of atoms in a higher energy state relative to a lower one. So the ratio for each star is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So, for each star, the ratio is (
