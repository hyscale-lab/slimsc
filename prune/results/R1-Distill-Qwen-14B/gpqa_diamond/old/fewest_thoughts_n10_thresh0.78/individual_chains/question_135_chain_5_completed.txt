Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through this step by step. Hmm, the problem says that the bosonic field X has a mass of 6 GeV, and it interacts with fermions through a specific Lagrangian. I'm supposed to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Oh, right, usually the Lagrangian term for a Yukawa interaction is something like L = -g ψ ψ X, where g is the coupling constant. So in this case, the interaction term is proportional to X(y) ψ_f(y) ψ_f(y). Oh, wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, the term is -λ f f-bar X, perhaps? Because it's written as λ f (something) X. Wait, the original expression is: L(y) = -λ f f-bar (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I misread that. Maybe it's better to parse the expression. So, the term is -λ multiplied by f (some function) multiplied by the fermion fields?

Wait, perhaps the actual interaction term is written as L = -λ f ψ_f(y) X(y) ψ_f(y). Or maybe I should think in terms of the standard Yukawa coupling. The Yukawa term is usually something like L = g ψ ψ X, where ψ is a Dirac fermion. So the coupling would involve X interacting with two fermions.

So, the interaction term here is probably something like X ψ_f ψ_f, meaning X is coupling to two fermions of the same type. Because the term is written as f-bar ψ_f times X, perhaps. Wait, the way the question is written, it's -λ f f-bar (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and it's supposed to be -λ f ψ_f-bar (y) X(y) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, no. Let me think more carefully.

Looking at the Lagrangian term: -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that can't be correct because the dimensions don't quite match. Oh, perhaps the interaction is something like a Yukawa coupling, so the term is -λ X ψ_f ψ_f. So X couples to two fermions.

But wait, the notation in the Lagrangian is a bit ambiguous. Let me try to parse it again. The term is -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps f-bar is the same as ψ_f? Or maybe f and ψ_f are the same fermion fields. Alternatively, perhaps the term is written as λ times X times ψ_f times ψ_f, which would make sense for a Yukawa interaction. So, the interaction term is proportional to X ψ ψ.

Assuming that, the boson X can decay into two fermions of the same type. So the decay products would be a pair of fermions. But then, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So the allowed decays would be into any fermion pair where the combined mass is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but what fermions are available? Let's list the known elementary fermions. The fermions in the Standard Model are quarks (u, d, c, s, t, b), charged leptons (e, mu, tau), and neutrinos. But in this case, the interaction term is X ψ ψ, so the fermions are charged because the interaction must be with Dirac fermions, which have both positive and negative charge.

Wait, the neutrinos are Majorana or Dirac? Well, in the Standard Model, they are considered as left-handed, but for this problem, perhaps it's safe to assume that X can interact with charged fermions. So the possible decay products would be pairs of quarks or charged leptons.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let's think about the rest mass: each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let's list the masses of the fermions (approximate):

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are very light, but since X is neutral (assuming), perhaps it can't decay into neutrinos because the interaction would have to involve charged particles. So X can only decay into charged fermions, like quarks or leptons.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, if X is a boson, it must be a scalar, so the coupling would have to preserve the gauge symmetry. But perhaps that's beyond the scope here; the problem is more about kinematics.

So, for X to decay into a pair of fermions, each of the fermions must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV, since each must be less than half the mass of X (since the sum is 6 GeV). Wait, no, that's not quite right. The sum of the masses of the two fermions must be less than the mass of X. So for a fermion-antifermion pair, each has mass m, so 2m < 6 GeV → m < 3 GeV.

So, any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Let me list the fermion masses:

Electron: 0.5 MeV → much less than 3 GeV → allowed.

Muon: ~105 MeV → allowed.

Tau: ~1.78 GeV → allowed.

Charged pions are mesons, so not applicable here.

Quarks:

u: 2 MeV → allowed.

d: ~5 MeV → allowed.

s: ~100 MeV → allowed.

c: ~1.3 GeV → allowed.

b: ~4.5 GeV → each b quark is 4.5 GeV, so two would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b and anti-b.

Top quark is way too heavy, so no.

So possible decay products are any pair of fermions where each fermion has mass less than 3 GeV.

So, the possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e- → yes, both 0.5 MeV.

mu+ mu- → 105 MeV each.

tau+ tau- → 1.78 GeV each. Two taus sum to ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so allowed.

Quarks:

u u-bar → 2 MeV → sum 4 MeV.

d d-bar → sum ~10 MeV.

s s-bar → sum ~200 MeV.

c c-bar → sum ~2.6 GeV.

What about bottom? b b-bar would require 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass, so it's not allowed.

So the possible fermion pairs are e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

Wait, wait, but in the options given, I don't see all of these. Let's look at the options.

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b quarks have a mass of 4.5 GeV each. So, X is 6 GeV. Two b quarks would be 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass, so it's not allowed. So any option including b b-bar is incorrect. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, c is about 1.3 GeV, so 2.6 GeV sum. That's allowed. So c c-bar is possible. So option B includes c c-bar, which is allowed.

But what about tau+ tau-? 1.78 GeV each, so 3.56 GeV total. That's allowed. So option B includes tau and others.

But wait, is tau allowed? Let me think: the mass of X is 6 GeV. For tau pair, 2 * 1.78 = 3.56 <6. So yes.

But wait, in the interaction term, is X coupling to all possible fermions or only specific ones? Because the Lagrangian given is L = -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps ψ_f is a specific fermion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the interaction is with all fermions, so X can decay into any possible fermion pair as long as their mass allows.

So, looking at the options:

Option B includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau, mu mu, e e. So all of these are possible except for maybe the charged current interactions. Wait, but the interaction is with all fermions, as the Lagrangian seems to imply.

Wait, the problem statement says that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So, perhaps the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided their combined mass is less than 6 GeV.

So, the possible decay channels are any pair of fermions where each is lighter than 3 GeV. So, that includes e, mu, tau, u, d, s, and c.

Wait, but what about the charm quark? 1.3 GeV each, so two would be 2.6 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So c c-bar is allowed.

So, the possible decay products are all the fermion pairs listed in option B and D.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, mu, e.

Option D includes b, but that's not allowed. So option D is wrong. So the correct answer is option B?

Wait, but looking at the options, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so the maximum mass allowed for each fermion is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can be a decay product.

The bottom quark is 4.5 GeV, which is over 3 GeV, so can't decay into b b-bar.

So the possible fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

So the possible decay channels are all of these, so the possible decay products should include all of these pairs.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau, mu mu, e e. That's all allowed.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So option D is wrong.

So the correct option is B. Wait, but wait another thing: looking at the options, option B includes c c-bar, which has a combined mass of 2.6 GeV, which is allowed. So yes.

Another point: the interaction term is given as L = -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps f is a different fermion field, and ψ_f is another. Hmm, maybe I've misunderstood the interaction structure.

Wait, perhaps the term is -λ f ψ_f(y) X(y) ψ_f(y). No, the original term is written as L(y) = -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I should parse it as λ * f * f-bar * (v + X) * ψ_f. But that would make the term dimensionally inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe the term is written as -λ f (f-bar ψ_f) (v + X) something. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo in the question. Alternatively, maybe the term is -λ f-bar psi_f X, which would make it a Yukawa coupling term.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is between X and a pair of the same fermions. So, X can decay into any pair of fermions ψ and anti-ψ, provided their mass is less than 3 GeV.

So, the possible decay products are any fermion pairs where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV. That includes e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So, the allowed decays are X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau, mu mu, e e.

Looking at the options, option B includes all of these. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed fermion pairs. So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \), based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs, as it is proportional to \( X \bar{\psi}_f \psi_f \). For a decay \( X \to \bar{\psi}_f \psi_f \) to be kinematically allowed, the combined rest mass of the fermion-antifermion pair must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_{\psi_f} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), which implies \( m_{\psi_f} \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The masses of the known fermions in the Standard Model are approximately:

- \( u \): \( 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( d \): \( 5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( s \): \( 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( c \): \( 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( b \): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy, as \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
- \( t \): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
- \( e \): \( 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( \mu \): \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( \tau \): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

From this, the fermions with masses less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \). Therefore, the allowed decays of \( X \) are:

\[
X \to u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-
\]

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( m_t = 173 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. This option is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
