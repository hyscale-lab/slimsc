Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says a light beam is going through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the beam is going, say, to the right, and the glass is moving to the right too, but maybe the observer is on the left side of the setup. Or maybe the setup is such that the glass is moving towards the observer, so from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving towards them, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, the question says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Oh, so the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So the lab frame is the stationary frame, and the glass is moving towards the observer, in the same direction as the light beam.

I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light within that medium doesn't just add vectorially because light is an electromagnetic wave and the medium's motion affects it in a specific way. Or wait, maybe it's more about how the medium's velocity affects the observed speed of the light.

Wait, normally, in a medium at rest, the speed of light is c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that change things? I'm a bit rusty here. I think it's related to the concept of the Doppler effect, but maybe not directly. Or perhaps it's about relativistic addition of velocities, but that would only come into play if v is a significant fraction of c, but the problem states c=1, so perhaps we can consider a non-relativistic approach first.

Wait, but light speed in a medium is given by c/n only when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. If the medium is moving, does the speed of light as observed change? Or is it that the speed relative to the medium is c/n, but the speed relative to the lab frame is different?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the lab frame.
