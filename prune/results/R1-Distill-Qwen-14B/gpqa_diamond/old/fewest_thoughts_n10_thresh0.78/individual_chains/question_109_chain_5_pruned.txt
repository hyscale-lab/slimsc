Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let's see. The question involves the Pauli exclusion principle and some conservation laws. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The problem states that two nucleons (NN) are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The initial state is 1S0. I remember that the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0, S=0, L=0, and J=0. So the state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The Pauli statistics condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, what are these quantum numbers again? T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum, and the equation is T = S + L + 1 mod 2. Oh right, this is for ensuring the overall wavefunction is antisymmetric under exchange of the two identical fermions. So for the final state, this condition must hold.

The problem says the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So substituting into the equation: 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. Which implies that S + L must be 1 mod 2, because 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd.

The question is about which partial wave isn't allowed. Partial waves are denoted by their orbital angular momentum quantum number l. The options give different l states for the emitted particle X. The options are:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p
B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p
C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f
D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s

Wait, the notation is a bit confusing. Let me parse each option. Each option is the initial state (1S0) decaying into something plus a particle X. The something is the final NN state, and the particle X is emitted. The lowercase letters after X indicate the angular momentum state of X. So for example, option A is 7D1 (the final NN state) plus a particle in p state (l=1). So p state implies l=1 for X.

Wait, but the X's intrinsic parity is given as -1. Parity considerations are important for angular momentum. Remember that parity is P = (-1)^l, so for X, l_parity = (-1)^l. Since X has parity -1, (-1)^l = -1 → l must be odd. So X must have an orbital angular momentum with l odd. So l could be 1,3,5,... etc.

So for each option, look at the emitted particle's angular momentum state. Let's check each option:

Option A: X is p → l=1 (valid, since 1 is odd). So X's parity is (-1)^1 = -1, which matches the given.

Option B: X is p → same as A, l=1. So parity is correct.

Option C: X is f → f usually stands for l=3 (since l=0 is s, 1=p, 2=d,3=f). So l=3 is odd. So X's parity is (-1)^3 = -1, correct.

Option D: X is s → s is l=0. Then parity is (-1)^0=1. But X has parity -1. So this can't be allowed. Wait, but wait, the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. So any process that emits X must conserve parity.

Wait, no. Wait, parity isn't conserved in weak interactions, but this problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So it must be a strong or electromagnetic interaction, where parity is conserved. So the parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.

So initial parity is that of 1S0. The parity of a state is (-1)^L. For 1S0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0=1.

The final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. So the parity of the NN state plus the parity of X must equal the initial parity (1). But wait, the parity of a two-body system is the product of their intrinsic parities (but since they're identical particles, maybe it's more complex). Wait, perhaps each particle has intrinsic parity, but the orbital angular momentum contributes a (-1)^L factor. Alternatively, maybe the parity of the NN state is (-1)^L times the product of their intrinsic parities. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the initial parity and the final
