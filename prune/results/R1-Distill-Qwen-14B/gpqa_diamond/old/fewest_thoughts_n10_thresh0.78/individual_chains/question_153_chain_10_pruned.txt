Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question has three separate reactions labeled (A), (B), and (C). Each of these reactions involves a Michael addition, and I need to figure out what the major products are for each. Then, matching them with the options provided.

First, let me recall what a Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound (like an enone or similar). The nucleophile, which is usually an enolate, attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, leading to a conjugate addition. So the enolate acts as the nucleophile here.

Looking at reaction (A): dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, likely deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good enolate precursor. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it forms the enolate ion. The enolate would have negative charge on the alpha carbon. Then, this enolate attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt? No, wait, let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOR? Wait, no, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. Wait, no, because acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-R. So the substituent is on the middle carbon. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, the correct structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me? Or is it CH2=C(p-tolyl)CH2CO2Me? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So if the substituent is in position 3, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

The key point is that the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, the
