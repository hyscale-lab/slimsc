Okay, so I've got this problem here about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my interplanar distances, but let me try to think it through. So the question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember rhombohedral is one of the crystal systems, right? It's like a distorted cubic system where all the edges are equal but the angles are different. Wait, but in this case, all the angles are 30 degrees. Oh wait, no, the problem says alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So this is a rhombohedral crystal with a = b = c (since it's rhombohedral) and angles all 30 degrees. Wait, is that right? Or is that a cubic system? Wait no, in a cubic system all angles are 90, so in this case, since all angles are 30, it's a rhombohedral.

The question asks about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember the formula involves the lattice parameters and Miller indices.

The formula I think is d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (2hk cos alpha + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos gamma) ) ) but wait, no, that's not quite right. Or maybe I'm mixing it up with another formula. Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha
