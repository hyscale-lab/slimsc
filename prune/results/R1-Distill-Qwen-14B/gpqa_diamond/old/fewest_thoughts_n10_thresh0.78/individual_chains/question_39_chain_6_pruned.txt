Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. 

So the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function needs to be normalized. Oh right, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 100%.

But wait, in this problem, when they measured the particles, they were only found between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function is zero outside that region. Or wait, no, the wave function is given as non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. Oh wait, the question says that when measuring, none were found outside 1 and 3, so that implies the wave function is zero elsewhere? Or that the wave function is only non-zero between 1 and 3. 

Wait, the way the question is phrased says that each particle's wave function in the part where it can exist is given. So maybe the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So the region is from x=1 to x=3.

So the wave function is Ïˆ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, but only between x=1 and x=3. Elsewhere, it's zero.

Wait, but the wave function usually includes real and imaginary parts. So
