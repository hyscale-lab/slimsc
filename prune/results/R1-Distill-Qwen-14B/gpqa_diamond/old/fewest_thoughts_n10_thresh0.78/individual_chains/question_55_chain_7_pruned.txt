Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit unsure where to start, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are various propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. The given NMR data points are:

- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets (dq)
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet

Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the number of signals and their splitting can give information about the structure. Let's break down each part.

First, the singlet at 2.1 ppm. I think a singlet of three protons is often a methyl group attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like an oxygen. Wait, acetate groups are OAc, right? So maybe that's the acetate part. The OAc group has a methyl (CH3) which is usually a singlet because the three H's are equivalent and not split by any neighboring H's. So that makes sense. So the 2.1 ppm peak is probably the acetate's methyl.

Next, the other signals. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a relatively large coupling constant. For protons on adjacent carbons, a coupling around 16 Hz suggests an allene (cumulative diene) or a trans configuration in a double bond. Wait, because for double bonds, the coupling (J) between trans (cis?) protons can vary. Wait, I think for trans double bonds, the coupling J is around 12-18 Hz, and cis might be a bit less, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if it's a vinylic proton next to another, like in an enol structure, maybe. But in this case, the doublet at 7 ppm—could that be a vinyl proton adjacent to another?

Looking at the 5.5 ppm peak, which is a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, a doublet of quadruplets. That sounds like a proton that's split by two different neighboring protons, each causing a different splitting. Or perhaps it's coupled to two sets of protons. Alternatively, this could be due to coupling with two different neighboring groups. Like, perhaps two neighboring protons on adjacent carbons. Wait, for example, in a propenyl group—CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, propenyl would have a double bond.

Wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl acetates. Let's think about their structures. 

Cis-propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but the structure of propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, but wait, propenyl is the group, so the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No. Wait
