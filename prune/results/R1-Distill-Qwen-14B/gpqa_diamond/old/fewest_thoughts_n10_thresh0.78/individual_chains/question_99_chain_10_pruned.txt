Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, each with a carboxylic acid group and some branching.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in the IR typically indicate O-H stretches. Since there's a carboxylic acid group (COOH) in all the options, that makes sense. The O-H in carboxylic acids usually absorbs strongly and broad in the IR, so that fits.

Another peak is at 1700 cm⁻¹. A strong peak there suggests a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 cm⁻¹ (maybe a bit lower, around 1680-1720), so that aligns. So the compound definitely has a COOH group, which all the options have.

Now onto the 1H NMR. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. That means there are no double bonds or rings with adjacent hydrogens, so no vinylic protons. So structures with any double bonds are out, but all the options here are saturated, so that's fine.

Looking at the NMR signals, one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about what that implies.

In 1H NMR, splitting patterns come from neighboring protons. For example, a triplet comes from coupling with two equivalent protons. So a doublet of triplets would be a proton that's next to two different sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of each splitting. The first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Breaking it down: each split happens due to neighboring J-coupled protons.

Let me think about each part. Starting with the quartet: a quartet suggests n+1 splitting, where n=3. So the proton is adjacent to three equivalent protons. Then, a triplet would be n=2, so another adjacent group of two protons. And a doublet would be n=1, another adjacent group of one proton. So putting it together, the splitting is quartet (from 3H), then triplet (from 2H), then doublet (from 1H). Or perhaps it's the other way around?

Wait, no. Each split is due to coupling with adjacent groups. So the overall pattern is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That would mean that the proton is experiencing coupling with three different sets of protons, each with a different number of neighbors.

Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet of triplets, each of which is a triplet. Or perhaps it's a more complex splitting. Let me think about the structure.

The other signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So that
