Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

Alright, the problem talks about two mixtures, X and Y. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. Also, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they give a single hydrocarbon Z, which has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Z is part of mixture Y and is used as a solvent. Importantly, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, implying it's fully saturated—maybe an alkane.

The question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

Hmm. So, let's think about each part.

First, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. That suggests that X has compounds that can react with bromine via addition or possibly some other reaction. Common compounds that do this are alkenes (ethene, propene, etc.) and aromatic compounds (like benzene). But wait, the problem says that X is a mixture of two liquids, and their reaction leads to Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. So after the reaction, the resulting compounds in Y don't react with bromine, meaning they are probably saturated, like alkanes.

So, when X is treated with platinum (a catalyst) and heat, it undergoes a reaction. The problem states it's a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation typically involves a single species being both oxidized and reduced. But because X is a mixture of two liquids, maybe each undergoes a reaction.

Wait, but the reaction forms Y, which is a mixture of two other liquids. So each component in X might undergo a different reaction to form the components in Y.

But wait, the problem says that the reaction is a disproportionation. Hmm. Maybe each component in X is a diene or something that can hydrogenate but also do something else, like maybe splitting into smaller molecules. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if X is a mixture of two alkenes, perhaps each can hydrogenate to form alkanes. But then Y would be a mixture of alkanes, which don't react with bromine, so that makes sense. But why would that be a disproportionation? Oh wait, maybe each of the alkenes is undergoing hydrogenation, which is an addition reaction, not a disproportionation. So that's not it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. For example, H2O turning into H2 and O2 when electrolyzed. But since X is a mixture of two liquids, perhaps each of them is undergoing a disproportionation reaction. Or maybe a single component is undergoing it, but X is a mixture, so maybe each of the two in X is a different substance, each undergoing a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different dienes, each of which undergoes a reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrogenation. Oh, wait, the problem says that when X is treated with platinum and heated, it forms Y. So maybe the reaction is hydrogenation. Oh! Because the mixture Y is formed via hydrogenation. But then, hydrogenation usually adds H2 across double bonds, turning alkenes into alkanes. But then, if X is a mixture of alkenes, Y would be alkanes, which don't decolorize bromine. So that fits.

But wait, the problem mentions that the reaction is a disproportionation. So, hydrogenation isn't a disproportionation. Hmm. So maybe I'm wrong here.

Wait, what's an example of a disproportionation reaction with alkenes? I'm trying to think. Alternatively, maybe X isn't alkenes but something else. Another possibility: if X is a mixture of two alcohols or something else. But wait, the fact that X decolorizes bromine water suggests it's an addition reaction, not an oxidation. Because bromine water decolorizes when alkenes add Br2.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes. Let's say, for example, X is ethene and something else. Then, when hydrogenated, they become ethane and the other alkane. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but later on, when both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they only give Z. So, if X is a mixture of alkenes, hydrogenating them would give alkanes, but Y is made from X via another reaction. So perhaps Y is a mixture of something else.

Wait, but the problem says that the hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. So, Z must be a product of both. That suggests that X and Y, when hydrogenated, give the same product, Z.

Hmm. So, let's think about what Z could be. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's compute that. 14.28% is approximately 1/7, since 1/7 is about 14.2857%. So, the percentage composition is C:85.72% and H:14.28%. Let's calculate the empirical formula.

Total = 100%, so C is 85.72%, H is 14.28%. So, moles: 85.72 /12 ≈7.143, and 14.28 /1=14.28. Simplify, divide by 7: 1.02 and 2.04. Hmm, close to 1 and 2. So the empirical formula is CH₂.

Wait, that can't be right because CH₂ isn't a possible formula for a neutral molecule. Alternatively, maybe the calculation is off.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value. 14.28% is exactly 1/7. So, mass of H is 1/7, mass of C is 6/7.

Wait, let's compute the ratio of C to H. Molar masses: C is 12, H is 1.

So, for 100g, 14.28g H is 14.28 moles H, and 85.72g C is 85.72/12 ≈7.143 moles C.

So ratio is C:H = 7.143 :14.28 ≈ 0.5:1, which is 1:2. So the empirical formula is CH₂. But that can't be a molecule. So, perhaps it's C₂H₄? Because that would have (2*12 +4)/ (2+4) = (24+4)/6=28/6≈46.67% C, but that's not matching. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the percentage.

Wait, wait. Let me recompute the percentage. If Z is a hydrocarbon with mass fraction H as 14.28%, then the molar ratio of C to H can be found as follows.

For a hydrocarbon, the formula is Cn Hm. The mass of H is (m/(12n +m)))*100 =14.28.

So, (m/(12n +m))=0.1428.

Let me try some small values for n and m.

Suppose n=1:

Then denominator is 12 + m. So, m/(12 +m) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides by denominator: m = 0.1428*(12 +m)

m = 1.7136 +0.1428 m

m -0.1428 m =1.7136 → 0.8572 m=1.7136 → m≈1.7136 /0.8572≈2. So m=2.

So formula is C1H2, which is CH₂. But that's not possible, as CH₂ is not a stable molecule. So maybe n=2.

n=2:

denominator 24 +m.

m/(24 +m)=0.1428

m=0.1428*(24 +m)=3.427 +0.1428 m

m-0.1428 m=3.427 → 0.8572 m≈3.427 → m≈4.

So m=4, formula C2H4. Let's check: (4)/(24+4)=4/28=1/7≈14.28%. Yes! So Z is C2H4, but wait, that's ethene, an alkene. But the problem says Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is a solvent. Ethene is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, confused.

Wait, but wait. Z is a product of hydrogenation. If X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So, if X is a mixture of alkenes, hydrogenation would give alkanes, which are Z. But in this case, Z is C2H4, which is an alkene, not an alkane. That can't be. So perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating Z.

Wait, no. Because the problem says Z is a hydrocarbon, and when X and Y are hydrogenated with H2 under severe conditions, they give only Z. So Z must be an alkane because it's a product of hydrogenation. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try n=4.

Wait, Z is a hydrocarbon (alkane), so formula is CnH2n+2.

So, let's compute H% for possible n.

n=1: CH4. H% is (4)/(16) =25%. Not 14.28.
