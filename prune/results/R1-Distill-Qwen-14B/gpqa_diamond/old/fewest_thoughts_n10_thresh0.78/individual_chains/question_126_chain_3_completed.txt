Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down step by step. The question involves two reactions and then analyzing the products using HPLC. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

First, let's look at Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The reagent used is LAH, which is Lithium Aluminum Hydride. I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce ketones and esters. Since the molecule has a ketone group at position 3, LAH will reduce that. So, the ketone (O) will become an alcohol (OH). Wait, but wait—what's the structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one? Let me draw it.

Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? No, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, let me think. Hexan-3-one would be (CH2)2CO(CH2)3? No, wait. Wait, hexan is six carbons. So position 3 is the third carbon. So it's:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let's count: 1, 2, 3. So structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan is six carbons. So 3-ketone would be:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I should write it out more clearly.

The correct structure for hexan-3-one is: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's five carbons in total? No, no. Wait, hexan has six carbons, so positions 1-6. 3-ketone would be:

1: CH3-
2: CH2-
3: C=O
4: CH2-
5: CH2-
6: CH3

Wait, no, that would be pentan-3-one if it's five carbons. Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the molecule: 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the hexane chain has six carbons, with a ketone on carbon 3, and a methoxy group on carbon 5.

So the structure is: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? Wait, no, because hexan-3-one would have the ketone on C3, so positions:

1: CH3
2: CH2-
3: C=O
4: CH2-
5: CH2-OCH3
6: CH3?

Wait, no, that might not be right. Wait, maybe it's:

Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: OCH3
Carbon 6: ?

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:

CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. No, wait, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's:

(CH2)2COCH2-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So hexane chain: positions 1 to 6.

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O (since it's 3-one)
4: CH2
5: OCH3 (since it's 5-methoxy)
6: CH3

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the structure:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the numbering. Let me try to draw it correctly.

Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? No, wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? That can't be right because that's 3-ketone in a six-carbon chain. Wait, perhaps it's:

Carbon positions:

1: CH3-
2: CH2-
3: C=O
4: CH2-
5: CH2-
6: CH3.

Wait, but that's 3-pentanone, not hexanone. Oh, wait, no, hexan-3-one has six carbons. So the correct structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's five carbons after the ketone. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as:

The structure is (CH2)2-CO-(CH2)3-OCH3?

Wait, no, the methoxy is on carbon 5. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3-CH2?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

(CH2)2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. No, that would have the methoxy on carbon 4.

Wait, maybe it's:

The molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which has the structure: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, the carbonyl is at position 3, and the methoxy is at position 5.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3? No, wait, position 5 would be the fifth carbon from the ketone. Let me number from the carbonyl.

Carbon 3: carbonyl.

Then, carbons 4, 5, 6.

So the structure would be:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH2-OCH3
Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, that can't be because that would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the molecule is:

(CH2)2-CO-(CH2)2-OCH3.

Wait, but that would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So:

Positions:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: OCH3
6: CH3?

Wait, no, because position 5 would be the fifth carbon from the end. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's move on.

In any case, when you treat this with LAH, the ketone group is reduced to an alcohol. So, the product of Reaction I would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, no, because LAH is a strong reducing agent and would convert the ketone into a secondary alcohol. But wait, the starting material is (S)-configured, so the product's configuration would depend on the mechanism of the reduction. LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, and the stereochemistry is retained because the reduction is via a two-step mechanism, so the configuration would stay the same. Wait, no, LAH is a strong enough reducing agent that it can sometimes cause racemization, but in this case, since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would be the corresponding secondary alcohol with the same configuration, unless the reaction conditions cause racemization. Wait, but LAH is a strong base; the reaction is done under acidic workup, so maybe the configuration is preserved.

Wait, but the product of a ketone reduction with LAH would be a secondary alcohol. So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait—when you reduce a ketone, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So the structure would be CH2CH2-CHOH-CH2-OCH3-CH3? Not sure, but perhaps that's correct.

Moving on to Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups: one at C2 and another at C4. Structure: (CH3)C(O)CH2C(O)CH3. So when treated with NaBH4, which is a strong reducing agent (but not as strong as LAH, but in this case, maybe it's enough), the ketones would be reduced. But wait, NaBH4 typically doesn't reduce ketones as effectively as LAH, but under certain conditions, it can. But wait, in this case, it's mentioned as excess NaBH4, so perhaps both ketones are reduced.

So each ketone would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So pentane-2,4-dione would become pentane-2,4-diol. Wait, but when you reduce two ketones, each becomes an alcohol. So the structure would be (CH3)CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3. Wait, but wait, the two ketones are at positions 2 and 4, so the product would be 2,4-pentanediol. Now, 2,4-pentanediol has two secondary alcohol groups. Now, the question is, does this molecule have any chirality? Let me see.

In 2,4-pentanediol, each alcohol is on a carbon that's connected to two other carbons and two hydroxyl groups. Wait, no: positions 2 and 4 are each CH(OH) groups. So for each of these carbons, the groups are: CH2, OH, CH2, and another CH2? Wait, wait. Let me write the structure.

Structure of 2,4-pentanediol: CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3. So each of the middle two carbons (2 and 4) have OH groups. Wait, no, that can't be right because the positions are 2 and 4. So the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, pentane is five carbons. So 2 and 4 are the second and fourth carbons.

So the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

Wait, but that would make each OH on a carbon with two CH2 groups and a CH3 perhaps? Wait, let's number them:

1: CH3
2: CH(OH)
3: CH2
4: CH(OH)
5: CH3.

Wait, that can't be because that would make the molecule symmetrical. So each of the two central carbons (2 and 4) have OH groups. Now, each of these carbons (2 and 4) has the following groups attached: two CH2 groups and an OH and a CH3? Wait, no, let's see.

Carbon 2: attached to carbon 1 (CH3), carbon 3 (CH2), OH, and another group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps each of these carbons is attached to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a CH3.

Wait, in any case, let's think about chirality. A chiral center is a carbon with four different substituents. So, in 2,4-pentanediol, each OH is on a carbon. Let's look at carbon 2: attached to CH3, CH2 (from carbon 3), OH, and another CH2 (from carbon 1). Wait, no, carbon 1 is CH3, carbon 2 is CH(OH), which is attached to carbon 1 (CH3), carbon 3 (CH2), an OH, and perhaps a hydrogen? Wait, no, it's a diol; each of the OHs are on secondary carbons.

Wait, maybe I should consider each carbon with the OH. Carbon 2 has groups: CH3, CH2CH(OH)CH3, OH, and a hydrogen? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Each of the OH groups is on a carbon that is attached to two other carbons. So, for carbon 2: substituents would be CH3, CH2 (from carbon 3), OH, and another CH2 (from carbon 1). Wait, but that would make it CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, maybe I'm not getting the structure correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: CH(OH)

Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, that would mean that each of the OHs is on a CH2 group? No, carbon 2 would be CH(OH), attached to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two H's? No, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Wait, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, each of the OHs is on a CH group. For carbon 2: substituents are CH3 (from C1), CH2 (from C3), OH, and a hydrogen. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make it a CH group, but with four substituents: CH3, CH2, OH, and H. So, that's four substituents. So, carbon 2 would have CH3, CH2, OH, and H. Are these four different groups? CH3, CH2 (which is part of a CH2 group connected to C3), OH, and H. So, yes, that's four different groups, making carbon 2 a chiral center. Similarly, carbon 4: substituents would be CH2 (from C3), CH3 (from C5), OH, and H. So, again four different groups. So, each of these carbons (2 and 4) is a chiral center.

But wait, in this structure, the molecule would have two chiral centers. So, 2,4-pentanediol would have two stereogenic centers, each being the OH-bearing carbons. Now, would the molecule be meso or have enantiomers?

Let me think: if the molecule is symmetrical, like if the configuration at C2 and C4 are mirror images, it could be a meso compound. For example, if C2 is R and C4 is S, but due to the symmetry, the molecule might be achiral. Alternatively, if both are R or both are S, it might be a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the two OHs are on symmetric positions. So, if the configurations are opposite, the molecule would be a meso compound because the plane of symmetry would make the mirror images identical. Therefore, the possible products would include a meso form and other possible diastereomers.

Wait, when NaBH4 reduces the two ketones in pentane-2,4-dione, what happens? Each ketone is reduced to an alcohol, so both positions 2 and 4 become hydroxyl groups. Now, the question is whether the reduction leads to retention of configuration. But wait, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol using NaBH4, you get a secondary alcohol with the configuration determined by the approach of the hydride. But in this case, since the starting material is a symmetrical diketone, the product would form two identical chiral centers but with possible configurations.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which is symmetrical. So when you reduce it, each of the two ketones would form an alcohol. Since the starting material is symmetrical, perhaps the product could either be a meso compound or a pair of enantiomers, depending on how the reduction occurs.

Wait, but the reaction is done with excess NaBH4. So, each ketone is reduced. The product is 2,4-pentanediol. Now, considering the possible stereoisomerism.

If the two OHs are both on the same side (R,R or S,S), then the molecule would have two stereocenters and would be a pair of enantiomers. Alternatively, if the OHs are on opposite sides (R,S), but due to the symmetry, the molecule could be meso, which is achiral.

Wait, but when NaBH4 reduces a ketone, it typically adds the hydride from the less hindered side, leading to a certain configuration. But in the case of a symmetrical diketone, the reduction would lead to a mixture, perhaps. So, what is the product?

Wait, perhaps the reaction of pentane-2,4-dione with NaBH4 would produce a racemic mixture, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it would form a single diastereomer, but I think that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a meso compound.

Wait, but NaBH4 is a chiral reducing agent? No, NaBH4 is a chiral reagent because it's a BH4^- ion, which is a chiral Lewis acid. So, perhaps the reduction of each ketone would proceed with a specific configuration.

Wait, let's think of the individual reduction of each ketone. Each ketone in pentane-2,4-dione is equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. So when NaBH4 reduces each, the hydride would approach from the same face, leading to the same configuration at each center.

Wait, but in this case, since the starting material is symmetrical, the reduction would lead to a molecule where both OH groups are on the same face, leading to either (R,R) or (S,S) configurations, but due to the molecule's symmetry, perhaps it's a meso compound.

Wait, no, if the two OHs are on the same side, then the molecule would not be meso. Meso compounds have stereocenters but are achiral due to a plane of symmetry.

Wait, let me think of the structure again. If the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, and the OHs are both on the same side (both R), then the molecule would have two chiral centers, and their configurations would be R and R. But due to the symmetry, the molecule would actually be meso, meaning it's achiral.

Wait, no, because the molecule would have a center of inversion. Imagine the central CH2 group. If the two OHs are on the same side, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4, making it meso. Alternatively, if the OHs are on opposite sides, then the molecule would not be meso and would have enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of tartaric acid as an example. The meso form has two stereocenters with opposite configurations, leading to internal symmetry. So, in our case, if the two OHs are on opposite sides, the molecule would be meso. But if they are on the same side, then the molecule would have two stereocenters with the same configuration, making it a pair of enantiomers. But wait, how does that work?

Wait, perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer because the molecule is symmetrical, and the reaction produces a meso compound. So, in the case of pentane-2,4-dione, when reduced by NaBH4, the product is meso-2,4-pentanediol. That would mean it's a single compound, not a mixture of enantiomers.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the product is a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers, but if the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps it's a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a mixture of both, but I think that depends on whether the reaction leads to retention of configuration or not. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces a single diastereomer.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the products of each reaction.

So, Reaction I gives (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is a secondary alcohol. Wait, but wait, the starting material is (S)-configured at the ketone. Upon reduction, the configuration of the OH would be the same as the original ketone's configuration because LAH is a strong enough base but the mechanism may not involve racemization. Wait, no, the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol typically involves a two-step mechanism where the tetrahedral intermediate forms, and the configuration is determined by the hydride attack. Wait, but in ketone reduction, the starting ketone is planar, so the hydride can attack from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, in this case, the starting material is a single enantiomer. So when you reduce it, the product would have the same configuration because the attack would happen from the same face.

Wait, no, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the configuration at C3 (the ketone) is S. Upon reduction, the C3 becomes a secondary alcohol. The configuration would depend on the approach of the hydride. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to retention of configuration, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reduction could lead to racemization because the tetrahedral intermediate could form and then re-form with either configuration. But if the reaction is done under strong acidic conditions, perhaps the intermediate could lose its configuration. But wait, the workup is acidic, so maybe the product is a racemic mixture. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, (S)-configured. When you reduce a ketone with LAH, does it produce a single enantiomer or a racemic mixture? I think that when you reduce a chiral ketone with LAH, you get a racemic mixture of the alcohol because the planar sp² hybridized carbonyl can lead to attack from either face, leading to both R and S configurations. Wait, but wait, the starting material is a single enantiomer. So, the ketone has a specific configuration, but upon reduction, the product would have a 50:50 mixture of the two possible alcohols. But wait, the starting material is (S) at C3. So, perhaps the product would be a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers of the alcohol. So, the product would have two chiral centers: the original C3 and any others.

Wait, but wait, in Reaction I, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has a chiral center at C3. Wait, no, the structure after reduction would have an OH on C3. So, the molecule is (S)-configured at C3 before reduction. Upon reduction, the configuration would depend on how the hydride attacks. So, if the hydride attacks from the same face, the configuration would be retained. But I think that in the case of LAH, the reduction leads to racemization because the intermediate is a planar sp³ hybrid, allowing the alcohol to form with either configuration. Therefore, the product would be a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers.

Wait, but the starting material is (S)-configured, so upon reduction, the product would have an equal mixture of R and S at C3. So, the product would be a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is a single enantiomer, so when it's reduced, if the reaction leads to racemization, the product would be a racemic mixture. Alternatively, if the reaction doesn't lead to racemization, perhaps the configuration is retained. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should look this up mentally.

LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically causes the reduction of ketones to alcohols without necessarily causing racemization. Wait, but no, actually, the reduction of a chiral ketone with LAH would lead to a racemic mixture because the carbonyl is planar, and the hydride can attack from either face, leading to a 50:50 mixture of the two possible alcohols.

So, in Reaction I, the product is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, two enantiomers.

In Reaction II, the product is pentane-2,4-diol. As discussed earlier, this molecule has two chiral centers, and due to the symmetry, it can be a meso compound or have enantiomers. But in this case, the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. So, it's a single compound, not a mixture.

Wait, but wait, the NaBH4 is in excess. So, would the reaction produce only the meso form, or a mix of meso and other stereoisomers?

Wait, when you reduce a symmetrical diketone like pentane-2,4-dione with NaBH4, which is a chiral reducing agent, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture. Wait, no, because the starting material is symmetrical, the product would be a meso compound. Because the two OHs are on the same side, leading to a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. So, the product is a single meso compound.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the product is a mixture of enantiomers. But in the case of a symmetric starting material, perhaps the product is a meso compound.

So, in Reaction II, the product is meso-2,4-pentanediol, a single compound with two chiral centers but achiral overall.

Now, the products from both reactions are combined. So, the products are:

- From Reaction I: racemic mixture of (R) and (S) 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, two compounds, each a single enantiomer.

- From Reaction II: meso-2,4-pentanediol. A single compound.

Wait, wait, but Reaction II's product is 2,4-pentanediol. Let me make sure. So, after reducing pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4, the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so it's a single product.

So, when combining the products, we have:

- From Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (racemic mixture, two enantiomers: R and S).

- From Reaction II: meso-2,4-pentanediol (one compound).

So, in total, we have three compounds: R, S, and meso.

Wait, but wait, no. Reaction I's product is a racemic mixture, meaning an equal amount of R and S enantiomers. So, when combined, you have (R), (S), and (meso). So, three compounds in total.

Wait, no. Let me make this clear. Reaction I gives two enantiomers (R and S) of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Reaction II gives one compound: meso-2,4-pentanediol. So, when combined, we have R, S, and meso. So, three distinct compounds.

Wait, but wait, the question says that the products are combined and run on HPLC columns. So, when they run on a normal-phase HPLC, which is based on polarity, how many peaks would they see? And on a chiral HPLC, which separates enantiomers, how many peaks?

Normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity. So, each compound's polarity determines retention time. So, if you have three different compounds (R, S, and meso), each would elute at different times, leading to three peaks.

Wait, but wait, the meso compound is a single compound, but the R and S are enantiomers. So, on a normal-phase HPLC, which doesn't distinguish between enantiomers (since it's not chiral), R and S would co-elute, giving a single peak for the racemic mixture. Because the HPLC doesn't separate enantiomers, it can't tell them apart; they have the same physical properties except for chirality. So, the R and S would be one peak, and the meso would be another. So, total of two peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

On the chiral HPLC, which is packed with a chiral stationary phase, the enantiomers would separate. So, the R and S would give two separate peaks, and the meso would give one peak. So, total of three peaks on the chiral HPLC.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm. The meso compound is a single, achiral molecule, so it would elute as a single peak on both HPLC types. The racemic mixture (R and S) from Reaction I would elute as one peak on normal-phase HPLC but two peaks on chiral HPLC.

So, combining all, the normal-phase HPLC would show two peaks: one for the racemic 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and one for the meso-2,4-pentanediol.

The chiral HPLC would show three peaks: R and S from Reaction I, and meso from Reaction II.

Wait, but wait, how many peaks in each HPLC?

Wait, no. Let's think again.

Reaction I: produces 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol as a racemic mixture. So, two enantiomers, R and S. On normal-phase HPLC, they would be one peak. On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

Reaction II: produces meso-2,4-pentanediol. So, one compound. On both HPLC types, it would be one peak.

So, total on normal-phase: (R and S) = 1 peak + meso = 1 → total 2 peaks.

Total on chiral: (R) = 1, (S) = 1, meso = 1 → total 3 peaks.

Wait, but the options don't have 3 and 2 as an option. Let me check the options.

Option D says 3 in both. Option B is 3 in chiral and 2 in normal. Option C is 4 and 2.

Wait, but according to this, normal phase would have 2 peaks (racemic and meso), chiral would have 3 (R, S, meso). So, the answer would be 3 peaks on chiral and 2 on normal phase, which is option B.

Wait, but let me re-examine.

Wait, in Reaction I, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, no, that's the starting material. The product is the alcohol. Wait, no, the starting material is (S)-configured at the ketone. Upon reduction, the configuration at the former ketone carbon would be R or S, depending on the attack.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about Reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH.

The structure is:

(CH2)2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, perhaps the configuration at C3 is S. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol. The configuration at C3 would be determined by the attack of the hydride. But since the ketone is planar, the attack could be from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. So, the product is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

So, two enantiomers from Reaction I.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione reduced to 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so one compound.

So, when combined, the products are:

- Racemic mixture (R and S) of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (two compounds).

- Meso-2,4-pentanediol (one compound).

So, total of three compounds: R, S, and meso.

Now, when running on normal-phase HPLC, which doesn't differentiate between enantiomers, the R and S would co-elute, giving one peak. The meso would give another. So, two peaks in normal-phase.

On the chiral HPLC, R and S would separate into two peaks, and meso would be a single peak. So, three peaks in total on chiral HPLC.

So, the answer would be 3 peaks on chiral and 2 on normal, which is option B.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 5 and 4 → no.
B) 3 and 2 → yes.
C) 4 and 2 → no.
D) 3 and 3 → no.

So, the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC, 2 in normal.


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in chromatograms using normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC.

### Reaction I:
The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Treatment with LAH reduces the ketone group at C3 to a secondary alcohol, forming (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. However, LAH reduction of a chiral ketone typically leads to racemization due to the planar nature of the carbonyl intermediate. Thus, the product is a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, resulting in two enantiomers.

### Reaction II:
The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, a symmetrical diketone. Reduction with excess NaBH4 converts both ketone groups into hydroxyl groups, forming 2,4-pentanediol. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the product is meso-2,4-pentanediol, which is a single achiral compound.

### Combined Products:
When the products from both reactions are combined, the following compounds are present:
1. **From Reaction I**: A racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (two enantiomers).
2. **From Reaction II**: Meso-2,4-pentanediol (one compound).

### Analysis on HPLC:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**: This technique separates compounds based on polarity. Since enantiomers have the same polarity, they co-elute. Therefore:
   - The racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol appears as a single peak.
   - Meso-2,4-pentanediol appears as a separate peak.
   - Total peaks: **2**.

2. **Chiral HPLC**: This technique separates enantiomers due to the chiral stationary phase. Therefore:
   - The racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol appears as two distinct peaks.
   - Meso-2,4-pentanediol appears as a single peak.
   - Total peaks: **3**.

### Conclusion:
The normal-phase HPLC shows **2 peaks**, while the chiral HPLC shows **3 peaks**. This corresponds to **Option B**.
