Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let me think about what I know. Alright, the question is about a proton and an antiproton annihilating to produce two particles of opposite charge, A+ and A-. The mass of each A particle is given as 300 MeV/c². They're asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are all in terms of c, so I need to find v as a fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, the initial setup is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. Wait, no, wait. No, the reaction is p plus anti-p producing two A+ and two A-. But wait, protons and antiprotons annihilating usually produce particles like pions, but in this case, it's producing two each of a different kind.

But I think the key here is conservation laws. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I might assume that the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. Or wait, no, the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its kinetic energy is low. But protons and antiprotons have rest mass energy around 938 MeV each. Wait, but the problem states that m_A c² is 300 MeV. So each A particle's rest mass is 300 MeV. 

So, considering energy conservation. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The rest mass energy of each is about 938 MeV, so their combined rest mass is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, but wait, in particle reactions, the initial particles' kinetic energies can affect the outcome. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate that its kinetic energy is negligible, so the initial energy is just the sum of their rest masses.

Wait, but in reality, when a proton and antiproton collide, they can annihilate into other particles, but the initial energy includes their kinetic energies as well. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So perhaps the initial energy is approximately m_p c² + m_p c², since the antiproton has the same mass as the proton, right? Because protons and antiprotons have the same rest mass.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving
