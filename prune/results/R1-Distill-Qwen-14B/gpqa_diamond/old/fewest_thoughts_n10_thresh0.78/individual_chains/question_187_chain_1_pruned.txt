Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets and studying the universe's expansion. But wait, what determines if a star is detectable by ESPRESSO? Oh right, it's the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel. The question says S/N of at least 10 is needed for detectability during a 1-hour exposure.

So, I need to figure out which of the listed stars would have an S/N of 10 or higher. Let's look at the options:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with V mag 15 at 10 pc
d) Same V mag 15 at 200 pc
e) Same V mag 15 at 5 pc
f) Same V mag 15 at 50 pc

Wait, so Canopus and Polaris are actual stars. I'm not sure about their magnitudes, but I think Canopus is a very bright star. Polaris is the North Star, which is also bright. Their apparent magnitudes matter because that's what affects the signal.

The other options (c to f) all have the same absolute magnitude (V=15) but different distances. I remember that absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 pc. So, to find their apparent magnitude, I can use the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.

Let me calculate the apparent magnitudes for each:

c) d=10 pc. Since M=15, m=15 + 5*log(10/10)=15 + 0=15.

d) d=200 pc. m=15 +5*log(200/10)=15+5*log(20)=log(20)=~1.301, so 5*1.301≈6.505. So m=15+6.505=21.505.

e) d=5 pc. m=15 +5*log(5/10)=15 +5*log(0.5)=15 +5*(-0.301)=15-1.505≈13.495.

f) d=50 pc. m=15 +5*log(50/10)=15+5*log(5)=log(5)=~0.699, so 5*0.699≈3.495. So m=15+3.495=18.495.

So the apparent magnitudes are: c=15, e=13.5, f=18.5, d=21.5.

Now, for the detectability, I think the fainter the star (higher m), the lower the S/N. Because S/N is inversely related to the brightness (apparent magnitude) of the object. Brighter stars (lower m) have higher S/N.

But wait, how does S/N scale with magnitude? Because each step of 5 magnitudes is a factor of 100 in brightness. So the formula for flux is f = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m0 is some reference magnitude. The S/N typically depends on the flux, so higher flux (brighter, lower m) gives higher S/N.

But I'm not exactly sure about the exact relation. Let me think. The S/N ratio for a star depends on the number of photons collected. The number of photons is proportional to 10^(-
