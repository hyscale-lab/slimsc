Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that astronomers are studying a star with certain parameters. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

They're looking at the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is assumed to be in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Hmm. So, the key here is to figure out how the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels depends on temperature. I remember that in LTE, the ratio of populations in two energy states is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower. So the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K with spots, vs 6000 without.

But wait, are the spots cooler or hotter than the surrounding photosphere? Spots on a star are usually cooler regions. So when a spot covers part of the star's surface, it emits less flux. But the question says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff decreases. So the star's effective temperature is an average based on the total luminosity. 

Wait, but in this problem, when the spots are present, the star's effective temperature is lower. So without spots, it's 6000 K, with spots, 5500 K.

Now, the ratio
