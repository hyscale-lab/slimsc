Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I'll try to visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). The numbering must be such that these groups are in the correct positions relative to each other.

Wait, in benzene, numbering starts so that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So if the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, they must be adjacent in a meta arrangement? Or maybe not, because 1,2,3 would be adjacent in a way that makes the largest substituent have a lower number? Hmm, maybe I should sketch this.

But before that, let's think about the synthesis steps. The starting material is benzene, and we need to introduce three substituents: t-Bu, OEt, and NO2. The order of adding these groups is crucial because each substitution can influence the next due to directing effects.

Benzene is usually activated or deactivated by substituents. Nitration is a meta director, but wait, nitro groups are strong meta directors, and they deactivate the ring. Ethoxy groups are strong activating groups (ortho/para directors), and t-Bu is a bulky group, probably a deactivating due to being an alkyl group but ortho/para directing because it's an activating group? Wait, no: alkyl groups are activating (since they donate electrons via induction, even though they are bulky), and are ortho/para directors. So, ethoxy is a strong activating group, t-butyl is a weaker activating (since it's bulkier but still donates electrons).

But wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating (meta director), so if we add that last, maybe. Because nitration is a nitro group, which is meta.

Wait, the target molecule has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and t-Bu at 2. So how would these groups be added?

Let me think about the order of addition.

Perhaps the first substituent should be the one that directs the next group into the correct position. Let's say I add ethoxy first. Then, since ethoxy is a strong activating group (ortho/para), the next substituent would go either ortho, para, or maybe meta, but wait, no, the next substituent would go ortho or para to the ethoxy.

But wait, wait: when adding substituents, the existing groups influence the incoming electrophile. So, adding ethoxy first would make the ring very activated, and the next substituent (like t-Bu or nitro) would go ortho or para to ethoxy.

But wait, in the target, the nitro is at position 3. Let's number the benzene with ethoxy at position 1, then the t-Bu at 2, which is adjacent (ortho) to ethoxy. Then nitro at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the first substituent is t-Bu. Because t-Bu is bulky, maybe it's added first to a less hindered position. Then, ethoxy can be added. Let me think: if I add t-Bu to benzene via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, that's possible, but wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation tends to form carbocations, which can lead to rearrangements. Oh wait, t-Bu is a tertiary alkyl group, so in Friedel-Crafts it would form a tertiary carbocation, which is stable. So Friedel-Crafts alkylation is feasible here.

So step 1: benz
