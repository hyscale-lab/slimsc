Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through. So, the question is about why some peaks disappear when using a different fixation method. 

Alright, the setup: They did a ChIP-seq using PFA-fixed samples and an antibody against IKAROS, which is a transcription factor. Then, they used next-gen sequencing with standard steps. But when they switched to PFA plus DSG fixation, those peaks went away. So the question is, where would those disappearing peaks be located?

Hmm, I remember that ChIP-seq helps identify binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. The process involves crosslinking proteins to DNA, shearing the DNA, and using an antibody to pull down the protein-DNA complexes. Then sequencing tells us where the binding sites are.

PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a common fixative in ChIP. It crosslinks proteins to DNA, making the complexes stable for the subsequent steps. But wait, DSG is something else. Oh right, DSG stands for dimethyl sulfoxide with gluteraldehyde. Wait, no, DSG is a crosslinker too, but perhaps it's used in a different way. Or maybe it's a part of a more thorough crosslinking protocol. Alternatively, PFA+DSG might be a more stringent fixation method?

Alternatively, I've heard that PFA is a milder fixative, perhaps not as effective in crosslinking certain proteins, especially in certain regions of the genome. For example, regions with high nucleosome density might not get properly crosslinked with just PFA, so perhaps when you use a stronger fixative like PFA+DSG, those regions get crosslinked more efficiently, but maybe some regions are more susceptible to losing their crosslinks under different conditions.

Wait, but in this case, the peaks disappeared when using PFA+DSG. So the original experiment with PFA showed peaks that were not seen when using PFA+DSG. So perhaps the initial method (PFA alone) was not crosslinking certain regions properly, but the more stringent method (PFA + DSG) fixed everything, but the peaks went away. That doesn't make sense. Or maybe the initial method over-crosslinked some regions, and the more efficient method crosslinks better but the regions that were not properly crosslinked before might have better crosslinking now.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this backwards. Let
