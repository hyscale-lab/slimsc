Okay, so I need to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columns—both standard (achiral) and chiral. I have to figure out how many peaks each would show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's used for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation typically occurs via an electrophilic addition. But the stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

So Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA. Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA. Both are treated with one equivalent, so each reaction will form an epoxide.

Wait, but what happens when you have different starting alkenes? Let me think.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, which is trans, reacting with mCPBA. Epoxidation of a trans-alkene would result in a trans-dihydroxy epoxide, but wait, no, correction: mCPBA adds across the double bond in a cyclic transition state, so the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting geometry.

Wait, no—wait. mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide would form such that the two new oxygen atoms are on opposite faces. Or wait, more accurately, the epoxidation leads to the formation of an epoxide with a particular configuration based on the starting double bond geometry.

Wait, maybe I should think about the type of epoxide formed. The reaction of mCPBA with an alkene forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. For example, if the starting alkene is E, the epoxide will have the two substituents on opposite sides, making it trans. Or wait, no, the epoxide is a three-membered ring, so the substituents are adjacent. Let me get this right.

Wait, when mCPBA reacts with a double bond, the peracid attacks the less substituted side in a conjugated addition. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some concepts. Alternatively, the epoxidation leads to the formation of an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are added with a certain stereochemistry based on the double bond's configuration.

Wait, another approach: for cis (Z) and trans (E) alkenes, the epoxidation will produce different epoxide diastereomers.

Wait, but oct-4-ene is symmetric in a way. Let's see: (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on both ends? Wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each end? Wait, wait no. Let me draw it.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, octene is 8 carbons. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Let's see: the structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each end? No, wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me correct.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me think. The correct structure is CH2CH2 groups on each end, but wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, I'm getting confused. Let's write it properly.

Oct-4-ene has 8 carbons. The double bond is between C4 and C5. So structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait no, that's not correct. Let me number. Carbon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

So, for oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the double bond is between C4 and C5.

Wait,
