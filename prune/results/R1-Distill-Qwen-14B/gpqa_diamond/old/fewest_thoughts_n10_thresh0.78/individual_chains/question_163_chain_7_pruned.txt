Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this. And then we also have to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down.

First, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, right? Iron(III) hydroxide. I remember that it's a sparingly soluble solid. So to dissolve it, a strong acid would react with it. The reaction would probably produce Fe³+ ions and water.

So the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid (let's say HCl, since it's monobasic and strong) would be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O.

Wait, yeah, because each OH⁻ from Fe(OH)3 would react with a H+ from HCl. Since Fe(OH)3 has three OH⁻ ions, we need three H+ ions, which would come from three HCl molecules. So the stoichiometry is 1:3.

So the first thing I need to find is how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles, so I can figure out how much HCl is needed.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Let's calculate that. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16, and Hydrogen (H) is 1. Each OH- group contributes 16+1=17 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH).

So:

Fe: 55.85 g/mol
3(OH): 3*(17) = 51 g/mol
Total: 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, sometimes the formula might be written as Fe(OH)3, so each OH is 17, times 3 is 51, plus Fe's 55.85: yes, 106.85 g/mol.

So we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. Moles would be mass divided by molar mass.

Moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009358 moles.

But wait, let me recalculate that. 106.85 * 0.0009 = 0.096165 grams. Hmm, so 0.1 is a bit more, so 0.0009358 is correct.

Now, from the reaction equation, each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl. So moles of HCl needed = 3 * moles Fe(OH)3.

Moles HCl = 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.0028074 mol.

The concentration of HCl is 0.1 M, which means 0.1 moles per liter (1000 cm³). So the volume of HCl needed is moles divided by concentration.

Volume HCl = 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028074 L, which is 28.074 cm³. Hmm, so approximately 28.07 cm³.

Looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³. That's really close. So maybe that's the correct volume.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the minimum volume needed. So why this calculation gives exactly that? Because I calculated based on the stoichiometry, assuming all Fe(OH)3 dissolves. But in reality, Fe(OH)3 is only sparingly soluble. So perhaps the amount of acid needed isn't just for stoichiometric neutralization, but also for dissolving the solid in the first place?

Oh, right! Because Fe(OH)3 has a low solubility, to dissolve it, you might need more acid than just what's stoichiometrically required. Or maybe not? Hmm. Wait, let me think.

The dissolution process of Fe(OH)3 in acid is a reaction. So the stoichiometric calculation should hold if the acid is sufficient to react with all the Fe(OH)3, but in practice, if the acid is too dilute, maybe some of the Fe(OH)3 doesn't dissolve. But since the question asks for the minimum volume needed to prepare the solution, assuming all Fe(OH)3 dissolves, which would require the stoichiometric amount. So the calculation is correct.

So the required volume is about 28.07 cm³, which matches option C's 28.05 cm³. So the volume part is likely option C.

Now, the second part is the pH of the resulting solution. So after adding the acid, we have FeCl3 in solution. FeCl3 is a strong electrolyte, so it dissociates completely into Fe³+ and Cl⁻ ions. The Fe³+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water to form H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

So the pH depends on the concentration of Fe³+ ions in the solution. Let me find the concentration.

After dissolving, the total volume is 100 cm³. The moles of Fe³+ will be equal to the moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.0009358 mol.

So concentration of Fe³+ is 0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009358 M.

Now, Fe³+ hydrolyzes in water according to the reaction:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The hydrolysis constant K can be found using the relationship with the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3. Alternatively, since it's a weak acid, we can use the hydrolysis constant K. Alternatively, I might remember that Fe³+ is a strong enough acid that it can hydrolyze significantly, so the pH will be quite low.

The hydrolysis reaction produces H+ ions, so the concentration of H+ will depend on K and the initial concentration.

But I'm not exactly sure about the K value for Fe³+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, I can calculate it using the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, what is the Ksp of Fe(OH)3? I think it's about 6 × 10^-38. Let me check my memory: yes, around 1e-37 or so. So a very low solubility.

Alternatively, the hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be considered in terms of the acid dissociation. The hydrolysis reaction can be written as Fe³+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)²+ + H+.

The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for Fe³+ is relatively large. I think it's about 5.8 × 10^-3 (I might be mixing up different values, but I'll proceed with that for calculation purposes).

Wait, let's think. The hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be considered as:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction is K = Kw / Ksp.

Wait, Ksp is the solubility product. Fe(OH)3 has a Ksp = [Fe³+][OH^-]^3.

But for the hydrolysis reaction, K would be [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+][H2O].

But H2O is a pure liquid, so it's omitted
