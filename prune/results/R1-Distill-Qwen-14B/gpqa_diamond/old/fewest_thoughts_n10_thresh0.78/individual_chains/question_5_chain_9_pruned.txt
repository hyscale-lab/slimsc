Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, right, in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the states in which the observable has a definite value (the eigenvalue).

Wait, the operator is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I remember that the total angular momentum operator P is the vector sum of these components, so P = P_x * x + P_y * y + P_z * z. But wait, wait, no, actually, the operator for the component along an arbitrary direction n would be the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the vector n. Oh right, because the spin operator is usually written as S = (ħ/2) σ · n, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So I think that's the case here.

But wait, the problem says that the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n would have components (x, 0, z) because it's in the x-z plane, meaning the y-component is zero.

So the operator P (which I think is the spin operator here) would be P = (ħ/2)(σ_x * n_x + σ_y * n_y + σ_z * n_z). Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Given that, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. Wait no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so P |v> = (ħ/2) |v> ?

Wait wait, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So the equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write the operator as (σ · n) multiplied by ħ/2, since the eigenvalues for spin-½ systems are ±ħ/2 when you have spin along a direction n.

So the general approach would be to find the eigenvectors of the operator σ · n, and then scale by ħ/2, but since the eigenvalue is given, maybe we can find the eigenvector directly.

Wait, but in the problem, each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given. For example, P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]], the Pauli Y matrix. P_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]], Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator P along direction n would be P = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0, so P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. Let me denote n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, because for a direction in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis, perhaps. Or wait, maybe it's more standard to use polar coordinates where θ is the angle from the z-axis, so yeah, n_x = sinθ cosφ, but since n is in x-z, φ is zero, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ? Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, the direction vector is typically (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since our direction is in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Or wait, wait, maybe n_x is cosθ and n_z is sinθ? Because sometimes angles are parameterized differently. Hmm, maybe
