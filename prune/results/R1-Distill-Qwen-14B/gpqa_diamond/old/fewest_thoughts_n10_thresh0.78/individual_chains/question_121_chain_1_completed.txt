Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about the reaction between a saturated epoxide and an organocuprate. The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, and the reagent is Me2CuLi. I need to figure out what product this will form from the given options.

First, I remember that organocuprates, like Me2CuLi, are nucleophilic reagents. They react with epoxides in a specific way. I think the mechanism involves the cuprate attacking the less substituted carbon of the epoxide. Oh wait, the question mentions that the alkyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon. So, the nucleophile (the cuprate) will add to the less substituted carbon because that's less hindered.

Wait, also, in disubstituted epoxides, there's an inversion of configuration at the carbon to which the nucleophile adds. Hmm, so the configuration at that carbon flips. But wait, the starting epoxide is bicyclic, so I need to look at its structure.

The starting compound is 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let me visualize that. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have two rings: one a four-membered ring, another a one-membered bridge? Wait, no, bicyclo systems are [x.y.z], where x is the largest bridge. So [4.1.0] means two bridges: a four-carbon bridge, a one-carbon bridge, and a zero? Or wait, maybe I should think of it differently.

Wait, the formula for bicyclo[m.n.p] is that m >= n >= p. So [4.1.0] implies three bridges: the largest bridge is 4 carbons, then 1, then 0. Wait, but that can't be right because the sum would be 4+1+0 = 5, but the ring is heptane. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, heptane is seven carbons. The bicyclo system has two bridgeheads. Let me sketch it mentally. The compound is 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. So it's a bicyclic structure with a seven-membered ring, but with two bridges: one of four carbons, another of one, and another of zero? Wait, maybe the numbering is different.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the oxygen is in the 7 position. Wait, maybe it's a norbornane-type structure. Norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. But this is bicyclo[4.1.0], which I think is a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is similar to a bicyclo system where there are two rings: a five-membered and a three-membered ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a bridged bicyclic ether. The molecule is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-configured. So the substituents are on positions 1,3,4, and 6.

I think I need to figure out which carbons in the epoxide are more substituted. The epoxide group is a three-membered ring with two adjacent carbons connected by an oxygen. In the bicyclo structure, the epoxide oxygen is at position 7, so the two carbons connected by the oxygen are positions 6 and 7? Wait, maybe 7 is the oxygen, so the two adjacent carbons are 6 and another.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Let me try to think differently. When an epoxide reacts with a cuprate, the nucleophile (the methyl group from Me2CuLi) will attack the less hindered carbon. In a disubstituted epoxide, the less substituted carbon is where the attack occurs. But if it's a bicyclic epoxide, the substituents (like methyl groups) might influence where the attack is more favorable.

Given that the starting molecule has 1R,3R,4R,6S configuration, perhaps the epoxide is between, say, carbons 1 and 2, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the product. The product is a cyclohexanol derivative. The options are all cyclohexanol derivatives with various substituents.

Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo compound with an epoxide. When the epoxide opens, the ring will likely break, and the product would form a cyclohexanol. Because organocuprates are strong nucleophiles, the attack will open the epoxide. So the product is a cyclohexanol with substituents.

The reaction mechanism should proceed via an SN2-like attack, leading to inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. Wait, but in a bicyclic system, the steric effects might influence where the attack occurs. Also, for a disubstituted epoxide, the less substituted carbon is the one with fewer adjacent substituents, so that's where the attack occurs.

Alternatively, in a bicyclic epoxide, the two carbons of the epoxide might have different substituents. Let's say one has more substituents around it and is more hindered. The cuprate would attack the less hindered one.

Wait, the starting compound is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. So it has methyl groups at positions 1,3,4, and 6. The 7 is the oxygen, so the epoxide is between carbons 6 and 7? No, wait, no, the 7-oxa is the oxygen, so the epoxide is between carbons 6 and 7? Or perhaps 7 is the oxygen, so the two carbons connected by the epoxide are 6 and another adjacent carbon.

Wait, in a bicyclo system, the numbering can be a bit tricky. Let me think: the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have two bridgeheads. Let's imagine the structure. For example, a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have a four-membered bridge, a one-membered bridge, and a zero-membered bridge? How? Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the chair-like structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a bicyclo with two rings: a five-membered and a three-membered. Wait, the seven-membered ring is split into two bridges. Let me try to imagine the structure as two bridges: one bridge of four carbons, another of one, and the third bridge of zero. Hmm, perhaps that's not possible. Maybe the zero bridge implies a direct connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the epoxide is between two bridgeheads. For example, the epoxide is at bridgeheads 6 and 1 or something.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of the starting compound as a bicyclo structure where the epoxide is between two carbons that are bridgeheads. The two bridgeheads (say, carbons A and B) are connected by the epoxide oxygen. So when the cuprate attacks, it will add to the less hindered bridgehead.

In a disubstituted epoxide, each bridgehead has substituents. One bridgehead (say, A) has more substituents, making it more hindered. The cuprate attacks the less hindered bridgehead (B), leading to the methyl group adding there.

Since it's an SN2 attack, there's inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. So if the configuration at B was R, it becomes S after attack, or vice versa.

Wait, the starting configuration is 1R,3R,4R,6S. So, the substituents are on positions 1,3,4, and 6. The epoxide is at position 7-oxa, so the two carbons connected by the epoxide are 6 and another—maybe positions 6 and 1? Because in the bicyclo system, bridgeheads are shared.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure. But since I can't do that, I'll try to imagine. Let's say the bicyclo has bridgeheads at positions 1 and 6. The epoxide bridges these two positions, so the oxygen is at position 7. So the two carbons in the epoxide are 1 and 6.

In the starting molecule, carbon 1 is R, and carbon 6 is S. Each has substituents. Carbon 1 has a methyl (since it's trimethyl?), maybe. Wait, the name is 1,3,4-trimethyl, so positions 1,3,4 have methyl groups. So carbon 1 is methyl (R), and carbon 6 is S. So if the epoxide is between 1 and 6, then each has substituents.

When the cuprate attacks, the less hindered carbon. Which of 1 or 6 is less hindered? If carbon 1 has more substituents (like methyl groups nearby), then it's more hindered. So the cuprate would attack carbon 6, which is S configuration.

Wait, but wait, the question says that in disubstituted epoxides, inversion occurs at the carbon to which Nu is added. So the configuration at the attacked carbon inverts.

So, in the starting molecule, the configuration at the attacked carbon is S (carbon 6). After attack, it inverts to R.

Now, after the attack, the epoxide ring opens, and the product is a cyclohexanol derivative. The methyl group from the cuprate adds to the less hindered carbon, and the OH group (from the other oxygen) ends up on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, the other oxygen in the epoxide, after opening, would become an alcohol. So the hydroxyl group would be on the other carbon.

Wait, perhaps the product structure is a cyclohexanol where the two new groups (methyl from cuprate and OH) are on adjacent carbons.

So in the product, the positions where the methyl and OH are attached would be adjacent. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, they are all cyclohexanol derivatives with substituents on positions 1,2,4,5, etc.

Option B is (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. So the hydroxyl is on position 1, and methyl groups on 2, 2,4,5.

Wait, but the starting material has three methyl groups in 1,3,4. When the epoxide opens, perhaps some of these substituents remain, and the new methyl is added.

Wait, when the epoxide opens, the two bridgeheads (1 and 6) become the two new adjacent carbons in the cyclohexanol. So the substituents from 1,3,4,6 would influence the structure.

Wait, perhaps the product has substituents from the original bridgehead substituents and the added methyl group.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the mechanism step by step.

1. The epoxide is between carbons 1 and 6 (bridgeheads).
2. The cuprate (Me-) attacks the less hindered of the two. If carbon 1 is more substituted (R configuration), then carbon 6 is less substituted (S configuration), so it's less hindered. So the attack occurs at carbon 6.
3. The attack is SN2, so inversion occurs at carbon 6. So the configuration changes from S to R.
4. The other oxygen (from the epoxide) attacks the other carbon (carbon 1), leading to the formation of the alcohol. But wait, attack is by the nucleophile on one carbon, and then the leaving group (the other oxygen) would form the alcohol on the other carbon.

Wait, maybe the actual mechanism is that the cuprate attacks the less hindered carbon (carbon 6), leading to the opening of the epoxide. The oxygen then becomes the hydroxyl group on carbon 1.

Wait, no, in an epoxide ring-opening under SN2 conditions, the nucleophile attacks one carbon, and the oxygen becomes an alcohol on the adjacent carbon.

So, for example, if the epoxide is between C1 and C2, and the nucleophile attacks C2, then the oxygen would end up on C1, and the methyl from the cuprate on C2. But in a bicyclic system, the positions are a bit different.

In the starting molecule, the substituents are R and S configurations. After the attack, the configuration at the attacked carbon inverts.

So, the starting configuration at carbon 6 is S. After attack, it becomes R.

Now, the product is a cyclohexanol. The substituents from the original molecule (1R,3R,4R,6S) would translate into the cyclohexanol structure.

Wait, perhaps when the epoxide opens, the bridge is broken, and the rings become a single cyclohexane ring. So the substituents that were in the bicyclo system (like the methyl groups) will now be in positions on the cyclohexane.

So, let's think about the product. The starting molecule has methyl groups on 1,3,4,6. After the epoxide opens, perhaps the 1 and 6 positions become adjacent on the cyclohexane, each bearing a methyl group. The attack by the cuprate adds another methyl on one of them, and the hydroxyl on the other.

Wait, but the product is a cyclohexan-1-ol, meaning the hydroxyl is on position 1. So the attack must have occurred at position 6, making the hydroxyl form on position 1.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. In the epoxide, the two carbons are 1 and 6. The cuprate attacks one, say 6, and the other (1) becomes the hydroxyl. So the hydroxyl would be on position 1 after the attack.

So the product will have a hydroxyl on position 1 (hence, cyclohexan-1-ol) and a methyl from the cuprate on position 6. But wait, the original substituents on 1,3,4,6 are all methyl groups.

Wait, maybe the starting molecule has methyl groups on 1,3,4, and 6. After the epoxide opens, the product has additional substituents.

Wait, perhaps the resulting cyclohexanol has substituents at positions 1 (from the original 1 and 6), 2 (from the bridge), 4 (original 3), and 5 (original 4?). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents from 3 and 4 become 2 and 5 in the cyclohexane.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry.

The starting bridgehead at 6 is S configuration. After attack, it becomes R. So in the product, the substituents from the original 6 (S) becomes R.

Let me look at the options again.

Option B: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

So, the hydroxyl is on position 1 (R configuration), and methyl groups on 2 (two of them), 4,5.

Wait, but the starting material had 1R,3R,4R,6S. So in the product, the substituents from 3 and 4 would be on positions 2 and 5 perhaps?

Wait, maybe when the bridge is opened, the substituents from the bridgehead (positions 3 and 4) end up on adjacent positions in the cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents at 3 and 4 in the starting material become substituents at positions 2 and 5 in the product.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2,2,4,5-tetramethyl. So the starting material's 1,3,4,6 are all methyl. After attack, the product has methyl groups at 1 (from original 1 and 6?), 2 (from 3), 4 (from 4), and 5 (from 6), plus the added methyl from the cuprate.

Wait, no, the product's structures are all cyclohexan-1-ol, so the hydroxyl is on position 1.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure after the reaction. The cuprate adds a methyl group to the less hindered carbon (carbon 6, which is S). When the epoxide opens, the hydroxyl ends up on the other carbon (carbon 1). So in the cyclohexane ring, the hydroxyl is on position 1, the added methyl is on position 6.

But wait, the starting material also has methyl groups on 1,3,4. So when the ring opens, those substituents would remain but perhaps in different positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions 1 and 6 in the bicyclo system become adjacent in the cyclohexane, so substituents from 1 and 6 are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, maybe the product has substituents on positions 1 (hydroxyl), 2 (from 3), 4 (from 4), and 5 (from 6 plus the added methyl from cuprate).

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option B is (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

So, positions 2 has two methyl groups, 4 has one, 5 has one.

Wait, the substituents from the starting material are 1,3,4,6. After the reaction, perhaps the substituents from 3 and 4 end up on 2 and 4 in the product, and the substituent from 6 ends up on 5, plus the added methyl from the cuprate on 5 or 2.

Alternatively, maybe the starting substituents:

- Position 1: R → becomes position 1 in the product (now with OH)
- Position 3: R → becomes position 2
- Position 4: R → becomes position 4
- Position 6: S → becomes position 5

But wait, the product has substituents on 2,2,4,5. So perhaps the original position 3 becomes 2 (adds a methyl), position 4 stays at 4, and position 6 (which is where the cuprate attacks) adds another methyl at position 5. So the product has methyl groups at 2,2,4,5.

So the configuration would be:

- Position 1: OH, which was originally R, but after attack, maybe the configuration changes? Not sure.

Wait, in the starting material, position 6 is S. After attack by the cuprate, the configuration inverts to R. So in the product, position 5 (from 6) is R.

So, in the product, positions 1 (OH), 2 (R, from 3), 4 (R, from 4), 5 (R, from 6). So all R configurations except perhaps 1, which is -OH.

Wait, but in the options, option B is (1R,4R,5R), but also has 2,2,4,5-tetramethyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the configuration changes.

Original substituents:

- 1: R
- 3: R
- 4: R
- 6: S

After reaction:

- The attack is at 6 (S) → becomes R.
- The hydroxyl is on 1 (originally R, so after attack, how does that change? Wait, the attack is on 6, which is a bridgehead. The other bridgehead, 1, is where the hydroxyl will form.

Wait, but does the attack on 6 cause any change in the configuration of 1? Or is 1's configuration retained?

In the epoxide ring-opening, only the attacked carbon's configuration changes (inversion). So, carbon 6 (S) becomes R. Carbon 1's configuration (R) remains R because the attack is on 6.

So, in the product, when the bridge is broken, the substituents from 1,3,4,6 are now in the cyclohexane.

Assuming that:

- The hydroxyl is on the former 1 (now part of cyclohexane's position 1)
- The new methyl from the cuprate is on the former 6, which is now part of position 5 in the cyclohexane
- The substituents from 3 and 4 (R configurations) end up on positions 2 and 4.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact positions. Alternatively, maybe the new methyl from the cuprate adds to position 2, and the hydroxyl is on position 1.

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize the product's configuration and substituents.

Looking at the options, option B has (1R,4R,5R), which suggests that positions 1,4,5 are R.

If the original 1 was R, and it's now position 1 with OH, then 1 would be R in the product (as the OH is a substituent, but the configuration depends on the attack).

Wait, but in the product, the OH is on position 1, which was originally R. Since the attack is on 6, which is a bridgehead, perhaps the configuration at 1 remains R.

So, in the product, position 1 is R, position 5 (from 6) is R, and position 4 (from 4) is R. Position 2 might have two methyl groups from the original 3 and perhaps another methyl from the cuprate attack.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the attack adds a methyl to position 2, leading to two methyl groups there.

Hmm. Let me think again. The cuprate adds to the less hindered carbon, which is 6 (S). So methyl adds to 6, which in the product becomes position 5. The hydroxyl is on position 1.

The original substituents:

- 1: R → position 1, now OH
- 3: R → position 2
- 4: R → position 4
- 6: S → position 5, now R after attack.

So, the product would have:

- Position 1: OH (R configuration)
- Position 2: methyl (R)
- Position 4: methyl (R)
- Position 5: methyl (R) from the cuprate addition.

Wait, but the options have more substituents. Option B has 2,2,4,5-tetramethyl. So two methyls on 2, and one each on 4 and 5.

So, perhaps the original substituents at 3 and 4 become 2 and 4, and the cuprate adds a methyl to position 5. But why two methyl groups at 2? Because the original 3 has a methyl, and perhaps another substituent from the ring opening.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach: when the cuprate attacks the less hindered bridgehead (6), which is S configuration. The attack leads to inversion, so 6 becomes R. The other bridgehead (1) remains R.

After the epoxide opens, the product's structure is a cyclohexanol with substituents based on the original bridge substituents.

So, considering that, the hydroxyl is on position 1 (R), the added methyl is on position 5 (R), and the original methyls from 3 and 4 are on positions 2 and 4, respectively.

Wait, but that would make four substituents: OH on 1, methyl on 2, 4,5. But option B has five substituents, including two methyls on 2.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the attack leads the added methyl to be on position 2, and the hydroxyl on 1.

Wait, perhaps the bridge structure leads to the added methyl being on position 2, not 5.

Wait, perhaps the bridgehead numbering is such that the hydroxyl ends up on position 1, and the added methyl is on position 2.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for the correct option.

Option C is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

That would mean substituents on positions 1,2,4,5, each R configuration.

Wait, but the starting material has 1R,3R,4R,6S. So maybe in the product, the substituents from 3 and 6 end up on positions 2 and 5.

So, the attack adds a methyl to 6, which becomes position 5 (R). Hydroxyl on 1 (R). Substituents from 3 and 4 become 2 and 4 (R each).

So, the product has methyl groups on 1 (from 1), 2 (from 3), 4 (from 4), and 5 (from 6 plus cuprate). Wait, no, the cuprate adds a methyl to 6, so 6 becomes 5 in the product. So 5 has a methyl from the cuprate and possibly another from the original 6.

Wait, perhaps the original 6 had a methyl, so when it's attacked, the cuprate adds another methyl there.

Wait, that would lead to two methyl groups on position 5. But none of the options have that except option A and B, which have two methyl groups on position 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents from 3 and 6 end up on the same position in the product.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: look for the option where the substituents are on positions 1,2,4,5, all in R configuration.

In option C, the substituents are on 1,2,4,5, each R.

So perhaps that's the correct product.


The reaction involves the reaction of (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with Me₂CuLi. Organocuprates, such as Me₂CuLi, act as nucleophiles and attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In disubstituted epoxides, the nucleophile adds to the less substituted carbon, and inversion of configuration occurs at the attacked carbon.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The starting material is a bicyclic compound with an epoxide group at position 7. The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane system has two bridgeheads at positions 1 and 6. The substituents are:  
   - Position 1: R configuration with a methyl group.  
   - Position 3: R configuration with a methyl group.  
   - Position 4: R configuration with a methyl group.  
   - Position 6: S configuration with a methyl group.  

2. **Reaction Mechanism**:  
   The organocuprate attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. Since position 6 (S configuration) is less hindered compared to position 1 (R configuration), the nucleophile (Me⁻) adds to position 6. This results in inversion of configuration at position 6, changing its configuration from S to R. The oxygen of the epoxide then becomes a hydroxyl group at position 1.

3. **Product Formation**:  
   After the epoxide ring opens, the product is a cyclohexanol derivative. The substituents from the starting material are distributed as follows:  
   - Position 1: Hydroxyl group (retains R configuration).  
   - Position 2: Methyl group from position 3 (R configuration).  
   - Position 4: Methyl group from position 4 (R configuration).  
   - Position 5: Methyl group from position 6 (now R configuration due to inversion).  

4. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.  
     Incorrect because the configuration at position 1 is S, which contradicts the retention of R configuration.  

   - **Option B**: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.  
     Incorrect because position 2 has two methyl groups, which is inconsistent with the substituents from the starting material.  

   - **Option C**: (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.  
     Correct. The hydroxyl group is on position 1 (R configuration), and the methyl groups are on positions 2 (from 3), 4 (from 4), and 5 (from 6).  

   - **Option D**: (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.  
     Incorrect because the configuration at position 2 is S, which contradicts the R configuration from position 3.  

### Conclusion:
The correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.  

ANSWER: C
