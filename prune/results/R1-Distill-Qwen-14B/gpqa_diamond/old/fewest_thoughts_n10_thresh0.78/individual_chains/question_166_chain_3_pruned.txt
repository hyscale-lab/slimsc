Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model extension and the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given includes some terms I recognize. Let's see: i bar(N_R) gamma^mu partial_mu N_R — that looks like a Dirac term for right-handed neutrinos. Then there's (1/2)(partial^mu phi)^2, which is the kinetic term for a scalar phi. The |D^mu S|^2 term is the covariant derivative squared for the scalar S — so S is a doublet, which probably makes it a part of the electroweak symmetry breaking. 

The next terms are interactions: -y_i/2 phi bar(N_iR)^c N_iR^c. So that's like a Yukawa coupling between the singlet fermions N and the scalar phi. Then there's the -g_i alpha bar(N_iR) L_alpha S term — wait, L_alpha is a lepton doublet, I think, and S is a scalar doublet. So this couples the singlet neutrinos to the leptons and the scalar. Finally, there's a potential V(phi, S, H). H is another scalar, I guess, but I'm not sure about its role here.

The fields are given: N_iR are singlet fermions with quantum numbers (1,1,0), which probably means they're SU(2) singlets, weak hypercharge 0. S is a scalar doublet, (1,2,1), so SU(2) doublet, hypercharge 1. Phi is a singlet scalar (1,1,0).

The vev (vacuum expectation value) is given as <phi>^2 = x^2 + v^2, and <phi> = x, <h> = v. Wait, but h isn't in the given fields. Oh, right, maybe H is the Higgs field. Wait, the potential includes H, so perhaps H is another scalar field, maybe the Higgs doublet? Or another singlet? Hmm, the question mentions a pseudo-Goldstone boson H2, so perhaps we're dealing with multiple scalars getting vevs.

Wait, the setup is about the extension of the Standard Model. In the Standard Model (SM), the Higgs is a doublet, and after symmetry breaking, it gives mass to the W and Z bosons. Here, phi is a singlet, so maybe it's another scalar that gets a vev. So when phi gets a vev, it breaks some symmetry? Hmm, but the SM's Higgs is a doublet, so maybe in this model, there are multiple scalars contributing to the symmetry breaking.

I'm trying to think about the scalar potential. In the SM, the Higgs field gets a vev, and the would-be Goldstone bosons are eaten by the W and Z to become massive. But if we have other scalars, like in a two-Higgs model, there might be additional Goldstone bosons.
