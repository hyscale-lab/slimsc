Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). We need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, right. So I remember that expectation value is like the average value you'd expect to measure. The formula for the expectation value of an operator is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, multiplied by the state vector. So it's <ψ|Ô|ψ>.

Wait, the spin state is given as (3i, 4). So that's a two-component vector. Let me write that down. Let's denote the state as |ψ> = [3i, 4]^T.

The operator for spin in the y-direction is S_y. Oh wait, the question mentions sigma_y. Oh right, for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators are S = (ħ/2) * sigma, where sigma is the Pauli matrices. So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the sigma_y matrix.

The sigma_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So to find the expectation value <S_y>, I need to compute ψ† * S_y * ψ.

Wait, ψ is a column vector
