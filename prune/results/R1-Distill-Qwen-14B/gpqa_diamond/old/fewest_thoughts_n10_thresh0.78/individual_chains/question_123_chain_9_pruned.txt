Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

A supernova in our galaxy. Ejecta moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, okay. So I think this is a special relativity problem because we're dealing with velocities that are a significant fraction of the speed of light. 60,000 km/s is way faster than typical everyday speeds, but the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so this is 0.2 times the speed of light. So relativistic effects might come into play here.

Wait, the problem says that both frames are inertial, which is a good start because that means we can apply special relativity principles. The key thing here is probably time dilation or length contraction because the two frames are moving relative to each other.

Wait, but the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, their own time is 50 seconds, and they see the galaxy moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. But the galaxy frame is the one we need to find the distance in.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s, right? Because the frames are moving relative to each other at that speed.

So let's consider the two frames: the Galaxy (let's say frame S) and the ejecta (frame S'). In S', the Galaxy is moving towards them at v = 60,000 km/s. So in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at v = 60,000 km/s.

But wait, the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during
