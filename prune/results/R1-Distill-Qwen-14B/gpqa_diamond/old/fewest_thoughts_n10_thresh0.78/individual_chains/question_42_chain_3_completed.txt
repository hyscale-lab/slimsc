Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and orbital periods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to piece it together.

Alright, let's read the question again. There are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe it's just context.

The given data: the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. Then, between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3. Wait, no, the question says the ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4. So T1 is 1.4 times T2. But when it comes to Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is 2.3, but which way? Does that mean Planet2's temperature is 2.3 times Planet3's or vice versa? Let me check the wording: the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So, I think that's T1/T2 = 1.4. Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3. Oh wait, no, because the wording is between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 2.3. So maybe it's T2/T3 = 2.3? Or is it T3/T2? Hmm, I need to be careful here.

Wait, the exact wording: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." So, maybe it's T1/T2 = 1.4. Then, between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is about 2.3. So I'm guessing that's T2/T3 = 2.3? Or could it be T3/T2? No, because if it's the same as the first ratio, it's the first planet over the second. So T1/T2 =1.4, T2/T3=2.3. So T1=1.4 T2, and T2=2.3 T3. So T1 would be 1.4*2.3 T3 = about 3.22 T3. So T1 is 3.22 times T3. Wait, but maybe I should think about it in terms of T1, T2, T3.

But wait, equilibrium temperature. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D^2)]^(1/4), right? Or wait, more accurately, the formula is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D^2) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, D is the orbital distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, in this case, all three planets have the same albedo of 0.3, so a is 0.3 for all. And the star's luminosity (L) is the same for all three planets because they're orbiting the same star. So the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of the distance, because T is proportional to (L/(D^2))^(1/4) = (L)^(1/4) / D^(1/2). So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(D).

But wait, the ratio of temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their distances. So T1 / T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Because if T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), then T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1).

Wait, let me think again. If T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), then T1 = k / sqrt(D1), T2 = k / sqrt(D2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Because (k/sqrt(D1)) / (k/sqrt(D2)) ) = sqrt(D2/D1).

Yes, that's right. So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). So if T1/T2 is 1.4, then 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1). Squaring both sides, (1.4)^2 = D2/D1. Which is 1.96. So D2 is 1.96 times D1. So D2 = 1.96 D1.

Similarly, for T2 and T3. T2/T3 = 2.3. So 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Squaring, (2.3)^2 = D3/D2. So D3 = (5.29) D2.

So putting it together, D2 = 1.96 D1, D3 =5.29 D2 =5.29 *1.96 D1. Let me calculate that. 5.29 * 1.96. Hmm, 5 *1.96 is 9.8, 0.29*1.96 is about 0.5684. So total around 10.3684. So D3 ≈10.3684 D1.

Wait, but orbital period is determined by Kepler's third law. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So P^2 ∝ D^3. Since all planets orbit the same star, the mass of the star is the same, so P^2 = (4π²/G M) * D^3. So P ∝ D^(3/2).

So the ratio of the orbital periods would be (D3/D1)^(3/2). Because P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2). Because (P3/P1)^2 = (D3^3/D1^3). So taking square roots, P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

We found that D3/D1 ≈10.3684. So (10.3684) raised to the 3/2 power.

Wait, what's 10.3684^(3/2)? Let me calculate that. First, sqrt(10.3684) is about 3.22. Because 3.22^2 is about 10.3684. Then, 10.3684^(3/2) is (sqrt(10.3684))^3 = (3.22)^3. Let me compute that.

3.22^3 = 3.22 *3.22 *3.22. Let's compute step by step.

3.22 *3.22 = approx 10.3684. Then, 10.3684 *3.22. Hmm, 10 *3.22 is 32.2, 0.3684 *3.22 is approximately 1.186. So total is about 33.386. So approximately 33.4.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recheck the math.

D3 is 5.29 * D2, and D2 is 1.96 D1. So D3 =5.29 *1.96 D1.

Let me compute 5.29 *1.96 accurately.

5 * 1.96 =9.8.

0.29 *1.96: 0.2 *1.96=0.392, 0.09*1.96=0.1764. So 0.392 + 0.1764=0.5684. So total is 9.8 +0.5684=10.3684 as before.

So D3 =10.3684 D1.

So P3/P1= (10.3684)^(3/2).

So, 10.3684 is about 10^1.016, but perhaps an exact calculation is better.

Let me compute 10.3684^(3/2).

First, take the square root of 10.3684: sqrt(10.3684)= approx 3.22.

Then, 3.22^3 = ?

3^3 is 27. 0.22^3 is about 0.0106. But when you cube 3.22, you can compute as (3 + 0.22)^3.

Using binomial expansion: (a +b)^3= a^3 + 3a²b + 3ab² +b^3.

a=3, b=0.22.

So: 27 + 3*(9)*(0.22) +3*(3)*(0.22^2) +0.22^3.

Compute each term:

Term1: 27.

Term2: 3*9*0.22=27 *0.22=5.94.

Term3:3*3*(0.0484)=9*0.0484=0.4356.

Term4:0.22^3=0.010648.

Adding all terms:27 +5.94=32.94; 32.94 +0.4356=33.3756; +0.010648=33.386248.

So approximately 33.386, which is about 33.4.

So the ratio P3/P1 is approximately 33.4. So the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times that of Planet1.

But wait, the question is about the orbital period of Planet3 being larger than Planet1 by what factor. So the factor is 33.4, which is option D.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I account for all factors correctly?

Another point: I used the equilibrium temperature formula and assumed that the same star is involved. The problem says it's a system of three exoplanets, so same star, same L.

Also, the mass ratios are given (Planet1/Planet2 is 1.15, Planet2/Planet3 is 1.35), but the question is about orbital periods. Kepler's third law relates to the distance and the mass of the star, not the planet masses. So the planet's mass doesn't affect the orbital period, I think. So we don't need the planet mass ratios for this problem.

So the given mass ratios are perhaps a red herring, or maybe they are used in another part of the problem, but since the question is about the period ratio, the masses don't come into play here.

So, the answer would be option D) ~33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply the relevant physical principles.

### Key Information and Relationships:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**:
   - The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:
     \[
     T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}}
     \]
     where \(D\) is the orbital distance. Thus, the ratio of temperatures between two planets is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their distances:
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}}.
     \]

   - From the problem:
     - \(T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \implies \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} = 1.4 \implies \frac{D_2}{D_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies D_2 = 1.96 D_1\).
     - \(T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \implies \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} = 2.3 \implies \frac{D_3}{D_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies D_3 = 5.29 D_2\).

   - Combining the two results:
     \[
     D_3 = 5.29 D_2 = 5.29 \times 1.96 D_1 = 10.3684 D_1.
     \]

2. **Orbital Period Ratio**:
   - Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance:
     \[
     P^2 \propto D^3 \implies \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}.
     \]

   - Substituting \(D_3 / D_1 = 10.3684\):
     \[
     \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}.
     \]

   - First, calculate the square root of \(10.3684\):
     \[
     \sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22.
     \]
   - Then, cube \(3.22\):
     \[
     3.22^3 = 3.22 \times 3.22 \times 3.22 \approx 33.4.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately **33.4 times** that of Planet1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
