Okay, so I have this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates with a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ. The maximum power is A, and I need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and also the possible form of f.

Wait, okay, what do I remember about dipole radiation? Oh right, when a dipole oscillates, it radiates electromagnetic waves. The power radiated depends on the angle θ from the dipole's axis.

The power pattern for a dipole is given by P(θ) proportional to (sinθ)^2, right? Wait, no. I think for an electric dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) has a dependence of (sinθ)^2. So the maximum is when θ is 90 degrees, because sin90=1. So the maximum power is at θ=90, and the power drops to zero at θ=0 and 180.

Wait, but the problem says that A is the maximum power. So the function f(θ) would have its maximum at θ=90 degrees. So f(θ) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, actually, the radiation from a dipole varies as sin²θ. So the maximum is when θ=90 degrees. So if the question is asking about the fraction of the maximum power at θ=30 degrees, we calculate f(30)/A, where A is the maximum, which is at θ=90.

So let's compute sin(30 degrees) squared. Wait, sin(30) is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25. So the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4.

Wait, but wait! The question says that in the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ. So f(θ) would be the power per solid angle. The total power would be the integral over all solid angles of f(θ) dΩ. But since the question is about the fraction of the maximum power, perhaps it's comparing f at θ=30 to the maximum f, which is at θ=90.

Wait, but the maximum power per unit solid angle is A. So perhaps f(θ) is given by (sinθ)^2 multiplied by some constants that depend on λ and other factors. Wait, what is the dependence on λ?

Hmm, I remember that the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to (d²p/dt²)², but in the far field, the radiation pattern is (sinθ)^2. Also, the radiation resistance and the power depend on the frequency, which is related to λ. The power is inversely proportional to λ^4, maybe? Let me think.

The power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( (μ₀/(4π)) ) * ( (e^2 ω^4)/(c^3) ) * (some terms), but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Oh wait, I think the power per unit solid angle (like the radiation intensity) for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2 and also to (ω^4), which is (2πc/λ)^4. Or wait, because ω is 2πf, and c is the speed of light. So ω is 2πc/λ.

So the radiation intensity (which is the power per unit solid angle) would be proportional to (ω^4) * (sinθ)^2. Since ω is proportional to 1/λ, because ω = 2πc/λ, then ω^4 is proportional to (1/λ)^4.

So the function f would be proportional to (sinθ)^2 * (1/λ)^4. Or maybe f is proportional to (sinθ)^2 multiplied by λ^(-4), because when λ decreases (higher frequency), the intensity increases.

Wait, but the problem says f is a function of λ and θ. So the possible form is given as options, which include things like λ^(-4), λ^(-3), etc.

So the function f could be proportional to (sinθ)^2 * λ^(-4), right? Because higher frequencies (smaller λ) mean higher radiation intensity.

So for the fraction of the maximum power at θ=30 degrees, it's [ (sin30)^2 ] / [ (sin90)^2 ] = (0.25)/(1) = 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the form of f is proportional to λ^(-4) multiplied by (sinθ)^2.

Wait, but the question says the maximum power is A, so the function f(θ) would be the power per unit solid angle. So the maximum of f(θ) is at θ=90, where sinθ=1. So if f(θ) = k λ^(-4) (sinθ)^2, then the maximum f is k λ^(-4)*1 = k λ^(-4).

But the problem says that the maximum power is A, so A would be the maximum value of f(θ), which is k λ^(-4). So if someone asks what fraction of A is radiated at theta=30, it's (k λ^(-4) (sin30)^2) / (k λ^(-4)) ) = (sin30)^2 = 0.25.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the form of f is λ^(-4) multiplied by (sinθ)^2, so f is proportional to λ^(-4).

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 1/4, λ^(-4). That seems to fit.

Wait, but another thing: the radiation pattern is (sinθ)^2, which is symmetric about the equator (θ=90). So the fraction of the power at θ=30 is 1/4 of the maximum.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to λ^(-4). So the correct option is C.


The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution shaped as a spheroid, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. The radiation pattern in the far field depends on the angle θ from the z-axis and the wavelength λ. The power radiated per unit solid angle, denoted as \( f(\theta) \), is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \) and also depends on \( \lambda \). The maximum power radiated is given as \( A \), and the task is to determine the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the form of \( f(\theta) \).

For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). The maximum power occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin^2\theta = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin^2\theta = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 0.25 \), or \( \frac{1}{4} \).

The radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) also depends on \( \lambda \). From the properties of dipole radiation, the intensity is proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \). Therefore, the function \( f(\theta) \) has the form \( f(\theta) \propto \sin^2\theta \cdot \lambda^{-4} \).

Among the given options:
- Option A: \( \frac{1}{2}, \lambda^{-4} \) is incorrect because the fraction of power at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \), not \( \frac{1}{2} \).
- Option B: \( \frac{1}{4}, \lambda^{-3} \) is incorrect because the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).
- Option C: \( \frac{1}{4}, \lambda^{-4} \) is correct because it matches both the fraction of power and the dependence on \( \lambda \).
- Option D: \( \frac{3}{4}, \lambda^{-6} \) is incorrect because the fraction of power is \( \frac{1}{4} \), and the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-6} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
