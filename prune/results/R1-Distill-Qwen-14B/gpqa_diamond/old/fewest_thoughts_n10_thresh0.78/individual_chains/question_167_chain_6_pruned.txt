Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. And N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, non-Gaussianity is being measured here using relative entropy. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

I remember that the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (like the Bhv measure) is the difference between the quantum entropy of the state and the entropy of the closest Gaussian state. So, if the state itself is Gaussian, then the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

Wait, but what's a Gaussian state? Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions. For single-mode states, coherent states, squeezed states, and thermal states are examples of Gaussian states. Non-Gaussian states include things like Fock states (number states), cat states, etc.

In this case, the state is a superposition of two coherent states: |alpha> and |-alpha>. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is a non-Gaussian state. So, the state is definitely non-Gaussian. But wait, in some cases, like when the phase phi is zero or pi/2, the state might collapse into something else.

Wait, phi is given as -pi/4. So let's compute what that implies. Let me think about cosine and sine of that. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, approximately 0.707. Similarly, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, which is about -0.707.

But wait the coefficients in the state are cos(phi) and sin(phi). So the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi). Let's plug in phi = -pi/4.

So cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707, and sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.707. So the state becomes (0.707|0.5> -0.707| -0.5>)/N. Wait, but what's N here?

N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2)). Let's compute sin(2*phi) when phi is -pi/4. 2*phi is -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1. So N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2 )).

Compute exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*0.6065) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

So the state is (0.707 |0.5> - 0.707 | -0.5> ) / 0.627.

Hmm, but wait, what's the structure of this state? It's a superposition of two coherent states. So the Wigner function of this state would be a non-Gaussian one, like a cat state.

Now, the relative entropy measure requires us to compute the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state and that of the closest Gaussian state. But wait, calculating the entropy of a general non-Gaussian state is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, the non-Gaussianity is zero if the state is Gaussian.

Wait, when phi is pi/4, then sin(2 phi) is sin(pi/2) = 1. Then, N would be sqrt(1 + (1) exp(-2 alpha^2)). But in that case, the state would still be a superposition, so non-Gaussian.

Wait, but wait a second. When phi is zero, the state becomes |alpha>, which is a coherent state (Gaussian). Similarly, when phi is pi/2, the state is | -alpha >. So those are Gaussian. But for other values of phi, it's a superposition of Gaussian states and thus non-Gaussian.

But what about when the superposition leads to a Gaussian? I'm not sure. I think the only cases when the superposition state is Gaussian are when it's just a single coherent state.

So, back to the problem: phi is -pi/4, alpha is 0.5. So the state is a non-Gaussian state.

But the question is about the non-Gaussianity measure del_b. So I need to compute this relative entropy.

Wait, the relative entropy is defined as the entropy of the state minus the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. But wait, no, the formula given is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the non-Gaussian state, tau is the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but the relative entropy in this case could be a measure of how non-Gaussian the state is. So if the state is Gaussian, rho equals tau, so the difference would be zero. If it's non-Gaussian, the difference is positive, I think.

But computing this requires knowing the density matrices rho and
