Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probabilities. Hmm. Let me think. So the setup is that we have an atom that we're monitoring, and we're interested in its decay. From previous experiments, the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that means that in 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it will decay. Wait, but actually, in radioactive decay, the probability is usually modeled with an exponential decay law, right?

Wait, the question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So maybe that's the probability that it will decay in that time. So that's the standard approach. So the decay follows an exponential probability distribution. So the formula for the decay probability is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time.

But wait, in the first part, the question states that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So now, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, since we're given that 50 minutes have passed without decay, how does that affect the probability?

Ah, right! Radioactive decay is a memoryless process. So the probability of decay in the next interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without decay. So the conditional probability, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, is the same as if it
