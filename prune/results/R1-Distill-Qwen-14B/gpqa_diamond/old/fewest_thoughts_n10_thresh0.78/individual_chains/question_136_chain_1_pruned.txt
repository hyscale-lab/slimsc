Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) within a sphere of radius R. The vector field falls off radially as 1/r², and it only has a radial component. Hmm, I remember that divergence is a measure of a vector field's source or sink at a point. So the integral would be like summing up all these sources and sinks within the volume.

First, let me recap what I know about divergence. The divergence of a vector field F is given by the sum of the partial derivatives of each component with respect to their respective coordinates. Since this field is in spherical coordinates and only has a radial component, maybe I can find a simpler expression for the divergence.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, the divergence operator is a bit different. The formula is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (F_θ sinθ) + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/φ) d/dφ F_φ. But since the field here only has a radial component, F_θ and F_φ are zero. So the divergence simplifies a lot. It should just be (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r).

Right, so F is the vector field, and in this case, F has only F_r, which varies as 1/r². So F_r = 1/r². Let me plug that into the divergence formula.

The divergence ∇·F would be (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let me compute that derivative. r² times 1/r² is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Oh wait, so the divergence is zero? That can't be right.

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. F_r is 1/r², right. So r² * F_r is r² * (1/r²) = 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·F is zero. But wait, that's only the divergence at a point not at the origin, right?

Hmm, because at r=0, the field isn't defined since it's 1/r², which would be infinite there. So the origin is a point where the field is singular. That makes me think about Gauss's law or the divergence theorem.

The volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the surface, according to the divergence theorem. So ∫∫∫ (∇·F) dV = ∫∫ F · dA over the surface of the sphere.

Wait, but if ∇·F is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral would be zero except perhaps at the origin. But the divergence theorem includes the origin in the volume, so maybe that's where the action is.

Alternatively, using the divergence theorem, the integral of ∇·F over the volume is the same as the flux of F through
