Okay, so I have this question about the Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constant tells us about the renormalizability of the theory. Let me think step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I know that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Wait, what's the dimension of each part here?

First, I need to figure out the mass dimension of each field involved. The fields are ψ (a Dirac spinor), and F^{μν}, which is the field strength tensor of a gauge field, say electromagnetism. Gauge bosons like photons are vector fields, so their field strength F has the same dimension as the gauge field A. 

I remember that in four-dimensional spacetime, the fields have specific mass dimensions. For Dirac spinors (like electrons), each ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2 because the action is dimensionless. So ψ̄ ψ would have dimension 3, because each ψ is 3/2, so 3/2 *2 =3.

Wait, but wait, σ_{μν} is an antisymmetric combination of gamma matrices. Since each gamma is dimensionless (they're just matrices), σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is dimension 3 (from ψ̄ ψ) because σ doesn't contribute any dimension.

Now F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. The derivative ∂ has mass dimension 1. Aμ (gauge field) has dimension 1 because the field strength F has dimension 2 (since each derivative gives 1, and F is built from derivatives of A). Wait, no: wait, in 4 dimensions, the action is ∫ d^4 x L, so Lagrangian density must have dimension 4. 

So, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Let's think about the Maxwell term, like L = -1/4 F^{μν} F_{μν}. Each F has dimension 2, so F F would be 4, which is correct for the Lagrangian.

So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

So back to our term: L_int is κ times ψ̄ σ ψ F. The dimensions of each part: ψ̄ σ ψ is 3, and F is 2. So the product (3) * (2) =5. Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, the coupling κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M is -1.

Now, about renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in four dimensions, a renormalizable interaction vertex must have a coupling with dimension ≤ 4 - (sum of fields' dimensions). Wait, more accurately, a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if the coupling's dimension is ≥ 0, because in perturbation theory, the expansion parameter is g/(Λ^d), where d is the negative of the coupling's dimension. So if the coupling has negative dimension, the term becomes nonrenormalizable because the interaction would involve higher orders of energy (i.e., higher derivatives or higher powers), leading to nonrenormalizable interactions.

Wait, no, I think the condition is that the coupling's dimension must be ≥ 0 for the theory to be renormalizable. Because if the coupling has negative mass dimension, that implies that the interaction term (like L = κ φ^n) would have a dimension higher than four in four dimensions, which is not allowed for renormalizable theories.

Wait, let me think again. The Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So for a term like κ ψ̄ ψ ψ̄ ψ (a four-fermion interaction), each ψ is 3/2, so four of them make 6. κ would need to have dimension 4-6= -2. So that's a nonrenormalizable term because the coupling has negative dimension. The theory would have an effective cutoff at some scale.

So in our case, the coupling κ has dimension -1. That's negative. So the term L_int has dimension 4 because the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 5, multiplied by κ with dimension -1, gives 4.

But because κ has negative mass dimension, the interaction is nonrenormalizable. Because each vertex would bring in a factor of κ, and since it's dimension is negative, in high-energy processes, the coupling becomes stronger, leading to a theory that isn't predictive at high energies and requires an infinite number of counterterms.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me recall the general rule. The mass dimension of the coupling g in an interaction term L = g φ^m must satisfy [g]_M = 4 - m [φ]_M. If [g]_M is positive, the theory is super-renormalizable. If zero, renormalizable. If negative, nonrenormalizable.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the formula is [g]_M = D - (sum of the fields' dimensions). Wait, in 4 dimensions, the dimension of the Lagrangian is 4. So for a term like g φ^n, the sum of the fields is n * [φ], so [g] = 4 - n [φ].

Wait, no, wait, no: the Lagrangian must have dimension 4 in 4D. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So for a term like g Φ^k, where Φ has dimension d, then [g] + k*d =4.

So, [g] =4 -k*d.

If [g] is positive, then the term is renormalizable only if [g] ≥0. Because for renormalizable theories, the interaction terms can have at most certain dimensions. So if [g] is negative, the term is nonrenormalizable.

In our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's compute the dimension.

Each ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2)*2 =3, because there are two ψs (since ψ̄ is like ψ^dagger γ^0, which has the same dimension as ψ). So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3.

F has dimension 2.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F is 3 + 2 =5.

So [L_int] = [κ] +5 =4. So [κ] = -1.

So [κ] is -1, which is negative. So the interaction is nonrenormalizable.

Wait, but wait, [κ] is negative which would make the term in the Lagrangian have dimension 4 when multiplied by κ. So why is that nonrenormalizable? Because when you have a coupling with a negative mass dimension, the interaction term is relevant only at low energies. Such terms are called nonrenormalizable because you need to introduce an infinite number of counterterms as you go to higher energies, making the theory not predictive beyond a certain scale.

So the options: [κ]_M is -1. The theory is not renormalizable. So looking at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and not renormalizable. Option A says it's -1 and renormalizable, which can't be right. Option D says [κ]=1 and not renormalizable, which is not the case. Option B says [κ]=1 and renormalizable, which is wrong.

So the correct answer is option C: mass dimension -1, not renormalizable.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. 

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has a mass dimension of $\frac{3}{2}$ in four spacetime dimensions.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$, which is derived from the gauge field, has a mass dimension of $2$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the interaction term
The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ involves two spinors, so its mass dimension is:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi] = 2 \times \frac{3}{2} = 3.
\]
The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has a mass dimension of $2$. Therefore, the product $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has a mass dimension of:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian density must have a total mass dimension of $4$ in four spacetime dimensions, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is nonrenormalizable. Nonrenormalizable theories require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences, making them predictive only at low energies.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
