Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right. Their Lorentz factors are given: 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. Then they collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One goes upper-right, the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. So, first, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since the electron and positron have equal and opposite charges (the positron is like an electron with a positive charge), their annihilation must conserve momentum and energy.

Wait, the problem says both photons have the same energy. That's interesting. So each photon has the same energy, but their directions are in the upper and lower right. So the angle between them would depend on their angles relative to the horizontal axis.

Let me think about conservation of momentum. Since the initial particles are moving along the horizontal axis (let's say the x-axis), the momentum in the y-direction must be zero before the collision. After the annihilation, the photons' momenta must add up to zero in the y-direction as well.

Each photon's momentum is in a particular direction. Let's denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Photon 1 is moving in the upper-right direction, which would mean it has a positive y-component and positive x-component. Photon 2 is moving lower-right, so it has a negative y-component and positive x-component. Wait, but wait, the positron is moving from the right towards the left, and the electron from the left towards the right. So their velocities are towards each other. After collision, the photons are moving to the right? Or could they be moving left? Hmm, the problem says the directions are upper-right and lower-right, so both are moving to the right along the x-axis.

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so it's going to the right. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so it's going to the left. When they collide, the annihilation occurs at the point where they meet. So the initial momenta are in opposite directions along the x-axis.

So the total initial momentum is the sum of their momenta. Let's calculate that.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. For the electron, gamma_e = 4. Its rest mass is m_e. So the momentum p_e is gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of relativistic momentum. The relativistic momentum is gamma * m * v. Alternatively, the relativistic energy is gamma * m cÂ², and the momentum is (gamma m v
