Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to how long the particle lives on average before decaying. Oh right, the mean lifetime is connected to the width via the uncertainty principle. The formula for the mean lifetime τ is τ = ħ / Γ, right? But wait, lifetime and decay distance... Oh yeah, you multiply the velocity by the lifetime to get the distance. So the decay length L is v * τ = (v * ħ) / Γ.

But wait, I should think about units and the actual formulas. I think Γ is the decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ / Γ. Then, the velocity v of the meson would be important because the decay distance is how far it travels before decaying.

Wait, but how do I find the velocity? I have the energy and the mass. The energy E is the total energy of the particle, which is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. But wait, I can find the velocity from E and m.

The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV/c². So I can calculate γ as E/(m c²). Wait, but since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², perhaps I can ignore the c² factors because they'll cancel out. Let's see.

γ = E / (m c²) → but let's be careful with units. Alternatively, since E = γ m c², and m c² is the rest energy, which is 1.2 GeV. So γ = E / (m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So γ is approximately 6.6667. Then, the velocity β can be found using the relation γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Let me solve for β.

γ² = 1 / (1 - β²) → 1 - β² = 1 / γ² → β² = 1 - (1 / γ²) → β = sqrt(1 - 1/(γ²)).

Let me compute that. γ is 8/(1.2) = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667. So γ squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444. Then, 1 / γ² is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775). Hmm, let me approximate that. sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887. So β is about 0.9887, which is v/c. So v is approximately 0.9887c.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) = 1 - ( (1.2)^2 )/(8^2 ) ) → 1.2 is 6/5, 8 is 8/1. So (6/5)^2 is 36/25; 8^2 is 64. So 36/25 / 64 = (36)/(25*64) = 36/1600 = 9/400 = 0.0225. So yeah, same as before. So sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887.

So v is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light. Now, the lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. Let's get the units right. ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Let me remember the value. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s, and ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055 × 10^-34 J·s. But when working in GeV and other particle physics units, it's often given as 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1.602 × 10^-10 J, so converting:

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just use the value in GeV·s. Yes, I think in particle physics, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So that's the unit we'll use.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. The decay width Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute this.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 → 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875 → 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32:

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 → 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875 → so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So τ is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the decay length L is v * τ. v is 0.9887c. So L = β c τ.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So let me compute L.

L = β c τ.

β is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s, τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.9887 * 3e8 = 0.9887 * 3 = 2.9661 → so 2.9661e8 m/s.

Then multiply by τ: 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ let's see. 2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322, 2.9661 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1687. So total is about 6.1009.

Then exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So L ≈ 6.1009e-16 meters? Wait, but I'm getting a number that doesn't match any of the options. Wait the options are in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 m range.

Wait, let's double-check the calculations. Let me compute 0.9887 * 3e8 = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s. 3e8 is 300,000,000; 0.9887 * 300e6 = 296,610,000 m/s.

So 2.9661e8 m/s.

Then multiply by τ: 2.056875e-24 s.

So 2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.9661 *2.056875 * 1e8 * 1e-24.

2.9661 *2.056875 ≈ let me compute that more accurately.

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ let's see.

0.9661 *2 = 1.9322,

0.9661 *0.056875 ≈ approx 0.055.

So total is about 1.9322 + 0.055 = 1.9872.

So total is 4.11375 + 1.9872 ≈ 6.10095. So about 6.10095.

Exponents: 1e8 *1e-24 =1e-16. So 6.10095e-16 meters.

Wait, but the options are A) 5.0223e-16, B)4.0655e-15, C)5.0223e-15, D)4.0655e-16.

Hmm, none of the options match 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me recheck the beta calculation.

Earlier, gamma is 8 GeV /1.2 GeV=6.6667. So gamma is 20/3.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444.

1/gamma^2 is 9/400=0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775)= around 0.9887 as before. So beta is correct.

Wait, perhaps the meson is at rest? No, since production energy is higher than rest mass, so it's moving.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the energy differently. Wait, but production energy is the total energy, so E=γ m c², which I used correctly.

Wait, another approach: maybe the mean decay length is given by L = (E)/(Γ c), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is L = (E * ħ c )/(Γ m) ?

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the formula for the decay length, which is L = (γ v ħ c)/(Γ). Hmm, because velocity v is beta c, so L= gamma beta c^2 (hbar)/(Gamma) ?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The proper formula for the decay length is L = v * gamma * c tau, but wait, tau is the proper lifetime. Or is it?

Wait, tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). The mean lifetime as observed in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. Because time dilation applies.

Wait, no, wait. The decay width Γ is related to the proper lifetime by Γ = ħ / tau_0. So the proper lifetime tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.
