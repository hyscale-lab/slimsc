Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I want to make sure I understand it correctly before diving in. Let me read it again and break it down.

The setup is that particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Now, the key point is that one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of them reach the inner walls?

Hmm. So the radius of the detector is 30 meters. I think the Lorentz factor affects how much the particles are time-dilated or length-contracted, which in turn affects how far they travel before decaying.

Wait, right. When a particle is moving at a high Lorentz factor gamma, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma times its proper lifetime. So if the particle's lifetime is tau in its rest frame, in the lab frame it's gamma * tau. That means it can travel further because it's moving faster and lives longer.

So the distance a particle travels before decaying is v multiplied by gamma * tau. But since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, v is approximately the speed of light, c. So distance D = c * gamma * tau.

But wait, the problem says that one third of the particles with gamma ~20 reach the detector walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. So for gamma=20, the particles either make it to the wall (one third) or decay before that (two-thirds, I guess). Wait, no, the problem says one third reach the walls, so two-thirds decay before.

Wait no, the current situation is that with a Lorentz factor of about 20, on average one third reach the inner walls. So we need to find the gamma that makes two-thirds reach the walls. So perhaps the probability of reaching is higher when gamma is higher. So the required gamma must be higher than 20. So looking at the options, the options are 54, 68, 40, 28. So gamma would be higher than 20, so 40,54,68 are options. 28 is lower than 20, but 28 is higher than 20? Wait 28
