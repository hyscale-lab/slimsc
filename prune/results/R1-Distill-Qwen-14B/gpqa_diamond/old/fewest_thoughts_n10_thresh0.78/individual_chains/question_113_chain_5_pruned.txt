Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are all different chemical formulas, so I need to match the given data to one of them.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So, the compound probably has an -OH group, like in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H stretch, so that's a possibility. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. 

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The peak at 1700 is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O). That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some kind of substitution. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't think that's one of the options here.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So that suggests the compound has a double bond. Also, the presence of vinyl protons in the NMR implies that the molecule has an alkene group, which is probably part of the structure.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, I need to think about what fragments have a mass of 45. Common fragments include the methyl group (15), but that's not 45. Wait, another possibility: a hydroxyl group attached to something else. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, maybe the -COOH group breaks off, but that might give different fragments. Alternatively, could it be an ethyl group or something else? Or maybe a fragment like CH3COO-? Wait, the molecular ion could break down into smaller parts. Let me think: 45 is 45 g/mol. What's the molecular weight of some common groups. For example, C3H7O would be 57, which is higher. 45 is 12*3 + 1*6 +16*2? Wait, let me calculate: 12*3=36, H6=6, O2=32. 36+6+32=74. That's higher. Alternatively, 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is 15 (CH3) +16 (O) +15 (CH3) = 46? Wait, no, that's 15*2 +16=46. Close, but not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let's think about each.

Option A: C6H12O2. That would imply two oxygen atoms. The IR has two carbonyl peaks, so maybe two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one carbonyl and another group like conjugated double bonds or something else. Wait, the peaks at 1700 and 1650 could be two carbonyls, like in a conjugated system. For example, maybe an ester and another group, or two ester groups. Or maybe a ketone and an ester. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and another is an aromatic ring with conjugation.

Wait, another thought. The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak is lower than 1700, so maybe it's a conjugated
