Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral? Oh right, that's one of the crystal structures. I remember that in a rhombohedral structure, all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. So, the lattice parameters a, b, c are equal, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are equal too. In this case, the angles are all 30 degrees. Oh, wait, no, the question says alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. Wait, but I think in a rhombohedral structure, the angles can be different, but in this particular case, they're all 30°, making it a special case.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance—does that refer to the lattice parameter a? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', but in a rhombohedral, it would be the same, right? Because all edges are equal. So I think a is 10 Angstrom here.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is d, calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor. The formula I remember is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) multiplied by some factor accounting for the angles. Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is:

1/d² = (h²/(a²) * sin²(alpha/2)) + (k²/(b²) * sin²(beta/2)) + (l²/(c²) * sin²(gamma/2)) ) plus some cross terms involving the cosines of the angles. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up two different approaches here. Alternatively, I think the formula might be more straightforward when the lattice is cubic, but this isn't a cubic case since the angles are 30°, which is not 90°, so it's a rhombohedral but not cubic.

Wait, another approach: for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance formula can be expressed in terms of the Miller indices (hkl)
