Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down. So the molecule has a cyclohexanone ring, which is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, which is a CH2OH substituent. At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(=CH2)-, so it's an allyl group attached to the cyclohexane ring at the 5 position. So the structure looks something like a cyclohexanone with substituents at carbons 3 and 5.

The first reaction step is treatment with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent, so I think this is an alkylation reaction. When NaH is used with a carbonyl compound like cyclohexanone, it usually deprotonates the alpha hydrogen. The alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl group, which is at position 1 here. So position 2 is alpha, but wait, the starting molecule is 3-(hydroxymethyl), so the hydroxymethyl is at C3. So maybe the other alpha positions are C2 and C6. Wait, actually, cyclohexanone has carbonyl at C1, so the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6 (since the ring is six-membered).

But wait, the molecule already has a hydroxymethyl group at C3, which is a secondary position, maybe that's an alpha position? Or no, because the carbonyl is at C1, so the alpha positions are C2 and C6. So perhaps the NaH deprotonates one of these, making a carbanion, which then reacts with benzyl bromide as an electrophile. So benzyl bromide is C6H5CH2Br. The carbanion would attack the benzyl carbon, adding a benzyl group.

Wait, but the starting molecule also has an enol group? Because the substituent at C5 is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is an allyl group. So maybe the compound can undergo some enolization or conjugate addition. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is activated for alkylation.

Wait, another possibility: when NaH is used in the presence of an alcohol, it can deprotonate the alcohol to form an alkoxide. But in this case, the hydroxymethyl is a secondary alcohol. So NaH would deprotonate it, turning it into an O- which could then react with benzyl bromide. But wait, benzyl bromide is an alkyl bromide, so if the O- attacks, it would make an ether. Alternatively, the benzyl bromide could alkylate the oxygen, but that would require a good leaving group. Wait, no, the hydroxymethyl is -CH2OH, so when deprotonated, O- would be a good nucleophile. Then benzyl bromide could act as an alkylating agent. So the O- would attack the benzyl bromide, adding a benzyl group to the hydroxymethyl, making it -CH2-O-Bn (where Bn is benzyl). But wait, NaH is a strong base, so it can deprotonate the hydroxymethyl (pKa around 16-18?), but benzyl bromide is a primary alkyl halide, so perhaps this is an SN2 reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone is deprotonated. For ketones, the alpha protons (like those on C2 or C6) have a pKa around 19-20. NaH can deprotonate that, making a carbanion which would attack the benzyl bromide. So the product would have a benzyl group added to the ring at C2 or C6. But I'm not sure which one would be more favored. Alternatively, perhaps the enol is formed, and the alkylation occurs at the beta position.

Wait, but in the starting structure, the substituents are at C3 and C5. So the positions are 1 (carbonyl), 3 (CH2OH), 5 (allyl group). Let me sketch this mentally. So the cyclohexane ring has the ketone at position 1, hydroxymethyl at position 3, and the allyl group at position 5. So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the carbonyl. If the NaH deprotonates at C2, making a carbanion, which would attack benzyl bromide, adding a benzyl group at C2. So product 1 would have a benzyl group at C2. Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation occurs via the enolate.

Wait, but the starting material has an enol substituent. Maybe the enol is reactive. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(=CH2)-, so it's an allyl group attached to the ring. So the substituent at C5 is an allyl group, which would be
