Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember from my classes that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. Let me think about what I know.

The question says that the decay probability of an atom is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, so that means if we have a bunch of these atoms, after 100 minutes, 32% of them would have decayed. But wait, in this case, we're looking at a single atom. Oh right, the decay of a single atom is a probabilistic event. So the probability that it decays by a certain time follows an exponential distribution.

So the setup is that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet. Now we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but wait, the next 150 minutes from when? From the current time, which is 50 minutes in. So the total time would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes from the start. Or is it considering the next 150 minutes, meaning from the current point? I think it's the latter. Because the question says "the next 150 minutes," which implies starting from the current time, which is 50 minutes in. So the time interval we're looking at is 150 minutes.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the half-life or something else? Oh wait, no, the
