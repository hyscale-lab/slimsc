Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the compound's formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. I remember that the formula involves the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products, but wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the energy required to break bonds in the reactants and form bonds in the products, but I might have that backwards.

Wait, no, I think the correct approach is based on the concept that the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for a hydrocarbon, that's carbon dioxide and water, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe this problem is considering the formation from atoms.

Wait, but the given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an elemental form. For carbon in graphite, the bond energy is the enthalpy of atomization divided by the number of bonds per mole. Wait, but carbon is a solid, so in graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three others. Wait, but the given value is 1000 kJ/mol for carbon's enthalpy of atomization. So that's the energy needed to completely atomize carbon into gaseous atoms.

Ah, but for bond energies, the bond energy is per bond. So, for graphite, each C-C bond would have a bond energy of (1000 kJ/mol) divided by the number of C-C bonds per mole. Wait, but wait, in graphite, each carbon is bonded to three others, but each bond is shared between two carbons. So the number of C-C bonds per mole is 3/2 per atom. Hmm, but maybe that's complicating things here.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach here is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the bond energies provided, treating the molecule as if it's built from its constituent atoms, considering the bonds broken in the react
