Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the question is about three candidate genes in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. The genes are G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants: g1, g2, g3, and double mutants like g1g2, etc. The results show the resistance levels of these mutants compared to the wild-type, which is 100% resistance.

Hmm, the data is:
- g1: 75% resistance
- g2: 0% resistance
- g3: 50% resistance
- g1g3: 10% resistance
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

They also mentioned that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.

Wait, transcription factors usually regulate other genes. So, if a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes won't be expressed, right? So the mutant would have lower resistance.

Looking at the data, the single mutants:
- g1 is 75%: so it's less resistant than wild-type. Maybe the gene's product is involved, but not the only one.
- g2 is 0%: that's super low. So without G2, the plant can't resist the disease at all. That suggests that G2 is critical, perhaps a transcription factor that's necessary for the resistance pathway.
- g3 is 50%: so it's half as resistant as wild type. So G3 contributes, but maybe not as much as G2.

Now, looking at the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% → So the double mutant of g1 and g2 has no resistance. But wait, g2 alone is already 0%, so how does adding g1 affect it? Oh wait, since g2 alone is 0%, perhaps the effect of G1 is not visible when G2 is already knocked out. So maybe G2 is upstream of G1. Because if G2 is a transcription factor for G1, then without G2, G1 can't function. So in the double mutant g1g2, both are knocked out, but the resistance is as low as g2 alone. That makes sense.

Next, g1g3: 10% → That's lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So combining the knockout of G1 and G3 makes the resistance worse than either alone. Hmm, maybe G1 and G3 have additive effects, or maybe they're in parallel pathways.

g2g3: 0% → G2 is already 0%, so adding G3 knockout doesn’t change that. So maybe G3 is downstream of G2, or maybe G3 is not involved when G2 is not present.

Wait, but g3 alone is 50%. So when G2 is present, G3 affects resistance, but when G2 is knocked out (as in g2g3), resistance is 0% even though G3 is also knocked out. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. If G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. So in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are non-functional, leading to 0% resistance. But in the single mutants, g1 and g3 still have some function because maybe they have other regulators, but for g2, since it's a transcription factor, without it, the downstream genes don't work.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor for both G1 and G3, then in the double mutant g1g2, G1 is already KO, but G2 is KO too. So without G2, G3 isn't expressed either. So the g1g2 mutant would have neither G1 nor G3. But wait, the data shows that g1g2 is 0% resistance. But the single g3 mutant is 50%, so if G3 is only expressed when G2 is present, then in g2, G3 isn't working. So in the double mutant g2g3, both G2 and G3 are knocked out. But without G2, G3 isn't expressed anyway, so the resistance is 0% either way.

Wait, maybe I should consider epistasis. Epistatic genes are those that act in the same pathway. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, the pathway is blocked if A is KO, regardless of B. So for example, if A is upstream and B downstream, then knocking out A would make B's status irrelevant.

In the single mutants, G2's resistance is 0%, which is the lowest. So perhaps G2 is the most upstream, acting as a transcription factor for both G1 and G3.

Looking at the double mutants:

g2g3: 0% → Since g2 is already 0%, adding g3 doesn't change anything. Makes sense if G3 is downstream of G2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

Similarly, g1g2: 0% → Since G2 is a transcription factor for G1, without G2, G1 can't function anyway. So the effect is same as g2 alone.

g1g3: 10% → So both G1 and G3 are knocked out. If G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, then knocking both out would have a more severe effect than either alone. So their effects are additive.

Now, looking at the options.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic towards G1.

Wait, G2 is a TF. But the data says that G2 is 0% resistance, which suggests it's critical. But if G1 is the TF, then knocking out G1 would have a bigger effect, which isn't the case here. Because G1's single mutant is 75% resistance. So probably G2 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (so same regulation?), G3 epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter would imply they are co-regulated. But the data shows that G3's single mutant is 50%, and G1's is 75%. So if they have same promoter, knocking out either would affect both. But in the data, g1 and g3 have different resistances. So maybe that's not right.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. But in this case, G1 and G3 are single mutant resistance and their double mutant. If G1 is epistatic to G3, meaning G1 is upstream. So in g1g3, the resistance would be as low as g1. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than both. So maybe they are in parallel pathways. If G1 is epistatic, then knocking out G1 would make G3's effect irrelevant.

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the g1g3 mutant, the effect would be the same as g1 (75% is higher than 10%). So that doesn't fit. So maybe the opposite: G3 is epistatic to G1. Let's see.

If G3 is epistatic, then knocking out G3 would make G1's effect irrelevant. So in g3, the resistance is 50%, which is lower than wild type but higher than g2. Hmm.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. So knocking both out would have a more severe effect. Which is what we see: g1g3 is 10%, worse than either alone (75% and 50%). So that fits.

Epistasis-wise, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then G1 is upstream. So in the double mutant g1g3, the effect is additive. But in the data, G1's single is 75%, G3 is 50%, and together it's 10%—so worse than either. So that suggests they're in separate pathways.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking them both would worsen the phenotype beyond either single. So that fits the data.

Now, what about the epistatic relationships. Epistasis is about the order of genes in a pathway. If two genes are in the same pathway, the upstream one is epistatic to the downstream.

In the double mutants, when you have g2g3, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G3's effect is only apparent when G2 is present. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

Similarly, g2g1 is 0% same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

So G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3. So G2 is a transcription factor, which makes sense.

Now, in the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. So both G1 and G3 are knocked out. If G2 is present, but G1 and G3 are both knocked out, perhaps G2 has another pathway or another target.

Wait, no. In the g1g3 mutant, G2 is still present. Because the mutation is only in G1 and G3. So if G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then in g1g3, G1 and G3 are not functional, but G2 is. So that would mean G2 is trying to activate other genes, but perhaps that's not enough to provide resistance.

Wait, but in the single mutant g3, the resistance is 50%—so some resistance. Which suggests that G3 is involved in a pathway that contributes to resistance, but not the only one. Similarly, G1 has 75% resistance. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, both activated by G2.

So if G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways, then knocking out G2 would disable both, leading to 0% resistance. That's consistent with the data.

In the g1g3 mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is still active. But if G2 can't activate either G1 or G3 (because both are knocked out), maybe there's another gene downstream that's necessary but not sufficient. So resistance drops to 10%—so perhaps another gene is involved, but not enough for high resistance.

Alternatively, maybe G2 activates other genes besides G1 and G3. But the question is about the interaction between these three.

So putting it all together: G2 is a TF, and acts upstream of both G1 and G3. The single mutants g1 and g3 have partial resistance, but when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse. So G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So when both are out, the effect is additive.

So looking at the options:

Option D says: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, gene redundancy refers to when two genes can compensate for each other. So if you knock out both, the effect is worse than either. That matches the data (g1g3 is 10% worse than either). So G1 and G3 are redundant. But what about the epistatic part?

If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean G1 is upstream. So in the double mutant g1g3, the effect should be same as g1. But data shows 10%, which is worse. So that suggests that their effects are additive, which is more like redundancy.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, what about the other options:

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because G2's resistance is 0%, so G2 is more likely the TF.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that's the case here. The data suggests they're both contributing to the same trait (resistance), but perhaps in different ways.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which fits the data because their double mutant is worse than either single.

So which option is correct?

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance should be as low as g1 (75% is higher than 10%). But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, so that's worse than g1's 75%. So that contradicts the idea that G1 is epistatic to G3. Because if G1 is epistatic, the double mutant would look like G1's phenotype.

So that suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong. So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1, meaning that G3 is downstream. So in the double mutant, if G3 is knocked out, then G1's function doesn't matter because maybe G3 is necessary for resistance.

Wait, but in the single mutants, when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than G1's 75%. So if G3 is downstream, then G3's KO would have a more severe effect than G1's, but only if G1 is upstream. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so knocking both out would have an additive effect (g1g3 is 10%). So perhaps they're not epistatic to each other. But in the options, one of them must be epistatic.

Wait, the options include epistatic relationships. So which is epistatic to which? Let's think about the double mutant g1g3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, meaning G1 is upstream, then in the double mutant, the resistance would be the same as in G1's single mutant (75%). But data shows 10%, which is worse than either. So G1 is not epistatic to G3. So the other way around: G3 is epistatic to G1. So in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as G3's single, which is 50%. But data is 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit either.

So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each with their own downstream genes. So knocking both out would have additive effects, leading to lower resistance than either alone.

So back to the options. Which option talks about G1 and G3 in parallel, with redundancy and perhaps G2 being the TF.

Option D says gene redundancy and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But earlier reasoning suggests that G1 and G3 are not in a linear pathway but in parallel.

Hmm, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway (so G2 is upstream of both), but G1 and G3 are redundant. So if both are knocked out, the effect is worse. So the correct option would be D.

Alternatively, let me look at the options again.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that they affect multiple traits, but in this case, the data is about one trait (resistance). So I'm not sure about that.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If they have redundancy, then the double mutant is worse than either single. That fits. But the epistatic part is confusing.

Wait, the question says, "which conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw?"

The data suggests that G2 is the TF, because its knockout leads to 0% resistance, and the other mutants show partial resistance.

In the double mutants, the g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either, so redundancy.

So among the options, D seems to fit.

So the correct answer would be D.


The question involves analyzing the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine plants contributing to resistance against anthracnose. The experiment provides resistance data for single mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The goal is to determine the relationships between these genes, including their roles as transcription factors (TFs), pleiotropy, and epistasis.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (partial loss of resistance).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (complete loss of resistance).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (reduced resistance compared to wild-type).

   From this, **G2** appears to be the most critical gene, as its knockout completely eliminates resistance. This suggests G2 may act as a transcription factor upstream of other genes.

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2 alone).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either g1 or g3 alone).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2 alone).

   The data indicates:
   - G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, as its knockout masks the effects of G1 and G3.
   - G1 and G3 appear to contribute to resistance in parallel pathways, as their combined knockout (g1g3) results in a resistance level (10%) worse than either single mutant.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic towards G1. This is inconsistent with the data, as G2 is clearly the most critical gene (0% resistance in g2), suggesting G2 is the transcription factor, not G1.

- **Option B**: States G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 share the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1. The data does not support G1 and G3 sharing the same promoter, as their single mutants have different resistance levels (75% for g1 and 50% for g3). Additionally, G3 does not appear to be epistatic towards G1.

- **Option C**: States G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, there is no evidence of pleiotropy in the data. Furthermore, G1 is not epistatic towards G3, as the double mutant g1g3 has a resistance level (10%) worse than either single mutant.

- **Option D**: States G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. This aligns with the data:
  - G2 is the transcription factor (0% resistance in g2).
  - G1 and G3 show redundancy, as their combined knockout (g1g3) results in a resistance level (10%) worse than either single mutant.
  - While the term "epistatic" is used, the data suggests G1 and G3 act in parallel pathways rather than a strict linear hierarchy.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent explanation is that **G2** is the transcription factor, and **G1 and G3** are redundant genes contributing to resistance in parallel pathways. This matches the description in **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
