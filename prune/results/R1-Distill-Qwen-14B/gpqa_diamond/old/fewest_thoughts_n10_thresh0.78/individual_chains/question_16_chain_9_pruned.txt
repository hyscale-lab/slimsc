Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when there's a chiral center, which is a carbon attached to four different groups. But wait, there are other possibilities too, like if there's a plane of symmetry or if the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image.

The question provides seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them exhibit optical activity. Let me go through each one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Okay, structure-wise, that's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, the double bond is at position 1. So the structure is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is connected to a double bond to the second carbon. So the molecule is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Now, does this have a chiral center? No, because the first carbon only has two substituents: the double bond (which is like two groups, but in reality, each carbon in a double bond is connected to two other carbons and two substituents. Wait, in this case, the first carbon (Cl) is attached to a CH2 group, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me draw it out. Structure: Cl is on C1, which is double-bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and single-bonded to C3 (which is CH2). So C1 is connected to Cl, C2 (double bond), and two CH3 groups? No, wait, C1 is attached to Cl, a methyl group (from C2?), no, wait, C2 has the methyl. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, the structure might be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that would make C1 (Cl) connected to a CH(CH3) group via double bond. Alternatively, maybe I should think about substituents around the double bond.

Wait, for a molecule to have optical activity, it needs a chiral center or some form of asymmetry. In this case, the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Structure: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a
