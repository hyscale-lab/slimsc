Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

We have an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R, which makes sense because it's inside. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with a different expression for E. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges inside cavities, the concept of electrostatic shielding comes into play. But wait, in this case, the conductor is uncharged. Let me think. Inside a conductor, the charges would redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so when a charge is placed inside the cavity, what happens?

Wait, the cavity is inside the conductor. The conductor is a conductor, so charges can move freely. But wait, the conductor is neutral initially. So when we put a charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor must somehow have induced charges. Oh right, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner surface) will have an induced charge of -q, to cancel the electric field inside the conductor material. Because in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. So the conductor's inner surface must have a charge of -q, and the outer surface must have a charge of +q to maintain overall neutrality. Wait, no, the conductor was initially uncharged, so the total charge after placing +q inside would need to balance.

Wait, the conductor was uncharged. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the cavity's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, as the conductor responds to the internal charge. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q to balance. So the conductor as a whole ends up with a net charge of +q.

But wait, the problem states the conductor is uncharged. So wait, the conductor has an inner surface with -q and an outer surface with +q, making the total charge +q. But if the conductor was neutral, that can't be. Oh wait, no. Wait, the conductor was neutral before any charge was placed. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) must have a charge of -q. Because the charge +q inside the cavity would induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface. Since the conductor as a whole was initially neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to
