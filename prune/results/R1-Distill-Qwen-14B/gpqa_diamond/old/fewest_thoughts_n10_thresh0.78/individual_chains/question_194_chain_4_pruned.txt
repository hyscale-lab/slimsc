Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the problem says each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). But each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Oh right, each spin is either +1 or -1, so each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 values.

So the first step is probably to list all possible states and compute their energies, then sum the exponentials. But that sounds a bit tedious, but manageable.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see. The energy depends on the sum of the products of each pair. So the energy can be written as E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). Let me denote each term as S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. Each of these could be +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are aligned or anti-aligned.

Wait, but each term S_i S_j is +1 if S_i = S_j, and -1 otherwise. So for each pair, the product is +1 or -1. Therefore, each of the three terms contributes.

So the total energy E is -J times the sum of these three terms. Let's denote the sum as (A + B + C), where each A, B, C is each pair's product. So E = -J (A + B + C).

Each term can be either 1 or -1, but wait, no—wait, the sum could range from -3 to +3 in steps of 2, because each term is ±1, so sum could be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), or -3 (all -1). Hmm, that's four possibilities for the sum.

Wait, let me think: For three terms each ±1, the possible sums are:

- All +1: 3 → E = -J *3 = -3J
- Two +1, one -1: 2-1=1 → E = -J *1 = -J
- One +1, two -1: 1 -2 = -1 → E = -J*(-1) = J
- All -1: -3 → E = -J*(-3) = 3J.

Wait, but wait, that depends on how many pairs are aligned. Let's think.

Wait, no, no—each of the three terms S_i S_j can be +1 or -1. So the sum (A+B+C) can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.

So the energy E is:

E = -J*(sum). So let's compute E for each possible sum:

sum =
