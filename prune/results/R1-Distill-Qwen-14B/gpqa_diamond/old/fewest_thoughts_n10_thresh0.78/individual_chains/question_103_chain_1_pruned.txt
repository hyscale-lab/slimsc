Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Whew, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the target molecule. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So that's a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromine, position 5 has a nitro group, and the ethanone is attached to the benzene as a ketone. Wait, ethan-1-one would be a ketone, right? So the substituent is a ketone group (COCH3) attached to the benzene.

Wait, actually, 1-(substituted phenyl)ethan-1-one would mean the ketone is on the same carbon as the benzene. So it's a benzophenone derivative where the benzene is attached to a COCH3 group. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)C=O. So the structure is Ar-CO-CH3? Wait no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula for ethan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-R, right? So if it's 1-(something)ethan-1-one, the carbonyl is on the first carbon, which is attached to the benzene.

So, the molecule is phenyl group attached to a ketone (CO) and then a methyl group. So structure is Ar-CO-CH3. So the benzene has substituents at positions 3 and 5, which are Br and NO2.

Now, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. That means they are meta to each other. Wait, benzene is a ring, so if one substituent is at position 3, the other is at position 5. So they're on adjacent carbons? Wait, no, in a benzene ring, positions 3 and 5 are actually adjacent because it's a six-membered ring. Wait, no, position 1, 2, 3, 4,
