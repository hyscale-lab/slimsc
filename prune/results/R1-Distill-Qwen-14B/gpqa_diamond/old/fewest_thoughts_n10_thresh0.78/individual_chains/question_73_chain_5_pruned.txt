Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to break this down.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m moving at 0.6c, and the other has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, I think about the relative speed. Wait, in classical mechanics, relative speed would just be the difference, but since these speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, I can't use the classical approach. I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity in relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). But wait, u and v are the velocities of the two objects as seen from the rest frame, so which one is which? Let me think. Oh, wait, actually, the problem is about the relative speed between the two astronauts. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction, then from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Or is it the other way around? No, relative speed depends on which frame you're considering. Oh wait, maybe I should calculate the relative speed of B as seen from A's frame.

So, u is the speed of B in the rest frame (which is 0.5c), and v is the speed of A (0.6c), since A is moving at 0.6c. So, from A's perspective, what is B's speed?

Wait, no, wait. The formula is (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/(c²)), where u' is the velocity of the object in the original frame (B's velocity is 0.5c in the same direction as A's 0.6c). So to find the relative speed of B with respect to A, I think we set u' as 0.5c and v as 0.6c.

Wait, that might not be right. Because from the perspective of A, B is moving at a different speed. So u is B's velocity in the lab frame, which is 0.5c. A's velocity in the lab frame is 0.6c. So, what is the velocity of B as observed in A's frame?

Using the velocity addition formula:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c²)

Plugging in u = 0.5c and v = 0.6c,

u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² )

Calculating numerator: ( -0.1c )

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7

So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = (-1/7)c ≈
