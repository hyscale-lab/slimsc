Okay, so I have this problem about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. Oh right, that's also known as the non-rigid rotor model. So, I guess that means the bond length isn't fixed, and the molecule can both rotate and vibrate. But wait, in the rigid rotor approximation, the bond length is fixed, but here it's non-rigid, so maybe the model accounts for bond stretching as well. But I'm not sure how that affects the energy transitions.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. So for vibration, the fundamental state would be the first vibrational level, n=0. And for rotation, the fundamental state would be the lowest rotational state, which is J=0, I believe.

The question is about what momentum a photon should have to make the molecule switch to the next lowest energy state. Wait, but the next state could be either the next rotational state or the next vibrational state. Oh wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. But the problem says, switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that means the smallest possible energy increase, which would be the next possible state, which might be the next vibrational level or the next rotational level. Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest state, so the next state would be the first excited state. But I'm a bit confused—what's the order of energy levels here?

Wait, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the non-rigid rotor model have both rotational and vibrational contributions. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy is (J(J+1))/2I ħ², where I is the moment of inertia.

In the rigid rotor model, I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass. But in the non-rigid rotor, I think the bond length can vary, but for this problem, maybe we can treat it as a rigid rotor because the bond length is given as 2 angstroms. Or wait, the problem says it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, but the bond length is given as a fixed value. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe I should proceed with the rigid rotor approximation for the rotational part and the harmonic oscillator for the vibrational part.

So the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is n=0 for vibration and J=0 for rotation. Now, when it absorbs a photon, it can transition to the next state, which would be either a vibrational excitation (n=1) or a rotational excitation (J=1). But which requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the states.

So I need to calculate the energy differences for both transitions and see which one is smaller. The photon's momentum would be related to its energy via E = p c. Wait, but wait—photon energy E is related to momentum p by E = p c,
