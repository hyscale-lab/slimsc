Okay, so I've got this physics question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think. Alright, let's read the question again.

So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super-fast spaceship that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is around 150 Earth years, so they live a long time. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we want to know how long the trip to Earth will take from their perspective.

Wait, wait, Earth is the destination, right? So the ship is traveling towards Earth. But wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and Earth is in the Milky Way. So the distance between them must be significant. But the question doesn't give the distance, so maybe it doesn't matter because we're dealing with time dilation.

The key here is that the astronaut's experienced time is less due to special relativity. Because when you travel at a significant fraction of the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Time moves slower for the traveler relative to a stationary observer.

But wait, the question is from the astronaut's point of view. So the proper time (the time experienced by the astronaut) would be less than the time measured by someone on Earth.

Wait, but the question is asking how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective. So we need to calculate the proper time, which is the time experienced on the spacecraft.

So, first, let's establish the necessary variables. The speed is
