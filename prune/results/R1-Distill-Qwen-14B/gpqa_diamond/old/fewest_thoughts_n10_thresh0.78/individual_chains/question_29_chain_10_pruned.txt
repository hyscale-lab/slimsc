Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound is made up of five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate this compound by using EMS mutagenesis. After sequencing the target gene in all mutants, the changes are found in the first exon area. The question is asking which mutation is most likely to eliminate the compound.

So, the intact gene has a specific sequence, and each mutant has a different change. I need to find out which mutation would disrupt the gene's function, thereby stopping the compound from being made.

First, I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so they're crucial for the protein's structure. Mutations in exons can lead to changes in the amino acids of the protein, potentially causing the protein to malfunction or not be produced at all.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a change in the beginning of the sequence, the first exon. Let me examine each mutant's mutation.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ as the coding sequence.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Hmm, comparing to the intact, let's see where the change is. The first part of the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTAC. In mutant 1, it's ATGTTCTACGCTGGTAC.

Wait, maybe I should look for where the nucleotides change. Let me write the first parts:

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATT...
Mutant 1:
ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATT...

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me compare each position.

Original: positions 1-20 (hypothetically):

Intact: 1-20: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant 1: same as intact, except maybe the third codon.

Wait, perhaps I should line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, looking at the beginning:

ATG remains (start codon), then TTT in the intact becomes TTC in mutant 1. So the second codon
