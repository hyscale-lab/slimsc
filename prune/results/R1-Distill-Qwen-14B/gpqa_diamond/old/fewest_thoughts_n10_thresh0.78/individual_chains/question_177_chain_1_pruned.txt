Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question is about their luminosities. Let me read the problem again carefully.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 is 1.5 M2. Interesting, but wait, the problem isn't directly about mass, so maybe that's a red herring? Or perhaps it's relevant for something else, like temperature? Hmm.

The problem says that the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's displacement law states that λ_max * T = constant, where T is the temperature. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same too. Because if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same since λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but let me think again. Wien's law is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature. That's important.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1's radial velocity is 0 km/s, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity refers to the velocity along the line of sight. But since Star_1 has zero radial velocity, perhaps we're assuming it's not moving relative to us. Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s? Or maybe towards? Depending on the sign. But the problem says 'radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively.' So Star_1 isn't moving towards or away from us, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, Doppler effect. So when a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, and moving away is redshifted.

But wait, the problem says that they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found they're the same. So the observed λ_max is same for both stars. But wait, that might have implications. Because, the intrinsic λ_max is determined by their temperatures, but if the star is moving, the observed λ_max would shift because of Doppler effect.

Wait, so for each star, the observed λ_max is same. But the intrinsic λ_max (from their temperatures) would be different if they have different velocities. Or perhaps no, because the question says that the stars' λ_max are same. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same for both. But each star's actual emission's λ_max depends on their own T. So considering Doppler shifts, maybe their actual temperatures are different.

Wait, perhaps let me approach it step by step.

First, the luminosity of a star (assuming blackbody) depends on its radius and temperature via the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1²) / (R2² T2²) ) ? No, wait, it's (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴), because L is proportional to R² T⁴.

So I need to find the ratio L1/L2. Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So (R1/R2)^2 is 2.25.

But what about the temperatures? Because if the stars' observed λ_max is the same, but their actual temperatures might be different
