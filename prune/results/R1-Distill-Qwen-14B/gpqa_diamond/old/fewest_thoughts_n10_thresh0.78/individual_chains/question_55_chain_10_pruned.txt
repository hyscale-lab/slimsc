Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are four different acetates: Cis and Trans versions of propenyl and butenyl acetates.

The NMR data given is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

I remember that NMR helps determine the structure by showing the environment of each proton. Let's think about each part.

First, the 2.1 ppm triplet as a singlet (s) with 3H. That usually suggests a methyl group attached to something deshielded, like an oxygen. Acetate groups have an OAc, which is O-CO-OCH3. Wait, noâ€”the acetate ester is OAc attached to something else. So the structure would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait. Actually, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-O-R. So the acetate ester is something like R-O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Acetate is CH3COO-. So in an ester like R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure of an acetate ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, no, wait. Let me think again. The ester is formed from acetic acid and an alcohol. So if the alcohol is R-OH, then the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, because acetic acid is CH3COOH, so the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, actually, the structure is R-O-CO-O-R', but in this case, R would be the propenyl or butenyl group, and R' is methyl. So the ester would be something like R-O-CO-OCH3. So the acetate group has two oxygen atoms. The methyl group (CH3) attached directly to the carbonyl (COO-) would be split as a sing
