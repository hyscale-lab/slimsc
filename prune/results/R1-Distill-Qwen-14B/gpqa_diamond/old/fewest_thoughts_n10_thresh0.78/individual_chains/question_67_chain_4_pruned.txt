Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. Hmm, let's try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says that two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. Ignoring spin, the coupled state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So, I think that notation means l1=1, l2=1, the total angular momentum l=2, and m=-1. Wait, wait, m is the z-component of the total angular momentum, right?

The question asks for the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ. L1z and L2z are the individual orbital angular momentum z-components for each electron. Since each electron has l=1, the possible m values for each are -1, 0, +1. So, for each Lz, the eigenvalues can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But wait, these are orbital angular momenta, so the operators are L1z and L2z. The question is, what's the probability that when measured, both give -ħ.

I think the coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> is expanded in terms of the product states of the individual states. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a combination of |l1, m1> ⊗ |l2, m2>, such that m1 + m2 = m_total, which is -1 here. But wait, the total m is given as -1, but in the coupled state, the individual m1 and m2 are not fixed, but their sum is m.

Wait, no. The coupled state is a combination of product states where m1 + m2 = m. So, for the state |1,1,2,-1>, the expansion would include all possible pairs (m1, m2) where m1 + m2 = -1.

So, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:
- (-1, 0)
- (0, -1)
- (1, -2) → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So that's not possible
