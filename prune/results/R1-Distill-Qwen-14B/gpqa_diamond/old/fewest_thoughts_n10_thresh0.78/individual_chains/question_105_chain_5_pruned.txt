Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about a star with some spots on it, and how that affects the brightness measurements, which could be mistaken for an exoplanet. The goal is to find out what the radius of a planet would need to be to cause the same brightness variation as the spots.

First, let me read the problem again.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So Rstar = R_sun. The spots are on one hemisphere, covering 20% of that hemisphere. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, I think. Because it says a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K? Or wait, it's a temperature difference, so perhaps the spots are 1000 K less than the star's effective temperature. So Teff spots = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

Photometric observations show brightness variations as the star rotates, because the spots come into and out of view. The question is, if the star didn't have spots, what planet radius would cause the same amplitude in the light curve?

So I need to compare the dip in brightness caused by the spots (as the star rotates) to the dip caused by a planet transiting the star.

When a planet transits, the drop in brightness (the transit depth) is (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But in the case of the spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us (on the star's disk), they make the star appear dimmer. As the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing a periodic brightness change.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere).

Wait, wait. Let me think. The filling factor is the fraction of the visible hemisphere that is covered by spots. So if the star's radius is R, the area of a hemisphere is 2π R². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Since the star is a sphere, the spots are on the hemisphere that's currently visible. Wait, no, the star is rotating, so one hemisphere is facing us at any time. The spots are on that hemisphere, covering 20% of it. So when the star rotates, the spots that were on the back come into view, but since it's only one hemisphere, the spot coverage is fixed as the star rotates.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So perhaps the entire star's surface isn't covered. Only one hemisphere has 20% of its area covered in spots. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. But because the hemisphere is fixed, as the star rotates, different parts of the other hemisphere come into view. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the star has spots on one side, and as it rotates, the spots move into and out of the observer's view. So the brightness variation comes from the spots being in the visible hemisphere or not.

Wait, perhaps the spots are on the surface of the star, and as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of the visible disk. So the total area of spots that is visible at any time depends on the rotation.

Wait, but the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. So the brightness variations are due to the spots being present in the visible hemisphere or not.

Wait, perhaps the way to model this is that when the star is in a certain orientation (like spot side facing us), the spots are fully visible, causing a dip in brightness. As it rotates, the spots rotate out of view, so the brightness returns to normal.

So the amplitude of
