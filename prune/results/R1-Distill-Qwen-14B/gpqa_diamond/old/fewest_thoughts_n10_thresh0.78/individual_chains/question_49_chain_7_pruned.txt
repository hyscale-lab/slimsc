Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here with three reactions and four options. I need to figure out which option correctly assigns the products A, B, and C. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at each reaction one by one. The question mentions sigma-tropic rearrangements, which are a type of pericyclic reaction. I remember that sigmatropic shifts involve the movement of a pi bond along with the sigma bond framework. The Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples of this, so I'm guessing the reactions here might involve similar mechanisms.

**Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ + Heat â†’ A**

Hmm. The starting materials here are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. Wait, but the reaction also has H+ and heat. So maybe this is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement.

I think about the Claisen rearrangement, which typically involves an allyl vinyl ether rearranging to a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl. But in this case, the starting material isn't an allyl vinyl ether. Wait, but wait, the first molecule is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That structure is like having two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So it's something like (methoxy)2CH-NH2.

But I'm trying to think of another rearrangement. Oh wait, maybe it's the Cope rearrangement, but that usually involves 1,5-dienes. Alternatively, perhaps it's similar to the Claisen but with an amine component.

Wait, but another thought: maybe it's a Stork enamine reaction. Enamines can undergo various rearrangements. Let me think about the structure. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have the structure (CH3O)2CH-NH2. When heated, perhaps with acid, this could form an enamine?

Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol. Could this be a case where the two molecules undergo some kind of [3,3] sigmatropic shift?

Alternatively, perhaps the 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine acts as a dienophile? Or maybe the but-3-en-2-ol is an enol ether or something.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the product. The options for A are either 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine or a (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine.

Wait, 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine sounds like a pyrrolidine or pyran derivative. The other option for A is a (Z)-configured amine with a butenyl ether.

Maybe the reaction forms a cyclic structure. If the amine and the alcohol combine, perhaps through an acid-catalyzed mechanism. Let's think about formation of an oxaziridine or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen-like rearrangement where the amine acts as a directing group. Wait, but the initial structure isn't an allyl vinyl ether. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. Let me think: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has a structure where the amine is adjacent to two methoxy groups. But if that amine is adjacent to a propenyl group, perhaps it can form a cyclic structure.

Alternatively, maybe the but-3-en-2-ol is acting as an enol ether. Let me draw the structures.

But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2C(OH)CH2. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH
