Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question provides FTIR and 1H NMR data. Let me look at each piece of information carefully.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR around that region usually correspond to O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, the peak is very broad. Oh right, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch because they're usually deprotonating a bit, especially in solution. So that suggests the compound has a carboxylic acid group. Another strong peak is at 1700 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which also fits with a carboxylic acid group because they have that C=O in their structure.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So that means the molecule doesn't have any double bonds with hydrogens attached, or perhaps the double bond is elsewhere and the hydrogens aren't showing up in the NMR under the conditions given. Wait, but I think the question says none of the signals are vinyl, so the molecule doesn't have any vinyl groups. Hmm, but looking at the options, all seem to have similar structuresâ€”maybe branching but no double bonds. So that makes sense; the structures don't have any double bonds, so no vinyl Hs.

Now, looking at the NMR signals. One of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a bit complex. Let me think about splitting patterns. Splitting in NMR arises due to coupling with neighboring protons. Each splitting indicates the number of neighboring Hs. So, for example, a doublet is two peaks, which would mean one neighboring set of equivalent protons. A triplet would be two neighbors, and so on.

Let me think about the structure. The options are all somewhat similar, but with different substituents. Let me list out the options:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Wait, no, let me parse that properly. Option A: It's CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the structure would be something like CH3-C(-H)(C2H5)-C(-H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So that would have two CH groups (the C(H)(C2H5) groups) connected in a row. Wait, no, wait: actually, the way it's written would be like (CH3)C-C(C2H5)C-C-CH2COOH? Hmm, maybe I should draw the structures.

Wait, all the options have a similar backbone. Let me see:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So that's CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the structure is a chain where after CH3CH2, there are two CH groups each attached to a CH3 and a CH2CH3 (wait, no, perhaps the substituents are different).

Wait, perhaps it's better if I think about each option's structure more clearly.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So that's CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So two CH groups each attached to a C2H5 group.

Option C: CH3C(H)(
