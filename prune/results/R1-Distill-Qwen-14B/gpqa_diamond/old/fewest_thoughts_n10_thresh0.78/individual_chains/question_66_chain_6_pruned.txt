Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), and I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in it. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators, which are suppressed by some high energy scale, usually the Planck scale. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, 8, etc.

The question is asking about the symmetries that all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices combine these into four possible answers.

Wait, first, I should clarify what each of these symmetries mean. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is bigger; it includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (so it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime). Then there's CP symmetry, which is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). CPT symmetry is the combination of charge, parity, and time reversal.

In the SMEFT, the operators are built from the Standard Model fields, right? And the theory must maintain the same symmetries as the Standard Model, except for maybe some specific cases. But wait, the Standard Model itself respects certain symmetries. Let's think: the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, so its effective theory, SMEFT, must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So operators can't violate Lorentz symmetry. So choice 1 is correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Well, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. If the theory is Lorentz symmetric, does it automatically respect Poincare? Because Poincare is a bigger symmetry group. Wait, no. Wait, I'm a bit confused. The theory must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. The SM has Poincare symmetry because it's a relativistic theory. So SMEFT must respect Poincare as well. So both 1 and 2 must be respected. But wait, let me think again: the effective operators are constructed from the SM fields, so their terms must be Lorentz scalars. So yes, operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, which is part of Poincare.
