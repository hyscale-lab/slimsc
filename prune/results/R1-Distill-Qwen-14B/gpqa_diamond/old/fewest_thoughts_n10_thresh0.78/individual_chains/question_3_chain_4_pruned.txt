Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And we're told that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z. So, we're supposed to find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x. The options are given, so after calculation, I need to pick the right one.

Wait, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd expect to measure if you measured the observable many times on identically prepared systems. The formula is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

So the operator here is 10σ_z +5σ_x. Since expectation is linear, I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩. So I just need to find the expectation values of σ_z and σ_x separately.

First, let's tackle σ_z. Because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, that might make this part easier. The eigenvalues for σ_z are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively.

The given state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So to find ⟨σ_z⟩, we can compute the probabilities of each state and multiply by their eigenvalues, then add.

The probability of measuring spin-up is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. Spin-down is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, the contribution from 10σ_z is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the trickier part is σ_x. The expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ is a bit more involved because σ_x doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. I remember that σ_x is the spin in the x-direction. Its eigenstates are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

Wait, the expectation value for σ_x can be calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩. Alternatively, maybe using the matrix representation.

The spin-½ particle's states can be represented as vectors. Let me think. The Pauli matrices: σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the operator for σ_x is the 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal.

So ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let's write this as a vector. |↑⟩ is [1, 0]^T, and |↓⟩ is [0,1]^T. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So the expectation value of σ_x is ψ†
