Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question involves a series of reactions starting from compound A, which is C3H6. I need to figure out what each compound is after each reaction and then determine which statement about the products is incorrect.

First, let me outline what each reaction step does.

1. Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of CCl4 to form compound B.
2. Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form compound C.
3. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D.
4. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E.
5. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and HCl, forms compound F.
6. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G.
7. G reacts with NaOH to form H.

Then, the options A to D are statements about the products, and I need to find the incorrect one.

Let me start by identifying compound A. The formula is C3H6. The possible structures are either propene (propylene) or cyclopropane. But cyclopropane is less likely because propene is more reactive and a common starting material for such reactions.

So, compound A is propene (CH2=CHCH3).

Reaction 1: Bromination in CCl4. For alkenes, bromination is typically addition. Propene has a double bond, so it will add bromine. The reaction is likely an anti addition (since CCl4 is a non-polar solvent, but wait, wait—actually, bromination of alkenes in CCl4 is typically a bromination via the bromonium ion mechanism, leading to dibromide. So adding Br2 across the double bond. So, adding Br2 to propene (CH2=CHCH3) would give 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, but wait—wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me think again. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding bromine would add across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane: BrCH2-CHBr-CH3.

Wait, but wait a second. When propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacts with bromine (Br2) in CCl4, it undergoes addition, not substitution, because it's an alkene. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is BrCH2CHBrCH3. Yes, that's right.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, could it be a substitution? But no, substitution usually requires a different condition, like light, for alkanes. So in this case, since it's an alkene, it's addition.

So, compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3).

Reaction 2: B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. When a vicinal dibromide (two adjacent bromines) reacts with
