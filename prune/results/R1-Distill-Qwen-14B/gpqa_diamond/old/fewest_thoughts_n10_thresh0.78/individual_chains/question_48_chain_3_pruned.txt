Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. So, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone group (a carbonyl). I remember that when you treat a ketone with bromine, it usually undergoes a halogenation reaction. Wait, but ketones don't just brominate easily. Oh wait, right! The acid-catalyzed bromination. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, which is electron-withdrawing, so the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) are more reactive. So adding HBr or Br2 in an acid condition would lead to alpha bromination.

Wait, but when bromine (Br2) is used with ketones, it's typically under acidic conditions like H2SO4. So in this case, the first step is treating cyclohexanone with bromine, probably in acidic conditions. That would brominate the alpha position. Which alpha position? Well, cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha positions? No, wait. The cyclohexanone ring has six carbons, and the ketone is on C1. The alpha carbons are C2 and C6, but wait, in a chair conformation, they might not be equivalent. Wait, no, I think in cyclohexanone, the alpha positions (C2 and C6) are actually equivalent because of the symmetry of the ring. So when you add Br, it would add to both positions, but wait, wait, no. Because when you add Br, it's an electrophilic substitution. The carbonyl group makes the adjacent positions (alpha) more positive, so the bromine attacks there.

So product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone. Wait, but wait another second. The bromine attack usually leads to the formation of a bromohydrin? Or is it a different process. Oh no, wait, bromine in a non-polar solvent would add across the double bond if it were an alkene. But cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond; it's a ketone. Oh wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, no, when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine in presence of acid, it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? No, wait, that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe
