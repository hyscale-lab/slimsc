Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that Hamiltonians are related to the energy of a system in quantum mechanics.

The Hamiltonian given is H = ε σ · n. Wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So σ · n would be the dot product of the Pauli matrices with a unit vector n. Oh, right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and each is a 2x2 matrix. So when you take their dot product with a vector n, you're essentially doing a weighted sum of these matrices.

But wait, each Pauli matrix has a trace of zero and their squares are identity matrices. Oh, right, σ_i² = I for each i (x, y, z). So if I have σ · n, and n is a unit vector, then (σ · n)² would be (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z) squared. Let's compute that. 

Expanding that, it's n_x² σ_x² + n_y² σ_y² + n_z² σ_z² + cross terms. Since σ_x² is I, same for σ_y and σ_z, and n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² equals 1. So each squared term contributes I, so the sum would be I(n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) which is just I. The cross terms involve σ_i σ_j for i≠j, which I think are equal to iε_ijk σ_k, but when you square σ · n, those cross terms end up being imaginary and might not contribute to the square's trace. Wait, but since n is arbitrary, but the square of (σ · n) is I, right? Because when I expand it, (σ · n)² = I. So (σ · n)² = I.

So that brings me back to the Hamiltonian. H = ε (σ · n), so H² would be ε² (σ · n)², which is ε² I. Now, if I'm looking for the eigenvalues of H, I can consider that H² = ε² I. 

The eigenvalues of H² would be ε² times the eigenvalues of
