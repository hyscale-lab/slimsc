Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Hmm, wait, that's interesting. A benzene ring is 6 carbons, right? So the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. But wait, it's di-substituted, so two substituents attached to the ring. Each substituent can contribute to the total carbon count.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, that means the molecule has both a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring. Let me think about possible substituents. Common aromatic halogens include -Cl, -Br, -I, but they don't add any carbon atoms. The carbonyl group could be from an acyl substitution, like an acetyl group, which is -CO-R.

Wait, the substituents must account for the 8 total carbons. The benzene is 6, so the two substituents add 2 carbons in total. Since each substituent is a group attached to the ring. Let me think: perhaps one substituent is a halogen (which is one atom, no carbons) and the other is a carbonyl group with one carbon. Because a carbonyl group like a

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm. Let me break this down. So, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, right? Six-membered ring, two substituents. And the total carbon count is 8. Wait, benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents add 2 carbons in total. Since it's di-substituted, each substituent probably has one carbon each, but wait, maybe one substituent has two carbons. Or perhaps one is a single atom like halogen.

Wait, but FTIR shows a carbonyl group. Carbonyl is C=O. So one substituent is a carbonyl group. And another substituent is an aromatic-halogen bond, so that's a halogen attached to the benzene ring.

So, the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. But wait, the compound has 8 carbons. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2 carbons. So if one substituent is a carbonyl group (which is just a group, maybe like a ketone or ester), but let's think about the substituents.

Wait, the carbonyl could be part of a substituent. For example, if the substituent is an acyl group, like -CO-X, where X is something else. But wait, the other substituent is a halogen. So maybe the two substituents are -COX and X? No, wait, perhaps each substituent is a single group.

Wait, wait, the substituents are both on the benzene ring. So benzene has two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but the carbonyl is part of the substituent. For example, a substituent could be a ketone (like -CO-), but that's probably not possible because ketone substituents would require more carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetyl group or something like that.

Wait, the total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2. So the two substituents together have 2 carbons. If each substituent is a single carbon, but one is a carbonyl group and the other is a halogen, how?

Wait, maybe the substituents are -COOR and -X, but that would add more carbons. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group and the other is a halogen. Let me think of possible groups.

Wait, another approach: since the molecule has 8 carbons in total, and benzene has 6, the substituents must add two carbons. So the substituents could be two groups each with one carbon, but that's not possible because a hal
