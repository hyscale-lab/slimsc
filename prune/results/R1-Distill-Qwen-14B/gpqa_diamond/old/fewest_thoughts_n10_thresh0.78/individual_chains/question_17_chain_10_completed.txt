Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that the concentration of the calcium-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant (K) is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions. 

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms a complex with metal ions like calcium. The complex is usually written as CaY^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. 

So the formula for the formation constant should be K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Right. But wait, in this problem, the solution contains the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, which I think means that all the calcium is complexed with EDTA. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. 

But wait, does that mean that all the Ca is in the complex form? Because if the solution is stoichiometric, that suggests that the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are in a 1:1 ratio. So if the complex concentration is 0.02 M, then both the free Ca and free EDTA would be present, but their concentrations are related by the K value.

Wait, no. Because the problem states it's a "stochiometric" solution. Stochiometric usually means the molar ratio is exactly the same as the balanced equation. So in this case, the Ca and EDTA are present in a 1:1 ratio. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which implies that the sum of Ca in solution is 0.02 M. But wait, no, the complex itself is the species, so the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. 

So the dissociation of the complex into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- would depend on K. But since K is very large (5e10), the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca^2+ should be very low. 

Wait, but maybe I should approach this using the expression for K. Let me think about it. The complex has a concentration of 0.02 M. Let’s denote [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Then, the formation equation is:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

The formation constant Kf is given by Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in solution, the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and EDTA bound as the complex. Similarly, the total calcium is the sum of free Ca^2+ and Ca in the complex. But since the solution is stoichiometric, the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, which might mean that the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- were equal, so that they form the complex in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but if the solution is in equilibrium, some of the CaEDTA^2- might dissociate back into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. So the total concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are both x. Because the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, [Ca^2+] = [EDTA^4-] = x. 

So substituting into the K expression: Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So 0.02 / x² = 5e10. Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 / 5e10? Wait, wait, let's calculate this. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12, which is 0.4e-12, so 4e-13. 

So x squared is 4e-13. Taking the square root, x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 10^-13 is 10^-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M. 

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the answer. So the concentration of Ca^2+ is about 6.3e-7 M. 

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. Because the solution is stoichiometric, the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- were equal, so they form the complex until it's 0.02 M. But at equilibrium, some of the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. So the total concentration of Ca is 0.02 M (all in the complex) plus the x from dissociation? No, wait. No, because the complex is 0.02 M, which is all the Ca in the form of the complex. Because the solution is stoichiometric, I think the dissociation is the only source of free Ca and EDTA. So, the initial assumption was that [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca^2+] = [EDTA^4-] = x. 

Another way: The total concentration of Ca is [Ca^2+] + [CaEDTA^2-]. But since the solution is stoichiometric, the initial Ca and EDTA were in 1:1 ratio. So if all of the Ca is in the complex, that would mean [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca^2+] is negligible. But since K is large, the dissociation is minimal, so [Ca^2+] is indeed approximately x, which is 6.3e-7 M. 

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant for the complex:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

The problem states that the solution is stoichiometric, meaning the concentrations of free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) and free EDTA ions ([EDTA⁴⁻]) are equal, denoted as \(x\). The total concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M, so:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting these into the formation constant expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

The formation constant is given as \(K_f = 5 \times 10^{10}\). Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**.
