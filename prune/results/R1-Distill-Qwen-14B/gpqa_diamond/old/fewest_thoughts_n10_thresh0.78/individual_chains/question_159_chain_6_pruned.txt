Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar and the comoving distance in the universe. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. Wait, flux dropping at shorter wavelengths... Oh, right! That makes me think of the Lyman-alpha forest. Or wait, maybe the Lyman break? Oh yeah, the Lyman break is when the flux drops because of absorption by hydrogen. The Lyman series is in the ultraviolet, so the Lyman break would be around 91 nm, but wait, the observed wavelength here is 790 nm. Oh, wait, that could mean it's redshifted.

So the quasar's own emission would have certain features. If the peak is at 790 nm, and the drop is below that, maybe the quasar's rest-frame UV emission is being absorbed. The Lyman break is when the UV emission from the quasar is absorbed by intergalactic medium, causing a drop in flux below a certain wavelength. So for a quasar, we look for a break in the spectrum that tells us about its redshift.

Wait, the Lyman limit is 91.2 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that would be a redshift z where 790 nm = (1+z) * 91.2 nm. Let me calculate that.

So z = (790/91.2) - 1. Let me compute that. 790 divided by 91.2 is approximately... 91.2 times 8 is 729.6, 9 times is 820.8. So 8.65? Let's see: 91.2 *8=729.6, 790-729.6=60.4. So 60.4 /91.2 is about 0.66. So z is approximately 8.66. Wow, that's a high redshift.

But wait, wait. Is the Lyman break at 91.2 nm the correct rest wavelength? Because in the quasar's rest frame, the Lyman series transitions would be in the UV. So when observed
