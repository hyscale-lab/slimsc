Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's try to think through this.

Alright, parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star due to the Earth moving around the Sun. I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance; the closer the star, the larger the parallax. So, plx = 1/distance (in some units, maybe parsecs). So, if a star is at distance d, its parallax is about 1/d.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So like, if I pick a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed, their number density in space is constant. That means the number of stars in a given volume of space is proportional to the volume. But wait, parallax relates to distance, so I need to think about how volume relates to distance.

Wait, the volume of a sphere increases with the cube of the radius. So, the number of stars within a certain distance d would be proportional to d^3. But here, we are looking at the change in number with parallax, which is inversely related to distance.

Let me think about this. Let's model it. Let's say the number of stars between distance d and d+dd is N. Since the density is uniform, N would be proportional to the volume of the spherical shell between d and d+dd. The volume of a shell is 4πd² dd. So N = k * 4π d² dd, where k is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But parallax plx is equal to 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's substitute d with 1/plx. Then, d² would be (1/plx)^2, and dd is the change in d, which, since plx is inversely proportional to d, dd would be - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of plx.

Alternatively, let me think in terms of plx. Let plx go from p to p + dp. Each such plx corresponds to a distance d = 1/p and d = 1/(p + dp). So the range in distance is from d to d - delta_d (since higher plx is closer). But maybe it's easier to write in terms of plx.

The number of stars in a parallax range from p to p + dp would be the number of stars in the corresponding distance range. So, the number of stars in that distance shell would be proportional to the volume of the shell at that distance. The volume is 4πd² dd, where dd is the thickness of the shell. Since d = 1/p, dd would be the change in d when plx changes by dp. Let's relate dd and dp.

d = 1/p → p = 1/d → dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² dp. Hmm, the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But since we're interested in the magnitude, perhaps we can ignore the sign for now.

So, the number of stars
