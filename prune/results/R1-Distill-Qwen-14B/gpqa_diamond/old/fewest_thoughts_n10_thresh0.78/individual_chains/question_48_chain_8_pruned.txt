Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll do my best to figure it out.

So, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Let me visualize its structure: a six-membered ring with one oxygen as a ketone group.

First step: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1. Hmm, I think bromine adds to ketones in a specific way. Oh wait, it's probably a dibromination. Oh right! When ketones react with Br2, they undergo a halohydrin formation. Wait, no, wait. Maybe it's more likely that cyclohexanone undergoes a ring-opening addition with bromine. Or wait, I'm confusing with other reactions. Alternatively, I remember that cyclohexanone can undergo a halogenation via the enol mechanism. So maybe it's a conjugate addition. Wait, another thought: bromine in a non-polar solvent would add across the double bond. But wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's a dienone structure? No, no, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. So perhaps it's undergoing a bromination on the carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility. Cyclohexanone reacting with bromine might undergo a bromohydrin formation. But wait, that usually requires something like water or another nucleophile. Alternatively, I think that when ketones react with bromine, it's a nucleophilic addition. Let me think: the carbonyl is attacked by a nucleophile. But bromine is a dienophile? Or maybe it's a dihalide addition.

Wait, another approach: cyclohexanone with Br2 could form a bromohydrin. Wait, no, I think that usually in a solvent like water or with a nucleophile present. So maybe without that, the reaction is different. Wait, perhaps it's a bromine addition to the carbonyl, like a cyclohexanone undergoing a Michael addition? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, I think that bromine might add to the carbonyl, making a bromide adjacent to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, wait, maybe product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. How? Because cyclohexanone has a carbonyl, which is attacked by Br2.
