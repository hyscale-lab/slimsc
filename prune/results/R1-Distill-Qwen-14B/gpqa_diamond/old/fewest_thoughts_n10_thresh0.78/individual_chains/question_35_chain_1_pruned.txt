Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a specific matrix. The first row of S is (0 -i), and the second row is (i 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y, and then determine which of the given statements (A to D) is correct.

Wait, so the question is about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix Ay. Let me think about how to approach this. Oh right, for any matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

First, I need to write out the matrix Ay. Since Ay = c·S, let's compute c·S. S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So Ay is (h/(4π)) times this matrix. So,

Ay = [ (h/(4π))*0   (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
       [ (h/(4π))*i   (h/(4π))*0 ]

Which simplifies to:
Ay = [ 0      (-i h)/(4π) ]
       [ (i h)/(4π)   0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again. Let me factor out c. So each element of S is multiplied by c. So the top row is 0, -i multiplied by c; the bottom row is i * c, 0. So yes, that's correct.

So the matrix Ay looks like:

[ 0         (-i c) ]
[ (i c)      0   ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I'll set up the characteristic equation. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are solutions to:

det(Ay - a I) = 0

So,

| (-a)      (-i c)         |
| (i c)     (-a)          |  = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - (i c)(i c) 

Wait, let me compute (i c)(i c). Wait, (-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) * c^2. Because the top right is (-i c) and the bottom left is (i c). Wait, determinant is (top left * bottom right) minus (top right * bottom left). So:

Determinant = (-a)(-a) - [ (-i c) * (i c) ]

So that's a² - [ (-i)(i) c² ]

Simplify (-i)(i): (-i)*i = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So it's a² - (1 * c²) = a² - c² = 0.

So the
