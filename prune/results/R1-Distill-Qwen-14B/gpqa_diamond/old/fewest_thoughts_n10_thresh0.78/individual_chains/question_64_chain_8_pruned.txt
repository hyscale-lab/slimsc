Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. So, heating them in an environment without oxygen or air probably means it's a decomposition reaction. The result is a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through several tubes, and each tube reacts with the gases in a specific way.

The setup is as follows:
- Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. The weight increased by 3.60 grams. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water, forming Mg(ClO4)2·8H2O or something like that. So the gas here must have been water vapor, H2O. Because when water reacts with Mg(ClO4)2, it gets hydrated, increasing the tube's weight.
- Tube 2: Contains a Ca(OH)2 solution. The weight didn't change. Hmm, if the gas were CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 and precipitate CaCO3, but the weight didn't change. Maybe because it's a solution, and the gas didn't react. Or perhaps the gas wasn't CO2. Alternatively, maybe the gas was something else that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2 under these conditions.
- Tube 3: Red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed. Red-hot copper reacting with a gas—what's that? Probably CO, as CO reacts with Cu to form CuO. The reaction would be something like 2Cu + CO → 2CuO + something maybe? Wait, I think the reaction is 2Cu + CO → 2CuO + C? Or maybe it's 2Cu + CO → Cu2O + something? Wait, no, I think the correct reaction is 2Cu + CO → 2CuO + C, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 2Cu + CO → Cu2O + something else. Wait, let me think. When CO passes through hot Cu, it's oxidized. So the reaction is 2Cu + CO → 2CuO + C. So the solid increases by the mass of the CO that reacted. Wait, but in this case, the tube's mass increased by 0.80 grams, which would be the mass of the CO.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the mass. CO has a molar mass of 28 g/mol. So if the mass increase is 0.80 grams, that would be 0.80 / 28 ≈ 0.0286 moles of CO. But let's hold onto that thought for a moment.

Now, after these tubes, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 22.4 liters is 1 mole, so 2.24 liters is 0.1 moles of gas C. What could gas C be? It's probably a gas that doesn't react in any of the tubes. Looking at the setup, it was after all three tubes. So which gases don't react with Mg(ClO4)2 (maybe H2O), Ca(OH)2 (maybe not CO2), and red-hot copper (maybe something else like N2, O2, etc.) But wait, what's left?

Wait, let me outline what each tube does:
- Tube 1: Absorbs H2O → if the gas in the mixture has H2O, the weight increases by the mass of H2O.
- Tube 2: If the gas was CO2, it would form CaCO3, which would increase the weight of the tube. But in this case, the weight didn't change. So perhaps the gas wasn't CO2. Alternatively, maybe the solution in tube 2 is such that it doesn't react with the gas. Or perhaps the gas is something else, like N2 or O2, which don't react with Ca(OH)2.
- Tube 3: Reacts with CO, as I thought earlier, forming CuO. So any CO in the gas would be absorbed here.

So, the initial mixture of gases from the salts would probably contain H2O, CO, and another gas that doesn't react, which is gas C.

Wait, but let's think about the decomposition of the salts. When salts decompose upon heating, they often produce gases. For example, nitrates decompose to produce NO2, NH3, or other gases. But given the reactions, let's hypothesize that the salts A and B, upon heating, produce H2O, CO, and possibly another gas.

So, perhaps the salts are such that when decomposed, they produce H2O (which is absorbed by tube 1), CO (which is absorbed by tube 3), and another gas that doesn't react in any of the tubes, which is gas C.

Looking at the data:

Mass increase in tube 1: 3.60 g. Since Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs H2O: Mg(ClO4)2 + 8H2O → Mg(ClO4)2·8H2O. So the mass increase is due to the water absorbed. The mass of H2O is 3.60 g.

So moles of H2O = 3.60 g / (18 g/mol) = 0.2 mol.

Tube 3: 0.80 g increase. As I thought, if it's CO, then moles of CO = 0.80 g / 28 g/mol ≈ 0.02857 mol.

Gas C: 2.24 L at STP → 0.1 mol.

So the total moles of gas produced would be 0.2 (H2O) + 0.02857 (CO) + 0.1 (gas C) ≈ 0.32857 mol.

But wait, since the salts A and B are equimolar, let's say each is n moles. So total moles of A and B together are 2n (if each is n), but perhaps the reaction produces a certain number of moles of each gas.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition reactions are such that each salt produces some of these gases.

Wait, perhaps the salts are nitrates, like sodium nitrate or something. Let's think about possible decompositions. For example, NaNO3 on heating can produce Na2O, NO2, and O2.
