Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first, I need to normalize this state because probabilities require the state to have a norm of 1. 

Wait, I remember that the norm of a vector is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components. So the state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal, right? So the norm squared is |1+i|² + |2 -i|². Let's calculate that.

For the first term, |1+i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 because 1² + 1² for the real and imaginary parts. That's 1+1=2. For the second term, |2 -i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So the total norm squared is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Next, the question is about measuring the eigenstates of an operator whose matrix is given by Aij. The matrix elements are Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so what's this operator look like? Let me think. For a two-level system, the matrix would be:

[ 0       ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2     0  ]

Because the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and off-diagonal (i≠j) are ħ/2. So that's a 2x2 matrix.

Hmm, what operator has this form? Oh wait, that's similar to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is diagonal. But here, our A matrix is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because if you take X and multiply by ħ/2, you get the matrix given.

Wait, no. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by ħ/2, it becomes [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], which matches A. So A is the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of X, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. Wait, but in the problem, the state is given in terms of the standard spin-z basis (|up> and |down>), which are the eigenstates of S_z. So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, I think I need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, and then the probabilities are the square of the coefficients.

Alternatively, I can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A and then project |alpha> onto each eigenvector. Let's try that approach.

The operator A is (ħ/2) * σ_x. So its eigenvalues can be found by solving (σ_x) |v> = λ |v>. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A are (ħ/2)(±1) →
