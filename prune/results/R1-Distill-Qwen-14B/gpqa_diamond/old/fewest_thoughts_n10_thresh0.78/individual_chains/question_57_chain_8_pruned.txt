Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that involves electrons bouncing off a nucleus, right?

The given data includes phase shifts: δ0 is 90 degrees, δ1 is 67 degrees, δ2 is 55 degrees, δ3 is 30 degrees, and δ4 is 13 degrees. Oh wait, and we're supposed to ignore the rest beyond δ4. So I guess that means we're considering up to l=4? Because each δ corresponds to a specific orbital angular momentum quantum number l. So δ0 is for l=0, δ1 for l=1, and so on.

The scattering amplitude is a key concept here. I remember the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a formula involving the phase shifts. The general form is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum over l [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (some spherical harmonics terms) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, another approach comes to mind. The scattering amplitude can also be expressed in terms of the partial waves.

Wait, I think the scattering amplitude in the context of partial waves is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) / (2ik) ) * ( (2l + 1) ) * [ ... ] ] Wait, maybe there's another formula. Oh right, I think I need to recall the expression for the differential cross-section, but perhaps that's not directly helpful here. Alternatively, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts.

Wait, another thought: The real and imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude can be found using the phase shifts. The formula I remember is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l + 1) * P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, since the question is specifically asking about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, that would be when θ is 0 degrees because that's the direction of the incident beam.

Hmm, but wait, no. Wait, in scattering, θ=0 is the direction of the incident particle, and θ=180 is the opposite. But for the forward direction (θ=0), the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ) becomes P_l(1), which is zero for all l except l=0. Because for l=0, P_0(x)=1, so P_0(1)=1. For l>0, P_l(1) is 1 for even l, but actually, no, wait, Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are all 1, right? Wait no, because P_1(1) is 1, P_2(1)=1, etc. Oh wait, no, wait, P_l(1) is always 1. Because when x=1, all the terms just add up.

Wait, no, I think that's correct. So, for any l, when θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1) = 1. So, the sum would include all terms. Hmm, but wait, in that case, the sum is over all l, each term contributes (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) times (2l+1) times 1, all multiplied by 1/(2ik).

But the question is specifically about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction, which is θ=0. So f(θ=0) would be the sum over l of [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l + 1) ) ] / (2ik). Then, the imaginary part of this is what we need.

So let's compute the imaginary part of each term in the sum. Because the overall factor is 1/(2ik), which can be written as -i/(2k) because 1/i is -i. So when we take the imaginary part, each term's contribution will involve the imaginary part of (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) multiplied by (2l + 1), then multiplied by (-i/(2k)).

Wait, let me clarify. Let me write this more carefully. The amplitude f is:

f(θ=0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l+1) ]

Because beyond l=4, we ignore them. So each term in the sum is (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) multiplied by (2l+1), then all summed and multiplied by 1/(2ik).

We need the imaginary
