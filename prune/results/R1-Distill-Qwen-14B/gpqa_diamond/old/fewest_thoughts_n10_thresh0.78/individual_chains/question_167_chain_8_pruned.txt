Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Schrödinger cat state and calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let's read the problem statement carefully. The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The task is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure del_b, which is defined as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state rho and the reference Gaussian state tau.

Wait, von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(rho ln rho), right? So the relative entropy here is S(rho) - S(tau), or is it the other way around? The formula given is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. Oh, wait, no, because usually entropy is -Tr(rho ln rho), so del_b would be [ -Tr(rho ln rho) + Tr(tau ln tau) ] = [Tr(tau ln tau) - Tr(rho ln rho)].

Wait, but the formula in the problem says del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because the von Neumann entropy is usually the negative of that. So maybe I should be careful with the signs.

But let's start by understanding the state given. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states, so a superposition of them would be non-Gaussian, which is why this state is a Schrödinger cat state, known for being non-Gaussian.

The normalization N is given by sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Let me compute that for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

So, phi is -pi/4. Let's compute sin(2phi). 2phi would be -pi/2, and sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1.

Then exp(-2 alpha²) is exp
