Okay, so I have this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine, and I need to figure out the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for substances 1 to 6. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to either the ortho, meta, or para positions. The directing effect depends on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating and whether it's an ortho/para director or a meta director.

The question asks about the para isomer's weight fraction. So, for each substituent, I need to determine how much para product is formed when bromine (Br2) is used in excess under electrophilic substitution conditions.

Let me list out each compound and their substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3 → methyl group
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 → ethyl ester (COOEt)
3) C6H5-Cl → chlorine atom
4) C6H5-NO2 → nitro group
5) C6H5-C2H5 → ethyl group (maybe it's ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH → carboxylic acid group

Now, each substituent directs the incoming bromine:

- Methyl (CH3): It's an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. Alkyl groups are ortho/para directors. So, when bromine adds, the major product will be a mix of ortho and para, but para is more favored than ortho because of steric hindrance in ortho (since the substituent is bulky). Wait, actually, for activating groups, the para is usually the major product when possible. Or maybe it's a balance between substitution positions. For methyl, the main products are para and ortho, but the para is more favored. So the para fraction would be higher.

- COOEt: The ester group (COOEt) is a deactivating group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. It's a meta director. So, the incoming Br would substitute mainly in the meta position. So for this compound, the para isomer would be less, maybe negligible, so the fraction is low.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The ester group is a meta director, so the substitution occurs at the meta position, so the para isomer is not formed in significant amounts. So for compound 2, the para fraction is low.

- Cl: Chlorine is an ortho/para director but is deactivating because it's a halogen. Halogens are unique in that they are deactivating (due to their electronegativity) but still ortho/para directors. So, substitution occurs in ortho and para. But since Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, the ring is less activated, so the reaction might be slower, but the directing is still ortho/para. So for this compound, para is a major product.

Wait, but wait. For halogens, the para product is major? Or is it that they have a higher tendency to direct to para compared to ortho? Or maybe it's a mix, but in the case of para substitution, it's more favorable in some cases. Hmm.

- NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, substitution occurs mainly at the meta position. So, the para isomer is not formed much. So the para fraction is low here too.

Wait, but when NO2 is present, the substitution is meta. So for compound 4, the para isomer is minimal.

- C2H5 (ethyl group): This is similar to methyl. It's an activating, ortho/para director. So, substitution occurs at ortho and para. Since the ethyl group is larger than methyl, perhaps the para position is more favored because the ortho substitution is more crowded. So, the para fraction is high here.

Wait, no, wait. The ethyl group is a better ortho director than para? Or the opposite? I think for larger alkyl groups, the para product tends to be more favored because the ortho position is more hindered. So, ethyl would lead to more para substitution. So for compound 5, the para fraction is high.

- COOH (carboxylic acid): This is a strong deactivating group because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl. It's a meta director. So, substitution occurs at the meta position. So, the para isomer isn't formed much. So for compound 6, the para fraction is low.

Wait, but wait. The COOH group is a strong deactivating group, yes. So, the ring is less reactive, but the substitution occurs where? Since it's meta-directing, the Br would add at the meta positions, so para is not a major product.

Wait, but wait again. No, the substituent is in the para position relative to
