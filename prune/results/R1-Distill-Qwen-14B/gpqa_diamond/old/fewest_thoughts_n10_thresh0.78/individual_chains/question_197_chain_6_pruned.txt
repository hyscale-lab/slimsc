Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's dive in.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to find the final product. The options are A, B, C, D. They've given IR and NMR data for Compound X, so I should start by analyzing that.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, likely an O-H stretch or an N-H stretch. Since there are no other N-containing peaks mentioned, maybe it's an O-H like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but another peak is at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm-1 (broad), and their carbonyls are around 1700. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, there's a 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 peak. Those might be from aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, like a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the NMR data: There's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is really up there. That's a very deshielded proton. For benzoic acids, the COOH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad singlet. So the 10.5 ppm peak is likely that acidic proton. That supports the idea that it's a benzoic acid derivative.

In the NMR, there's also 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring because the doublets each have two protons and are in a symmetrical position. So the aromatic ring has substituents in the para positions. One substituent is the COOH group, and the other is another group (maybe an alkyl chain).

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which
