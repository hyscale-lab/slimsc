Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through what I need to do.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, we see brightness variations, which can look like an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is asking: to produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as this spotty star, what would be the radius of an exoplanet compared to the star's radius?

Hmm, I remember that the brightness change when a planet transits a star depends on the area blocked. The formula for the depth of the transit is (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius. But here, the situation is a bit different because it's star spots causing the variation.

Wait, the star's brightness variation due to spots is more complex. When spots are on the star, they make it dimmer when they're facing us. Since the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing dips in brightness. But the spots are cooler, so when they're in the visible part, the star appears slightly dimmer.

The problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. Wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR², so 20% of that is 0.4πR². So the total spotted area is 0.4πR².

But wait, the star is a sphere. So each hemisphere is 2πR². Covering 20% of one hemisphere would be 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

The star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots are 1000K cooler, so their temperature is 5000K. But how does this affect the brightness variation?

The apparent brightness of the star depends on the areas' temperatures. The total flux from the star without any spots would be sigma * Teff^4 * 4πR² / 4π, because the star is a sphere. Wait, no, the flux is sigma*T^4 per unit area. The star's total luminosity is L = 4π R² sigma Teff^4.

When spots are present, part of the surface emits less. So the total flux is L = (4π R
