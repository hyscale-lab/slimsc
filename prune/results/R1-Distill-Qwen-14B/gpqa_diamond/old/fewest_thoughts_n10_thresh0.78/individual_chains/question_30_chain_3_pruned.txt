Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, let's think. The question says the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons and emits light at 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember something about the energy of light and colors. Oh right, the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength, which in turn corresponds to a color. The formula I think is E = hc/位, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light. So higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths.

But wait, this is about absorption and emission. Oh yes! When a compound absorbs light, it's because the energy of that light corresponds to the energy gap between states in the molecule. So if the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, that's the energy it releases when it drops from an excited state back to the ground state. So the energy absorbed would be the same as the energy emitted? Or wait, maybe not. Because in fluorescence or phosphorescence, the emitted light is usually lower energy than what was absorbed. Or is it the same?

Wait, no, in fluorescence, the energy emitted is typically lower than the absorbed energy because some is lost as heat. So if the dye emits at 2.3393 eV, that's the energy of the emitted photon. But the absorbed photon would have higher energy, right?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Let's consider that when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, when it emits a photon, it typically does so at a lower energy than the absorbed photon. But wait, wait, no. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the color wheel and the complement. Because when a substance absorbs certain wavelengths, it reflects the complementary color. So if the dye emits green light, it might absorb... Wait no, the question is about what color is absorbed, not what is emitted.

Wait, the question says the dye emits light at a certain energy. So the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. Let me calculate the wavelength of that. E = hc/位, so 位 = hc/E.

h is Planck's constant, which is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J路s. c is speed of light, 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. E is energy in joules. But the energy given is
