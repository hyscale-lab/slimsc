Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying the product formed when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes a Cope rearrangement. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically involves 1,5-dienes transforming into another 1,5-diene, but in this case, the starting material doesn't look like a 1,5-diene. Wait, maybe it's related to a similar structure.

The compound given is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure, right? And the substituents here are a vinyl group and an azabicyclo group. So the structure has a bridge, and the double bond is at position 5.

I think the vinyl group is at position 2, which is part of the bridge. Let me draw the structure mentally. The bicyclo has two bridges: one of two carbons, another of two, and the third bridge is of one carbon. The substituents are at positions 1 and 4, which are bridgeheads. So the structure would have a double bond between carbons 5 and 6, perhaps.

Wait, the structure is 2-vinyl, so there's a CH2-CH2 group attached to the bridge. Or maybe the vinyl is part of the ring. Hmm, perhaps the molecule looks like this: the bicyclo system has the double bond between 5 and 6. The 2-azabicyclo suggests that a nitrogen is at position 2, which is part of the bridge. So the nitrogen is in the bridge, and there's a vinyl group attached to it. So the structure has a double bond adjacent to the nitrogen.

Wait, the starting material is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the bicyclo is [2.2.1], which has seven carb
