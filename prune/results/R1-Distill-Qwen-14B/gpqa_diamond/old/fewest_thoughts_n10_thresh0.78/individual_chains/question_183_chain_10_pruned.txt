Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated based on the formula of the compound. It's related to the degrees of unsaturation, right? So each ring or double bond counts as one, and each triple bond counts as two. 

The compound in question is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So it's a cyclohexene ring, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (which is a CHO group), and at position 5, a vinyl group (which is a CHâ‚‚=CH- group). Plus, there's a carboxylic acid group attached somewhere, probably at position 3? Or wait, the numbering might be such that the cyclohexene has a double bond from 3 to 4? Because cyclohex-3-ene would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4.

Wait, the structure of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw this out mentally. The main ring is cyclohexene, with a double bond between C3 and C4. Then, a formyl group is at C2, and a vinyl group is at C5. Also, there's a carboxylic acid group attached to the ring, maybe at position 1 or another position. Wait, the name is cyclohex-3-ene-carboxylic acid. Oh, right, so the carboxylic acid is at position 1, I think. Because the numbering would start such that the double bond is between 3 and 4, and the carboxylic acid is at position 1. So the substituents are at positions 2 (formyl), 5 (vinyl), and 1 (COOH).

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, I remember that when carboxylic acids react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a reaction called the Arndt-E
