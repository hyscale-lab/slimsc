Okay, so I've got this problem about binary star systems, and I'm trying to figure out what the answer is. Let me start by breaking down the question.

So, there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. The radial velocity (RV) variations are given as sinusoidal with specific amplitudes for each system.

In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass considered is the sum of the two stars in each system.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method relates the mass of the stars to their velocities. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's less massive stars that orbit more quickly around the center of mass.

Wait, right! The mass ratio comes into play here. The mass ratio q is the mass of the secondary divided by the mass of the primary. But I'm not exactly sure how to apply this. Maybe I should think about the center of mass.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit a common center of mass. The more massive star is closer to the center, and the less massive one is farther out. Their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, if star A has mass M1 and velocity V1, and star B has mass M2 and velocity V2, then M1/M2 = V2/V1.

Wait, yes. Because M1 * V1 = M2 * V2 (conservation of momentum). So, M1/M2 = V2/V1. That makes sense.

So for each system, the mass ratio is determined by swapping the velocities of the two stars. So in system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5. So the mass ratio q1 is (5/10) = 0.5. So M1a / M2a = 0.5, which implies M2a is twice as massive as M1a.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I got that backward. Let me see. If the velocities are V1 and V2, then M1 = (V2 / V1) * M2. Because M1 * V1 = M2 * V2. So M1 / M2 = V2 / V1.

So for system_1: V1 is 10 km/s, V2 is 5. So M1a/M2a = 5/10 = 0.5. That means M1a is 0.5 times M2a. So the total mass of system_1 is M1a + M2a = 0.5 M2a + M2a = 1.5 M2a.

Wait, but that's just the ratio for system_1. Now system_2 has RVs of 15 and 10. So for system_2, V1 is 15, V2 is 10. So M1b / M2b = 10/
