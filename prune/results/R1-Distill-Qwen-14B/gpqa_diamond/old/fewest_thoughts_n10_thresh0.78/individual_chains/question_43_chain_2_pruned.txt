Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this IUPAC naming problem. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents. The substituents are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde group attached to the benzene), and a cyano group. All three of these are meta to one another. That means each is separated by two carbons around the ring. So if I imagine the benzene ring, the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the cyano at position 3, and the aldehyde at position 5? Or is it a different numbering? Wait, no, because it's all meta, their positions should be 1, 3, and 5, but the substituent numbering could vary based on the main functional group.

Wait, I remember that the main functional group in benzoic acid is the -COOH group. So in IUPAC nomenclature, the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group, and the numbering starts from there. So the substituents will be numbered based on their positions relative to the -COOH group.

But wait, the question says the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to each other. So if the -COOH is at position 1, the cyano (CN) would be at 3, and the aldehyde (CHO) at 5. Because they are meta to each other, each is two positions away from the others.

Additionally, the substituents ortho to the carboxylic acid are hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (N(CH3)2). So positions 2 and 6 (because ortho is adjacent to the substituent) of the benzene ring. Wait, wait. Let me think about the numbering. Let's imagine the benzene ring with the carboxylic acid at position 1. Then, the adjacent positions (ortho) are 2 and 6. So, the substituents on positions 2 and 6 are -OH and N(CH3)2.

Wait, but the question says ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So positions 2 and 6 are occupied by -OH and -N(CH3)2. Which one is on which position? Hmm, I'm not sure yet
