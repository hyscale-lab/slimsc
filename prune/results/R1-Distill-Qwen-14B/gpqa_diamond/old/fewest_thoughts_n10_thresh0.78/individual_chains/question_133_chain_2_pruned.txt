Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and equilibrium, which I remember from class but I'm not super confident. Let's take it step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.

Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, no. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-? Or wait, no. Let me think again. Phosphate ions can exist in different forms depending on the pH. So H3PO4 is the fully protonated form, then H2PO4^- is the first deprotonated, then HPO4^2- is the second, and PO4^3- is the third.

So the question is about orthophosphate ions. Hmm, I think orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, the dihydrogen phosphate ion. So we're looking for [HPO4^2-] in the solution.

The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both of these are phosphate salts, so this is a buffer solution. Buffer solutions work by resisting changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. They consist of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid.

In this case, let me see: KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Its formula is KH2PO4, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (since H3PO4 donates a proton to become H2PO4^-). But wait, no, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+ (Ka1 is 7.5e-3). So H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4.

Then, the other salt is Na2HPO4·2H2O. Sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- and 2 H2O. So HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- (since H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-; that's the second dissociation step with Ka2 being 6.2e-8).

So putting these two together, we have a buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Because when you mix a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), you can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, but wait, the question isn't asking for pH, it's asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I need to find [HPO4^2-]. Hmm, but since the solution is a buffer, the concentrations of the acid and conjugate base are determined by the amounts of the salts used.

So the first step is to calculate the moles of each component.

Let's compute the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Molar mass (Mw) of KH2PO4 is given as 136.09 g/mol. We have 1.00 g, so moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ let's calculate that. 1/136 is approximately 0.00735 moles. Wait, 136.09 is about 136, so 1/136 is about 0.0073529. So approximately 0.007353 mol.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O, Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.0
