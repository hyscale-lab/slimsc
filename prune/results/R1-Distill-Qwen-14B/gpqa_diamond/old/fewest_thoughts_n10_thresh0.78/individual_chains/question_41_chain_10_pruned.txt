Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. I remember that when dealing with relative motion and light, it's all about how different frames of reference perceive things.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. Wait, same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Oh, that might mean that from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving towards them, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement.

Wait, no. Let me parse that again. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going, say, to the right, and the glass is moving to the right too. But the beam is approaching the observer. Hmm, maybe the observer is stationary, and the glass is moving towards them in the same direction as the light? That might not make sense. Wait, no, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the glass is moving in the direction the light is going, but the observer is on the lab side. So the glass is moving towards the observer, because the light is moving towards the observer. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is that the light is going towards the
