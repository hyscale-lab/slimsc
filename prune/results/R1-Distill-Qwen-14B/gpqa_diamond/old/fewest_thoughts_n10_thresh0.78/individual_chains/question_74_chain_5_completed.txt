Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about radioactive decay probability. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. But wait, the question is about a single atom, right? So it's not talking about a large number of atoms, just one. That makes me think about the concept of decay constants and maybe the half-life?

The problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, in 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance that the atom will decay. Wait, but probability in that time frame. So, if I have a 32% chance over 100 minutes, what does that mean for shorter or longer periods?

Wait, but the question is a bit tricky. It says that so far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, we need the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, does that mean the next 150 minutes from the start, or from the current time? Let me read again: "the next 150 minutes." So I think it's 150 minutes after the current time, which is 50 minutes into the monitoring. So the total time from the start would be 50 +150 = 200 minutes, but the question is about the next 150 minutes after the current 50 minutes have passed.

But wait, radioactive decay has the memoryless property. Oh right, I remember that in exponential decay, the probability of decaying in a future interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the fact that 50 minutes have gone by and it hasn't decayed doesn't change the probability now. But wait, how does that fit with the given 32% probability over 100 minutes?

Wait, so the given 32% is the probability that the atom decays within 100 minutes. Let me model this. The probability of decay in time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. So if t is 100 minutes, P(100) = 0.32.

So we can find λ first. Let's compute λ. 

So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). 

That gives e^(-100λ) = 1 -0.32 = 0.68. 

Take natural log of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). 

So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100. 

Calculate ln(0.68): ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7. Let me think: ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857. So λ ≈ 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Now, the question is about the next 150 minutes. Since the process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes from the current time is P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

So let's compute that. 

λ is 0.003857 per minute.

150 * λ ≈ 150 * 0.003857 ≈ 0.57855.

So e^(-0.57855) ≈ ? Let me think. e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me approximate it. Let's calculate 0.57855 -0.5 =0.07855. So the exponent is 0.5 + 0.07855. 

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute e^-0.57855. Let's see:

We can use the Taylor series for e^-x around x=0.5, but maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use the fact that ln(0.56) is about -0.5798, which is close to 0.57855. Wait, ln(0.56) is approximately -0.5798, so e^-0.5798 ≈ 0.56. But our exponent is 0.57855, which is a little larger than 0.5798, so e^-0.57855 is a bit larger than 0.56. Let's say approximately 0.562.

So P(150) = 1 - 0.562 = 0.438, or 43.8% approximately. Looking at the options, 44% is option A. But wait, let me check the calculation more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute e^(-0.57855) more accurately.

Another approach: ln(0.56)= -0.5798, which is about 0.5798. Our exponent is 0.57855, which is 0.00125 less than 0.5798. So the e^-0.57855 would be e^(0.00125) * 0.56. Since e^0.00125 ≈ 1 + 0.00125 = 1.00125. So 0.56 * 1.00125 ≈ 0.5607. So e^-0.57855 ≈ 0.5607. So P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, about 43.93%. Close to 44%, so option A.

But wait, the options don't have 44% exactly. Wait, option A is 44%. So that's the closest. But wait, let me recalculate the decay constant. Did I compute that correctly?

Earlier, I had P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ}, so e^{-100λ} = 0.68. Taking ln(0.68)= -0.385662... So λ=0.385662/100 =0.00385662 per minute.

So let's compute 150 * λ: 150 * 0.00385662 ≈ 0.5785.

Then e^-0.5785. Let me compute e^-0.5785 more accurately.

Let me use a calculator approximation. Let's see:

We can compute it as ln(0.56) is about -0.5798, so 0.5785 is higher than that by about 0.0013. So e^{-0.5785} = e^{( -0.5798 + 0.0013)} = e^{0.0013} * e^{-0.5798}.

Wait, that's e^0.0013 * 0.56. e^0.0013 ≈ 1 + 0.0013 + (0.0013^2)/2 ≈ 1.0013 + 0.000000845 ≈ approximately 1.001300845. So 1.001300845 * 0.56 ≈ 0.560736.

So e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.560736. So 1 - 0.560736 = 0.439264, which is approximately 43.93%, which is 43.9% approximately. So the closest option is 44%, which is option A.

But wait, is that correct? Because another approach would be to think in terms of probabilities. The initial 100 minutes have a 32% chance. But wait, the problem says that 50 minutes have passed without decay. Does that affect the probability for the next 150 minutes?

Wait, no, because the decay process is memoryless. So the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as it would have been from the start, regardless of how much time has already passed without decay. Because the probability is exponential, the chance doesn't depend on the previous time.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. So that would be P(150) / (1 - P(50)).

Wait, that could be another approach. Because the total probability of the atom decaying in the first 50 minutes is P(50) = 1 - e^{-λ*50}.

So the probability that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is e^{-λ*50}.

Now, the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after 50 is: [P(200) - P(50)] divided by (1 - P(50)).

Wait, because P(200) is the probability it decays within 200 minutes, and P(50) is within 50. So the probability it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is P(200) - P(50). But since the process is memoryless, this conditional probability should be the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting from the current time.

Wait, but in that case, [P(200) - P(50)] / (1 - P(50)) = [1 - e^{-λ*200} - (1 - e^{-λ*50})] / (e^{-λ*50}) 

Simplify numerator: [e^{-λ*50} - e^{-λ*200}]

Denominator: e^{-λ *50}

So numerator/denominator = [1 - e^{-λ*(200-50)}] = 1 - e^{-150λ} = same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. So both approaches give the same result. So in either case, the probability is 1 - e^{-150λ}.

So, I think my initial approach was correct. So 43.9% is approximately 44%, so option A.

But wait, let me look at the options again. The options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.

So 44% is the closest. So the answer should be A.


To determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, we use the memoryless property of radioactive decay. The probability of decay in a given time interval depends only on the decay constant \( \lambda \), which can be calculated from the given decay probability over 100 minutes.

### Step 1: Calculate the decay constant \( \lambda \)
The probability of decay within 100 minutes is given as 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using the formula for radioactive decay:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

we solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-100\lambda}
\]

\[
e^{-100\lambda} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
-100\lambda = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3857 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3857}{100} = 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is given by:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substitute \( \lambda = 0.003857 \):

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.003857 \cdot 150}
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.57855}
\]

To approximate \( e^{-0.57855} \), note that \( e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065 \) and \( e^{-0.6} \approx 0.5488 \). Since \( 0.57855 \) is between \( 0.5 \) and \( 0.6 \), we estimate \( e^{-0.57855} \approx 0.56 \). Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \, \text{or} \, 44\%.
\]

### Step 3: Verify the memoryless property
The memoryless property ensures that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes already elapsed. This confirms that the calculation is valid.

### Final Answer
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**, corresponding to option A.
