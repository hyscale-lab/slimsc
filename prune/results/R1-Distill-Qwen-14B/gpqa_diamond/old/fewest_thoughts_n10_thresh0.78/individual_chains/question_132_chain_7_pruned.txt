Okay, so I have this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question gives me a 1H NMR spectrum of a mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The options are different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene. 

The NMR has two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. So that means each aromatic ring contributes one set of protons, but since there are two signals, each compound must have the same number of equivalent aromatic protons. Wait, no, because there are two signals in a 1:1 ratio, but they're each singlets. Hmm, maybe each compound has a single type of aromatic proton. So both compounds are perhaps para-substituted or something that gives them only one set of equivalent protons in their aromatic ring.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows two singlets—so each compound contributes a singlet. That suggests that each has an equivalent set of aromatic protons. Let me think: which of the options have only one type of aromatic proton?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's see. The first compound is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl. So if I imagine the benzene ring, substituents at 1,2,3,4 positions. Wait, that's four substituents. Wait, how does that look? Let me draw it mentally. Benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. So the substituents are adjacent? So the positions are 1,2,3,4—so that's four in a row. So the structure would have methyl groups at 1,2,3,4. That leaves positions 5 and 6. So the aromatic protons would be at 5 and 6. Wait, but wait, in a ring, position 5 is next to position 4, and 6 is next to position 1. So maybe the ring looks like this:

Positions 1,2,3
