Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm, I need to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Because β is 1/(kT), so each state contributes exp(-E/(kT)).

Each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. But maybe there are some states with the same energy, so they can be grouped together.

Let me think about the possible values of E. Since each S_i is ±1, each S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. So for each pair, S_i S_j is +1 if the spins are the same and -1 if different.

So the energy E is -J multiplied by the sum of the three S_i S_j terms. Let's denote each term as S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. So E = -J(A + B + C), where each of A, B, C is either +1 or -1.

I need to find all possible combinations of A, B, C and compute E for each. Then find how many states give each E, multiply by the Boltzmann factor, and sum them up.

Wait, but each S_i can be ±1, so for each pair, S_i S_j is the product. So for each triplet (S1, S2, S3), we can compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the possible total values of the sum. Let's think about the possible values of H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term is ±1, so the sum can range from -3 to +3 in steps of 2? Let me see. Wait, each term is either 1 or -1. So for three terms, the possible sums are:

-3: all three terms are -1.
-1: two terms are -1, one is +1.
+1: two terms are +1, one is -1.
+3: all three are +1.

Wait, but actually, is that possible? Let's see.

Wait, for example, if all three spins are the same, say +1. Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So their sum is 3, so E = -J*(3) = -3J.

If two spins are the same and the third is opposite. Let's say S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Another case: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.
