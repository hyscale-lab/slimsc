Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again to understand what's being asked.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis and falls vertically on this aperture. This setup creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. They also mention that we can use the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, okay, so the key here is probably to model this situation using the concept of diffraction. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of bright and dark fringes. The specific pattern depends on the shape of the aperture.

Wait, for a single slit, the intensity pattern has a central maximum and then minima at certain angles. The formula for the minima (dark fringes) in single-slit diffraction is given by a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer (m=±1, ±2, ...). But wait, no, I think that's for double-slit interference. Wait, no, no, wait. I'm mixing things up.

Right, single-slit diffraction minima occur at a sinθ = mλ, where m is 1,2,3... So the first minimum is at θ where a sinθ = λ. But wait, that's when the slit width is 'a'. But wait, in this problem, the apothems are all length 'a'. Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says the aperture is a polygon with N sides, and all apothems are length 'a'. So for a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular N-gon, each side has length s = 2 * a * tan(π/N). Because the apothem is related to the side length by s = 2a tan(θ/2), where θ is the central angle of each side. So for a regular polygon, each side is s = 2a tan(π/N).

But as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. Because a polygon with infinite sides becomes a circle. So, when N is infinitely large, the aperture becomes a circular aperture. Oh!
