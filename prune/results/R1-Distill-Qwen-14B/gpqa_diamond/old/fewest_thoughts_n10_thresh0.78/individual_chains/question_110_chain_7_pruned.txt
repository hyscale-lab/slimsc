Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I get all the details.

The question gives me five stars, each with different properties: RA, DEC, magnitude, distance, and some have extinction (E(B-V)) which affects their apparent brightness. The key is to figure out which stars can be observed by both instruments. 

First, I need to recall the capabilities of each spectrograph. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no—wait, it says "brighter than 17 mag." Oh, right, because lower magnitude means brighter. So ESPRESSO can detect stars with V <=17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, I think I get it wrong sometimes. Because the magnitude scale is inverted. So brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star is brighter than 17, its V mag is less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, the apparent V mag should be ≤17. Because anything brighter than 17 (like 16 or 15) is okay. Conversely, a star with V=18 would be too faint for ESPRESSO.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the apparent V mag must be ≤16. Because anything brighter than 16 is okay; so stars with V mag 17 would not be detected by HIRES.

So each star's apparent V magnitude needs to be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. But wait, wait, the question says which stars can be detected by both. So a star must be detectable by both, meaning it's within both observatories' limits. So the apparent V mag must be ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). So the star's apparent V must be ≤16. Because if it's 17,
