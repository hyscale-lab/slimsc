Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. So, I imagine something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no, that's not cis. Oh, wait, the dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene, meaning it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Maybe more accurately, something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the middle carbons, making it cis. So perhaps HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOH, but wait, that's longer. Alternatively, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond elsewhere. Wait, no, the main thing is the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis double bond.

The first reaction is dehydration to form an anhydride. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride. The product is an anhydride. The question says this anhydride has a single peak in the 1H NMR at 7 ppm and two peaks in the 13C NMR at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.

Hmm, 7 ppm is a region for possibly alkenyl protons. Wait, but in an anhydride, maybe the protons are on oxygen? No, wait. Alternatively, maybe the 7 ppm peak is from an aromatic ring, but the starting material is a diacid with a cis-alkene, so maybe the dehydration forms a cyclic anhydride.

Wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks. 137 ppm could be a carbonyl adjacent to something, like an oxygen. 165 ppm is a strong indication of a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone or anhydride. So if it's an anhydride, the carbonyl carbons in the anhydride ring would typically be around 165-185 ppm. So one of the 13C peaks is the carbonyl.

But the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. So maybe there's only one set of protons equivalent, perhaps in a symmetrical position. Wait, when a diacid dehydrates to form an anhydride, if the acid is symmetric, the resulting anhydride would have symmetry. For example, if the diacid is HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH, then dehydrating would form a cyclic anhydride. The symmetry would mean that all the non-carbonyl protons are equivalent, perhaps.

Wait, but the starting material has a cis-alkene. So maybe the anhydride comes from a diacid where the two carboxylic acid groups are on either end of a cis double bond. So the structure would be something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, the diacid has a cis-alkene, so perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, think of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid would form maleic anhydride. So the structure is more like:

HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H â†’ after dehydration, becomes a cyclic anhydride: O=C-(CH2)2-C=O, but as an anhydride. Wait, no, maleic anhydride is actually a five-membered ring. So the structure is O=C-(CH)2-C=O connected in a ring with
