Okay, so I've got this question about NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum looks consistent with the expected molecule, except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals, adding up to 1H. But the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so it's not like they're splitting each other.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum matching the expected molecule. So the question is, what's causing this?

Looking at the options:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different, right? Because the precursor would have a lower massâ€”like if the real compound lost something. But the LC-MS says same mass, so A might not be it.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In NMR, if the compound is a racemic mixture, for an achiral proton (like in the case where the two enantiomers have the same environment for that proton), you wouldn't see two separate peaks. Wait, no, actually, in some cases, if the environment is the same, they might merge. But if the molecule is chiral and the proton is in a chiral environment, maybe the NMR would split. Hmm, but the question says the two peaks are from the same alpha-proton. Enantiomers would have identical NMR shifts because the environment is the same, so why two peaks? Unless it's a diastereomer, which would cause different shifts. Wait, but if it's a mixture of enantiomers, the NMR would still show the same peaks as the pure compound because they're identical in that aspect. So for B, if the compound is a racemic mix, the NMR would look normal, right? Because the two enantiomers contribute the same peaks. So maybe B isn't the right answer.

C) Double coupling during amide formation. I'm not too sure about this. Double coupling could mean something like a proton coupling with two different sets, but the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So maybe this isn't it.

D) Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. Wait, but in the question, the two peaks have similar shifts. So why would that be? If you have a diastereomeric mixture, the alpha-proton environment might be slightly different, leading to two peaks close in shift. But wait, the integrals add up to 1H, which suggests that each peak is half an H. So in the NMR, each diastereomer has the same number of protons, but their environments make their shifts a bit different. So each diastereomer contributes one proton, but with a slightly different shift. That could cause two peaks with similar shifts and equal integrals.

But then, looking at the LC-MS part. At elevated temperature, if the two diastereomers have the same mass, then the LC would separate them into two peaks. But wait, diastereomers usually have different physical properties, so they should elute at different times. That's why the
