Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question asks which of the given options has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D, each corresponding to one of these.

Wait, actually, the options are labeled a to d in the question, but the choices are A to D, each selecting one of a-d. So I need to figure out which exoplanet has the highest density, then match it to the answer options.

First, let me list each option:

Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So same as Earth. Earth's density is known, around 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density about 5.5 g/cm³. Hmm, that's same density as Earth but twice the mass. Wait, but if the density is the same, the mass would scale with the cube of radius. Because mass is density times volume, and volume is (4/3)πr³. So if radius increases, mass goes up more.

Wait, but wait. Option b says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. So its density is same as Earth. But since it's more massive, perhaps the radius is larger? Let's think: Earth's mass is M, radius R. So density rho = M/( (4/3)πR³ ) =5.5.

If this planet has 2M, same density, then the volume is 2*(4/3 π R³), so the radius would be R multiplied by cube root of 2. So the radius is larger than Earth's. But the question is about which has the highest density. So option b's density is 5.5, same as Earth.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. So if it's same composition, same density. Because composition determines density. So Earth's density is 5.5, so this planet would also have 5.5 g/cm³.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same density. So same as Earth.

Wait, but wait. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So options a, b, c, d: a is same as Earth, so 5.5. Option b has same density as Earth, 5.5. Options c and d also
