Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm. Let me read through it again. 

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are supposed to be normalized, right? Oh wait, maybe I should check that first. Oh, because if the state isn't normalized, I might need to normalize it before proceeding. 

So the state vector is a column matrix: [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me calculate its norm. The norm squared would be (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So to normalize it, each component would be divided by sqrt(6). But wait, does the problem specify whether the state is normalized? The problem doesn't say, so perhaps I should assume it's not, and proceed by normalizing it because in quantum mechanics, state vectors are typically normalized.

Wait, but the observable P is given as a matrix. Let me see what P looks like. The matrix P has first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So it's a 3x3 matrix with 0s and 1/sqrt(2)s. 

Wait, the observable P is a matrix, and the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. The question is asking for the probability that the measurement of P yields 0. Oh, because 0 is one of the possible eigenvalues of P?

Wait, no. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the observable's possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P, and see if 0 is one of them. But wait, wait, let me think again. Suppose P is a Hermitian matrix because observables are represented by Hermitian operators, which ensures real eigenvalues. Let me check if P is Hermitian.

Let me look at P's elements. The (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (2,1) element is also 1/sqrt(2), so that's symmetric. The (1,3) is 0, and (3,1) is 0. The (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), and (3,2) is 1/sqrt(2), so symmetric. The diagonal elements are 0,0,0. So yes, P is a symmetric matrix, which implies it's Hermitian because all the elements are real. So P is Hermitian; that's good.

Now, the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's compute them.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

So the matrix looks like this:

[ 0      1/√2      0 ]

[1/√2    0      1/√2]

[0      1/√2     0 ]

Hmm. Let me find the eigenvalues. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve det(P - λ I) = 0.

So, the characteristic equation is:

| -λ    1/√2      0      |

|1/√2  -λ     1/√2 | = 0

| 0     1/√2    -λ  |

Expanding this determinant. Let me write it out.

The determinant is:

-λ * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using the first row.

So,

-λ multiplied by the determinant of the minor matrix:
| -λ     1/√2 |
|1/√2   -λ   |

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ^2 - (1/2).

Then the next term is - (1/√2) times the determinant of the minor matrix when we take the second element of the first row.

The minor matrix would be:

|1/√2  1/√2|
|0      -λ  |

Wait, no. Wait, to get the minor for the element (1,2), which is 1/√2, the minor is the matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2. So that's:

Row 2 and 3 without column 2:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2]

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The original matrix for the minor when considering the (1,2) element (which is 1/√2) is the determinant of the matrix after removing row 1 and column 2. So the remaining elements are:

Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2] but column 2 is removed, so [1/√2, 1/√2]

No, wait, no. For the minor for (1,2), the remaining elements are rows 2 and 3, and columns 1 and 3.

So the minor matrix is:

Row 2, columns 1 and 3: [1/√2, 1/√2 ]

Row 3, columns 1 and 3: [0, -λ ]

Wait, no, wait. The minor for (1,2) is the submatrix formed by removing row 1 and column 2. So the minor is:

[ [1/√2, 1/√2 ],
  [0, -λ ] ]

Wait, no, the original matrix is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0 

So when I remove row 1 and column 2, I'm left with:

Row 2: 1/√2, 1/√2 

Wait, no. The minor for (1,2) is the elements from row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So after removing row 1 and column 2, the minor becomes:

Row 2 without column 2: [1/√2, 1/√2]

Row 3 without column 2: [0, 0]

Wait, wait, let's make it clear. Let me write the minor matrix as rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So minor is:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [0, 0 ]

Wait, no, row 3 without column 2: the third row elements are 0, 1/√2, 0. So removing column 2, it's 0 and 0, because column 1: 0, column 3: 0.

Wait, no: the columns are 1, 2, 3. So after removing column 2, the remaining are column 1 and 3.

So row 2 after removing column 2: element (2,1) is 1/√2, element (2,3) is 1/√2. So the row is [1/√2, 1/√2].

Row 3 after removing column 2: element (3,1) is 0, element (3,3) is 0. So the row is [0, 0].

So the minor matrix is:

[1/√2, 1/√2 ]

[0,     0   ]

The determinant of this minor is (1/√2)(0) - (1/√2)(0) ) = 0.

So the expansion continues. Let's go back. The determinant expansion for the first row:

= (-λ) * [ λ^2 - (1/2) ] - (1/√2) * [ determinant of the minor ] + 0 * [ ... ]

But wait, the minor determinant for (1,2) is 0 as I just calculated. So the second term is [ - (1/√2) * 0 ] = 0.

Then the third term is 0 because the first row's third element is 0. So the entire determinant becomes:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) = 0.

So the characteristic equation is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) = 0

Which implies λ = 0, or λ² = 1/2 → λ = ± 1/√2.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1/√2, and -1/√2.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check: the determinant I did was for the 3x3 matrix. But when I expanded along the first row, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign for the minors.

Wait, the expansion using the first row would be:

element (1,1) * minor(-λ) - element (1,2) * minor + element (1,3) * minor.

Wait, the signs for the cofactors are determined by (-1)^(i+j). For the first row (i=1), the signs alternate: +, -, +.

So for (1,1): +, (1,2): -, (1,3): +.

So the determinant is:

(0) * [something] - (1/√2) * [determinant of minor for (1,2)] + (0) * [something else]

Wait, but in the first term, the (1,1) element is 0, so the first term is zero.

The second term is - (1/√2) * [ determinant of minor at (1,2) ].

The minor at (1,2) is the matrix:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

Which is:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [0, 0 ]

So the determinant is (1/√2)(0) - (1/√2)(0) )= 0.

So the second term is - (1/√2) * 0 = 0.

The third term is 0 * something, so zero.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the determinant would then be zero, which can't be correct. Because the trace of P is zero, but the determinant is not necessarily zero. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding the determinant. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write out the matrix and compute the determinant correctly.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let me look for symmetries or patterns in P.

Looking at P, it's a 3x3 matrix with zeros on the diagonal, and 1/sqrt(2) in positions (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), and 0 elsewhere.

Wait, so it's a symmetric matrix, and perhaps it's a kind of tridiagonal matrix, but not exactly because (2,3) is non-zero, but (1,3) is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by considering the structure. Let's think about eigenvectors.

Suppose I have an eigenvector [a, b, c]^T.

Then P applied to this vector would be:

Row 1: 0*a + (1/√2)*b + 0*c = (b)/√2

Row 2: (1/√2)*a + 0*b + (1/√2)*c = (a + c)/√2

Row 3: 0*a + (1/√2)*b + 0*c = (b)/√2

So the matrix equation P * v = λ v becomes:

(b/√2) = λ a,

(a + c)/√2 = λ b,

(b/√2) = λ c.

Hmm, so from the first and third equations:

(b/√2) = λ a → equation (1)

(b/√2) = λ c → equation (3)

So from equations 1 and 3: λ a = λ c → if λ ≠ 0, then a = c.

If λ =0, then from equation 1, b=0.

Let me consider two cases: λ=0 and λ≠0.

Case 1: λ = 0.

Then from equation (1): b=0.

From equation (2): (a + c)/√2 = 0 → a + c = 0.

In this case, a = -c.

So the eigenvector would be [a, 0, -a]^T. So any vector of the form a(1, 0, -1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

So 0 is indeed an eigenvalue.

Case 2: λ ≠0.

Then from equations 1 and 3, a = c.

Equation 2: (a + c)/√2 = λ b → (2a)/√2 = λ b → a√2 = λ b → b = a√2 / λ.

So the eigenvectors would be [a, (a√2)/λ, a]^T.

We can write this as a*(1, (√2)/λ, 1) → so the eigenvectors are in terms of a and λ.

Now, to find λ, we can use the fact that the vector must be an eigenvector and satisfy the equation.

But perhaps it's easier to substitute a = c into the first equation.

Wait, alternatively, since a = c, let's substitute into equation (2):

(a + a)/√2 = λ b → 2a/√2 = λ b → a√2 = λ b → b = (a√2)/λ.

So the eigenvector is [a, (a√2)/λ, a]^T.

This vector must satisfy the original equations, so perhaps we can substitute back into equation 1 or 3, but those have already been accounted for.

We can now write the eigenvector as a linear combination of [1, (√2)/λ, 1]^T.

Now, the vector must also be a solution to the equation P v = λ v.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to look for possible eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess that the eigenvectors might be symmetric and have certain patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find another approach. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the trace of P, which is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. The sum of the eigenvalues is zero. So the eigenvalues are 0, and the sum of the other two eigenvalues must be zero. So the other two eigenvalues must be ± something.

Wait, earlier when I tried expanding the determinant, I thought the characteristic equation was -λ (λ² - 1/2) = 0, giving eigenvalues 0, sqrt(1/2), and -sqrt(1/2).

But wait, let me recompute the determinant correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the expansion. Let me try expanding the determinant again.

The matrix P - λ I is:

Row 1: -λ, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, -λ

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

So:

-λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] - (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ] + 0

= -λ (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 )

Simplify each term.

First term: -λ^3 + (λ/2 )

Second term: (1/√2)(-λ/√2) → wait, no, it's - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) → that's positive λ/(2)

So putting it all together:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2 ) = 0 → 

-λ^3 + λ = 0 → 

λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → 

λ (1 - λ² ) =0 → 

Solutions: λ =0, λ=1, λ= -1.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Hmm. So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, that makes more sense because the trace of P is zero, and the sum of the eigenvalues is zero. 0 +1 + (-1) =0. So that works.

Wait, but wait, earlier when I tried expanding, I thought the determinant gave me -λ (λ² -1/2)=0, but perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

So let's recompute the determinant correctly.

The determinant expansion along the first row:

= (-λ) * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] )
- (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] )
+ 0 * det( ... )

So let's compute each minor.

First minor (element (1,1)): 

det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) 
= (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) 
= λ² - (1/2)

Second minor (element (1,2)): 

det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] )
= (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0)
= -λ/√2 

So putting it all together:

= (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) + 0 

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ³ + (λ/2)

Second term: - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2 ) → which is (1/√2)(λ/√2) ) → λ/(2)

So the entire determinant is:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) 

= -λ³ + λ 

Set equal to zero:

-λ³ + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) =0 → λ (1 -λ² )=0 → λ =0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0,1,-1.

Ah, okay, so earlier I messed up the calculation. The eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

So when the question says the observable P's measurement will yield 0, that's one of the eigenvalues. So the probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to 0, in the given state.

Wait, but wait, the state vector given is [-1, 2, 1]^T. But earlier I thought it wasn't normalized, so I need to normalize it first.

So first, normalize the state.

The given state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1; 2; 1 ]

The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is |ψ_normalized⟩ = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ]

Now, the observable P has eigenvalue 0 with eigenvector(s) in the direction [1, 0, -1], as we found earlier.

Wait, from case 1, when λ=0, the eigenvectors are of the form [a, 0, -a]^T. So any vector proportional to [1, 0, -1] is an eigenvector for λ=0.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is spanned by [1,0,-1]^T.

So to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to compute the projection of |ψ_normalized⟩ onto this eigenspace.

The projection amplitude is the inner product of |ψ_normalized⟩ with the eigenvector.

So let's compute the amplitude:

⟨v | ψ_normalized ⟩ where v is [1, 0, -1]^T.

⟨v | = [1, 0, -1]

|ψ_normalized⟩ = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ]

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) [1* (-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ] = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1 + 0 -1 ] = (1/sqrt(6))* (-2) = -2/sqrt(6)

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude.

So | -2/sqrt(6) |² = (4)/(6) )= 2/3.

Wait, but wait, that's 4/6 = 2/3. So the probability is 2/3.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 2/3

B) 1

C)1/3

D) sqrt(2/3)

So the correct answer would be option A) 2/3.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.

1. State vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. Norm is sqrt(6), so normalized to (1/sqrt(6)) * state.

2. P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.

3. For eigenvalue 0, eigenvectors are [a, 0, -a]^T. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T, because [1,0,-1] has norm sqrt(1+0+1)=sqrt(2).

4. Compute the inner product between |ψ_normalized⟩ and this eigenvector.

⟨eigenvector | ψ_normalized⟩ = [1/sqrt(2)] [1, 0, -1] · [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]

Dot product: (1)(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1)(1/sqrt(6)) = (-1/sqrt(6)) - (1/sqrt(6)) ) = -2/sqrt(6).

The amplitude is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-2/sqrt(6)) )= (-2)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )= (-2)/sqrt(12) )= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3)

Wait, wait, I think I messed up a step. Oh no, wait: the eigenvector for λ=0 is [1,0,-1], and its normalized form is 1/sqrt(2) [1,0,-1].

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] · (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) [ (1)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)(1) ]

= (1/(sqrt(12))) [ -1 + 0 -1 ]

= (1/(2*sqrt(3))) ) * (-2)

= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )

= -1/sqrt(3)

So the amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), and the probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/3).

Wait a minute, that's different from before. So what's wrong here?

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the normalization of the eigenvector.

Wait, earlier I thought the eigenvector for λ=0 is [1, 0, -1], which has a norm of sqrt(1+0+1)=sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1].

The state vector is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] · (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ]

= (1/(sqrt(12))) [ -1 + 0 -1 ]

= (1/(2*sqrt(3))) ) * (-2)

= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3)

The amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), so the probability is [ (-1/sqrt(3)) ]^2 = 1/3.

Wait, this contradicts what I thought earlier, so I must have made a mistake in the eigenvector's normalization.

Wait, no, I think I messed up in the calculation of the projection. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the eigenvector for λ=0 is [1,0,-1], and its normalized version is (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1]. 

The state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,2,1].

The inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1] · (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,2,1].

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) [ (1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) ]

= (1/(sqrt(12))) [ -1 + 0 -1 ]

= (1/(2*sqrt(3))) * (-2) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought the inner product gave me -2/sqrt(6), which when squared would be 4/6=2/3. But that was without considering the normalization of the eigenvector.

Ah, that's where I made the mistake. I forgot to normalize the eigenvector when computing the inner product.

So the correct probability is 1/3, which is option C. But wait, earlier when I computed the inner product between the non-normalized state and the non-normalized eigenvector, I got (-2)/sqrt(6), but that's not considering the normalization factors.

So the correct probability is 1/3. So the answer would be option C.


The state of the system is given as the column vector \((-1, 2, 1)^T\). To proceed, the state must be normalized. The norm of the state is calculated as:

\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The observable \(P\) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the probability of measuring \(0\) for \(P\), we first determine the eigenvalues of \(P\). Solving the characteristic equation \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\), the eigenvalues are found to be \(0, 1, -1\). The eigenvalue \(0\) corresponds to the eigenvector \([1, 0, -1]^T\), which can be normalized to:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \(0\) is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \(|\psi\rangle\) onto \(|v\rangle\). The projection is calculated as:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} \left[ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \cdot (-2) = \frac{-2}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
|\langle v | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \(0\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

**Critical analysis of options:**
- **A) \(2/3\):** Incorrect. This would correspond to the probability if the eigenvector were not normalized.
- **B) \(1\):** Incorrect. This would imply certainty, which is not the case.
- **C) \(1/3\):** Correct. Matches the calculated probability.
- **D) \(\sqrt{2/3}\):** Incorrect. This is not the probability but the square root of a related quantity.

ANSWER: C
