Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's start by reading it carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, molecular symmetry groups, right. So I think I need to figure out what E is, then determine its molecular structure symmetry.

Let me parse the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so A + 8B → C. What could this be? I remember that when metals react with halogens, sometimes they form compounds. For example, sodium (Na) reacts with chlorine (Cl2) to form NaCl. But wait, sodium is a metal, and chlorine is a diatomic gas. If A is a metal, and B is a diatomic halogen, then the reaction ratio is important. So 8 equivalents of B imply that each molecule of A reacts with 8 molecules of B. Hmm, maybe A is a metal with a +2 charge, and B is a halogen with -1 each? So, for each A, 8 B would give A(B)_8. But wait, what's a compound with a metal and 8 halogens? Oh, maybe something like octane? No, that's not right. Wait, maybe A is a transition metal. Oh, wait, wait, I remember something about phosphorus reacting with chlorine. Wait, phosphorus in its +5 oxidation state forms PCl5. But that's five chlorines. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur. Sulfur reacts with something else? Or maybe A is a transition metal that forms an octahedral complex.

Wait, the product C is bright red. Bright red in chemistry often makes me think of things like rubies or certain metal compounds. Oh! Maybe C is a compound like CuO? No, that's black. Wait, another thought: when metals like sodium or potassium react violently with halogens, maybe they form something like NaCl, but in a different stoichiometry. Wait, but in the first reaction, it's 8 equivalents of B. So if A is, say, a metal with valency +2, and B is a diatomic halogen, each B molecule contributes one atom, so maybe each B molecule is a diatomic like Cl2. So 8 equivalents would mean 4 Cl2 molecules? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the reaction is A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C. So if B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would be 8 moles of Cl2. But each mole of Cl2 has 2 moles of Cl atoms. Hmm, so each A reacts with 8 Cl2 molecules? That would give a formula like ACl16? That seems extreme. Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal with a higher oxidation state.

Wait, another angle: bright red product. What compounds are bright red? Maybe something like Fe(OH)3 is reddish-brown. Or perhaps it's a chromium compound. Wait, another thought: maybe C is a metal chloride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound like C60, but that doesn't fit here. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me
