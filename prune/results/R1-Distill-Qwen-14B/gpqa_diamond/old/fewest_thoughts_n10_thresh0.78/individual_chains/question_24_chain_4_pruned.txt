Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem involves various mixtures and reactions, so I'll need to break it down. Let me jot down the key points as I understand them.

First, there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water. I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has unsaturation, like alkenes or alkynes, which can react with Br2. So X probably contains alkenes or similar compounds.

Next, when X is treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, it undergoes a reaction that forms another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. Importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So the products from X after Pt treatment are saturated, maybe? Because if they don't react with bromine, they don't have double bonds anymore.

Then, both mixtures X and Y undergo hydrogenation in the presence of Pt under severe conditions. The result is only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Oh wait, I can calculate the hydrogen percentage. Let me think: 14.28% is roughly 1/7. Because 1/7 is approximately 14.29%. So if the mass is 100, the hydrogen is 14.28g. 

To find the molecular formula of Z, let's do some calculations. Let's assume Z is CnH2m. The molar mass would be (12n + 2m). The mass of H is 2m * 1 g/mol. So the mass fraction (H%) is (2m / (12n + 2m)) * 100 = 14.28%. 

Let me set up the equation: (2m)/(12n + 2m) = 0.1428 (which is 1/7). Multiply both sides by denominator: 2m = (12n + 2m) * (1/7). Multiply both sides by 7: 14m = 12n + 2m. Subtract 2m: 12m =12n → m =n. So the formula is CnH2n. That suggests Z is an alkene or alkyne, but wait, no, because when Z is hydrogenated further, it doesn't react. Wait, but wait, the problem says hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z, which doesn't react further. So Z must be fully saturated, meaning it's a single bond compound, like an alkane.

Wait, wait, but if Z is an alkane, then its formula would be CnH2n+2. But earlier calculation suggests it's CnH2n. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck. 

Wait, the hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z. So X and Y must have multiple bonds that are hydrogenated. So Z is the fully saturated product. So perhaps X and Y have double or triple bonds, and upon hydrogenation, become alkanes. 

Wait, but the mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which we saw leads to CnH2n. But that's a double bond. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think about possible hydrocarbons. Let's assume Z is an alkane: CnH2n+2. Let's compute (2n+2)/(12n + 2n +2) ) ×100 =14.28%. 

Let me set up the equation: (2n+2)/(14n +2) ) = 0.1428. Multiply both sides by denominator: 2n+2 = 0.1428*(14n +2).
