Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations.

The question gives me some information about each spectrograph's brightness limits. From what I read, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait—wait, the question says 'brighter than 17 mag' can be observed. Oh, wait, magnitude is a bit counterintuitive. Lower numbers are brighter, higher magnitudes are dimmer. So 'brighter than 17' would mean apparent V magnitude less than 17, right? Because the scale runs from low (bright) to high (dim). So if a star has V mag less than 17, it's bright enough for ESPRESSO.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So stars with V mag less than 16 are within HIRES' capabilities. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) and also less than 16 (for HIRES). Wait no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh wait, no—brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star's V mag is brighter than 17, that means its V mag is less than 17. Because higher magnitude is fainter. So, for instance, apparent V mag =16 is brighter than 17. So for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag ≤17 can be observed. For HIRES, stars with V mag ≤16 can be observed. So the star needs to have an apparent V mag ≤16 to be detected by both, because if it's >16, HIRES can't see it, and if it's >17, ESPRESSO can't see it either. Wait, no. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, and HIRES up to 16. So the overlapping range is up to 16. So any star with apparent V mag ≤16 can be observed by both. So that's the key.

Now, let's look at each star and compute their apparent V magnitudes. Wait, but wait. Some of the stars give us absolute magnitude and distance, so we can calculate apparent magnitude using the distance modulus.

Let's go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag (Mv) =15.5, distance d =10 pc. The distance modulus is M - m = 5 log(d/10). So d=10, d/10=1, log(1)=0. So M-m =0 → m = M =15.5. So apparent V mag is 15.5.
