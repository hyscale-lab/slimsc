Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when dihalides react with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction (like elimination), they form alkenes. Since it's 1,3-dibromo, the elimination would probably form something like an alkene between the two bromines. But wait, adamantane's structure is a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure; it's quite rigid. So in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two bromines are on adjacent positions in a ring? Or maybe on different bridges? I'm not entirely sure, but I think the product after KOH would be an adamantene with a double bond. Because KOH, being a strong base, would cause elimination (E2 mechanism), so removing two H's and the two bromides to form a double bond.

The product after KOH is a light yellow solid. The NMR data is given: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and IR at 1720 cm-1. Wait, the IR has a peak around 1720, which is typical for a carbonyl (C=O) group. But wait, the initial reaction is elimination, so if it's an alkene, where's the carbonyl coming from? Oh, wait
