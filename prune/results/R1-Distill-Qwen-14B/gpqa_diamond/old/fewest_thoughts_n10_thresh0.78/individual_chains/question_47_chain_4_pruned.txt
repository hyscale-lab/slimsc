Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

The data given includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's start by looking at the IR. They mention strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks around 3300 usually indicate N-H stretching, like in amines or amides. But wait, sometimes O-H from carboxylic acids can also show up there, but those are usually broader and might be a single peak. So maybe it's N-H. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Carbonyls in esters, amides, ketones, etc., show up around there. Esters are usually around 1730-1750, but if it's conjugated, maybe a bit lower. Amides have lower carbonyl peaks, like around 1650 maybe? Hmm.

Now the NMR. Let's break it down. The 1H NMR shows:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.2 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in ethyl groups.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, integrating to 2H. Aromatic protons usually aren't this upfield, but maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, could it be an oxygen-bearing CH2, like an OCH2? Wait, but that's around 3.5-4.5 usually. But the broadness might indicate exchange with something, like an amine? Or maybe it's a methylene next to an oxygen, but that's usually a triplet or quartet if part of an ethyl group. Or perhaps it's an NH group, but that's usually not seen as a singlet unless it's in a different environment.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, integrating to 2H. A quartet often comes from a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, like in ethyl groups. So maybe this is part of an ethyl ester. The quartet around 4.5 ppm is common for the CH2 in an ethyl ester. Like, for example, in ethyl acetate, the CH2COO would be around 4.1, but maybe if it's more deshielded, like in a benzoate ester, it could be upfield or downfield. Wait, I think in ethyl benzoate, the CH2 is around 4.3 ppm as a quartet.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): These are doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic
