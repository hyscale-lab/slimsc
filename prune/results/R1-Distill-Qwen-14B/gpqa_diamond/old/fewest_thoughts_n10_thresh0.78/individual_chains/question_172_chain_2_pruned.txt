Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atomic energy levels can be described using the Boltzmann equation. 

The question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. So I need to relate this to the effective temperatures of the two stars, T1 and T2.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E_i and E_j are the energies, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference delta E is E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. The problem says that in star 1, the excitation is twice that of star 2. So, the ratio of the populations for star 1 is n1_i/n1_j = 2. For star 2, it's n2_i/n2_j = 1, assuming the same E difference. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: the ratio given is for the same energy difference, so for each star, we can write their own ratios.

Wait, no, star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's. So for star_1, (n_i/n_j) = 2 * (n_i/n_j)_star2. But each star's ratio depends on their own temperature.

Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars because they're the same atoms, so g_i/g_j would be same for both. So the ratio (n_i/n_j) is proportional to exp( - delta E/(k*T) ).

So for star_1: (n1_i/n1_j) = exp( - delta E/(k*T1) )

For star_2: (n2_i/n2_j) = exp( - delta E/(k*T2
