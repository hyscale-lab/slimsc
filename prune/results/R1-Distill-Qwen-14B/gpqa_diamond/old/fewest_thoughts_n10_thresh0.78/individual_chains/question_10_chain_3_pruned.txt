Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which exoplanet has the highest density among the options given. Let me think this through step by step.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing different planets. I need to compare their densities.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So the formula is density = mass/volume. Volume for a sphere is (4/3)πr³. But for exoplanets, I might not need to calculate the exact volume each time; perhaps I can use relative comparisons.

Looking at each option:

Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So this planet's density would be 5.5. I'll keep that in mind.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the density is given directly here. So that's 5.5. But wait, why would a 2-Earth mass planet have the same density as Earth? Because if mass doubles but density stays same, then volume must double. Because mass is density times volume. So if mass doubles and density same, volume doubles. Since Earth's volume is (4/3)πR³, doubling the mass with same density would mean radius is cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. But I don't think that affects the density; the density is given here, so this planet's density is 5.5.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Hmm, same composition as Earth would mean same density because composition determines density. So Earth's density is about 5.5. If this planet is more massive but same density, then its mass = density * volume. So the density here should be the same as Earth's, right? Because composition is same, so density doesn't change. So option c's density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition, so same density. So density is 5.5. So all options a, c, d have density 5.5, and b also has 5.5. Wait, but that can't be right because the question asks which has the highest. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Let me read the options again.

Option b says a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. So its density is given as 5.5. So all four options have the same density? Then why is the question asking which has the highest? That can't be the case. So perhaps I misunderstood the options.

Wait, maybe looking again:

Option a is Earth mass and Earth radius. So same as Earth, so density is 5.5.

Option b has 2 Earth masses, but is the volume same? Wait, no. If the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5, then the volume would be (2 * Earth mass) / 5.5. But I think the option says that the planet's density is approximately 5.5. So if that's the case, then yes, density is 5.5.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is asking which has the highest density
