Okay, so I've just landed this job at a structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The PI gave me the amino acid sequence, and I have four plasmids to choose from. Hmm, I need to figure out which plasmid has the correct DNA sequence to produce this protein. 

Wait, let me think. The plasmids are options A, B, C, D. They all have long DNA sequences, so I should compare them. But how?

I remember that when expressing proteins in E. coli, the plasmid must have the correct reading frame and appropriate start and stop codons. Also, E. coli uses the bacterial machinery, so the plasmid should be in a compatible vector, probably with a T7 promoter since BL21 strains often require T7 RNA polymerase for expression. But the question is about the sequence given in the options, not the vector features, I think.

Oh wait, the question is about which plasmid's DNA sequence corresponds to the given amino acid sequence. So I need to find the one that when translated would produce the correct protein.

Let me think about the DNA sequence. The amino acid sequence starts with Methionine (M), which is the start codon. So the DNA should start with ATG. Looking at all options, they all start with ATG, so that's not it.

The next part is the rest of the coding sequence. Each codon in the DNA is read as triplet nucleotides, and the mRNA is complementary to the DNA. So the DNA sequence in the plasmid is the coding strand, same as mRNA, except T instead of U. 

Wait, no. Wait, the DNA is double-stranded. The plasmid has a sequence that's the same as the mRNA except T for U. So when looking at the DNA, the coding strand is the same as the mRNA, except for T/U.

So to get the amino acid sequence, I can read the DNA in triplets, in the same direction as the mRNA. So if the DNA is given as the coding strand (which all these options seem to present), then each triplet corresponds to a codon.

But wait, the given amino acid sequence is quite long. I can't compare every triplet. Maybe I can find a unique part in the amino acid sequence and check the DNA in the options.

Let me scan the amino acid sequence for something distinctive. Looking at the beginning: MEEPQSDPSVEPPLSQETFSDLWKLLPENNVLSPLPSQAMDDLMLSPDDIEQWFTEDPGPDEAPRMPEAAPPVAPAPAAPTPAAPAPAPSWPLSSSVPSQKTY...

Hmm, I notice that there's a 'P53' in the middle, but that's probably part of the protein name, not the actual sequence. Alternatively, perhaps looking for specific motifs or longer sequences.

Wait, maybe looking for the stop codon. The protein likely ends with a stop codon, but the given amino acid sequence doesn't show one. Wait, actually, from the options, the DNA sequences end at various points. Let me check.

In the amino acid sequence, the last part is ...YNYMCNSSCMGGMNRRPILTIITLEDSSGNLLGRNSFEVRVCACPGRDRRTEEENLRKKGEPHHELPPGSTKRALPNNTSSSPQPKKKPLDGEYFTLQIRGRERFEMFRELNEALELKDAQAGKEPGGSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKKLMFKTEGPDSD.

Wait, does it end with a stop codon? The given amino acid sequence ends with D, so the DNA sequence should end with the appropriate triplet. Let's look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ends with ...AGACTGA
Option B: Ends with ...AGACTGA
Option C: Ends with ...AGACTGA
Option D: Ends with ...AGACTGA

Wait, that all end with AGACTGA. Wait, let me check each option's end.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the stop codon in the DNA. The stop codons are TAA, TAG, or TGA in DNA (the coding strand). So looking for these in the last part of the DNA sequences.

Looking at the end of each option:

Option A: ...ATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA

Option B: ...ATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA

Option C: same as A and B? Wait, the user provided the options, but the way they're presented is a bit confusing. Let me check each option's full sequence.

Wait, looking at the user's input, the options are all nearly identical except for some parts. Let me check.

Option A: the last part is ...ATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA
So the last few bases are ACTGA. So the last codons are GAC and AGA? Wait, wait, no: the last triplet would be AGA, which is a stop codon in DNA? Wait, AGA in DNA is a stop? No, wait, stop codons in DNA are TAA, TAG, TGA. So if the DNA ends with TGA, that would be a stop. Looking at the end of the options:

Option A: the last few letters are ACTGA. So the last triplet is CTG? Wait, no, let's see. Let me count.

Wait, the very end of option A is ...C
