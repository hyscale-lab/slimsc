Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think through what I know.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25Â°C. The formation constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, so I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant K is a measure of how strong this complex is.

Wait, the formation constant, K, is for the reaction where EDTA (Y^4-) binds with Ca^2+ to form the complex. The formula for the formation constant is K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]). Right, that's the expression I need.

But in this solution, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Since it's a 1:1 complex (each Ca^2+ binds one EDTA), the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But I need to find [Ca^2+], the concentration of free calcium ions.

I think the assumption is that the solution is in equilibrium, so the K is given. So I can set up the equation using K.

So K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, I might not know [Y^4-], the concentration of free EDTA. Oh, but wait, the problem states that the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But what about the free EDTA?

Hmm, in such cases, if the formation constant is very large (like 5e10), the complex is very stable. That means a lot of the EDTA is bound to Ca, so the free EDTA concentration would be very low. Similarly, the free Ca^2+ ions would also be very low because they form the complex readily.

Wait, no, the formation constant is so large that the complex is favored.
