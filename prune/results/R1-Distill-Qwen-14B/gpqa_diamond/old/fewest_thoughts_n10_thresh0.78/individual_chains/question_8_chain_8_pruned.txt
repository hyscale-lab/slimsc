Okay, so I've got this genetics question in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the scenario is that someone did an experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance against anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). 

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor that acts upstream of other genes. They tested the mutants' resistance to anthracnose. The resistance levels are given as percentages of the wild-type (control). The higher the percentage, the more resistant the plant is. So 100% is wild-type resistance, 75% is less, etc.

The results are:
- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

And the question is about figuring out the interaction among these genes. The options are A to D, each making different claims about which is the transcription factor, if there's pleiotropy, redundancy, and which gene is epistatic to another.

First, I need to understand what each term means here. 

Transcription factor: a gene that regulates the expression of other genes. So if G2 is the transcription factor, it might be upstream, controlling G1 and G3. Or maybe another configuration.

Epistasis: when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So gene A is epistatic to gene B if the phenotype of B depends on A. Like, if you have a mutation in gene A, the effect of gene B's mutation isn't seen.

Pleiotropy: when one gene affects multiple traits. But in this context, I think it might refer to the same gene affecting the resistance in multiple ways. Or perhaps, it's about the effect of a mutation in one gene on multiple others.

Gene redundancy: when two or more genes have overlapping functions. So knocking out both may have a more severe effect than either alone.

So looking at the data:

Wild-type is 100%, so higher resistance. The knockouts:

g1: 75% – so less resistant than WT.
g2: 0% – completely susceptible.
g3: 50% – less than WT.

Double mutants:

g1g2: 0% – same as g2.
g1g3:10% – much worse than either g1 or g3 alone.
g2g3:0% – same as g2, so maybe g3 doesn't matter if g2 is mutated.

Hmm. Let's think about the effect of each mutation. 

g2 is completely knocked out, leading to 0% resistance. So the plant is highly susceptible. That suggests that G2 is critical for resistance. If G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would disable the regulation of downstream genes, leading to lower resistance.

Looking at the double mutants: 

g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is same as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G3's function is downstream of G2. Because if G3 were upstream, then the double mutant might have a different phenotype. Or if G3 were redundant, perhaps not.

Wait, no. Let's think: If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G3, then in the absence of G2 (g2), G3 isn't expressed. So the single g3 mutant might have lower resistance if G3 contributes, but the double mutant (g2g3) wouldn't be worse than g2 because G3 isn't active anyway. That's what's happening here: g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So that could mean that G3's function is only active when G2 is present.

Similarly, looking at g1g2: 0% resistance. That's the same as g2. So maybe G1's function is also downstream of G2. Because when both are knocked out, you don't get any worse than when just G2 is knocked out.

Wait, but what about g1? The single g1 mutant has 75% resistance. So it's partially resistant. Then, when g1 is combined with g2, the resistance drops to 0%. So that suggests that G1's function is only important when G2 is present. Alternatively, G1 is downstream of G2. Because when G2 is knocked out, G1's function doesn't matter anymore.

Wait, but in the case where G2 is upstream of G1, then knocking out G2 would mean G1 isn't expressed either. But in that case, the single mutant g1 would not express G1
