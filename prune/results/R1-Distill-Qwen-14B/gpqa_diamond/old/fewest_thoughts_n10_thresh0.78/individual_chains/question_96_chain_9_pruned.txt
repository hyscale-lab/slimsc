Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my black hole thermodynamics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon is θ=10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d=10^10 parsecs. I remember that the event horizon's size relates to the black hole's mass, and entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon. Oh right, the formula for entropy S is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area. But wait, I might have the constants wrong. Alternatively, I think I've heard that the entropy is proportional to the area in Planck units, so maybe I can just calculate the area and then relate it to entropy.

Wait, the first step is to find the radius of the event horizon. The angular size θ is given, so I can use the formula θ ≈ R / d, where R is the radius and d is the distance. But wait, θ is in degrees, and I need to convert it to radians because the formula for small angles is in radians. Right, so θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). But for very small angles, like 1e-17 degrees, the approximation θ ≈ R/d should still hold because the angle is tiny, so maybe I can ignore the curvature of the universe or something. So yeah, R ≈ d * θ_rad.

But wait, no, wait. The formula I remember is θ (in radians) ≈ R / d. So R ≈ d * θ. But I need to convert θ from degrees to radians. Let's calculate θ_rad.

θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees. So θ_rad = (1e-17) * (π/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Close enough for an approximation.

So R ≈ d * θ_rad. d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, what's a parsec in meters? I think 1 parsec is approximately 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = d * θ_rad = 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad ≈ 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19. Let's compute that.

3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 = (3.086 *1.745) * 1e(26-19) = approximately 5.375 * 1e7 = 5.375e7 meters. So R ≈ 5.375e7 meters, which is about 5.375e4 kilometers. Wait, that's about 53,750 km. Hmm, seems plausible for a supermassive black hole. Wait, but wait, I thought the Schwarzschild radius R_s is about 2.95e5 km per solar mass. So if R is 5e4 km, that's about R_s ≈ 2e5 km would mean mass is roughly R/(2.95e5 km) * solar mass. Wait, but maybe I don't need the mass for this problem. Because we can directly compute the area from R.

The area A of the event horizon is 4π R^2. So let's compute that. R is 5
