Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. It's about the Michael addition reactions, which I remember involves enolates reacting with alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Let me go through each part carefully.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to determine the major products for each and match them with the options provided.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. I think NaOEt is a base, so it would deprotonate the alpha position of the malonate to form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, so dimethyl malonate is a good dienolate precursor because it's a symmetric diester. When deprotonated, it forms a strong enolate. The acrylate has a structure like CH2=CH-p-tolyl, but wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CHCO-OCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is at the 3 position. So it's more like CH2=CH-p-tolyl? Wait, perhaps it's the structure where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is at carbon 3. So maybe it's something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the structure could be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. So the double bond is between the alpha and beta carbons, with the p-tolyl group on the beta position.

When the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks, it would add to the beta carbon. Since the enolate is a strong nucleophile, it would add to the less substituted position? Or wait, the Michael addition is a conjugate addition, so the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be: I think the correct structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the 3-position would be where? Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, that would make the double bond between the two middle carbons. Wait, perhaps it's the structure where the substituent is on the end. So, the molecule is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. So the double bond is between the first and second carbon, with the p-tolyl group on the second carbon, and the CO-OCH3 on the third.

So during the Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon (the second carbon) of the acrylate. The enolate would add to the beta position, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

The product would then form
