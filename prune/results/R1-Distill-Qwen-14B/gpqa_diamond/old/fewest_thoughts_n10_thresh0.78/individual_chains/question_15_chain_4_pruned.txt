Okay, so I’ve got this question here about exoplanets and the transit method. I’m a bit rusty on my exoplanet detection methods, but I’ll try to think this through step by step.

The question says that researchers want to choose between observing Planet_1 and Planet_2 to detect transits. They have limited time, so they need to pick the one with the higher probability of transiting. Both planets were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Both planets have the same mass.
- Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 / 3.
- Both have circular orbits.
- The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2*M2.
- Both host stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but they have same radii.

The question is about the transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the relative sizes of the planet's orbit and the star. The formula for the transit probability (P) is:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet

Wait, no, wait. I think the exact formula is (R_star / a_planet) assuming the planet's size is negligible compared to the star. Oh, right, because the transit occurs when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. The probability is higher when the star is smaller relative to the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, wait. The probability is actually given by (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (some function of the inclination), but I think the main factor is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, the formula I remember is:

P = (R_star / a_planet) * (R_planet / R_star) ?

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit. Or wait, no, it's more like the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective.

The actual formula for the transit probability is
