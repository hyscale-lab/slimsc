Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is also provided, and I need to determine the product after reacting it with a series of reagents. The options are A to D, each a different compound.

First, I'll look at the NMR data. The peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, I'm trying to recall what each of these might represent. The 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet. That's a high chemical shift, maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm, and the triplet suggests coupling with two protons. Wait, but aldehydes typically only have one proton, so maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde or part of a conjugated system?

Looking at the other peaks: the 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating to 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. If they're doublets, they might be para-substituted aromatic rings. The splitting could be due to coupling between adjacent protons, but since each is a doublet, maybe each is a pair of equivalent protons on a benzene ring. So perhaps two para-substituted benzene rings? Or maybe one benzene ring with substituents in such a way that each set of protons is a doublet.

Then there's the 6.27 ppm peak, a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton, but the integration is 2H. Or maybe it's an enol or something else? Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton in a conjugated system, but I'm not sure yet.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet of 2H. That's likely an OCH2 group. Because the shift is around 3.6, which is typical for CH2 groups attached to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. The fact that it's a doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Maybe it's part of a propene system, like an allyl group attached to oxygen?

Putting this together, I'm thinking the compound might have an aromatic ring, perhaps with two substituents, maybe another group attached. The OCH2 group could be part of a chain connected to another aromatic ring.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. So here:

C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be two benzene rings (each has three double bonds, so that's 6, but wait, but we have only five. Wait, maybe one benzene ring and a double bond somewhere else. Or perhaps a benzene ring, a ring plus a double bond, etc.

Wait, let's recount. 8 carbons. The formula could be something like a benzene ring with some substituents. Let's think: benzene (6 carbons, three double bonds) plus a chain of two more carbons. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzene is C6H6. So the substituent would be C2H3NO. Hmm, but that's a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a propenyl group or something similar. Or maybe it's a phenyl group attached to a ketone, but that would require more oxygens.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group
