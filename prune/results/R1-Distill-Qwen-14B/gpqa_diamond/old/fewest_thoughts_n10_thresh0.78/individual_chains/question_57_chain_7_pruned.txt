Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem gives me phase shifts δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, and δ4 as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. And it says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. I'm supposed to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the direction of the incident beam.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using partial waves. The general formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(k)) * Σ ( (2l + 1) exp(iδ_l) sinδ_l / (1 + exp(2iδ_l)) ) * e^{i(l(θ - π/2 - something))} ), but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think.

Oh right! The scattering amplitude f is given by the sum over all angular momentum states l. For each l, there's a term (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (1 + e^{2iδ_l}) multiplied by some spherical harmonics or Legendre polynomials, but wait, in this case, since we're looking along the incident beam direction, maybe θ is 0°? Because the incident beam direction is theta equals zero, right.

Wait, the direction along the beam would be theta equals zero. So for each l, the term would involve the Legendre polynomial Pl(cosθ), but θ is zero. Pl(1) is 1 for even l, and something else, but maybe for each l, the term simplifies because Pl(1) is 1. Hmm, but wait, I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, I remember that the real and imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts. There's a formula that says the imaginary part of f(θ=0) is (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sin(2δ_l) / (1 + cos(2δ_l)) ),
