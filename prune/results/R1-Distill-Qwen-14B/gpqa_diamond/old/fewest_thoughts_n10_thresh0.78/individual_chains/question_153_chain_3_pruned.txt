Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about the Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the products for three different reactions. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

First, let's break down the question. The problem describes three separate Michael addition reactions, labeled as (A), (B), and (C). Each reaction uses different starting materials and reagents, and I need to match the products to the options given.

Starting with reaction (A): The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with the reagent NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile here is usually an enolate.

Wait, so dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Let me visualize the structures.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH, right? So when deprotonated by a strong base like NaOEt, it forms an enolate. The enolate would have a negative charge on the central carbon. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the substituents in E configuration, but wait, no, wait. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure: CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)-CO-OCH3, because 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the CH2?

Wait, actually, the structure is CH2=CH- group attached to the acrylate. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the compound would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group perhaps on the middle carbon. Wait, no, the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the p-tolyl is on the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Alternatively, perhaps (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OOCCH3? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the correct structure.

Wait, the correct IUPAC name is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate part is CH2=CHCOO-, but the substituent is at position 3. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the substituent would be on the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2
