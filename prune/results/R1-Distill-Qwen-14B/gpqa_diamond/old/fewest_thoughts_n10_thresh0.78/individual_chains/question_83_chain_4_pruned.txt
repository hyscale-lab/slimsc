Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question is about titrating a weak acid with a strong base. Hmm, I remember that when you titrate, you're neutralizing the acid with the base until you reach the equivalence point.

So, the setup is: we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The questions are about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values.

Wait, first, I should figure out what's the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The concentration of acetic acid after dilution would be (volume1 * concentration1) / (volume1 + volume2). 

So, (20 * 0.05) / 40 = (1) / 40? Wait, 20 * 0.05 is 1 mmol? Wait, no, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Then, adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, total volume is 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, what's the volume needed for equivalence? The moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol (as calculated above). Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So 25% of the equivalence point. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH used. 

Wait, I think I need to calculate the pH at two points: one when 25% of the NaOH has been added, and another when 100% (equivalence) has been added.

Let me tackle each part step by step.

First, the pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0
