Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, that formula rings a bell. C3H6 can be either propene (an alkene) or propane (an alkane), but wait, the degree of unsaturation might help. For C3H6, the degree of unsaturation is 1 (since 2n+2 = 8 for n=3, actual H is 6, so 8-6=2, divided by 2 is 1). So, it's either a cyclopropane or an alkene. But in the context of bromination, which typically occurs via addition for alkenes, perhaps A is an alkene. So, Compound A is probably propene (CH2=CHCH3).

Then, Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of CCl4. Bromination with CCl4 usually refers to addition across a double bond. Propene (CH2=CHCH3) brominating would form 1,2-dibromopropane or maybe a different di-substituted product. Wait, no, wait, when an alkene reacts with bromine (Br2), it's an addition reaction. The bromine adds across the double bond. So propene would become 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3) or perhaps 1,1-dibromopropane if there's a preference for that? Wait, no, the addition is across the double bond, so the two Brs go on adjacent carbons. So B is CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, right? So adding Br2 would give CH2BrCHBrCH3. So yes, B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH typically causes elimination reactions. Since B is a vicinal dihalide (two bromines on adjacent carbons), the reaction with KOH (in alcohol) would lead to elimination of HBr and form an alkene again. So this is a dehydrohalogenation. The product C would be propene again? Or maybe a different alkene? Wait, but let's think about the structure. If B is CH2BrCHBrCH3, when it reacts with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, the structure of B: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So the two Brs are on the central carbon and the adjacent (but wait, no—wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, so each Br would be on adjacent carbons. So the structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Or perhaps CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and
