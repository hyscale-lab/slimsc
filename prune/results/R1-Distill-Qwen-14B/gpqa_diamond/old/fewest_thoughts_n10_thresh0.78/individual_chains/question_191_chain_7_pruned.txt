Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let's visualize that structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (a CH2OH group). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group but attached at the middle carbon. So, it's CH2-C(=CH2)-CH2? Or wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So, prop-1-en-2-yl is the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the attachment is at C2. So, it's CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C1 and C2. Oh, wait, no. Let me draw the structure. Prop-1-en-2-yl group: the main chain is three carbons, with the double bond from C1 to C2. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's CH2=CH-CH2- with the substituent on the middle carbon. Wait, no. The IUPAC name is prop-1-en-2-yl. So, the substituent is on C2, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2-)-something? Wait, no. Let me think again. The group is attached via the second carbon, and the double bond is between first and second. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2- where the attachment is at the central carbon. Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2
