Okay, so I have this question about ChIP-seq experiments and what happens when you change the fixation method. Hmm, I remember that ChIP-seq is used to find where transcription factors bind on the DNA. The experiment here used PFA-fixed samples with an antibody against IKAROS in human B cells. Then they did sequencing, and after all the standard steps like quality control, alignment, and peak-calling, they got some peaks. But when they used PFA plus DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. I need to figure out where these disappearing peaks are most likely located.

Wait, first, what's the difference between PFA fixation and PFA+DSG? I think PFA is paraformaldehyde, which cross-links proteins and DNA. But sometimes it's not enough, so they add something else. Oh right, DSG is a stronger crosslinker, like disuccinimide. So PFA+DSG probably makes the crosslinking more efficient. But how does that affect ChIP peaks?

ChIP-seq depends on the crosslinking being sufficient to preserve the interactions between proteins and DNA. If the crosslinking isn't strong enough, some of the targets might not be captured as effectively. So when you add DSG, maybe it enhances crosslinking, which could either improve or reduce the signal, depending on the situation.

Wait, but the peaks disappeared when using the stronger method. So why would that happen? Maybe the initial PFA alone didn't fix all the interactions, but the more thorough crosslinking with DSG made some regions inaccessible. Oh, right! Some regions of the genome are harder to reach for crosslinking. Like in areas with high nucleosome density or tightly packed chromatin, the antibodies might not bind as effectively once the chromatin is more crosslinked.

So the question is, where are these regions that become harder to access? Well, active promoters and enhancers are regions where the chromatin is more open. They are usually accessible because they're transcriptionally active, so the crosslinking should work better there. But wait, the peaks are disappearing when using the stronger crosslinker. So maybe these regions are more sensitive to the crosslinking. Or maybe the opposite?

Alternatively, maybe PFA alone is enough to crosslink, but when you add DSG, it crosslinks more, maybe leading to less DNA shearing or something. Wait, no, DSG is used in conjunction with PFA to improve crosslinking
