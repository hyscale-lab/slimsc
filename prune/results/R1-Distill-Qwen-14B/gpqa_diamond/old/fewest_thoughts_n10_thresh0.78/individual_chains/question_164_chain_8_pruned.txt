Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? The question is about figuring out which system is more massive based on their radial velocity (RV) data and their orbital periods.

Alright, let's read the question again. There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and the periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. The RV variations for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. We need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocities of the two stars are related to their masses. The more massive star will have a smaller velocity because it's closer to the center of mass. The less massive one moves faster. So the RV amplitudes are inversely proportional to their masses. Like, if one star is twice as massive, it'll have half the velocity amplitude of the other.

Wait, the formula for radial velocity semi-amplitude is something like K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_companion * sin i) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) * (1 + M_companion/M_primary)^(1/3) ) ) ). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way when considering both stars in the system.

Oh right, in a spectroscopic binary, the two stars' velocities are in a ratio inversely proportional to their masses. So if star A has mass M_A and velocity K_A, and star B has mass M_B and velocity K_B, then M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A. Because the center of mass equation is M_A * a_A = M_B * a_B, where a is the orbit radius. And since velocity is proportional to (2π a)/P, the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses.

So for system_1, the two RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. Let's say star A has 10, star B has 5. So M_A / M_B = 5/10 = 0.5. So M_A is half of M_B. The total mass of system_1 is M_A + M_B = 0.5 M_B + M_B = 1.5 M_B. So the system's mass is 1.5 times M_B.

Wait, but the question is about comparing system_1 to system_2. So let's do the same for system_2. Their RV amplitudes are 15 and 10. Let's say K1=15 and K2=10. Then M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 10/15 = 2/3. So M1 is two-thirds of M2. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2 ≈ 1.6667 M2.

But wait, wait. Let me think about this again. The way I did it, I assumed the first star (K1) is the more massive one because its velocity is smaller. Wait, no, because K is the velocity amplitude. So the star with smaller K is more massive. So in system_1, K_A is 10, K_B is 5. So K_B is smaller, so M_B is larger? Or wait, no: the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So, in system_1, the star with K=5 has larger mass. So M_B (5 km/s) is more massive than M_A (10 km/s). So M_A/M_B = 5/10 = 0.5. So M_B is twice M_A.

Wait, no, the ratio is M_A/M_B = K_B / K_A. So K_A is 10, K_B is 5. So M_A/M_B = 5/10 = 0.5. So M_A is half of M_B. So M_total for system_1 is M_A + M_B = 0.5 M_B + M_B = 1.5 M_B. So total mass is 1.5 times M_B, but M_B is the more massive star in system_1.

Wait, but then what's the mass function? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe we should think about the mass function for each system, which relates the observed velocities to the masses.

The mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2π G), but I'm not sure if I remember that correctly. Wait, the formula for the mass function is f(M) = ( (K1^3 P ) / (2π G) ) * ( (1 + q)^2 ), where q is the mass ratio M2/M1.

But perhaps a better approach is to relate the velocities to the masses. Let me think.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit the center of mass. So, M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a1 and a2 are the orbital radii. Also, the orbital period P is the same for both. The velocity of each star is v1 = 2π a1 / P, and v2 = 2π a2 / P.

So, M1 / M2 = a2 / a1 = v2 / v1. Because a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a_total and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) * a_total. So, a2/a1 = M1/M2. So, v2/v1 = (2π a2/P) / (2π a1/P) ) = a2/a1 = M1/M2. So, M1/M2 = v2 / v1.

Wait, that's the same as earlier. So for system_1: v1 is 10, v2 is 5. So M1/M2 = v2/v1 = 5/10=0.5. So M1 = 0.5 M2. So M_total = M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Similarly, for system_2, v1 is 15, v2 is 10. So M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. So M_total =
