Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime is given as 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer due to time dilation. So the lifetime observed in the lab frame (which is the chamber here) would be gamma times the proper lifetime. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Gamma equals total energy divided by rest mass energy. Oh, right, because E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). But since units here are in GeV and mass is in GeV/c², the units should work out when calculating gamma.

So first, I need to calculate gamma. The total energy E is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV/c². So gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.918. So gamma is about 7.918.

Next, the proper lifetime tau0 is 8e-16 seconds. So the observed lifetime tau would be gamma multiplied by tau0. So tau = 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 7.918 * 8 is around 63.344, so 63.344e-16 s, which is 6.3344e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait, the lifetime determines how far the particles travel before decaying. The decay length, L, would be velocity times tau. Velocity v is approximately the speed of light c for high-energy particles. So L = v * tau ≈ c * tau. c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.3344e-15 s. Let me compute that. 3e8 * 6.3344e-15 = 1.90032e-6 meters. So about 1.9e-6 meters.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think that refers to the fraction of decays that occur within the resolution. If the resolution is the distance the detector can distinguish, then the fraction is the ratio of the resolution to the average decay length. Because if the decay length is longer than the detector's resolution, the detector can't pinpoint the decay location accurately.

Wait, actually, no. The resolution is the precision of the measurement. So perhaps the decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The question is about the minimum resolution, which I think refers to the minimum precision (like the uncertainty in the position measurement) needed so that at least 30% of the decays are within that uncertainty. Or maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the opposite. The resolution is the ability to distinguish the decay point. So if the decay length is L, and the resolution is R, then if L is longer than R, the detector can't see the decay point accurately. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the decay probability within a certain length.

Wait, let's think about the decay length. The probability that a particle decays within a certain length x is P = 1 - e^(-x/L), where L is the mean decay length. So to have at least 30% decays (so P >= 0.3), we can set up the equation 1 - e^(-x/L) = 0.3. Solving for x: e^(-x/L) = 0.7 → -x/L = ln(0.7) → x = L * ln(1/0.7) → ln(1/0.7) is approximately 0.3567. So x ≈ 0.3567 L.

Wait, but wait, that would be the distance needed to capture 30% of the decays. But the resolution is the smallest feature you can observe. So if the decay length is L, then the minimum resolution R is such that R = 0.3567 L. Because if the particles are spread out over a longer distance than R, you wouldn't be able to resolve them.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the resolution is the uncertainty in the decay vertex, which would relate to the decay length. But I'm not sure. Let me think
