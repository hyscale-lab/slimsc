Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, the formula is density = mass/volume. But wait, volume is proportional to the cube of the radius, right? Because if the radius increases, the volume increases much more. So, density depends on both mass and size.

Looking at the options:

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known, right? It's about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet would have the same density as Earth.

Option b) has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's the same density as Earth. But if the mass is double, what about the radius? Let me think. Since density is mass over volume, and volume is (4/3)πr³, if density is the same, then if mass doubles, volume must also double. So the radius would be the cube root of (2) times Earth's radius. Because volume scales with r³, so if V is doubled, r is cube root of 2, which is about 1.26 times Earth's radius. So this planet is bigger but same density as Earth.

Option c) Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Composition matters because it affects how much mass is packed into a given volume. If the composition is same, I think the density would be same as Earth. Wait, but mass is 5 times Earth's. If the composition is same, the density remains same. So the radius would be larger, right? Because mass is proportional to radius cubed times density. So for same density, mass goes up by 5, radius goes up by cube root of 5. Cube root of 5 is about 1.71, so the radius would be 1.71 times Earth's. So this planet is more massive and larger, but same density as Earth.

Option d) Same composition as Earth but half the mass. So again, same density as Earth. Radius would be cube root of (0.5), which is about 0.79 Earth radii. So it's smaller than Earth but same density.

Wait, but the question is which has the highest density. So looking at all options, a, b, c, d all have
