Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when the system is measured.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So the full operator P is the vector operator, which means P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). Or wait, no, maybe it's P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z since n is a direction vector.

The direction vector n is in the x-z plane. So that means y-component of n is zero, right? Because the x-z plane is where y=0. So n must be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that? Wait, no, actually, direction vectors in the x-z plane can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z), but since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. Alternatively, it's often parametrized as (cosθ, 0, sinθ) or similar, but I'll get back to that.

The problem is asking for the normalized eigenvector of P with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I need to find a vector |ψ> such that P|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

Wait, but P is a vector operator, so it's actually the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vector. Oh right, because any vector operator in the direction n can be written as the sum of its components times the respective direction. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So first, I need to construct the matrix for the operator P. Once I have the matrix, I can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Since the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, I can set up the equation (P - (ħ/2)I)|v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix, and |v> is the eigenvector.

But wait, each P_x, P_y, P_z is given as (ħ/2) times a matrix. Let me write down each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the matrix for P_x is:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2)*[[0, -i],[i, 0]]

And P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the operator P is n · (P_x, P_y, P_z) = n_x P_x + n_z P_z because n_y =0.

So substituting in the matrices:

P = n_x (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0
