Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving σz and σx. The particle is in a specific superposition state. Hmm, right, expectation values are like the average you'd measure if you measured the observable many times on identically prepared systems.

So the state given is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Wait, but wait, I should check if the coefficients are normalized because probabilities must sum to 1. Let me compute 0.5 squared plus (√3/2) squared. 0.25 + (3/4) equals 1, so yes, it's normalized. Good.

The operator is 10σz +5σx. I think the expectation value of an operator is the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state. So ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

Breaking it down, the expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩. Because expectation values are linear, right. So I can compute each term separately.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, that should be straightforward. σz |↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩, and σz |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩.

The state ψ is a linear combination. So ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b=√3/2.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|²*(+1) + |b|²*(-1). Because each term in the superposition contributes |coeff|^2 times the corresponding eigenvalue.

So |a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and |b|^2 is (√3/2)^2 which is 3/4 = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Multiplying by 10 gives 10*(-0.5) = -5. But wait, no, the term is 10⟨σz⟩, so that's 10 * (-0.5) = -5? Wait, I think I'm mixing steps. Let me correct. The operator is 10σz, so its expectation is 10⟨σz⟩. So 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ and also introduces a phase. The eigenstates of σx are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But in our case, the state is in the σz basis. So perhaps it's easier to compute ⟨σx⟩ directly.

Alternatively, σx has matrix representation [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you apply σx to a state, it flips the spin. Let me compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Wait, since ψ is a|
