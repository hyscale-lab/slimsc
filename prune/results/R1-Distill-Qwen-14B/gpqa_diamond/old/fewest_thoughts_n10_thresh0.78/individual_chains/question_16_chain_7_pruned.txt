Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical activity has to do with chiral centers and the ability of a compound to rotate plane-polarized light. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. But wait, there are other possibilities too, like allenes or other structures that can cause chirality without a traditional chiral center.

Let me go through each compound one by one. 

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl is on C1, and C2 has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, but butene is four carbons. Let's think again. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, so it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another CH2 group. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Hmm, wait, no. Let me draw it.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would have Cl on the first carbon. 2-methyl would have a methyl on the second carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, but with a double bond. Oh wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So structure is Cl-C(H)=CH-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the
