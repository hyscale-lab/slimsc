Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativistic mechanics. Let's take a deep breath and tackle this step by step.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that a nucleus moves at 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So, lithium typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, since 3 protons +3 neutrons is 6 nucleons. So, the atomic number is 3, and the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

So, the goal is to find the total energy of each nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just its kinetic energy but also includes the rest mass energy. But wait, in particle accelerators, the energy usually refers to the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So I need to calculate the total energy, E = gamma * m * c².

But first, I need to find gamma (the Lorentz factor). Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that.

Let me calculate v²/c² first. (0.96c)^2 / c^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let me think. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me compute 1 divided by 0.28. 1 / 0.28 is the same as 100 / 28, which is approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus is roughly the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, minus the binding energy (mass defect), but wait, maybe it's easier to just look up the atomic mass. Alternatively, since the problem is about relativistic energy, perhaps we can approximate using the mass of a proton as the main component.

Wait, no. Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me think. Each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c². Neutrons are a bit heavier, around 940 MeV/c². So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 3*(93
