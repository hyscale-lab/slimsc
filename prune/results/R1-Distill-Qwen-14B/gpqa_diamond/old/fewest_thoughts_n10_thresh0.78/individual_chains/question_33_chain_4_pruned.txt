Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction involving 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione under heat. I need to find the exo product from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that cycloaddition reactions, especially [4+2] ones, are usually Diels-Alder reactions. Wait, Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile. So, which molecule is acting as the diene and which as the dienophile here?

2,5-dimethylthiophene is a thiophene ring with methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. Thiophene is aromatic, so it's a conjugated diene. Furan-2,5-dione, which is also known as 2,5-furandione, has two ketone groups. That structure probably makes it a good dienophile because the electron-withdrawing groups (the ketones) activate the molecule for the cycloaddition.

So, the diene here is 2,5-dimethylthiophene, and the dienophile is furan-2,5-dione. Since the reaction is happening under heat, I think it's a thermal process, which might influence the endo or exo transition state.

Wait, the product is the exo product. In Diels-Alder reactions, the endo rule suggests that the more substituted (endo) product is favored, but sometimes conditions can lead to exo. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Alternatively, maybe the exo product is determined by the transition state's structure.

The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring. The diene (thiophene) has two methyl groups, so when it reacts with the dione, the substituents would be in certain positions.

Let me sketch this mentally. The diene, 2,5-dimethylthiophene, is a conjugated diene. When it reacts with the dienophile (furan-2,5-dione), the dienophile's electron-deficient double bond would attack the diene. The endo transition state would have the substituents (like the ketones)
