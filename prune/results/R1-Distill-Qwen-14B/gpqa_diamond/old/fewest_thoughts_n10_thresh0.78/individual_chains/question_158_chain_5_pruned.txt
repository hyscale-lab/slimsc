Okay, so I've got this question about transcription factors and mutations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So, the question is about two different mutations in a transcription factor. Let me break it down.

First, the transcription factor has subunits that are inactive until a signal comes. This signal is from a phosphorylation cascade on the membrane. When the serine residues in the transactivation domain get phosphorylated, the subunit dimerizes, moves into the nucleus, and starts gene transcription.

Now, the first mutation is X, which is a missense mutation in the transactivation domain and is recessive, loss-of-function. So, I remember that recessive mutations typically require both alleles to be mutated to show the phenotype. Since it's a loss-of-function, the mutation probably messes up the phosphorylation site, so the subunit can't activate transcription when activated.

The second mutation is Y, a heterozygous mutation in the dimerization domain which acts as a dominant-negative. Dominant-negative means that even one copy can cause the protein to not function properly. So, I'm thinking that mutation Y probably disrupts the dimerization process.

The question is asking about the molecular phenotype when mutation Y is present. Let's look at the options.

Option A: change of protein conformation and gain-of-function. Wait, dominant-negative usually leads to loss of function, right? So gain-of-function doesn't make sense here. Plus, I don't think the mutation would change conformation in a way that helps. Probably not A.

Option B: protein degradation and loss of wild-type allele function. Hmm, degradation... I'm not sure if mutation Y causes the protein to be broken down. Dominant-negative might interfere with the function without necessarily degrading the protein. Also, wild-type allele's loss would imply that the mutation Y is causing the wild-type to not work, but I think Y is in the same protein. Maybe it's more about disrupting the function of the normal subunits.

Option C: loss of dimerization and wild-type phenotype. No, because if dimerization is lost, the transcription factor can't form the dimers needed for function. So the phenotype should be loss-of-function, not wild-type. So C doesn't make sense.

Option D: protein aggregation and loss-of-function. Aggregation could happen if the mutant subunit misfolds and forms clumps. Dominant-negative effects often cause this because the mutant version interferes with the normal subunits. So, if Y is in the dimerization domain, the mutant subunits might form aggregates, preventing proper dimer formation. This would inhibit the transcription factor from working, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. That fits with D.

Wait, let me think again. So the mutation Y is in the dimerization domain. The transcription factor subunits need to dimerize to function. If a mutation is dominant-negative, the mutant subunit can't form a proper dimer but might bind to wild-type subunits, preventing them from functioning. So the wild-type subunits can't form active dimers because some are tied up with the mutant ones. This would cause the overall function to be lost.

So, the mutant Y would cause the proteins to aggregate, perhaps, because the dimerization isn't working right, leading to misfolded proteins clustering. This would mean that the cells can't transcribe the necessary genes, hence loss-of-function.

Looking back at the options, D says protein aggregation and loss-of-function, which aligns with this reasoning.

So the correct answer should be D.


The question involves two mutations in a transcription factor subunit. Mutation X is a recessive loss-of-function mutation in the transactivation domain, while mutation Y is a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain. The transcription factor requires phosphorylation in the transactivation domain to dimerize, move into the nucleus, and regulate gene transcription. Mutation Y disrupts dimerization and acts as a dominant-negative, meaning it interferes with the function of
