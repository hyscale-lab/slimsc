Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options given are A) 1, B) 3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us how many rings or double bonds (or triple bonds) are in a molecule. Each ring or double bond counts as one, and each triple bond counts as two. So we calculate it using the formula:

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C + 2 - H - X + N]/2

Where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens. But in this case, the product is formed after a reaction, so I need to figure out what the product looks like first.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Red phosphorus is usually involved in the deoxygenation of certain functional groups. Wait, I think when esters or certain carbonyl compounds react with HI in the presence of phosphorus, it's a Wittig-like reaction, but more likely, it's a deoxygenation of a ketone or aldehyde to an alkane, or maybe a reduction.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but I think that's for ketones or aldehydes to convert them into alkanes by removing the oxygen. Alternatively, another reaction comes to mind: the reduction of carbonyl groups. Let me think. Red phosphorus with HI is used to reduce carbonyl groups. Wait, actually, I think the reaction is the dehydrohalogenation or perhaps the formation of alkenes. Or maybe it's about converting carbonyl groups into alkanes.

Wait, wait. The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the structure of that would be a cyclohexene ring (since it's cyclohex-3-ene) with substituents at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, vinyl is CH2CH, but as a substituent, it's CH2CH2 attached to the ring. Wait, no, the vinyl group is -CH2CH2-? No, wait, vinyl is -CH2CH2- or perhaps it's -CH=CH2. Oh wait, no, the vinyl group is CH2=CH- as a substituent.

So the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond) with a formyl group (CHO) at C2, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is
