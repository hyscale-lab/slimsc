Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question says a chemist does two reactions. Both involve treating an alkene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The first reaction uses (E)-oct-4-ene and the second uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each would show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is an oxidizing agent commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. So, the first step is forming an epoxide. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes acid-catalyzed ring-opening. 

Wait, what's the exact process here? Epoxidation forms an epoxide ring. Then in acidic conditions, the epoxide ring opens. The mechanism for that involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, right? But the stereochemistry of the epoxide would influence the outcome.

Wait, the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z) isomers. Let me visualize oct-4-ene. It's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 in the middle. So the double bond is between C4 and C5, if I'm counting right.

Wait, the (E) isomer would have the two higher priority groups on opposite sides, and (Z) would have them on the same side. When mCPBA reacts with each, it will form the epoxide. The configuration of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide. Oh wait, I think mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that forms an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide would have the oxygen atoms on the same side? Or opposite?

Wait, no, the addition is a concerted process. The peracid adds across the double bond, forming an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. So, for an E alkene, the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms in a certain configuration, and for Z, another. Wait, no, actually, mCPBA adds to the double bond in a way that the epoxide's stereochemistry is determined by the alkene's geometry.

Wait, no, wait. When mCPBA epoxidizes an alkene, the epoxide that forms has the same stereochemistry as the alkene. Because the peracid adds from the same face (same side for both oxygen atoms?), so the epoxide's substituents are cis or trans depending on the starting alkene. 

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: For a trans- (E-) alkene, the two substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. When epoxidized, the oxygen atoms would be added on the same face, leading to a trans epoxide? Or wait, no. Let me think of (E)-oct-4-ene. The groups on each end of the double bond are on opposite sides. So, when mCPBA adds across the double bond, the oxygen atoms would be added to the same face. So, in the resulting epoxide, the two oxygens would be on opposite sides relative to the trans arrangement of the substituents.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about (E) and (Z) alkenes and how epoxidation affects them. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are opposite. When mCPBA adds, it adds an oxygen across the double bond in a way that the two new oxygens are on the same face. So the resulting epoxide would have a specific stereochemistry. 

Wait, maybe another approach. For the epoxide, the two new oxygen atoms are added in a way that the groups on each carbon are trans. Wait, no. Let me imagine. The starting alkene is trans (E), so when epoxidized, the oxygen atoms are added on the same face. So the groups on each end of the epoxide would be on the same face, leading to a cis configuration in the epoxide?

Wait, no, wait. Let's take an example. Let's say the starting alkene is (E)-but-2-ene, which is CH2CH2-CH2CH3 but with opposite groups. When epoxidized, mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond, leading to an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide's substituents would depend on the starting alkene's geometry. Oh wait, I think that for a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide will have a cis configuration because the peracid adds from the same face, leading the two new substituents (the oxygen atoms) to be on the same side.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction mechanism. The epoxidation by mCPBA is a peracid adding across the double bond in a way that forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. So, for a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide will have the two adjacent substituents (like the CH2 groups) on the same side, making the epoxide a cis epoxide? Or perhaps it's the opposite.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the epoxidation of (E) and (Z) alkenes. Oh, wait, I can't do that. Let me think: when a peracid reacts with an alkene, the O-O bond breaks, and the oxygen adds to each carbon of the double bond. The addition is stereospecific. The peracid approaches from the same face of the double bond (the less substituted face?), leading to the formation of an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are on the same face.

Wait, maybe an example: (Z)-2-pentene. When epoxidized, the resulting epoxide would have the oxygen atoms on the same face, so the substituents on each carbon (like CH3 and CH2CH2CH3) would be on the same side, making it a cis epoxide in the double bond region. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the epoxidation of (E) and (Z) alkenes leads to different diastereomers of epoxide. For (E) starting material, the epoxide would have a certain configuration, and for (Z), another. Then, when each epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens.

Wait, during acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides, the ring opens in a way that the more substituted carbocation is formed, which is more stable. So, in the case of a symmetric epoxide, like from an internal double bond (like 4-octene), the ring opening would lead to two identical carbocations, so the product would be a single diol.

Wait, but wait, considering that the starting epoxide might not be symmetric. For oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be between C4 and C5, each attached to two CH2 groups on either side. So the epoxide would be symmetric. Let me think: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Let's number from 1 to 8.

Wait, oct-4-ene structure: CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, perhaps I should write it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not correct. No, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, oct-4-ene is (CH2)3CH-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, let's think as follows: octane has 8 carbons. The double bond is between C4 and C5. So, structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's not correct because oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that can't be right because that's only 6 carbons. Wait, no, no, wait: the structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's 7 carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of oct-4-ene as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, maybe I'm getting stuck on this, but perhaps it's symmetric. So, when epoxidized, the epoxide would be symmetric.

Wait, but regardless of whether the epoxide is symmetric, when treated with acid, the ring-opening would proceed via a carbocation. If the epoxide is symmetric, the ring-opening would produce a single diol. But wait, if the epoxide isn't symmetric, perhaps two different diastereomers would form?

Wait, but the problem states that each reaction goes to 100% completion, so each starting material is fully converted into product.

Wait, but let's think about each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide, then acid → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → another epoxide, then acid → another diol.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the epoxides from (E) and (Z) are the same or different. If the starting alkenes are different, their epoxides would be different, leading to different diols, but maybe some products are the same.

Wait, let me get this straight. For each reaction, the diastereomers of the diol would form. So, if the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a single product. If the epoxide is asymmetric, perhaps two different diols form, but maybe they are diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, but wait, the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene would be different. Because the starting alkenes have different geometries, the epoxides would have different configurations.

Wait, (E) and (Z) alkenes would form different epoxides because the addition of the oxygen atoms would be in different configurations. So, when each epoxide is treated with acid, the ring-opening would produce different diols.

Wait, but for each epoxide, would the ring-opening produce a single diol or multiple diols? Because the epoxide is symmetric, perhaps the ring-opening under acidic conditions would lead to a single product.

Wait, let me think again: for a symmetric epoxide, like from oct-4-ene, the ring-opening would lead to a single diol because both ends are the same. So, regardless of whether the epoxide is from (E) or (Z) starting material, the diol would have a specific configuration.

Wait, no. Because the epoxide from (E) and (Z) starting materials would have different configurations. So, when each is treated with acid, they might form different diastereomers of the diol.

Wait, let's say for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is in a certain configuration, leading to a certain diol when opened. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is a different configuration, leading to a different diol when opened.

So, in reaction 1, the product is a diol with a certain stereochemistry, and in reaction 2, another diol with a different stereochemistry.

Now, the question says the chemist combines the products of both reactions.

So, the products from reaction 1 and reaction 2 are combined. So, let's say reaction 1 gives diol A, and reaction 2 gives diol B. Are A and B the same or different?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: the (E) and (Z) alkenes would form different epoxides, which upon ring-opening would form different diastereomers of diols. So, when combined, there are two diastereomers.

Wait, but wait. Suppose the epoxide from (E) is trans and from (Z) is cis. Then, upon acid treatment, each would form a diol, possibly leading to different products.

Alternatively, another possibility: when the epoxide is symmetric, the ring-opening can lead to two enantiomers if the starting epoxide is asymmetric. But if the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a single compound.

Wait, but in our case, both (E) and (Z) alkenes are symmetric. Because oct-4-ene is symmetric around the double bond. So, regardless of the E or Z configuration, the epoxide would be symmetric. So, for each epoxide, when treated with acid, the ring-opening would form a single diol.

Wait, but wait, the epoxide from (E) and (Z) would be different. For example, let's say the (E) alkene forms a trans-epoxide, and (Z) forms a cis-epoxide. Then, each would form a diol upon ring-opening under acid conditions.

Wait, but in the case of a symmetric epoxide, the ring-opening under acidic conditions leads to a single product because the carbocation is symmetric. So, for both (E) and (Z) starting materials, their epoxides are symmetric, but the stereochemistry of the epoxide is different. So, when each is treated with acid, the diol formed would be different.

Wait, let me think this through. Suppose the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is trans. Upon acid treatment, the ring opens to form a diol where the hydroxyl groups are trans. Similarly, the epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene is cis, leading to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are cis.

Wait, but is that correct? The ring-opening of a trans epoxide might lead to a cis diol, and a cis epoxide to a trans diol? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, no. Let me think about the mechanism. When an epoxide ring is opened under acidic conditions, the mechanism typically involves the protonation of an oxygen, making it a better leaving group. The ring then opens with a nucleophilic attack, usually by water (or another nucleophile), leading to the formation of a diol.

In the case of a trans epoxide, when the ring opens, the attack occurs on the more substituted carbon. Wait, but in a symmetric epoxide, both are equally substituted. So, the ring would open with equal probability on either side, but since the epoxide is symmetric, the attack would happen in a way that leads to a single product.

Wait, but in asymmetric epoxides, opening can lead to different products, but in symmetric epoxides, it leads to a single product. So, the diol would have a specific configuration determined by the epoxide's structure.

Wait, perhaps the key is that each starting alkene gives a different diastereomer of the diol. So, combining the two products would give two diastereomers.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the actual products. Suppose (E)-oct-4-ene forms a trans epoxide. When the epoxide is opened, the two hydroxyl groups would be on opposite sides, leading to a diol where the OH groups are trans. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a cis epoxide, which upon opening gives a diol with the OH groups on the same side.

Wait, but in reality, perhaps the diastereomerism is different. Let me think: oh, wait, the diol from (E) epoxide would have the two OH groups on opposite sides (trans), and the diol from (Z) epoxide would have them on the same side (cis).

Wait, no. The configuration of the diol depends on the epoxide's configuration. So, let's say the epoxide from (E) is trans, leading to a diol where the two OHs are adjacent and trans. But in a four-membered epoxide, the trans diol would have the OHs on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps an example. Let's take (E)-2-pentene. Epoxidation would form an epoxide where the two Oxygens are on opposite sides. So, when the epoxide opens in acid, the attack would be on the less hindered carbon, but in this case, since it's symmetric, it would form a single diol where the OHs are on opposite sides.

Wait, but for oct-4-ene, which is symmetric, the epoxide would form in a way that the two OHs are on opposite sides when the starting alkene is E, and on the same side when the starting alkene is Z.

Wait, so for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (trans) → diol (trans diastereomer).

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis) → diol (cis diastereomer).

So, combining the two, you have two diastereomers of the diol.

But wait, diastereomers are different stereoisomers that are not mirror images. So, the two diols would be diastereomers.

Now, when you run these on an achiral HPLC column, diastereomers would elute at different times (since their physicochemical properties are different), so each would give a separate peak. So, two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC column, each diastereomer may or may not have enantiomers. Wait, but wait: the diastereomers are not enantiomers. So, if the diastereomers are themselves not chiral, then the chiral HPLC wouldn't separate them. Wait, but are the diols chiral?

Hmm, the diol from (E) would have the OH groups on opposite sides, and the diol from (Z) would have them on the same side. So, in each case, are the diols chiral?

Wait, for an oct-4-ene-derived diol, the structure would be HO-O-C-C-O-OH, but wait, wait. Let me structure it correctly. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. Let me think correctly. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No. Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Wait, the correct structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's actually 4-octene.

Ah, I think I'm getting stuck on this, but perhaps it's better to proceed.

Assuming that the diol is symmetric, like 4,5-diol-octane, then if the diol is symmetric, it's not chiral. So, in that case, the diastereomers would not be chiral either. But wait, no. If the diol is symmetric, then it would have a plane of symmetry and not be chiral.

Wait, but if the diol has two OH groups on adjacent carbons, but the molecule is symmetric, then the molecule may not be chiral. For example, 2-butanol is chiral, but 2,3-butanediol is not because it's symmetric.

Wait, so in our case, the diol would be 4,5-octanediol. If the molecule is symmetric, like 4,5-octanediol, then it would not be chiral. So, the diols from Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 would be diastereomers, but each is not chiral.

Wait, but wait: if the diol from (E) has the OH groups on opposite sides, and the diol from (Z) has them on the same side, but the molecule is symmetric, then each diol would have a plane of symmetry, making them not chiral. So, for each diol, whether from E or Z starting material, the diol is not chiral.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think: 4,5-octanediol would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, 4,5-octanediol would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2(OH)-CH2(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, the diol is on C4 and C5, so the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, perhaps it's:

the structure would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2(OH)-CH2(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But in that case, the molecule is symmetric, so it's not chiral.

But wait, if the diol has the two OH groups on the same or opposite sides (i.e., cis or trans), but the molecule as a whole is symmetric, then the diol would be achiral.

Wait, but if the diol is symmetric and the two OHs are on the same side, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Similarly, if the OHs are on opposite sides, the molecule is symmetric and achiral.

Hmm, that can't be right because in that case, the diols would not be chiral, and when run on a chiral HPLC, they would not show any separation beyond what the achiral column would show.

Wait, but this is confusing. Let me think of another approach.

Each reaction produces a diol. Suppose Reaction 1 gives a diol that's a single enantiomer, and Reaction 2 gives another enantiomer. But wait, no, because the starting materials are E and Z, and the ring-opening leads to diols that are diastereomers, not enantiomers.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the products.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (let's say trans) → acid → trans-diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis) → acid → cis-diol.

But if the diols are 4,5-octanediol (trans) and 4,5-octanediol (cis), but the molecule is symmetric, then each would have a single structure. But wait, 4,5-octanediol (cis) and (trans) are actually the same as each other because of the molecule's symmetry. No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: for 4,5-octanediol, if the two OH groups are on the same side, the molecule is symmetric. So, it's not chiral. Similarly, if the OHs are on opposite sides, the molecule is also symmetric, so it's not chiral.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think of 2,3-pentanediol. If the OHs are on the same side, the molecule is symmetric and not chiral. If the OHs are on opposite sides, the molecule is also symmetric and not chiral. So, in that case, the diol would not be chiral.

Wait, but wait, that's only true if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, if the diol is on adjacent carbons in a symmetric molecule, then the diol would not be chiral.

So, in our case, the diol from (E) and (Z) would both be achiral because their structures are symmetric. So, each diol would be a single compound, not enantiomers.

But wait, if that's the case, then when the two diols are combined, you have two different diastereomers, but each is a single compound.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's think about the possible diastereomers.

If the diol from (E) is trans, and from (Z) is cis, and each diol is a single, achiral compound, then when you combine them, you have two different diastereomers. Each would be a single peak on the achiral HPLC because they are not enantiomers, and each would elute at a different time.

On the chiral HPLC column, since each diol is achiral, the chiral column wouldn't separate them. So, you'd see two peaks on both columns, right? Because the compounds are different diastereomers, not enantiomers.

Wait, but wait. Diastereomers would have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times on both columns. On the achiral column, they would appear as two separate peaks. On the chiral column, since they are diastereomers, not enantiomers, they would also have different retention times, so two peaks.

Wait, but the question says, "assuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases." So, the maximum resolution is achieved. So, if the two diols are different, they would show as two peaks on both columns.

But wait, let's go back to the products. Wait, each reaction produces a diol. Are the diols from (E) and (Z) starting materials the same or different?

Wait, the initial step: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (let's say trans) → acid → diol (trans). Similarly, (Z) → epoxide (cis) → diol (cis). So, two diastereomers of the diol.

So, when combined, they are two distinct diastereomers. Each would be a single compound.

On the standard (achiral) HPLC, diastereomers would show as separate peaks. So, two peaks.

On the chiral HPLC, diastereomers are not separated because the column can't differentiate between them. Wait, no, wait. Chiral columns are used to separate enantiomers. Diastereomers are separated on achiral columns because they have different physical properties.

Wait, no. Actually, diastereomers can be separated on achiral columns because they have different retention times, but on chiral columns, if the diastereomers are not enantiomers, they might not separate. Wait, no, that's not right. Chiral columns can separate enantiomers, but diastereomers may or may not be separated based on their structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: Chiral HPLC columns are used to separate enantiomers. Diastereomers, being different compounds, would have different retention times on any column, both achiral and chiral.

So, if you have two diastereomers, they would each show as a single peak on both types of columns.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that each reaction goes to 100% completion, so each gives a single product. So, the combined product would have two diastereomers.

So, on an achiral column, they would give two peaks. On a chiral column, since they're diastereomers, not enantiomers, they would also give two peaks.

So, both HPLC columns would show two peaks each. So, the answer would be option C, which says 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 2 peaks in both. But wait, let me think again. Am I missing something?

Wait, another possibility: Could the diols from each reaction be the same compound? No, because the starting E and Z alkenes produce different epoxides, which upon ring-opening give different diols.

So, in reaction 1: (E) → trans diol.

Reaction 2: (Z) → cis diol.

Combining them gives two diastereomers. So, two peaks in both HPLC columns.

But looking back at the options, option C is 2 peaks in both. So, the correct answer is option C.


The question involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The products are combined and analyzed using both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in each chromatogram.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Overview**:  
   - mCPBA reacts with alkenes to form epoxides. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.  
   - For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed has a trans configuration. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed has a cis configuration.  
   - Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxides leads to diols. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide.

2. **Products of Each Reaction**:  
   - Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → trans-diol.  
   - Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → cis-diol.  
   - The two diols are diastereomers of each other (not enantiomers) because they have different stereochemistry at the hydroxyl groups.

3. **Combining the Products**:  
   - The combined products contain two distinct diastereomers: the trans-diol and the cis-diol.  

4. **Chromatographic Behavior**:  
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties, so they will elute at different retention times. Thus, two peaks are observed.  
   - **Chiral HPLC**: Chiral columns are designed to separate enantiomers, not diastereomers. Since the two diols are diastereomers, they will not be separated on the chiral column, and two peaks will still be observed.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   - On both the standard and chiral HPLC columns, two peaks are observed, corresponding to the two diastereomeric diols.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC**: Incorrect. Only two diastereomers are formed, so four peaks are not possible.  
- **B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC**: Incorrect. No additional peaks are formed, and the chiral column does not separate diastereomers.  
- **C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC**: Correct. Two diastereomers are formed, and each chromatogram shows two peaks.  
- **D) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC**: Incorrect. Only two diastereomers are formed, so this option is not possible.

ANSWER: C
