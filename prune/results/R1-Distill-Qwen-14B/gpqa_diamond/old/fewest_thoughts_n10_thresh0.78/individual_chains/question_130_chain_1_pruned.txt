Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, I remember that when a quasar's light passes through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs some of that light, especially at a specific wavelength called the Lyman alpha line. I think the Lyman alpha wavelength is around 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, the question is about using optical ground-based telescopes to detect these absorptions. Oh right, because the atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV light, so ground-based telescopes can't see that wavelength directly. So the absorption would have to be shifted into the optical range.

Redshift! Right, when a source is moving away, the wavelength of the light is stretched. The formula for redshift (z) is (observed wavelength / emitted wavelength) - 1. So the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. The observed wavelength needs to be in the optical range, which I think is up to about 1000 nm (or 10,000 Angstroms). Wait, but optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 to 700 nm, or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So the largest optical wavelength a telescope can observe is around 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, let me get this straight. The Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm in the far UV. To see this line in an optical telescope, the wavelength must have been redshifted into the optical range. So the redshifted wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z). We want lambda_obs to be less than or equal to the maximum optical wavelength observed, which is about 700 nm, or 7000 Angstroms.

Wait a second, wait, wait. Wait, 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms (since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm). So 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. So we set up the equation:

lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) <= 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, but wait! The quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. So the observed absorption line in the quasar's spectrum would be at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms, which is redshifted. So yes, the observed wavelength lambda_obs = 1216*(1+z) should be within the optical range.

So the maximum allowed lambda_obs is 7000 Angstroms. So to find the minimum redshift z, we set lambda_obs to 7000:

1216*(1 + z) = 7000

So 1 + z = 7000 / 1216

Let me calculate that. 7000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1216 times 5 is 6080. 7000 -6080=920. 1216*0.76 is about 922 (since 1216*0.7=851.2, 1216*0.06=72.96; sum 924.16). So 5.76 is about 5.76? Wait, wait, let me compute it accurately.

Wait, 1216 * z + 1216 = 7000.

1216*(z+1)=7000

z+1 = 7000 / 1216 ≈ ?

Let me compute 7000 / 1216.

1216 * 5 = 6080, as above. 7000-6080=920.

So 920/1216 ≈ 0.756. So z+1=5.756 → z≈4.756.

Wait that can't be right. Wait, 1216 *5 is 6080, which is less than 7000. So 1216 *5.756 = 7000?

Wait wait, no. Let me compute 7000 / 1216 numerically.

1216 = 1.216e3.

7000 /1216 = approximately 5.756, because 1216 *5 =6080. 1216*5.756= 6080 + (0.756 *1216). Let's compute 0.756 *1216.

0.7 *1216=851.2, 0.05*1216=60.8, 0.006*1216=7.296. Sum: 851.2 +60.8=912; 912 +7.296=919.296. So total is 6080 +919.296=6999.296, which is about 7000. So yes, z+1=5.756 → z≈4.756. So z is approximately 4.76.

But wait, the options are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9. So none of the options are around 4.76. Hmm. That's a problem. Did I make a mistake in understanding the question?

Wait, wait. The question says 'the lower limit on the redshift of this object such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.' Wait, so we need the minimal redshift z where the Lyman alpha line is just entering the optical range. Because if the cloud is too close (z too small), the Lyman alpha line would be in UV, which ground-based telescopes can't see. So we need the minimal z where the Lyman alpha line is at the edge of optical. So if z is 4.75, the observed wavelength is 7000 Angstroms (700 nm), which is in the optical (red end). But wait, that's the maximum. So for any z larger than this, the line
