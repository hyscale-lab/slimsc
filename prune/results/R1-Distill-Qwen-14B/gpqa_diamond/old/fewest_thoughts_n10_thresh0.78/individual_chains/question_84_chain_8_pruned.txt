Okay, so I have this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically regarding the matrix exponential function approximation with a fractional method.

Hmm, let's break it down. The matrix exponential is often used in solving systems of linear differential equations, which is relevant here because the heat equation can be discretized into such systems. When dealing with higher dimensions, the system can get pretty large, so solving it efficiently is important. 

The question mentions "higher order finite difference approximations" and "parallel splitting." Parallel splitting probably refers to methods that allow the solution to be computed in parallel, maybe by dividing the problem into smaller subproblems. 

The key factor for converting a sequential algorithm to parallel is likely something about how the matrix is handled. In sequential methods, you might compute the matrix exponential directly, which could be a bottleneck for large matrices. Parallel methods often require decomposing the matrix into parts that can be processed simultaneously.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's more about ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up or become inaccurate. It's important but probably not the main factor here for parallelism.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions might complicate things, but how does that tie into parallel splitting? Not sure. Maybe it affects how the boundaries are handled in parallel, but I'm not certain.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Fractional approximations are used to approximate the matrix exponential. If the approximation has complex roots, that might affect the stability or the way the matrix is split. But I'm not exactly sure how this leads to parallelism.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fractions are a way to break down complex expressions into simpler terms. If the approximation can be linearly split into fractions, that might allow each part to be computed in parallel, since each fraction could be handled by a different processor. That sounds plausible because partial fractions can decompose the problem into independent parts.

Wait, how does this work? The matrix exponential, e^A, can sometimes be decomposed. If the approximation involves a linear combination of terms that can be computed separately, like e^A â‰ˆ something that can be split into parts, then each part can be handled in parallel. But the option D is about linear partial fractions of the fractional approximation. So the idea is that the approximation method can be split into linear parts, each of which can be computed independently, thus allowing parallel processing.

Option C talks about complex roots. If the roots are complex, they might not directly contribute to parallelism. But maybe having complex roots affects the stability or the form of the approximation, but I'm not sure.

So, between C and D. Another angle: in parallel splitting methods like the parallel method of lines or others, the matrix is often split into a sum of matrices, each of which can be exponentiated separately. If the fractional approximation allows such a decomposition, then each part can be computed in parallel. 

Linear partial fractions would decompose a rational function into simpler fractions, maybe each corresponding to a different part of the matrix. So for example, if the approximation is a sum of terms like (A + B)^n, and if A and B commute, then e^{A+B} = e^A e^B. But if they don't commute, you can't do that. However, if the approximation can be linearly split using partial fractions, that might allow for parallel computation.

So perhaps D is the correct answer because the linear partial fraction decomposition allows the approximation to be broken into parts that can be computed in parallel. 

Alternatively, maybe the presence of complex roots (option C) affects whether the approximation can be split, but I'm not as confident about that. 

I'm more inclined towards D being the key factor
