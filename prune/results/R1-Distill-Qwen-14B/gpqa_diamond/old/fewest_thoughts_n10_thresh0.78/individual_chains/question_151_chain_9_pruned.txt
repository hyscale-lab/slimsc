Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, I think in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized, meaning their inner product with themselves should be 1. Let me check that first because normalization is important for probabilities.

So the state vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. The inner product is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component. So that would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2. Let's compute that: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh wait, that's 6, which is not 1. So the state isn't normalized. I guess I'll have to normalize it before proceeding because probabilities depend on it.

To normalize, I need to divide each component by the square root of 6. So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, let me confirm that step. Yeah, because the norm is sqrt(6), so each component is divided by sqrt(6).

Next, the observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what this represents. Observables are Hermitian operators because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to possible measurement outcomes.

I'm supposed to find the probability that measuring P gives 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P, particularly the eigenvalue 0, and then compute the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.

Wait, but perhaps first, P is given, but maybe it's diagonal? Let me check. No, the matrix isn't diagonal. The diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So P is a 3x3 matrix with 0s on the diagonal. The elements in the off-diagonal
