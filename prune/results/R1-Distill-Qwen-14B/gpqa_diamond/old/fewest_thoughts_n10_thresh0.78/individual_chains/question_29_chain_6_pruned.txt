Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about barley and gene mutations. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit detailed, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the situation is that there's this drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. That's bad because they can't use it for food. The gene responsible for making this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and then they looked at the target gene in each mutant. The changes are in the first exon area. So, the question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

First, I need to understand what each mutation does. The intact gene is provided, and then each mutant has some differences. I think I should compare each mutant's sequence to the intact gene to see what's changed.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, comparing the first part. Let's see:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

So, the start of the intact gene is ATGTTTCTCGCT. Mutant1 changes that to ATGTTCTACGCT. Let me write this out:

Position 1: same ATGTTT in intact. Oh wait, wait. Let me count the letters. The first few letters are ATGTTTC... So in the intact gene, it's ATGTTTCTCGCT, and in mutant 1, it's ATGTTCTACGCT.

So at position where the intact has T, mutant1 has a T followed by CTA... Wait, maybe I should line them up.

Intact: positions 1-20 maybe:
1  2  3  4  5  6
