Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about selecting the correct reagents for two different reactions. Let me read it carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (and water) to form a butanoic acid derivative.

Wait, let me think about the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, what usually happens? Oh right, I remember that in the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone can undergo nucleophilic addition. So NaCN is a source of CN- ions. But wait, NaCN is a salt, and in aqueous solution, it would provide CN- ions.

Wait, but ketones typically react with HCN, not CN- directly. Oh, wait, perhaps in the presence of an acid, the CN- can act as a nucleophile. Or maybe it's a different mechanism. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but that doesn't seem right for a ketone.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's an example of the Arndt-Eistert synthesis or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic addition. Ketones can react with nucleophiles like HCN under acidic conditions. But NaCN is a source of CN-; maybe in the presence of an acid, it's protonated to form HCN?

Wait, but perhaps the reaction is a condensation. Wait, but butan-2-one plus NaCN and a reagent A gives a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Let me look at the product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, no, the formula is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons with a nitrile group. 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the structure:
