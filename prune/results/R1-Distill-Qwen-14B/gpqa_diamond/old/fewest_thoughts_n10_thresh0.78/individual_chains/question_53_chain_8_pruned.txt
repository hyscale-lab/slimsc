Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, the aromatic ring has two substituents. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters have specific absorption peaks in IR, so that's a clue about the functional group present.

Looking at the NMR data: the 1H NMR shows six signals. Let's break those down.

First, two signals are aromatic-H. A di-substituted benzene usually has some symmetry, so maybe the substituents are meta to each other? Wait, no, di-substituted can be ortho, meta, or para. But for a six-membered ring, if there are two substituents, the aromatic protons may split into different environments depending on their positions.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to a double bond, like in an ester group. Ester groups have the structure R-O-CO-O-R', and they have an adjacent vinyl proton if the ester is part of a substituent like an acetyl group attached to the ring. Wait, no, esters are usually something like R-O-CO-R. So, maybe the substituents are ester groups.

Wait, the compound is di-substituted, so perhaps each substituent is an ester? Or maybe one substituent is an ester, and another is something else. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. That suggests that there are two sets of protons attached to double bonds. So maybe each substituent has a vinyl group. But wait, the aromatic ring could have substituents that are ester groups, which themselves have double bonds.

Let me think about this. An ester group is -O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, that's not quite right. The ester's structure is R-O-CO-R'. So in the ester functional group, the carbonyl is next to an oxygen. So the adjacent carbons would have the ester's structure, but the protons would be on the R group attached to the ester.

Wait, if the substituent is an ester group attached to the benzene ring, like O-CO-O-R, no, that's actually a carbonate group. Wait, maybe it's O-CO-R. So the ester would be attached as a substituent to the aromatic ring. So if the substituent is an acetyl group, that's a carbonyl with a methyl group attached. But that wouldn't have any vinyl protons, right? Because acetyl is CH3-C=O.

Hmm, so maybe the substituents are something else. Or perhaps the substituents are vinyl groups attached to something else, like maybe the ester is part of a substituent that has a double bond.

Wait, another thought: the ester group itself doesn't have vinyl protons. But if the substituent is an acrylate ester, which has a double bond adjacent to the ester, then that would have vinyl protons. For example, an ester group attached via a vinyl group. Like, maybe the substituent is CH2=CHCOOR or something like that.

Wait, but the NMR shows two different vinyl signals. So maybe each substituent is part of a vinyl group. Or perhaps the substituents themselves are vinyl esters.

Let me think about the substituents on the aromatic ring. So if each substituent is an ester group, but more likely, considering the NMR, each substituent is an ester group connected to a vinyl group. So for each substituent, maybe it's something like O-CO-CH2-CH2-... No, that wouldn't have a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester.

Wait, maybe the substituents are ester groups with adjacent double bonds. For example, if the substituent is an allyl ester, like CH2=CHCOOR. But then, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2=CH- part.

Wait, but the aromatic ring has two substituents. Let's consider each substituent as a vinyl group attached via an ester. So maybe each substituent is something like O-CO-CH2-CH2-..., but that seems unlikely since that wouldn't have a double bond. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the ring.

But then the NMR shows two different vinyl signals. That suggests two different types of vinyl protons. So perhaps each substituent has a different vinyl group attached.

Wait, maybe the substituents are two different vinyl ester groups. So each substituent is an ester group connected to a vinyl group. For example, one substituent is CH2=CHCOO- and another substituent is something else, like maybe another vinyl ester, but with a different structure.

Wait, but the question says it's a di-substituted compoundâ€”so two substituents on the benzene ring. Each substituent would have their own set of protons. So if each substituent is a vinyl ester, that would contribute to the NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group with a vinyl group, and the other substituent is something else. Let me see.

Wait, the NMR has two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps each substituent has a vinyl group, but each has a different environment. So the substituents might be ortho, meta, or para to each other, and each substituent has a vinyl group attached.

But if each substituent is a vinyl ester, perhaps the two substituents have different structures, leading to different vinyl proton environments.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester with a vinyl group and the other substituent is a methyl group or something else. But the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals, which suggests that there are two distinct sets of vinyl protons. So perhaps each substituent has a vinyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that each has a vinyl group, but in different positions, causing their protons to split into different signals. For example, maybe one substituent is para to another, and each has a vinyl group in a different position, leading to different coupling.

Wait, but the NMR shows six signals in total. Let's think about each type of proton.

Two aromatic-H signals: so the aromatic
