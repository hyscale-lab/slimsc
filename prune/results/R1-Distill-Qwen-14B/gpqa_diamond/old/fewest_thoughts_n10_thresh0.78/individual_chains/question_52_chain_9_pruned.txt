Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's read through the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of the number of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—no spots compared to when there are spots.

The options are A to D, with some numbers. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I remember that this is in the near-ultraviolet range, but I'm not sure if that's important yet.

Hmm. So, the key concepts here are probably related to the Boltzmann equation for population ratios of energy levels in a star's atmosphere. Since the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the Boltzmann distribution applies. So, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels depends on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights of the levels, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio is decreasing when the star has spots. So, when the spots are present, the ratio n1/n2 (since the ratio is given as level 1 to level 2) is higher, because the observed ratio decreases. Wait, no—the problem says the ratio of number of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. But wait, let me double-check. When there are spots, the overall Teff
