Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, spin-1/2 particles are fermions, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Right, that means each quantum state can hold at most one particle.

The well has a length L, and I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The given energy E is pi^2 hbar squared over 2mL squared. So each energy level for a single particle in the well is E_n = (n²) * E, where n is the principal quantum number.

Since there are four particles, and they're fermions, their quantum states must be unique. Each state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin state. But wait, in one dimension, the spin-orbit interaction is negligible, so the spin doesn't affect the spatial part of the wavefunction. So each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins.

So for each energy level n, there are two possible spin states: up and down. So each n can hold two particles.

Let me think about how to fill up the particles. The ground state would have the lowest possible energy, so we'll fill the lowest n first, each with two particles.

The first few energy levels are n=1, n=2, n=3, etc. For each n, we can have two particles. So let's see:

n=1: can hold 2 particles.
n=2: next 2 particles.
n=3: next 2, but wait, we only have four particles total.

So, let's break it down. We have four fermions.

Ground state (lowest energy):

We fill the lowest n's with maximum particles. So n=1 holds 2 particles, n=2 holds 2 particles. Wait no, n=1 can hold two, but wait, four particles would require n=1 and n=2 each filled with two? Let me recount.

Wait, n=1 is the lowest: can take 2 particles. Then n=2 is next, which can take another 2. So that's 4 particles in total. So the ground state configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

Each particle in n=1 has energy E_1 = 1² E = E. Similarly, n=2 is E_2 = (2²) E =4E.

But wait, each n has two particles. So total energy would be 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E. Wait, but that's the total energy for all four particles.

Wait, but the question says calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check. Oh, no, maybe I thought the question was about the total energy but it's actually asking for each state's energy. Wait, no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system". So it's the system's total energy in each case.

Wait, but each state is a different configuration. So the ground state is the lowest possible, then first excited, next
