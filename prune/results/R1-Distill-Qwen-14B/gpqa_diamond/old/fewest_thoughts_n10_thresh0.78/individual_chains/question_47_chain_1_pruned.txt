Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectral data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation first. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, which there aren't any here. So plugging in the numbers: C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2.

So, (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 4, because it's three double bonds or a ring plus three double bonds) plus a double bond or a ring. Or maybe a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches or O-H stretches. Wait, the 3420 and 3325 are in the range for N-H (like amine or amide) or maybe O-H. But considering another peak, the strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So 1720 could be an ester, amide, ketone, etc. Let's think. Esters have carbonyls around 1740-1720. Amides are lower, around 1650-1680. So 1720 is likely an ester or maybe a ketone. Wait, the compound has an O2, which suggests maybe an ester group (which has O from the carbonyl and O from the OR group) or maybe a carboxylic acid, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would have a broad O-H around 2500-3300. But in this IR, maybe the two peaks are for N-H groups.

Wait, the IR shows two strong peaks around 3400. Those might be from an amine (two N-H stretches) or maybe from an amide (N-H bending, but amide N-H typically show up around 3300-3500 as two peaks, which seems to fit here. So maybe the compound has an amide group. Alternatively, it could be a secondary amine, but I'm not sure.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: That's a typical ethyl group, the CH2CH3 group. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl something attached.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Hmm. Broad singlet for 2H. Could be adjacent to something deshielded, maybe an oxygen. Like an
