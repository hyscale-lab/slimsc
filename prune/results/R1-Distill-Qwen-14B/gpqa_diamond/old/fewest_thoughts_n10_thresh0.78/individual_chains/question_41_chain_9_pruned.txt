Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light propagating through glass, and the glass is moving. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking about the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory frame. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the light is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. The glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So the beam is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which would be towards the observer. So both the beam and the glass are moving towards the observer.

Wait no, the beam is propagating through the glass. So if the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, that would mean the beam is going in that direction. So the beam is moving with the glass, but when the glass is moving towards the observer, that would imply that the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving along with it, but maybe the observer is in the lab frame, so the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer.

Wait, no, the question says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and toward the observer. Wait, maybe the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, so both towards the observer. Hmm, but I'm not sure; maybe the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving.

Wait, let me clarify the setup. The light beam is propagating through the glass, which is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement, which is towards the observer. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving at v towards the observer, and the light inside the glass is moving at some speed relative to the glass. But wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light speed is c/n, because the index of refraction is n. So when the glass is moving, how does that affect the speed of light in the lab frame?

Wait, this seems like a problem involving the addition of velocities, but I'm not sure whether we can apply the classical addition formula or if we need to use special relativity. Since v is given as a velocity, and if v is not too close to the speed of light, maybe we can approximate using Galilean addition. But if v is a significant fraction of c, then we have to use relativistic addition.

But the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. So perhaps the problem expects us to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the options given include terms with n and v, so maybe a classical approach is intended, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think step by step.

In the glass's rest frame (S'), the speed of light is v' = c/n. Because the index of refraction n = c / v', so v' = c/n.

Now, we need to find the speed of the light beam in the lab frame (S), where the glass is moving at velocity u = v (since the glass is moving towards the observer with velocity v in the same direction as the beam; wait, no, if the glass is moving towards the observer, then u would be in the direction opposite to the beam's propagation? Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, let me clarify the direction. The beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's movement towards the observer. So if the observer is at rest in the lab frame, and the glass is moving towards the observer, then the beam is moving towards the observer as well. So in the glass's rest frame, the beam's velocity is v' = c/n towards the observer. Now, when the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity u = v (in the lab frame), how does that affect the beam's velocity in the lab frame?

So we can apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula for adding velocities from frame S' to S (where S' is moving at velocity u relative to S) is:

v = (v' + u) / (1 + (v' * u)/c² )

Wait, but wait, the direction is important. If the glass is moving towards the observer (lab frame), then the direction of u is towards the observer, which I'll take as the positive direction. Or wait, perhaps I should set up the axes correctly.

Let me define the direction: Let’s say in the lab frame S, the observer is at rest. The glass is moving at velocity u = +v, because it's moving towards the observer. So in the glass's rest frame (S'), the beam's
