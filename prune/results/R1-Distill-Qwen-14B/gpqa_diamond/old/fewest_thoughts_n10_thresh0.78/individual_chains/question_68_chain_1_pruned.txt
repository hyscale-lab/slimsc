Okay, so I have this physics problem about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So the setup is: the particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma multiplied by Sz. Sz is the spin in the z-direction. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction, and the moment is aligned with it. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the spin precesses around the new field direction. But how does this affect the components of the magnetic moment?

The magnetic moment mu is proportional to the spin. The spin operator S has components Sx, Sy, Sz. The expectation values of these depend on the state of the particle.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say the state is |up_z>, meaning Sz is (ħ/2) times something. So the magnetic moment mu is gamma * (ħ/2) in the z-direction.

When the magnetic field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy because the magnetic field is along Y. The energy levels are determined by the eigenvalues of Sy.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, the energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of Sy. But the initial state was an eigenstate of Sz, not Sy. So the state will now evolve under the new Hamiltonian, leading to time evolution and oscillations in expectation values.

The oscillation frequency is typically related to the energy difference between states. For a spin-1/2 system, the energy levels are ± (gamma * B * ħ/2?), wait, no. Let me think about the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian H is usually given by H = -mu · B. Oh wait, but in this problem, mu is given as gamma * S_z. So when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment's interaction would be mu_y * B. So H would be proportional to Sy.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B = - gamma B (S · Y). That would be H = - gamma B (S_y), since the field is along Y.

Wait, actually, the dot product. S is a vector, so S · B would be Sx Bx + Sy By + Sz Bz. But in this case, B is along Y, so By = B, others zero. So H = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, wait. The magnetic field is B in Y direction, same magnitude as before. So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, H becomes H = -gamma * (S · B) = -gamma B S_y (since B is along Y).

But wait, actually, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is mu · B. So H = - mu · B = -gamma S · B. So when B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the sign. Oh right, for spin in a magnetic field, the energy is E = - mu · B. So H = -mu · B.

So H = -gamma B S_y.

Now, the time evolution of the state is determined by the eigenvalues of H. The eigenvalues of S_y for a spin-1/2 system are ± ħ/2. So the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = + gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H = - gamma B S_y would have eigenvalues -gamma B (± ħ/2) )= ∓ gamma B ħ/2.

So the energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = (gamma B ħ/2) - (- gamma B ħ/2) )= gamma B ħ.

Wait, but wait, the energy levels are E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ) and E_- = + gamma B ( ħ/2 ), so the difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ( ħ/2 ) - (- gamma B ( ħ/2 )) ) = gamma B ħ. So the energy difference is gamma B ħ.

But for oscillations in expectation values, like the expectation value of Sz, the frequency is determined by the energy splitting divided by ħ. So the frequency omega is (E_2 - E_1) / ħ.

So here, (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. So omega = gamma B?

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The initial state is |up_z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. When the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y, the state is a superposition of the eigenstates of S_y.

The time evolution will cause the state to precess, and the expectation value of Sz will oscillate with a frequency determined by the energy splitting.

But I might be getting this wrong. Let me recall that for a spin-1/2 in a magnetic field along the Y direction, the state precesses around Y. The components of the spin (like Sx, Sy, Sz) will oscillate in time.

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the particle’s moment. So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

So I need to find the time dependence of <S_z> when the state evolves under H = -gamma B S_y.

The initial state is |up_z>, which is |+z> = (|+> + |-> ) / sqrt(2) in the computational basis, but perhaps it's easier to write it in the S_z basis.

Wait, the state |+z> can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of S_y. Let me denote |+y> and |-y> as the eigenstates of S_y.

The transformation from z-basis to y-basis: |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). So the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Under the new Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y, the time evolution is given by the time evolution operator U = exp( -i H t / ħ ).

Since H has eigenstates |+y> and |-y> with energies E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 ), the time evolution of each component is multiplied by a phase factor.

So the state at time t is:

( |+y> exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) + |-y> exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) ) / sqrt(2).

Plugging in E_+ = - gamma B ħ/2:

exp( -i (- gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )

Similarly, E_- = gamma B ħ/2, so exp( -i (gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )

So the state is:

( |+y> exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) + |-y> exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) ) / sqrt(2)

Now, we need to find <S_z> which is gamma times the expectation value of S_z.

Expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>, we can evaluate <S_z>.

The S_z operator in the |+y> and |-y> basis can be found. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>, then compute the expectation value in the initial state.

Wait, let me think of the expectation value of S_z in the state that evolves over time.

The state at time t is
