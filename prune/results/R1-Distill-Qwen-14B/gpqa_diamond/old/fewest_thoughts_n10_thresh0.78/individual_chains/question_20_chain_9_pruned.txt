Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear physics and approximations used in calculations. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations, like for electroweak interactions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the four assumptions imply that nucleons behave as free particles. The options are combinations of these four points, numbered 1 to 4. I need to figure out which combination jointly leads to the impulse approximation.

Let me start by recalling what the impulse approximation is. From what I remember, the impulse approximation is a method used in nuclear physics where the nucleus is treated as a collection of free nucleons. The idea is that when a nucleon is hit by a photon or another particle, it behaves almost as if it's free, not influenced much by the other nucleons in the nucleus. So the approximation assumes that the interactions are so short-lived that the other nucleons don't have time to respond. That makes the system behave like the nucleons are free.

So, under this approximation, each nucleon is treated independently, and the nucleus as a whole doesn't significantly affect the interaction. Now, the question is about the assumptions that lead to this.

Looking at the four given assumptions:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

I need to figure out which ones are necessary for the impulse approximation.

First, assumption 1: The interaction only affects individual nucleons. That sounds right because, in the impulse approximation, each nucleon is treated separately. So this must be one of the assumptions.

Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent except for the selected nucleon. If the nucleus is mostly transparent, it means that the interaction doesn't see the other nucleons. So the other nucleons don't interfere, which aligns with the idea that each is acting independently. So this is probably another assumption needed.

Assumption 3: The quarks inside the nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, I'm not sure. Quarks are confined inside nucleons, and the binding within the nucleon is a strong force effect. But impulse approximation is about the motion of the nucleon as a whole, not the internal quarks. If the quarks are non-relativistic, does that affect how the nucleon interacts externally? Maybe not directly. Alternatively, in the impulse approximation, the internal structure (like quarks) is treated as part of the free nucleon. But I'm not sure if assumption 3 is necessary. It might be more about the dynamics within the nucleon, which perhaps isn't directly related to the approximation of treating them as free. Maybe this isn't a necessary part of the impulse approximation. Alternatively, if the quarks are non-relativistic, their motion is simple, so the nucleon can be treated as a point particle, which might fit into the approximation. I'm a bit confused about this one.

Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the nucleon experiences no binding forces. So, the binding between nucleons in the nucleus (like strong nuclear force) is ignored. That makes sense because in the impulse approximation, the nucleon is treated as free, so the binding forces are not considered during the interaction. So this must be another assumption.

So putting it together, the impulse approximation assumes that each nucleon interacts individually (1), the nucleus is mostly transparent so only one nucleon is involved (2), and the binding forces are ignored (4). So that would be 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, what about assumption 3? Oh, I think that's not part of the impulse approximation. Because the impulse approximation deals with the motion of the nucleons as a whole, not their internal quark dynamics. So assumption 3 might not be required
