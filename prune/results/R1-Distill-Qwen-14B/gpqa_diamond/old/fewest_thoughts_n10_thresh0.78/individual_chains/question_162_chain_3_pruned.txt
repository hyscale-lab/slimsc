Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's interesting. So the line element is expressed in terms of x and y, but it's a 2D metric, I think. Because there's only dx and dy, so maybe it's embedded in 2-dimensional space? Or is it a 2D spacetime?

Wait, no, wait. The question is about a pseudosphere. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface in 2+1 dimensions, I believe. Or is it a 2D surface in 3D space? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps this metric is representing a pseudosphere in some way.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. So I need to compute the area using this metric. But how?

Well, in general, the area of a surface can be found using the metric. For a 2D surface parameterized by coordinates x and y, the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Wait, but in this case, the metric is given as ds² = g_{xy} dx^2 + g_{yy} dy^2, but since the terms are the same for dx² and dy², it's a diagonal metric with g_xx = g_yy =
