Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer when certain substituted benzene rings undergo electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. 

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can activate or deactivate the ring and direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. The directing effect is crucial here because it determines where the substitution occurs—ortho, meta, or para to the existing substituent.

Wait, the question asks about the para-isomer's weight fraction. So for each compound, I need to figure out the major product's position—whether it's para or some other. But wait, wait—no, not exactly. The substituent's directing effect will influence the position where the bromine adds. For example, if the substituent is meta-directing, the majority of the product will be meta substituted, but if it's para, then para. 

But wait, I'm not sure if all substituents are either ortho/para or meta directors. Let me think. Electron-donating groups (like -NH2, -O- , alkyl groups) are typically ortho/para directors because they activate the ring and direct the electrophile to those positions. On the other hand, electron-withdrawing groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR) are meta directors because they deactivate the ring and direct the electrophile to the meta positions.

Oh wait, but wait, some groups are deactivating but still ortho/para directors. Like -Cl is a deactivating (due to the electronegative Cl atom) but it's ortho/para directing because the lone pairs on Cl can donate electrons through resonance, activating the ring in those positions. So -Cl is a ortho/para director despite being deactivating.

So, let's list each substituent and their directing effects.

1. С6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group, so it's an ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, the main products should be the ortho and para brominated derivatives, with para being a major product because it's more stable. So for this one, the para product would be a significant fraction. But how does the presence of excess bromine affect it? Well, assuming it's a monobromination (only one substitution occurs), but excess bromine might just increase the reaction's extent, not change the regiochemistry much.

2. C6H5-COOC2H5: The substituent here is an ethyl ester, COOEt. The carbonyl group is an electron-withdrawing group. So this is a deactivating group. Wait, but what's the directing effect here? I think esters are meta directors. Because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, so the ring is deactivated, and the substituent directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position. So in this case, the major product would be meta substitution. But wait, sometimes, if there's resonance, maybe not? Hmm. Alternatively, the ester group is an ortho/para director? No, wait, I'm pretty sure esters are meta directors. Because, for example, the nitro group is a strong meta director, and the ester, which is similar in being electron-withdrawing, would also direct meta.

Wait, wait wait. Another thought: the ester group is attached through an oxygen. O is more electronegative, so that could influence. Or maybe it's the carbonyl group that's the issue. For example, -COOR groups are meta directing. So in this case, the substituent is meta-directing, so the major product would be meta. So the para-isomer's fraction would be low for this compound.

3. C6H5-Cl: The substituent is Cl. As I thought earlier, Cl is an ortho/para director. So the incoming bromine will add at ortho or para positions. But because the reaction is with excess bromine, perhaps
