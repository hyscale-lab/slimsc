Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to think through it carefully. Let's take it step by step.

The question involves two reactions, and then analyzing their products using HPLC. The options give different numbers of peaks observed in both chiral and normal-phase HPLC. Hmm, I remember that HPLC can separate components based on their interaction with the stationary phase. Normal-phase HPLC usually uses a polar stationary phase, so polar compounds elute later. Chiral columns, on the other hand, separate enantiomers, so if the product has stereocenters, they will show up as separate peaks.

Let's look at each reaction first.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Structure-wise, that's (CH3)OCH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one means the ketone is at position 3. So structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-Me. Wait, wait, no. Let me draw it correctly.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But in this case, the substituent is at 5-methoxy. So the structure is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2? Wait, maybe it's better to think of the structure as:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the carbonyl is at C3. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2-CH3 ?

Wait, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. But if there's a methoxy group at position 5, which is the next carbon after the ketone. Let me number the carbons:

1   2   3   4   5   6
CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH
