Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the partition function Z for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I think I remember that the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-Î²E), right? So each state contributes a term based on its energy.

Wait, each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states for the system. I probably need to list all these states and calculate the energy for each, then sum up the exponential terms.

Let me list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3. Let's see:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

For each of these, I need to compute the energy E. The formula is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me compute each term.

Starting with state 1: All spins +1. So S1S2 = +1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

State 2: S3=-1. So S1S2= +1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1. Sum is 1+ (-1) + (-1) = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, no: the sum is (+1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, that's right. So E is J for state 2.

Similarly, state 3: S2=-1. So S1S2= -1, S1S3= +1, S2S3= -1. Sum is (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1. E = J again.

State 4: S2=-1, S3=-1. Compute each term. S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3= +1. Sum: (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1. So E=J.

Wait, wait. Wait a second, let's double-check that. State 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2: (+1)*(-1) = -1.

S1S3: (+1)*(-1) = -1.

S2S3: (-1)*(-1) = +1.

Adding them: (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1. So E is -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, the formula is E = -J*(sum). So sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each term is either +1 or -1.

So for state 4, sum is (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1. So E is -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, same as state 2 and 3. Interesting.

Moving to state 5: S1=-1, others +1.

S1S2: (-1)*(+1) = -1
