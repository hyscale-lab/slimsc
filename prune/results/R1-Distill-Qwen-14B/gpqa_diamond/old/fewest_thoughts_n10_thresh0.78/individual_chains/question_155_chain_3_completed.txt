Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the uncertainty in P_z given the state of the system. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(<P²> - <P>²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and then P_z squared.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Oh, but the state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So I should probably work with that.

First, I think I need to find the expectation value of P_z, which is <ψ|P_z|ψ>. And then the expectation value of P_z squared, <ψ|P_z²|ψ>. 

Let me write down the matrix for P_z. Oh right, it's given as:

P_z matrix:
[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So, the state vector ψ is a column vector [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

To compute <P_z>, I'll do ψ† P_z ψ. 

So, let's compute each part. The state is ψ = [a, b, c]^T where a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = -1/2.

Multiplying P_z with ψ: P_z ψ would be a vector.

Let me compute that:

First element: ħ * a + 0 * b + 0 * c = ħ * (-1/2) = -ħ/2
Second element: 0 * a + 0 * b + 0 * c = 0
Third element: 0 * a + 0 * b + (-ħ) * c = (-ħ)(-1/2) = ħ/2

So P_z ψ is [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, the inner product ψ† P_z ψ is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by P_z ψ.

Wait, wait, ψ is given as a real vector, right? Because all the components are real. So the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

So ψ† P_z ψ is the sum of each component multiplied together. 

So, (-1/2)*(-ħ/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + (-1/2)*(ħ/2) 

Calculating each term:
First term: (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4
Second term: 0
Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = -ħ/4

Adding them up: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0. So <P_z> is 0. That simplifies things a bit.

Next, I need to find <P_z²>. Since P_z is a diagonal matrix, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So the matrix P_z² is:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, ( -ħ )² ] = [ ħ², 0, 0; 0,0,0; 0,0, ħ² ]

So to compute <P_z²>, I do ψ† P_z² ψ.

Again, let's compute P_z² ψ first:

First element: ħ² * a = ħ² (-1/2)
Second element: 0
Third element: ħ² * c = ħ² (-1/2)

So P_z² ψ is [ - ħ²/2, 0, - ħ²/2 ]^T.

Then, ψ† P_z² ψ is the sum of the components:

(-1/2)*(- ħ²/2 ) + (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + (-1/2)*(- ħ²/2 )

Each term:

First: (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4
Second: 0
Third: (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4

Adding them: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So <P_z²> is ħ²/2.

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² )

Since <P_z> is zero, this becomes sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = (ħ)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which would be the answer. Alternatively, sometimes uncertainties are written with a square root of (something), but I think this fits.

But wait, let me double-check. The state is an eigenstate of P_x, but P_z and P_x don't commute, so the uncertainties shouldn't be zero. The calculation seems right.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in computing the inner product for <P_z>. Let me recheck that calculation.

ψ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

P_z ψ is [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]

So ψ† P_z ψ is (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2 )

Which is (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0. Correct.

So <P_z> is zero, and <P_z²> is (1/2) ħ². So the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2). So option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi$, we first calculate $P_z \psi$:

\[
P_z \psi = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute $\psi^\dagger P_z \psi$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi$, we first calculate $P_z^2 \psi$:

\[
P_z^2 \psi = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute $\psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right).
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$.

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$ and $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
