Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents A and B from the options given. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. Then, the product from the first reaction reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, looking again, the second reaction's starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Hmm, not sure about that structure, but maybe it's a nitrile group attached to a benzylphenyl group or something. Anyway, let's break it down step by step.

First reaction: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When ketones react with nucleophiles like CN-, they usually undergo nucleophilic addition. But wait, in the product, it's a hydroxy group adjacent to the nitrile. So perhaps it's a two-step process?

Wait, wait. Alternatively, when a ketone is treated with a cyanide nucleophile, it adds to the carbonyl group. So the ketone becomes a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone or aldehyde adds HCN (or CN- in a strong base) to form a compound with an alcohol and a cyanide group.

So the first reaction is forming a cyanohydrin. The general reaction for this is: ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. But the conditions matter. Usually, you need an acid catalyst for the addition. Because HCN is a weak acid, it doesn't react well without an acid catalyst. So adding H3O+ (which is option A or B) would protonate the CN- to make it a better nucleophile. Or perhaps it's a base that deprotonates something else.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- which is a good nucleophile. But without an acid, would the reaction
