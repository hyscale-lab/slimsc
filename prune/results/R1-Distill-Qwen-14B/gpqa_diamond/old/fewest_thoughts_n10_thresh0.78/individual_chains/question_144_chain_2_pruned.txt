Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of mesons and their properties. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. The formula I think I should be using is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates the lifetime (τ) to the energy width (Γ). The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δτ ≈ ℏ/2, where ℏ is the reduced Planck constant. So, τ ≈ ℏ / Γ.

But wait, wait. I think the uncertainty principle gives the relationship as Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. That's correct because Γ is the energy uncertainty, and τ is the time uncertainty. So, the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the lifetime by the velocity of the meson, right? Because distance is velocity multiplied by time. So, d = v * τ.

But now, I need to calculate the velocity of the meson. Since it's a high-energy particle, I should consider relativistic effects. The meson's total energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. I can find the relativistic gamma factor (γ) using E = γ m c². So, γ = E / (m c²). But since the units are in GeV, and m is in GeV/c² (because E = mc²), the units might cancel out correctly.

Wait, actually, the energy E is given in GeV, and m is in GeV/c² multiplied by c² gives GeV. So E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²). But since E and m are both in GeV and m is m c², perhaps in natural units where c=1, so E = γ m. So, γ would be E / m. Let me check: E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So, γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

But wait, I need to find the velocity. The gamma factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, v can be found from γ. Let me recall that formula. Let me rearrange it to solve for v.

Starting with γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Square both sides: γ² = 1 / (1 - v²/c²) → 1 - v²/c² = 1/γ² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/γ² → v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

Alternatively, another approach: since γ is large, maybe v is approximately c, but it's better to compute it accurately.

So, let's compute
