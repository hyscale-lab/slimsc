Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. Each particle has a specific energy based on its quantum number. But wait, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh right, spin-1/2 means they are fermions, right?

So, identical fermions have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. In a 1D infinite well, the primary quantum number is n, which determines the energy. The energy for each state is given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is the same as n²E, where E is the base energy they provided as E= π²ħ²/(2mL²).

But wait, since the particles are spin-1/2, each has a spin quantum number of ±1/2. So for each spatial state n, there are two possible spin states. That means each n can hold two particles, each with opposite spins.

The system has four particles. So I need to fill up the energy levels with these four, making sure no two particles are in the same quantum state.

Ground state would be the lowest energy. So, let's start filling the states.

First, each n can hold 2 particles (due to spin up and down). So for n=1, we can fit 2 particles. Then n=2 can hold another 2, but wait, but we have four particles in total.

Wait, wait. Let me think. For four particles, each with spin up and down in their respective n levels.

Ground state (lowest energy): first fill n=1 with two particles (each with opposite spins). Then n=2 can hold the next two. So the energy would be 2 particles in n=1 and 2 in n=2.

But wait, since the particles are fermions, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers. So for the spatial part, each n can have two particles with different spins. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (spins up and down), and the next two go into n=2 (spins up and down). So the energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

Each particle in n=1 contributes E*(1²) = E. There are two of them, so 2E. Then each in
