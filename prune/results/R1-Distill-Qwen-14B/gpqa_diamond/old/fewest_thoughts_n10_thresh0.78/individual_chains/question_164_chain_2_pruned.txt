Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, their radial velocity (RV) variations are given as sinusoidal with certain amplitudes. System_1 has 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and system_2 has 15 and 10. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass is the sum of the two stars in each system.

Hmm. I remember that in binary star systems, the more massive star usually orbits more slowly, but I'm not sure how that ties into the radial velocities. Oh wait, radial velocity is related to the Doppler shift as the stars move towards and away from us. The amplitude of the RV curve depends on the mass of the companion and the inclination of the orbit, but since both are binary systems showing eclipses, I think we can assume the orbits are edge-on, so inclination is 90 degrees. That probably means the full amplitude is observed.

Another thing I recall is Kepler's laws, particularly Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the masses and separation. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) * a³, where a is the separation. But wait, in binary stars, the two stars orbit around their common center of mass. So, each star's orbit has a radius a1 and a2, where a1 + a2 = a, the total separation. Also, M1 a1 = M2 a2 because the center of mass is the balance point.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for each star is related to their orbit. The formula for the semi-amplitude K for one star is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 + q)^(1/3) )) ), where q is the mass ratio M2/M1. Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I've heard
