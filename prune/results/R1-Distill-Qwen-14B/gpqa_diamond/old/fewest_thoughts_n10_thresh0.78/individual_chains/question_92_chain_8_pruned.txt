Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a bit of a mouthful. I think I should first figure out how many carbons and hydrogens are in this molecule. Let me count them.

Looking at each part:
- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH- : So that's two CH3 groups attached to a C which is double-bonded to another CH. So that's 3 carbons from each CH3, plus the central C and the CH, making 3*2 + 1 + 1 = 7 carbons here? Wait no, each CH3 is a methyl group. The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-. So that would be 3 carbons (two CH3 and one C) plus the CH which is another carbon. So that's 3+1=4 carbons in the first part, but wait, maybe I should count each part separately.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to count all the carbons in the entire molecule. Let me see:

The formula seems to be something like (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me write this as a chain:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : So (CH3)2C is a group, then a double bond to CH.
- Then -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- : So each of these parts adds more carbons.
- Then -CH=C(CH3)2 : Another double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should just count the number of C and H atoms in the molecule.

Each (CH3)2 group has 2 CH3, so each contributes 3 carbons. So in (CH3)2C=CH, the structure is (CH3)2-C=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, the first part is (CH3)2C=CH-, which is (CH3)2-C=CH-. So that's 2 methyl groups attached to a central carbon, which is double-bonded to a CH group. So the central carbon is connected to two CH3, one double bond
