Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem step by step. So, the question describes a series of reactions starting with (R)-(+)-Limonene. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to piece this together.

First, I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. It has a structure that includes a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group and some substituents. (R)-Limonene is a chiral molecule, so the stereochemistry is going to play a role in the reactions.

The first step is treating the methanol solution of limonene with Pd/C under hydrogen. I think this is a hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a catalyst typically used for hydrogenation, especially for reducing double bonds. Since limonene has a double bond in its structure, hydrogenation would add hydrogen across the double bond, turning it into a single bond. But how many equivalents of hydrogen are used? The question says 1 equivalent is consumed. So, limonene has one double bond, so it would be reduced to a single bond. The product after hydrogenation would be a cyclohexane derivative because the double bond (which was in the cyclohexene part) becomes a single bond.

Wait, limonene is actually a bicyclic compound. Let me think. Limonene's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative, right? So when hydrogenated, it would become bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. But wait, the question says it's a methanol solution. Hmm, maybe the hydrogenation is in methanol, which could lead to some other changes, like maybe an epoxide opening or an addition of something else. But no, Pd/C under hydrogen is usually just hydrogenation. So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene.

Wait, but limonene is (R) configuration. When the double bond is hydrogenated, the stereochemistry would change. For a hydrogenation of a double bond, if it's a syn addition, but wait, the starting structure is a bicyclic monoterpene. Let me think about the structure of limonene. It has a double bond in a ring, and when hydrogenated, the ring
