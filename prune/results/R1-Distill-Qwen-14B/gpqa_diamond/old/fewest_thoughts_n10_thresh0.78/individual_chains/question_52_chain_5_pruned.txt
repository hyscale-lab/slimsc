Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem talks about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is understanding how the temperature affects the energy levels of atoms. Since the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is: 

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k * T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the populations of the two energy levels.
- g2 and g1 are their respective statistical weights (degeneracy factors).
- E2 and E1 are their energies.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. I think I can find the energy difference using this wavelength. 

Wait, the energy difference ΔE can be found using the photon energy formula: 

ΔE = hc / λ

Where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

So first, let me calculate ΔE. But wait, I don't need the exact value in eV or anything; I can work in terms of k*T, since the ratio depends on the exponential of ΔE/(kT).

Alternatively, maybe I can express the ratio in terms of the temperatures. Because the ratio depends exponentially on T, the change in T from 6000 K to 5500 K will affect the ratio.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the temperature is lower (5500 K), the ratio n2/n1 is lower than when it was 6000 K. That makes sense because according to the Boltzmann factor, lower T means less population in higher energy levels, so n2 would decrease relative to n1.

But the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it does (T=5500 K). So the factor would be (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

Let me write the ratio as R = (n2/n
