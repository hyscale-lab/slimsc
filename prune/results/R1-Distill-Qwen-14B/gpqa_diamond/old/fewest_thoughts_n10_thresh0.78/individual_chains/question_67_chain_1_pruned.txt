Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their orbital angular momentum states. The state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. I need to find the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that for angular momentum coupling, the state is a combination of individual angular momenta. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. So each electron's l is 1, since p orbitals have l=1.

The state is |l1, l2, L, M>, right? So here, l1 is 1, l2 is 1, L is 2, and M is -1. So the combined angular momentum L is 2, and its z-component is -1ħ.

But wait, the question is about measuring L1z and L2z. Oh, right, L1z is the z-component of the first electron's angular momentum, and L2z the second's. So I need to find the probability that both are -ħ.

I think I should think about how the state |l1, l2, L, M> is constructed from the product states of each electron. Since each electron is in the p orbital, their individual states are |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>, right?

The total state is a combination of these, but when L and M are given, it's a specific combination. So to find the probability, I need to expand this coupled state into the product basis and see what the coefficients are for the state where each m1 and m2 is -1.

Wait, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. So M is -1. But each electron's m can be -1, 0, or +1. So if both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum would be -2. But the M here is -1. So how is that possible?

Oh, wait, because the coupled state is a sum of states with different m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M = -1. So in the expansion, the product states have m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, but the question is asking for the case where both m1 and m2 are -1. Let me think:
