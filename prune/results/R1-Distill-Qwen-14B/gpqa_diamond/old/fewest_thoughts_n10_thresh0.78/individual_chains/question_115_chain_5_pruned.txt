Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand it. So, an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis, but in opposite directions. The electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right. Their Lorentz factors are 4 and 2, respectively. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions were measured. One is moving in the upper-right direction, and the other in the lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, so Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So the electron has gamma_e =4, and the positron gamma_p=2. I remember that the Lorentz factor relates to the kinetic energy, but wait, in this case, since they are annihilating into photons, I think it's about their rest mass and relativistic momentum.

Wait, when particles annihilate, they transform their mass into energy, producing photons. So the total energy and momentum must be conserved.

So, the setup is that the electron and positron collide head-on. The electron is moving along the positive x-direction (from left to right), and the positron is moving along the negative x-direction (since it's moving from the right). Wait, no, wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so that's the same direction as the electron if the electron is moving left to right. Wait, no. Wait, the electron is moving from the left (so along positive x-direction). The positron is moving from the right, which would be along the negative x-direction, correct. So they're moving towards each other.

So their velocities are in opposite directions. So, when they collide, their momenta are opposite in direction.

Wait, but wait: the positron is a particle with the same mass as the electron, but positive charge. So the positron's momentum would be opposite in direction to the electron's.

So, the electron's momentum is in the +x direction, and the positron's is in the -x direction. So, the total momentum before collision is
