Okay, I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So I need to check each compound to see if they have any such centers or other factors that cause optical activity.

Let's go through each one step by step.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, actually, the formula is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, maybe I should draw it. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2, but wait, butene is four carbons with a double bond starting at C1. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 which has a methyl group. So structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3? Wait, but that would be 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is part of a double bond with the second carbon, which has a methyl group, and then the third and fourth carbons.

But regardless, the main point is whether there's a chiral center. Let me think: the molecule is (Z) isomer, but for a molecule to have optical activity, it needs to have a chiral center. So, does this compound have any? Let's see. The structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, so Cl-CH2-CH(CH
