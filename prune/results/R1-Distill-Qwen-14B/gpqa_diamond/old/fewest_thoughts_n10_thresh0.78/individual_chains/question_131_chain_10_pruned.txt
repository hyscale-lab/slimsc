Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question starts by talking about a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When that's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR spectra. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The NOESY NMR results show that the major has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn’t. I need to figure out which resonances are connected in the major product.

First, let me sketch out the structures involved. The starting point is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis alkene. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride. Since the alkene is cis, when it dehydrates, the geometry might influence the structure of the anhydride. 

The anhydride's NMR: 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a strong upfield shift—wait, 7 ppm is actually a deshielded region, typically for aromatic or conjugated systems. Wait, 7 ppm is more like aromatic protons. But wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkyne? No, alkyne protons are usually higher. Hmm. Wait, wait, another thought: if the anhydride is a cyclic structure, like a cyclic anhydride, maybe the protons are part of a conjugated system or maybe in a bridge structure.

Looking at the 13C NMR, there are two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 is probably a carbonyl group or an sp² hybridized carbon. Wait, 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl, like an ester or an anhydride. So that makes sense because the starting material is an anhydride. So the 137 ppm could be the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, maybe in a ring structure.

So the anhydride structure: since the starting material is a cis diacid, the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. The cis diene would lead to a structure where the two carboxylic acid groups are on the same face. So the anhydride formed would have a bridge structure, maybe a five-membered ring? Wait, no, a cyclic anhydride of a diacid is usually a five or six-membered ring, depending on the starting acid's structure.

Wait, but the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak. That suggests that all the protons in question are equivalent. So maybe the anhydride has a symmetric structure. For example, if the two substituents on the anhydride are the same and the ring is symmetric, the protons would be equivalent.

Wait, the
