Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state is given as |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, S_z. So, they form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system.

First, I think I need to normalize this state. Because it says it's proportional, meaning we'll have to find the normalization constant. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So, let's compute the inner product. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so when we take the inner product, it's |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + ib|^2 is a^2 + b^2.

Then |2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

Adding them together: 2 + 5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, okay. So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about measuring the eigenstates of an operator with a specific matrix representation. The matrix A has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. Hmm. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2.

Wait, what operator has that form? Oh right, the Pauli matrices. Let me think. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. But the given matrix here is:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Wait, that's similar to (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the X matrix has 1s off-diagonal. So A is (ħ/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So the operator in question is sigma_x multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of this operator. So the eigenstates are the same as those of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. Let me recall, the eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively, multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The Pauli X matrix's eigenvalues are +1 and -1, and the eigenstates are those combinations. So for the operator A, which is (ħ/2) sigma_x, the eigenstates would be the same as sigma_x's, and the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(+1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenstates of the operator A. So the possible outcomes when measuring the operator A would be ħ/2 and -ħ/2, and the probability would be the square of the amplitude when |alpha> is projected onto the corresponding eigenstates.

Wait, no. Because |alpha> is expressed in terms of the z-basis. So perhaps I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (the x-basis), and then find the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value <A> directly, using the state |alpha>.

Wait, the question is asking for the probability of measuring each eigenstate of the operator. Oh wait, no, the operator's eigenstates are not the same as eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. Because the operator A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but the eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's eigenstates.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, defined as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate (i.e., the square of the amplitude when projecting |alpha> onto each eigenstate), I need to compute <+x|alpha> and <-x|alpha>, then square their magnitudes.

Let me define |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, let's compute <+x|alpha>:

 <+x| alpha> = [ ( <+x| up> ) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) + ( <+x| down> ) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

But <+x| up> = 1/sqrt(2), because |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the inner product is 1/sqrt(2).

Similarly, <+x| down> = 1/sqrt(2).

So, <+x| alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7)
= [ (1+i + 2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))
= (3) / (sqrt(14)).

So the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14), so the probability is (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈0.6429.

Similarly, let's compute <-x| alpha>.

 <-x| alpha> = [ ( <-x| up> ) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) + ( <-x| down> ) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

 <-x| up> = 1/sqrt(2)
 <-x| down> = -1/sqrt(2)

So,

 <-x| alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) (1+i) + (-1/sqrt(2))(2 - i) ] / sqrt(7)
= [ (1+i - 2 + i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))
= [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(14) 

Wait, let me re-calculate that.

Wait, 1/sqrt(2) (1+i) + (-1/sqrt(2))(2 -i) = [ (1+i) + (-1)(2 - i) ] / sqrt(2)
= [1 + i -2 + i ] / sqrt(2)
= [ (-1) + 2i ] / sqrt(2)

So the amplitude is (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(2) divided by sqrt(7), which is (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

So the magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but 9/14
