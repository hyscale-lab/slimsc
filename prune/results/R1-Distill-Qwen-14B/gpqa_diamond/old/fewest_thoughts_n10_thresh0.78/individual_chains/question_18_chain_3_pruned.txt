Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me read it again. Two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres using some abundance ratios given.

Wait, the data provided includes [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, right, these are logarithmic abundance ratios. So I'll need to convert these into actual ratios to find the numbers.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and similarly for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. So, I can find the solar abundances for Fe and Mg relative to H.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Compute the solar abundance of Fe and Mg in terms of nFe/nH and nMg/nH.
2. Use the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] values for the stars to find their abundances relative to H.
3. Use the [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] ratios to find the Si abundance relative to Fe and Mg, and then to H.
4. Calculate the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2.

Wait, let's start with the Sun. 

For the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Therefore, nFe/nH = 10^-4.5. Similarly for Mg, log10(nMg/nH)=7 -12= -5, so nMg/nH =10^-5.

But wait, the Sun's data is given as [Fe/H]_sun and [Mg/H]_sun. No, wait, the given data is for the Sun's photosphere, so for Star_1 and Star_2, the [Fe/H] is their ratio relative to the Sun's.

Wait no, [Fe/H] is defined as log10(nFe/nH - star / nFe/nH - sun). But the way the question is phrased, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 dex. So their Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun's. Same with Mg for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0, so nMg/nH for Star_2 is same as Sun's.

Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify. For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0, which means that the abundance of Fe in Star_1 relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So (nFe_1 / nH_1) = (nFe_sun / nH_sun). Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0, so (nMg_2 / nH_2)= (nMg_sun / nH_sun).

Similarly, for the other ratios: [Si/Fe]_1=0.3. So log10(nSi_1 / nFe_1) = 0.3. So nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^0.3.

For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. So log10(nMg_2 / nSi_2) =0.3. So nMg_2 = nSi_2 *10^0.3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me structure this.

First
