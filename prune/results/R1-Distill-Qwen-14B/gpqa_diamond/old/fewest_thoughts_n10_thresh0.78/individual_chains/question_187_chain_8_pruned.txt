Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used for high-resolution spectroscopy. It's part of the VLT, so it's a big telescope. The question asks about detectability based on signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a one-hour exposure.

Wait, what factors affect the S/N? I think S/N depends on the brightness of the star, the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the instrument's efficiency. Also, maybe the wavelength range and the star's spectral type, but I'm not sure.

The formula I vaguely remember is S/N proportional to (flux * sqrt(exposure time)) divided by some noise terms. But perhaps a more practical approach is to use the concept of magnitude limits.

ESPRESSO's sensitivity—what's its typical limit? I think ESPRESSO is designed for very faint stars, like down to about magnitude 30 or something, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, that seems too faint. Maybe I'm mixing it up with other instruments. Alternatively, perhaps each star's V magnitude is 15, but their apparent magnitudes vary based on distance.

Wait, the stars in options c, d, e, f have absolute magnitudes of 15, but different distances. Absolute magnitude is how bright they are intrinsically. So I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes to see how bright they appear from Earth.

Oh right, the formula for apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 log10(d / 10), where d is distance in parsecs, and M is absolute magnitude.

Let's compute each:

c) 10 pc: m =15 +5 log(10/10)=15+0=15.

e) 5 pc: m=15 +5 log(5/10)=15 +5 log(0.5)=15 +5*(-0.3010)=15-1.505≈13.495.

d)200 pc: m=15 +5 log(200/10)=15 +5 log(20)=15 +5*(1.3010)=15+6.505≈21.505.

f)50 pc: m=15 +5 log(50/10)=15 +5 log(5)=15 +5*(0.69897)=15+3.494≈18.494.

So their apparent magnitudes are: c=15, e≈13.5, d≈21.5, f≈18.5.

Now, how bright are these? The lower the magnitude, the brighter the star.

ESPRESSO's S/N requirement is 10 per binned pixel in 1 hour. So, which stars are bright enough?

But wait, what's the typical S/N ESPRESSO can achieve for a given magnitude?

Alternatively, think about the V magnitude. The brighter the star (lower m), the more photons, the higher S/N.

I think ESPRESSO is more sensitive to brighter stars. Let's think about the V band. The faintest stars detectable by ESPRESSO might be around magnitude 20 or 25? Wait, no, because I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, but not necessarily the most sensitive for very faint objects. Alternatively, perhaps the sensitivity depends on the exposure time and the star's brightness.

Wait, according to some sources, the ESPRESSO spectrograph can reach S/N ratios of about 10 per pixel for stars around magnitude 20 in a few hours. But since here the exposure is 1 hour, perhaps that would limit it to brighter stars.

Alternatively, let
