Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let's see. I'll try to think through it step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Oh wait, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, the initial mass is M, and after fission, the two fragments' combined rest mass is 0.99M. That means some mass was converted into kinetic energy or maybe other forms, but the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.

I need to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation of T1. So, probably, I have to calculate T1 both ways and subtract them.

First, let's figure out the masses of the two fragments. Let's call the less massive one m, so the more massive is 2m. The sum is m + 2m = 3m, which equals 0.99M. So, 3m = 0.99M â†’ m = 0.33M. So the lighter fragment is 0.33M, the heavier is 0.66M.

But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum of the two fragments after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

Since momentum p = gamma * m*v, but for each fragment, their velocities might be different. But since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum must cancel out. So, the more massive fragment will have a lower speed to balance the momentum. Let's think in terms of velocities.

In the center of mass frame, the two will move in opposite directions with the same speed. But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the center of mass frame is the same as the initial rest frame. So the two fragments will have equal and opposite momenta. So the momentum of the heavier one (2m) is p, the lighter one (m) is p as well, but in the opposite direction. Wait, but 2m and m have different masses. So maybe their velocities are different.

Wait, no. Momentum is p = gamma m v. But because the system is initially at rest, the total momentum is zero. So, p1 + p2 = 0. So p1 = -p2. So, gamma1 m v1 = gamma2 m2 v2? Hmm, not exactly, because the masses are different.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that in the center of momentum frame, but wait, since the nucleus is at rest, the center of mass is the same as the rest frame. So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, p1 = -p2. So, p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2 = gamma2 m2 v2. Since p1 = -p2, their magnitudes are equal. So, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But this seems complicated.
