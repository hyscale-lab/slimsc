Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about optical isomerism in different organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The question gives four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each combining some of the four. I remember that optical isomerism has to do with the presence of chiral centers, which are atoms (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups. If a molecule has a chiral center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Then, the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions, and 6 and 6' are nitro groups. So each phenyl ring has a COOCH3 group at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. Wait, but the central part is a biphenyl, which is connected in such a way that the two rings are attached via a single bond. That single bond allows for rotation, but wait, does that affect the symmetry?

Wait, but the substituents on each ring: each ring has two substituents. If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then maybe there's a possibility for stereoisomerism. But wait, optical isomerism requires a chiral center. So I need to check if any of the carbons attached to these substituents are chiral.

Wait, the substituents are esters (COOCH3) and nitro groups. The central biphenyl might have some symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule symmetrical, maybe it's not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on opposite sides, leading to a situation where the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, but the positions are 2 and 2', so if each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and nitro at 6, maybe that's a symmetrical arrangement. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl system has a plane of symmetry, which would make the molecule achiral, so no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to a chiral center. Wait, but wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which requires a chiral center. So if the molecule has a carbon that's connected to four different groups, that's a chiral center.

Wait, the substituents are on the phenyl rings. The carbons on the phenyl rings are all bonded to other carbons, but are any of them chiral? Wait, the ester groups are O-CO-OCH3, but the carbons in the ester group would be connected to other groups. Let me think: each COOCH3 group is attached to the phenyl ring. The carbon in the ester (the O-CO-OCH3) is connected to the oxygen and the carbonyl group, but would that be a chiral center? No, because in an ester, the carbonyl is O=C-O-, so the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and connected to the phenyl and the OR group. So that's trigonal, not tetrahedral, so it's not a chiral center.

So maybe the central part of the molecule has some symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule has a mirror plane. Suppose each ring has the same substituents. Then the molecule could be symmetrical. So, for compound 1, I'm not seeing a chiral center, so it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought. Biphenyl systems can have E and Z isomerism if there's a substituent on each ring that's on the same side or opposite. But that's geometric isomerism, not optical. Oh, but if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. Or perhaps if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl has a certain configuration. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me move on to the next compound and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. But 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.

Wait, but the hydroxyl group is on the second carbon (the middle carbon). So let's see: the middle carbon (CH2) has groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH3 groups? No, wait.

Wait, wait, let me structure it. 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2 would be the middle carbon. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Maybe it's better to draw it as CH3-C(OH)H-COOH, but wait, that would be more like 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of it as (HOCH2)CH2COOCH3 as the ester. Wait, no, for the ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

The central carbon (CH2) is connected to OH, another CH2 group (which is connected to the COOCH3), and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of the molecule as:

Carbon chain: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that can't be right. Because propanoate would be three carbons. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So the middle carbon is CH2. Wait, no, wait—if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is O

So, the structure is: 

The carboxylic acid is at position 1. The hydroxyl is at position 2. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoic acid.

So the structure is: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but the middle carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- OH,

- one CH2 (connected to COOCH3),

- and two CH2 groups? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is: 

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, I think I'm confusing the structure. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, it's CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. But as an ester, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon is CH(OH), connected to CH3, COOCH3, and OH. Wait, no. Let me count the substituents on the CH(OH) group.

The middle carbon (position 2) is attached to:

- One CH3 group (from the left),

- One OH group,

- One COOCH3 group (from the right),

- And another CH3? Wait, no, perhaps. Alternatively, the structure is:

The carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (right),

- and what's the fourth group? Wait, the middle carbon is CH(OH), so it's connected to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and the rest is... wait, that's three substituents. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which would have the hydroxyl on the first CH2, and the COOCH3 on the third carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

Structure:

Carboxylic acid group is COOCH3 (ester).

The chain is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, so the middle CH2 is connected to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (the left and the right),

- and the COOCH3.

Wait, no, the middle group is CH2, but then the groups would be:

On the middle carbon (second carbon): connected to CH2(OH), CH2(COOCH3), and two H's. That can't be a chiral center because it has two H's and two CH2 groups. No, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)COOCH2CH(OH)CH3.

No, that would be different. Maybe I'm getting confused, but let's focus on whether any carbon has four different groups.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure would have a carbon where the hydroxyl is attached. Let's say that's the central carbon. So the groups attached to that carbon would be:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and two CH3 groups?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have OH on the second carbon.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The middle carbon (second carbon) is CH2(OH). So it's connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and two CH2 groups (left and right? Or perhaps it's a CH2 in the middle. Wait, no, the middle carbon is CH2(OH), which is connected to the first carbon (CH2-) and the third carbon (CH2COOCH3). So the substituents are:

- Two CH2 groups (from either side),

- OH,

- and the third CH2 is from the COOCH3.

Wait, I'm getting tangled. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the hydroxyl is on a carbon that is connected to three different groups, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH3? No, wait, that would make it CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the other side is connected to another CH3? No, wait, because the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon has:

- CH3 (from the left),

- COOCH3 (from the right),

- OH,

- and the fourth bond is to another CH3. So no, that's not possible because that would require four bonds.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think of the actual structure.

2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. Replacing the -OH in the carboxylic acid with an ester group (COOCH3), and the 2-hydroxy group would be on the second carbon.

So the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH, and the ester is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon is the CH(OH) part. Let's check the substituents on this carbon.

The substituents are:

1. CH3 group (from the left),

2. OH group,

3. COOCH3 group (from the right),

4. And another CH3 group? No, wait, the carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (left),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (right),

- and what else? The fourth substituent is a hydrogen? No, because that would make it CH(OH), which has four bonds: two from CH3 and COOCH3, OH, and one more bond. Oh wait, the central carbon must be connected to four groups. So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, so the central CH(OH) is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another H? No, that would give it four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So that's four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So that would make it a chiral center.

Wait, but H isn't the same as any other group. So the four groups are: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. All four are different. Oh wait, H is a substituent, so the central carbon has four different groups. So that's a chiral center. Therefore, this compound would exhibit optical isomerism because it has a chiral center.

So compound 2 has optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, where Ph is the phenyl group. The structure is two phenyl groups attached to a ketone (C=O) group. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (from the ketone). So the structure is:

Ph–C(O)–Ph.

The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. The substituents on the carbonyl carbon are two phenyl groups and two oxygens (from the double bond), but wait, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's only connected to two R groups (the two phenyls) and the double bond. So it's trigonal, not tetrahedral. Therefore, no chiral centers. Also, since benzophenone is symmetrical, it's not chiral. So compound 3 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid, with the structure HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is in the trans configuration. Wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans isomer, while maleic acid is cis.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where the two acid groups are esterified with methanol. So structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3? No, wait, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, so dimethyl fumarate is the ester: CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3.

Wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C=CH-COOCH3
   |
   OCH3

Wait, maybe I should draw it correctly. The structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

No, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH in the trans configuration. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond in between. No, wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, but the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the substituents on either side are the carboxylic acid groups. So the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's not correct because that's succinic acid. Wait, no, I might be mixing up fumaric and maleic acids.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, which is the trans (E) isomer, with the two carboxylic acid groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, the dimethyl ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3.

Wait, but wait, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂H? No, that can't be right. Let me get this right.

But in any case, the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a double bond that leads to geometric isomerism.

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality, not geometric isomerism.

Wait, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2=C(COOCH3)2?

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to say that the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂–C=C–CH₂
           |
           COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Fumaric acid is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, but no, that's not correct. Let's correct this.

Actually, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: the structure is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH? No, that's not correct. No, fumaric acid is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, but with a double bond in between. So it's HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, but that's not the case. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about this differently.

Fumaric acid is (E)-HO2C–CH=CH–CO2H. So, the double bond is between the two middle carbons, and the carboxylic acid groups are on either end. So, the structure has a double bond and the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

When you esterify fumaric acid with methanol, you get dimethyl fumarate, which would have the structure:

COOCH3
|
CH₂–C=C–CH₂
           |
           COOCH3

No, wait. No, the correct structure is:

CH₂=C(COOCH3)–CH₂COOCH3? No, I think it's more like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂=C(COOCH3)–CH₂–COOCH3 ?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂=C(COOCH3)–CH₂–COOCH3 ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

So, the molecule has a double bond between the first and second carbons, and each of the second and third carbons has a COOCH3 group attached. Wait, that can't be right because that would only have two COOCH3 groups.

Alternatively, the structure is:

The central double bond is between two carbons, each of which is connected to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group from the ester. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The central part is a double bond (C=C), with each carbon of the double bond attached to two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, no, that's not possible because each carbon can only have four bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Each of the two middle carbons has one COOCH3 group and is connected via a double bond. So:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But that's not possible because each C in the double bond would only have two substituents. Alternatively, perhaps each of those carbons has another substituent, like a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the structure. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's not correct. I think the correct structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, which is succinic acid, but that's not the case. Let me find a better way. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, which is an (E) isomer. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes:

CH₂=C(COOCH3)–CH₂–COOCH3.

Wait, no, because in fumarate, each of the two middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) has a COOCH3 group. So the structure would have the double bond between the two carbons, each of which has a COOCH3 group attached. So each of those carbons would have two COOCH3 groups? That can't be right because each carbon can have only four bonds.

Wait, I think the structure is:

The double bond is between C2 and C3.

So:

COOCH3
|
C1 – C2 = C3 – C4
           |
           COOCH3

Wait, but that leaves C2 and C3 with only two substituents each. So perhaps each of C2 and C3 has a COOCH3 group and another group (like CH3 from the ester).

Wait, no, the esterification replaces the -OH of the carboxylic acid with OCH3. So each of the two carboxylic acid groups becomes COOCH3. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂–C=C–CH₂
           |
           COOCH3

Wait, no, that would imply four substituents on each of the double-bond carbons. Let me think again. Each carbon in the double bond (C2 and C3) would have two substituents: one COOCH3 and another CH3 group. Wait, no, that can't be right because each would have three substituents: the double bond, a COOCH3, and a CH3, which isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps each has a COOCH3 and a CH₂ group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH₂=C(COOCH3)–CH₂–COOCH3.

But then, each of the carbons in the double bond (C2 and C3) would have:

- C2: connected to COOCH3, CH₂–, and the double bond to C3.

- C3: connected to COOCH3, CH₂–, and the double bond to C2.

Wait, but that would give each carbon three substituents plus the double bond. So each carbon would have three substituents and a double bond, making four bonds in total. So each of those carbons (C2 and C3) would have three substituents and a double bond, but that would make them trigonal, not tetrahedral.

So, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let me think. The substituents on C2 and C3 would be:

C2: CH2–, COOCH3, and the double bond to C3.

C3: CH2–, COOCH3, and the double bond to C2.

Wait, but each of these carbons is part of a double bond, so they're sp² hybridized, which means they can't be chiral centers because chiral centers are sp³. So, that would mean that the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, I might be forgetting something. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) ester of fumaric acid. Since the substituents on each end are the same (each has a COOCH3 group), the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it non-chiral. So, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, but I thought that when the groups on either side of the double bond are different, it could lead to optical isomerism. Wait, no, because the double bond in fumarate is between two identical groups (each end has a COOCH3 group), so the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it's not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate is a symmetrical molecule and thus not chiral, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl 2,3-fumarate, which has the structure CH₂=C(COOCH3)–CH₂–COOCH3. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, that would be (dimethyl (E)-fumarate), where each of the double-bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and a methyl group. But that can't be right because the COOCH3 is an ester group, so perhaps the structure is:

CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, that's possible. So each carbon of the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached. But wait, that would require each carbon to have four bonds, but then each would have:

- One double bond (C=C),

- Two COOCH3 groups,

- And another substituent, like a CH3 group.

Wait, no, I'm getting really stuck on this. Let me approach it from a different angle.

If the molecule has a double bond and the groups on either side are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. For example, in (E)-stilbene, which is (E)-1,2-diphenylethylene, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. Similarly, dimethyl fumarate, if it's symmetrical, would not be chiral.

So, if dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl (2,3)-fumarate, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I've heard that some diesters can exhibit optical isomerism if they have a chiral center. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is not symmetrical and thus has a chiral center. Wait, let me think about the substituents.

Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So, the structure is:

CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, no, that's not possible because each carbon in the double bond can only have three substituents plus the double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂–C=C–CH₂–COOCH3

Wait, I'm getting too confused. Let me try to think if there's a chiral center in dimethyl fumarate.

If the molecule has a carbon that is connected to four different groups, then it's chiral. If not, then it's not. Let's say that in dimethyl fumarate, each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (like two COOCH3 groups), then those carbons wouldn't be chiral. But if one of the carbons is attached to two different groups, then maybe it's a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each of the double-bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and another group that's different, making them chiral centers. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers because the substituents on each double-bond carbon are the same. For example, each has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Or perhaps each has two COOCH3 groups, making them non-chiral.

Hmm. I'm not confident about this. Let me think about another approach. If dimethyl fumarate is (E)-configured, then it's symmetrical and thus not chiral. If it's (Z)-configured, perhaps it's not symmetrical, but wait, no, because (Z) would have the same groups on each side, leading to symmetry as well. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a plane of symmetry. For (E)-dimethyl fumarate, the structure would be such that each end is a mirror image, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, in dimethyl fumarate, if the substituents on either end of the double bond are not the same, perhaps it's chiral.

Wait, but in the case of fumarate, both substituents on the double bond are COOCH3 groups, so the molecule is symmetrical. So it's not chiral, and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I might have to look this up, but since I can't, I'll have to proceed with what I think.

So, to recap:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I'm not seeing a chiral center. Maybe it's symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: has a chiral center, so yes.

3. Benzophenone: no chiral centers, symmetrical, so no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: I'm not sure. Based on earlier reasoning, perhaps it's symmetrical and thus no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not confident about compound 4. Another thought: maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, perhaps the two ester groups are on different carbons, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, if the structure is such that the two COOCH3 groups are on adjacent carbons and the central carbon is connected to four different groups, then it would be chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

I think I'm stuck on this. Let me try to think of other possibilities. If the molecule is symmetrical, it can't be chiral. For example, if the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, and the rest of the molecule is symmetrical, then it's not chiral.

So, if dimethyl fumarate is (E), then the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, leading to a symmetrical structure, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I've heard that some fumarate esters can have cis and trans configurations, leading to diastereomers. But diastereomers are not about optical isomerism per se, but about different stereoisomers.

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism due to chirality. So, if a molecule has a chiral center, it can have enantiomers, leading to optical activity.

So, if dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center, it would exhibit optical isomerism. Otherwise, not.

Wait, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because the substituents on the double bond are the same on each side. So dimethyl fumarate is not chiral.

But I'm not confident. Let me think about other examples. For instance, maleic anhydride is (Z), while fumaric acid is (E). Maleic anhydride is not symmetrical, so it's chiral and has optical isomerism. Wait, but no, maleic anhydride is a planar molecule with a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So it doesn't have optical isomerism. Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. Hmm.

Wait, no. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, so it's achiral, meaning it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Fumaric acid, being (E), is also symmetrical and thus achiral. So, if dimethyl fumarate is (E), it should be symmetrical and thus not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, in that case, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is not symmetrical because the substituents on the double bond are different. But in this case, the substituents are both COOCH3, so they're the same. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

So, putting it all together:

Which compounds exhibit optical isomerism?

1. No (no chiral center).

2. Yes (chiral center).

3. No.

4. No.

So the only compound with optical isomerism is 2. So looking at the options:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → no, because 4 doesn't.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → 3 doesn't.

D) 1 and 2 → no, because 1 doesn't.

Wait, but wait. Did I miss something? Let me check compound 4 again. If dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical. So the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality.

So, unless dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere, not on the double bond. For example, maybe one of the ester groups is attached in a way that creates a chiral center.

Wait, the ester groups are COOCH3. The carbonyl carbons are double-bonded and thus not chiral. The methyl groups (OCH3) are attached to oxygen and thus not chiral centers. So perhaps the central carbon isn't a chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to a chiral center. I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, among the four compounds, only compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.

Looking back at the options:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → no, because 4 doesn't.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → no.

D) 1 and 2 → no, because 1 doesn't.

Wait, none of the options fit. Because according to my analysis, only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But looking at the options again:

Option A says 1, 2, and 4.

Option D says 1 and 2.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1.

Let me revisit compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl with two phenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Each phenyl ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a COOCH3 group at position 2.

So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. Let me visualize the structure. The biphenyl group is such that each ring has substituents in the 2 and 6 positions relative to the connection point (position 1 and 1').

So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para positions relative to each other. So each ring would have substituents in para positions, making each ring symmetrical. Thus, the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, compound 1 doesn't have a chiral center.

Hmm, I think I'm confident now that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none have only 2. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → includes 1 and 4, which I think don't.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → no.

D) 1 and 2 → no.

Wait, this suggests I may have made a mistake in assessing compound 4.

Wait, perhaps I got compound 4 wrong. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

If the structure is such that the two COOCH3 groups are on adjacent carbons with a double bond, and the substituents are arranged in a way that there's a chiral center, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH₂=C(COOCH3)–CH2–COOCH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, that would imply the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2–C=C–CH2–COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is (CH2COOCH3)2C=CH2. No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the molecule as having a central carbon that's connected to two ester groups and two other substituents. For example, if the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–C–CH2–COOCH3
              |
              O

Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a central carbon that's connected to two COOCH3 groups and two other groups, making it a chiral center.

Wait, if the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)–C=CH2(COOCH3), then each of the two middle carbons would have a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a different arrangement, leading to a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a bridge or a ring that creates a chiral center. No, in dimethyl fumarate, it's a straight-chain molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a stereogenic center at one of the carbons. Let me think: if one of the carbons has four different substituents, then it's chiral.

Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, if the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)–CH2–COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one attached to CH2–COOCH3 and CH2 on the other side) might have substituents like:

- CH2–C=C–,

- COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups,

But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon has:

- a COOCH3,

- a CH2 group,

- a double bond,

- and another substituent, making it a chiral center.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I've heard that dimethyl fumarate is used in pharmaceuticals as a chiral auxiliary. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diastereomer, not an enantiomer.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking again at the options:

None of the options have only compound 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4.

Another perspective: what if dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center? Let's consider the structure again. If the structure is such that the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side, making the molecule asymmetrical. Wait, but in that case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry only if the groups are arranged symmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center because the substituents on the double bond are different. For example, if one side has a COOCH3 and the other has a different group, but in fumarate, both are COOCH3. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the number of stereoisomers. If a molecule has n stereogenic centers, it can have 2^n stereoisomers. If dimethyl fumarate has one chiral center, it would have two enantiomers, leading to optical isomerism.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, given the time I've spent, I think I should proceed based on my initial assessment.

So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them say only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A includes 1, 2, and 4.

Option D includes 1 and 2.

But I thought 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl group with each phenyl ring having substituents at positions 2 and 6. Each of those substituents is a nitro group and a COOCH3 group.

Wait, but the substituent positions are 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para positions relative to each other. So, each ring is symmetrical, but the arrangement on the two rings may not be symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical in a way that makes it achiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, but if each ring has two substituents at para positions, the molecule as a whole could be symmetrical, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center at the biphenyl's connecting point. Wait, the biphenyl has a single bond connecting the two rings. That single bond can rotate, so any substituents on the rings would be able to rotate as well, potentially leading to a situation where the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would be achiral. For example, if both rings have substituents in the same positions relative to the connecting bond, the molecule would be symmetrical and thus not chiral.

But if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical, then the molecule would have a chiral center.

Wait, but the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Since 2 and 6 are para positions relative to the connecting point (position 1), the substituents are in positions that are symmetrical across the ring. So the molecule as a whole would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, back to the initial assessment, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't include an option where only 2 is correct.

Looking again at the options:

A) 1, 2, and 4 → includes 1 and 4, which I think don't.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → no.

D) 1 and 2 → no.

Hmm. There's a problem here because none of the options match my conclusion. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4.

Another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But another possibility is that the molecule is chiral because the substituents on either side of the double bond are different, but in this case, they're the same.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on the double bond are both COOCH3 groups, so the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the molecule has two chiral centers. For example, each of the carbons adjacent to the ester groups is a chiral center.

Wait, if the structure is:

CH₂=C(COOCH3)–CH₂–COOCH3.

Then, each of the CH₂ groups adjacent to the double bond would be attached to:

- C=C,

- COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups.

No, that wouldn't make them chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon (the one between the two CH₂ groups) is connected to four different groups, making it a chiral center.

Wait, but that carbon is connected to:

- Two CH₂ groups,

- A C=C,

- And another group.

No, that can't be right.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck again. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll proceed with the assumption that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing one of the compounds.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again. If dimethyl fumarate is not symmetrical, then it would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on the double bond are different, making the molecule asymmetrical. For example, if one substituent is COOCH3 and the other is something else, but in this case, both are COOCH3, so that's not the case.

Hmm. I think I'll have to proceed with the information I have and choose the option that includes only compound 2, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on adjacent carbons with a double bond in between, leading to a situation where the molecule has a chiral center.

Wait, for example, if the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, then each of the CH groups would be bonded to:

- H,

- COOCH3,

- and the double bond.

But that would make each of those carbons connected to three substituents and a double bond, so they're trigonal, not tetrahedral, and thus not chiral centers.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. I think I have to make an educated guess.

Based on my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I missed that compound 4 has a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1, 2, and 4). But I'm not convinced.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate compound 4.

Wait, another possibility is that dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center because the two ester groups are on adjacent carbons with a double bond, creating a situation where the central carbon is a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3)CH2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Another thought: perhaps the molecule has a bridge or a ring that creates chirality, but I don't think so.

I think I've spent enough time. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) shows optical isomerism. But since the options don't include this, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1, 2, and 4.

B) 3 and 4.

C) 2 and 3.

D) 1 and 2.

If I'm wrong about compound 4, and it actually exhibits optical isomerism, then the correct answer would be option A (if 1 also does) or option D (if 1 doesn't, but 2 and 4 do). But I don't think 1 does.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me think about what the structure of dimethyl fumarate actually is.

Upon checking (using memory), dimethyl fumarate has the structure CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. Each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups, making them symmetrical and thus not chiral. So, the molecule is symmetrical and doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Therefore, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in compound 4: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-configured, making it asymmetrical and thus chiral. But I thought (E) and (Z) are about geometric isomerism, not optical.

Wait, but (Z) would have the same groups on each side, making it symmetrical. (E) would have substituents opposite, but in the case of COOCH3 on both ends, it's still symmetrical.

Hmm. I think I have to go with the initial conclusion that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, including compound 4.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the possibility that compound 1 has a chiral center.

Wait, in compound 1, the biphenyl system: each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, perhaps there's a chiral center.

Wait, but the biphenyl group itself can have different configurations, such as ortho, meta, or para. But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para positions on each ring. So the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

So, no. Therefore, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But no option includes only 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that compound 4 has a chiral center. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate: if the structure is such that it has a central carbon with four different groups, then it has a chiral center.

Wait, if the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)–CH2–COOCH3, then the CH2 group in the middle might be connected to:

- One C=C,

- One COOCH3,

- Two CH2 groups,

But that's not four different groups. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is connected to:

- C=C,

- COOCH3,

- two different substituents,

But I'm not seeing it.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, the only correct option is that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't include this, I might have to choose the closest option, which is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Another angle: if the molecule is not symmetrical, perhaps it has a chiral center. For example, if the substituents on either side of the double bond are different, the molecule would be chiral. But in this case, the substituents are the same.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on the double bond are both COOCH3 groups, so the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, no chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2. But since none of the options include only 2, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier analysis. Let me think: perhaps compound 4 does have a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a chiral center can be determined by checking if any carbon is connected to four different groups.

In dimethyl fumarate, let's imagine the structure as:

(CH2COOCH3)C=CH2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)–CH2–COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (the one between the two CH2 groups) is connected to:

- CH2–C=C–,

- CH2–COOCH3,

- two H's.

No, that's not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

If it's trans (E), then the substituents are on opposite sides. But each substituent is the same (COOCH3), so the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

Therefore, I think dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, after all this, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is 2. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question refers to any stereoisomerism, including geometric. But the question specifies optical isomerism, which is a subset of stereoisomerism, specifically due to chirality.

So, the correct answer must be the option that includes only the compounds with chiral centers.

Based on all this, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, including 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps compound 1 is chiral. Let me think: if the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral.

For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical. Let's say that each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, but the arrangement on each ring is such that the molecule as a whole isn't symmetrical.

Wait, for instance, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. But if both rings have substituents at 2 and 6, which are para positions, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral.

Thus, compound 1 is not chiral.

Therefore, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, which includes compounds 1, 2, and 4. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4. Let me consider if there's another possibility.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center because one of the carbons attached to the ester groups is a chiral center. For example, if the structure is such that a carbon is connected to COOCH3, another substituent, and two different groups, making it a chiral center.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to say. I think I've spent enough time, and based on my analysis, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is 2. But since the options don't include this, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps I should consider that dimethyl fumarate is actually chiral because the ester groups are on adjacent carbons, making the molecule asymmetrical.

In that case, the molecule would have a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism. So, compounds 2 and 4 would exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the correct option would be A (1, 2, and 4) if 1 does, but I don't think 1 does.

Alternatively, if only 2 and 4 do, then option A includes 2 and 4, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4 and it does have a chiral center. In that case, the correct answer would include 2 and 4, which is option A.

But I'm not confident, as I think dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

In conclusion, based on my analysis:

Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Compounds 1, 3, and 4 do not.

But since the options don't have an option with only 2, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not certain.


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Optical isomerism arises when a molecule has such a chiral center, allowing it to exist as non-superimposable enantiomers.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl system with nitro groups at the 6 positions and ester groups at the 2 positions on each phenyl ring. The molecule is symmetrical due to the para arrangement of substituents on each ring, and the biphenyl system has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it lacks a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where Ph is a phenyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical phenyl groups. Since it lacks a chiral center, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂. The double bond is in the trans configuration, and the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are identical (two COOCH₃ groups). This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Only compound 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism. None of the provided options correctly reflect this conclusion, as all options include additional compounds that do not exhibit optical isomerism. Based on the analysis, the most reasonable answer is **A (1, 2, and 4)**, assuming the question intends for dimethyl fumarate (4) to exhibit optical isomerism, despite the analysis suggesting otherwise.

Answer: A
