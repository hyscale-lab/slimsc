Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about stars with spots and the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. The question is asking about the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots versus when it does.

Alright, let me start by breaking down the information given. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does that happen? I think because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so when a significant part is covered, the average temperature goes down.

The main point is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. So without spots, ratio R1, and with spots, ratio R2. The observed ratio R decreases when the star has spots. So R1/R2 is the factor we're looking for, I think.

The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. But why does that matter? Oh, right, because the ionization or excitation of atoms depends on temperature. The Boltzmann equation relates the populations of energy levels to temperature.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations should follow the Boltzmann equation. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio R = n1/n2 (or n2/n1? Wait, the question says the ratio of Ti in two levels: level 1 and level 2. So perhaps n1/n2 when the star has spots.

Wait, the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, R = n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't have spots. Let's think about that. If the ratio decreases, then R1 (no spots) is higher than R2 (with spots). So the factor is R1/R2.

So, the ratio R is n1/n2. According to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The Boltzmann equation is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E2 is higher than E1, then E2 - E1 is positive. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )^-1? Hmm, perhaps
