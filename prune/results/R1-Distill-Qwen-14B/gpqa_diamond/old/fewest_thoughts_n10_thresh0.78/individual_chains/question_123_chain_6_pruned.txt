Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The problem says that a supernova occurred in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the center of the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking, in the galaxy's reference frame, how far does the ejecta travel when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame? Oh, and they say to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so I don't have to worry about any of that.

Wait, okay, so the first thing I'm thinking is that this has to do with relative motion and maybe some special relativity concepts. Because the problem mentions two inertial framesâ€”so the galaxy and the ejecta are moving relative to each other. But wait, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards it at that same speed, right? Because if A sees B moving at v, then B sees A moving at -v, assuming no acceleration and inertial frames.

So if the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy in the galaxy's frame, then in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at the same speed. That makes sense because they are moving towards each other.

Wait, but the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, so time is different in each frame. Oh wait, no, do I need to consider time dilation here? Because in special relativity, moving clocks run slow. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame? That's probably the key part here.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem gives time in the ejecta's frame. So from the ejecta's perspective, 50 seconds pass. But the galaxy's frame would see that time differently. So the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame would depend on how
