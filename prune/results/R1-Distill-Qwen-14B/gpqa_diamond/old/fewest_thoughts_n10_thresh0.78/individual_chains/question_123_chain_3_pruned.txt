Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, let me read the question again.

Alright, the scenario is that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. But from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it. So we need to find out how far the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame during 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

Oh, right, this involves time dilation and length contraction because we're dealing with different reference frames moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Wait, 60,000 km/s is 0.2 light-speed since the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. Yeah, 60,000 is 3e5 km/s * 0.2, so that's 20% the speed of light. So relativistic effects are important here.
