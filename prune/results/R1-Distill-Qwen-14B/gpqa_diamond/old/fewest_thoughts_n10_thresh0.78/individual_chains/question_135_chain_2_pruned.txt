Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the allowed decay channels for this boson X. The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term, and the mass of the boson is 6 GeV. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a boson into fermions depends on the interaction terms in the Lagrangian. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y)(υ + X(y))ψf(y). Wait, I think there might be a typo there. Usually, the interaction term would involve the field X coupling to the fermion field. Oh, right, the correct form should probably be something like L_int = λ X ψ̄ ψ, meaning the boson X couples to the fermion ψ. So whenever X decays, it should produce a pair of these fermions, provided certain conditions are met.

So the boson X is at 6 GeV mass. For it to decay into a pair of fermions, each fermion must have a mass less than half of X's mass, because in decay processes, the sum of the daughter particles' rest masses must be less than the parent's mass. Half of 6 GeV is 3 GeV. So any fermion with a mass less than 3 GeV can be produced.

Now, let's list the known fermion masses. The quarks come in different flavors, and their masses vary. The top quark is way too heavy (about 173 GeV), so it's out of the question. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is already over 3 GeV. So the bottom quark can't be produced either. The charm quark is around 1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV, so that's okay. Similarly, up and down quarks are much lighter, around a few MeV or so, so definitely allowed.

Then for leptons: the tau lepton is about 1.78 GeV, so that's under 3 GeV. The muon is 0.1 GeV, and the electron is even lighter, so they're all allowed. The strange quark is about 100 MeV, so that's also allowed.

Wait, but wait a second. The Lagrangian term given is -λ f ψ̄f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, that looks a bit off. Maybe it's more like a Yukawa coupling term. Oh, right, in the Yukawa interaction, the term is usually something like y ψ̄ ψ X, so X is a scalar field coupling to the fermions. So the interaction is between X and the fermion ψ.

So for the decay X → ψ ψ̄, the fermion ψ must have a mass less than Mx/2. So which fermions' masses fit that?

Looking again: the fermions that can be produced would be those with mass <3 GeV.

Let me list the fermion masses:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~2.2 MeV (so <<3 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV (<<3 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV (<<3 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV (so under 3 GeV)
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV (over 3 GeV)
- Top (t): way too heavy.

So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV is allowed. So the possible fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

So the decay products would be pairs of these fermions. So X can decay into:

e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-,

and for quarks, since they are confined, but in this case, the interaction is X coupling to them, so the decay would be into quark-antiquark pairs. But wait, wait. The problem gives the Lagrangian involving ψf, which I assume is a specific fermion field. Wait, is the Lagrangian for each fermion type, or for a single type, say, like a charged current interaction?

Wait, the term is written as ψ̄_f (y) X ψ_f(y), so for each fermion species f. So X couples to each fermion species f, as long as the coupling is present.

Wait, no
