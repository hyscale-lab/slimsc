Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

First, let's look at the reactions given. The problem describes several chemical reactions, so I think I should start by identifying the possible substances involved in each step. That might help in figuring out what E is.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm trying to think of a bright red solid product. Oh wait, maybe iron(III) oxide? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, sulfur comes to mind when I think of red, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about a metal reacting with something else.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a metal with a gas. For example, when metals react with chlorine or another halogen. Oh, wait, maybe A is iron. Because iron reacts with chlorine in certain conditions. Let me think: iron(III) chloride is a common compound. But wait, solid A reacting with gas B, which is in excess (8 equivalents). If A is Fe, and B is Cl2, then the product could be FeCl3. But FeCl3 is a yellowish solid, not bright red. Hmm, maybe another combination.

Another possibility: when a metal like copper reacts with a halogen. But copper(II) chloride is more blue. Wait, maybe the product is something else. Oh, wait, maybe A is sulfur. Sulfur is a solid, and reacting with something? Not sure.

Wait, the second reaction: product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E could be a highly toxic gas, perhaps? For example, chlorine gas, but I don't know. Or maybe something like phosgene or sarin? No, probably something more common.

Wait, another angle: the third reaction is C reacting with water to reform A plus two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces A, and two acidsâ€”a strong and a weak one. Hmm. Let's think about possible acids. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, HClO4. Weak acids include H3PO4, H2CO3, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait,
