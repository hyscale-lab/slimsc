Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI usually are involved in some kind of substitution reaction, maybe a substitution where a group is replaced by iodide. Oh wait, I think that's the case when we have something like an elimination-addition reaction, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where a certain group is replaced by iodine.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The data given are the IR and NMR spectra. Let me look at the IR first. The IR shows strong peaks in the 3400-2500 cm-1 region, which usually indicates the presence of either O-H or N-H groups. But in the options, I see some acids and aromatic compounds. Oh, wait, the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong one. That's a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or acid. Then there's a peak at 1610 and 1450, which are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So there's an aromatic ring present.

So from IR, we have:
- O-H (maybe an acid or an alcohol)
- Carbonyl (so maybe an acid, since 1720 is a bit lower than a ketone, which is usually around 1700-1750)
Wait, wait. Wait, the 1720 could also be an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, if it's an acid, the O-H would be broad in NMR, which I'll check later.

Looking at the 1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a really high chemical shift. My notes say that protons attached to a carbonyl group, like in a carboxylic acid, appear around 10-12 ppm as a broad singlet. So that's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton (COOH). So Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Other signals:
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is typical of aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Let's see, if it's a benzene ring with substituents in para positions, so two doublets each integrating to 2H. So the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents.

Wait, but the substituent could be a group that affects the ring. So considering that, perhaps the benzene has a substituent with an electron-withdrawing group (since the ring is activating or deactivating). But in this case, the carbonyl group (from the COOH) would be an electron-withdrawing group, so the ring would be deactivating.

Looking at the other signals:
-7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also aromatic, but maybe ortho to the substituent. Wait, or perhaps the substituents are in the para position, and the two doublets are from the two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the ring has a substituent in the para position, the two protons adjacent to it (ortho) would be one set, and the next set (meta) another. Hmm, maybe. Or perhaps it's a substituent in the para position, and the two doublets are from the two adjacent positions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe another approach: the aromatic region can be split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para position. Wait, no, because if it's a single substituent, the two ortho protons would be one doublet, and the two meta another. But I think in that case, the coupling would be more like quartets or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at the para position of the benzene, and the ring has another substituent in the meta position. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The substituent is at position para, but then the ring has another substituent? Or perhaps the substituent is a group that itself has protons. For example, a substituent like CH2CH(CH3)2 or something.

Wait, looking further at the NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet, possibly a methylene or methine group adjacent to a carbonyl. Or maybe a CH adjacent to an oxygen.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to another CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH. Like in an isopropyl group, where the CH is split into a doublet.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH3 at the end.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that is a propionoic acid group. Wait, but wait, the COOH is at 10.5 ppm. So if the substituent is a -COOH group, then the ring would have that. But looking at the substituent's NMR:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. So maybe the structure is benzene ring with a -COO-H group attached, but also another substituent.

Wait, but wait, the IR shows 1720 cm-1
