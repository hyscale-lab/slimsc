Okay, so I have this question about astronomy and redshift. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. They want the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is emitted by hydrogen when electrons transition from the second energy level to the first. But in this case, it's about absorption. So when quasars emit light, if there's neutral hydrogen in front of them, the hydrogen will absorb the light at the Lyman alpha wavelength.

Redshift... right, redshift (z) affects how we observe wavelengths. The formula I remember is observed wavelength λ = λ_emitted * (1 + z). So if the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, and the observed wavelength is longer because of redshift.

But wait, the quasar emits light across the spectrum. The Lyman alpha absorption line is in the UV for the quasar's emitted frame. But when the hydrogen cloud is at a higher redshift, the observed wavelength could shift into the optical range, which ground-based telescopes can detect.

Wait, but the problem says the clouds are in deep space, so high redshift. The quasar is a background source. So the Lyman alpha absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen cloud. But when the cloud is at a redshift z, we observe that line at λ = 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

But wait, the quasar emits light, including the Lyman alpha line, which is at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's frame. But wait, no, the quasar's own emitted light would be redshifted. But the hydrogen clouds are in front, so their absorption lines are also at 1216 Angstroms in their own frame. So when we observe them, the absorption line will be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms.

Wait, but the question is about the redshift of the clouds, so that we can detect them. So the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1 + z) Angstroms. Now, the issue is whether this observed wavelength is in the optical range because ground-based telescopes can't see UV due to the atmosphere. So the absorption line needs to be in the optical part of the spectrum.

What's the approximate range of optical wavelengths? I think optical is roughly 380 to 750 nm, which is 3800 to 7500 Angstroms. So the observed Lyman alpha line must be within this range for the telescope to detect it.

So let's set up the equation. The observed wavelength λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) must be less than or equal to 7500 Angstroms because beyond that is infrared, which is not optical. Wait, but wait, the maximum wavelength for optical is about 750 nm (7500 Angstroms). So let's solve for when λ_obs is equal to 7500 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1 + z) ≤ 7500

Divide both sides by 1216: (1 + z) ≤ 7500 / 1216

Calculate 7500 ÷ 1216. Let me do that. 1216 * 6 is 7296, which is just under 7500. 6.17 maybe? Let me compute: 1216 * 6 = 7296, 7500-7296=204. 204/1216 ≈ 0.167. So 6.167. So 1 + z ≤ ~6.167

So z ≤ 5.167. Wait, but that's the upper limit, but the question is about the lower limit on z. Wait, no. Wait, higher redshifts would make the observed wavelength longer. So to have the observed wavelength be within optical range (≤7500 Angstroms), the maximum z would be around 5.167. But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift so that they can be detected. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the lower limit is the minimum redshift where the absorption line is still in the optical. Let me think: if the cloud is at a very low redshift, then the observed wavelength λ_obs would be just a bit longer than 1216 Angstroms. But 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the UV range. So ground-based telescopes can't see UV, so the absorption line needs to be redshifted into the optical range.

So the minimum redshift where λ_obs is just in the optical (say, exactly 380 nm, the start of the visible spectrum). So let's compute that.

380 nm is 3800 Angstroms. So set 1216*(1 + z) = 3800

So 1 + z = 3800 / 1216 ≈ 3.123

So z ≈ 2.123. So the redshift must be at least about 2.123 for the absorption line to be in the optical.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 2.4 and D is 1.9. Hmm. So maybe the minimum redshift is higher than 2.123, but the options don't have that. Or perhaps the maximum wavelength is higher than 3800 Angstroms. Wait, optical goes up to 7500 Angstroms, so perhaps the minimum redshift is when the observed wavelength is just entering the optical, which is 380 nm.

Wait, but if the cloud is at a redshift z, then the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. To be detected in optical, the wavelength must be greater than ~380 nm (3800 Angstroms). So let's calculate when 1216*(1+z) >= 3800.

Because if the observed wavelength is less than 3800 Angstroms, it's UV and not observable. So the minimum z is when 1216*(1+z) = 3800.

So 1 + z = 3800 / 1216 ≈ 3.123 → z≈2.123.

So the lower limit would be z ≈2.123. Looking at the options, the closest is option D)1.9, which is lower, and option C)2.4, which is higher.

Wait, but wait. If the object is at redshift z, then the Lyman alpha emission would be at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. For the absorption to be detected in optical, which starts at 3800 Angstroms, the redshift must be at least (3800/1216) -1 ≈2.123.

So the lower limit for the redshift would be around 2.123. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.123, and option D is 1.9, which is lower.

But wait, maybe the question is considering the limit where the line just enters the optical. So if the redshift is higher than 2.123, the line is in the optical. If lower, it's in UV, which can't be detected. So the lower limit is z >= approx 2.123.

But the options don't have exactly 2.123. So which option is correct? Let's see the options:

A)3 → z=3 → 1216*(1+3)=4864 Angstroms (486.4 nm) which is in the visible (blue-green).

B)1.2 → 1216*2.2=2675.2 → 267.5 nm, which is UV, so not detectable.

C)2.4 → 1216*3.4=4134.4 → 413 nm (violet/blue, visible).

D)1.9 → 1216*2.9=3526.4 → 352.6 nm, which is UV (since 380 nm is visible). So 352 nm is in the UV, so ground telescopes can't detect it.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify the optical range. The atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below ~300 nm (far UV). So ground-based telescopes can't detect below about 320 nm or so. So any observed wavelength below 320 nm can't be seen. So the Lyman alpha line must be observed at >=320 nm (3200 Angstroms) to be detected.

Wait, so if the observed wavelength is at least 3200 Angstroms, then it's in the range detectable by ground-based optical telescopes.

So let's recalculate.

λ_obs = 1216*(1+z) >= 3200

So 1+z >= 3200/1216 ≈2.632 → z >=1.632.

So the minimum z is about 1.632. Looking at the options, which is the lowest redshift that still brings the absorption line into the detectable range.

Option D is 1.9, which would give λ_obs=1216*(2.9)=3526.4, which is 352.6 nm. That's below 380 nm but above 320 nm. Wait, is 352.6 nm in the UV? I think 320 nm is the start of the near UV. So 352 nm is in the near UV, which can be detected by some ground-based telescopes? Or is 380 nm the visible limit.

Wait, visible light starts around 380 nm. So anything below that is UV, which ground telescopes can't see. So if the observation is at 352 nm, it's UV, not visible. So to be in the visible, the wavelength must be at least 380 nm.

So let's do the calculation again for 380 nm.

λ_obs = 380 nm = 3800 Angstroms.

1216*(1 + z) = 3800 → 1+z = 3800/1216 ≈3.123 → z≈2.123.

So any cloud at a redshift above ~2.123 will have an absorption line in the visible (at least 380 nm). So the lower limit is z≈2.123.

Looking at the options, the possible choices are:

A)3 → z=3. Well above.

B)1.2 → z=1.2 → λ=1216*2.2=2675.2 → 267.5 nm. UV, not detected.

C)2.4 → z=2.4 → λ=1216*(3.4)=4134.4 →413.4 nm. Visible.

D)1.9 → z=1.9 → λ=1216*(2.9)=3526.4 →352.6 nm. UV, not detected.

So for the absorption line to be in the visible, the redshift needs to be at least ~2.123. So the lowest option above that is option C)2.4. Because option D)1.9 gives a wavelength in UV, which can't be seen.

Wait, but what if the question is about the lower limit of z, meaning the minimal z where the line is just visible? So the minimal z is when λ_obs >= 380 nm.

So the lower limit is z= (3800 /1216) -1 ≈3.123-1=2.123.

Which of the options is the smallest z that's >= 2.123. The options are C)2.4 and D)1.9.

So the minimal z is 2.123, so the lower limit is any z >=2.123. So the lowest option provided that is higher than 2.123 is C)2.4.

So the correct answer would be option C)2.4.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So what is the smallest z at which the absorption line is detectable. So the minimal z is 2.123. So any z above that would be detectable. So the lower limit is 2.123, but the options don't have that. The options with z higher than 2.123 are C)2.4 and A)3.

But the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z where the line is in the optical. So the minimal z is 2.123. So any object with z >=2.123 can be detected. So the lower limit is 2.123.

But the options don't have that, so the closest higher value is 2.4. So the correct answer must be option C)2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (\( \lambda_{\text{emitted}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \)) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the following:

1. **Key Formula**: The observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is given by:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted}} \cdot (1 + z)
   \]
   For the line to be detectable, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must lie within the optical range of ground-based telescopes, which is approximately \( 3800 \, \text{Å} \) ( violet ) to \( 7500 \, \text{Å} \) ( red ).

2. **Lower Limit for Detection**: The Lyman alpha line must be redshifted into the optical range. The minimum redshift corresponds to the case where \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 3800 \, \text{Å} \). Using the formula:
   \[
   1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{emitted}}}
   \]
   Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 3800 \, \text{Å} \) and \( \lambda_{\text{emitted}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \):
   \[
   1 + z = \frac{3800}{1216} \approx 3.123 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z \approx 2.123
   \]
   Thus, the lower limit for \( z \) is approximately \( 2.123 \).

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A (\( z = 3 \))**: At this redshift, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 3) = 4864 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the optical range. However, this is higher than the lower limit.
   - **Option B (\( z = 1.2 \))**: At this redshift, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.2) = 2675.2 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the UV range and not detectable by ground-based telescopes.
   - **Option C (\( z = 2.4 \))**: At this redshift, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 2.4) = 4134.4 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the optical range. This is slightly higher than the calculated lower limit (\( z \approx 2.123 \)).
   - **Option D (\( z = 1.9 \))**: At this redshift, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the UV range and not detectable by ground-based telescopes.

4. **Conclusion**: The lower limit for \( z \) is \( \approx 2.123 \). Among the options, the smallest value greater than this limit is \( z = 2.4 \), corresponding to **Option C**.
