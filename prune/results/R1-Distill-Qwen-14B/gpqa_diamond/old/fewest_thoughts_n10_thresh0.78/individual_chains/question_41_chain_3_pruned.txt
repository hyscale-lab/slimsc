Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's refractive index. But wait, what happens when the medium is moving relative to an observer?

So the setup is a light beam moving through glass which has a refractive index n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam and towards the observer? So if the beam is propagating towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction, that means the glass is moving towards the observer as well. Or wait, the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion. Let me make sure I get that right.

The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. So the lab frame is where the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is inside the glass, so its speed isn't c in the lab frame because the glass is moving, but the speed in the medium is c/n, right? Wait, no, wait: the speed of light in the medium is c/n, but that's in the rest frame of the medium. When the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think
