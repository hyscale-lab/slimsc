Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me some phase shifts: δ0 is 90 degrees, δ1 is 67, δ2 is 55, δ3 is 30, and δ4 is 13 degrees. Oh wait, and the rest are ignored. The electrons have an energy of 50 MeV, and we're ignoring the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. The formula I think is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum over l of [ (2l +1) * (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) * P_l(cosθ) ] ... where P_l are Legendre polynomials? Or wait, maybe that's for the partial waves? Right, the scattering amplitude can be expressed in terms of partial waves, each with their own phase shift δ_l.

But the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, right, when θ is zero, which is the direction of the incident beam. So cosθ = 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because Legendre polynomials P_l(1) = 1 for any l. So that simplifies things a lot.

So the amplitude f(0) would be (1/k) * sum of (2l +1) * (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) * 1. And since we're taking the imaginary part, let's compute that.

Wait, k is the wave number, right? Which is related to the momentum of the electrons. The energy is given as 50 MeV. Electrons have mass m_e ≈ 0.511 MeV/c². So the kinetic energy is 50 MeV, which is much larger than their rest mass. So we can probably use the non-relativistic approximation for k, but wait, 50 MeV is a lot. Hmm, actually, electrons at 50 MeV are ultra-relativistic. So maybe the relativistic formulas are better here.

But wait,
