Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and jot down what I know.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. Alright, let's break it down.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh wait, but I'm not sure how the spots affect the effective temperature. I remember that starspots are cooler regions, so maybe they make the star appear dimmer, but I'm a bit fuzzy on how exactly that affects the overall Teff.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Wait, I remember something about the Boltzmann equation in stellar atmospheres. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(kT)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots (Teff=5500 K), the ratio is lower than when it's spotless (Teff=6000 K). So the ratio when spotless over ratio when spotted would be the factor we're looking for.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of Ti in two levels. So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. How does temperature affect this ratio?

Let me think: The Boltzmann factor is exponential in T. So as T increases, the exponent -(E2-E1)/(kT) becomes less negative (since E2-E1 is positive, assuming E2>E1, which it must be for a transition to be emission). So when T is higher, the exponent is less negative, so exp(...) is larger. So n2/n1 is higher when T is higher.

Wait wait, so if the ratio n2/n1 increases with temperature, then when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio is lower. But the problem says that the observed ratio decreases when spots are present, which aligns with that. So when the star has spots, T is lower, ratio is lower. So the ratio without spots is higher.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

So the factor is [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*T_spotless)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*T_spotted)) ] 

The g2/g1 terms cancel out, so it simplifies to exp( (ΔE/k) [ 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_spotless) ] )

Wait, let me double-check that algebra. The ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1. So the ratio when no spots is (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ), and the ratio when spotted is (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) )

So the factor is [ exp(-ΔE/(k*6000)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k*5500)) ] = exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ]

Because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Wait, that's correct because factor = [n2/n1]_no / [n2/n1]_spot = [exp(-a) / exp(-b)] where a = ΔE/(k*6000), b=ΔE/(k*5500
