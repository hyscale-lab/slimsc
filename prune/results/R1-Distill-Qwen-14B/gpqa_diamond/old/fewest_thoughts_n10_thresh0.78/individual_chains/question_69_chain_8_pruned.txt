Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. They want to know the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, right, when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer due to time dilation if they're moving at relativistic speeds. So the lifetime observed (τ) is γ times the proper lifetime τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²) because for a relativistic particle, E = γ m c². But wait, energy is given, so E is 27 GeV. Oh, but the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be E/(m c²), but wait, both E and m c² are given in GeV, so maybe the c² factors cancel out.

So gamma is 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917. So gamma is about 7.917.

Then, the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by tau_0. So tau = 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.917 * 8e-16 is 63.336e-16 s, which is 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Wait, but why do I need the lifetime? Because I'm supposed to find the minimum resolution to observe the decay. Oh, right, in a bubble chamber, particles leave tracks, but if they decay too quickly, the tracks are too short and can't be distinguished. So the resolution is the minimum distance the detector can measure. The particles are moving, and the decay length is the distance they travel before decaying. So the resolution must be at least a certain fraction of the decay length to see the decay.

The decay length L is the velocity times the
