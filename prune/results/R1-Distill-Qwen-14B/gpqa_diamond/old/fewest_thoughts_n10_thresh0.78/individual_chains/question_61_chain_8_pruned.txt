Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with benzene and ending with a product. I need to figure out what each step does and then pick the correct final structure from the options.

Let's break it down:

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitration usually happens under these conditions. Nitration adds a nitro group (-NO2) to benzene. Benzene is pretty symmetrical, so the nitro group can go in any position, but since it's the first substitution, I think the nitro group will be in the para position if possible, but wait, benzene is symmetric. Wait, actually, nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene, which is a meta director. Or wait, no, nitration is a meta director? Wait, noâ€”when you add a nitro group via nitration, it's a meta director. But wait, nitration is an example of a meta-directing group, so the initial product would have the nitro group in the meta position relative to itself? No, wait, no: the nitro group is a meta director because it's a strong deactivating group. But wait, when you nitrate benzene, you get nitrobenzene, and the nitro group is in the para position or meta? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Oh
