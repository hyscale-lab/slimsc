Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me take it step by step.

Alright, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented by vectors, and their elements should be complex numbers. Oh, but here they're real, maybe that's okay. Oh, but wait, I think the state vector needs to be normalized. Let me check: the sum of the squares should be 1. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Total is 1+4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector would be each component divided by sqrt(6), right? So the state vector |ψ> is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Next, the operators for the observables P and Q are given. The matrix for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, okay. And the matrix for Q is:

First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. Wait, that's interesting. So Q's eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. Because a diagonal matrix's eigenvalues are on the diagonal.

The question is about measuring P followed by Q, and the probabilities of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. But wait, the measurements are done one after the other. So first P is measured, then Q is measured on the resulting state after the first measurement.

Wait, but the system's state is |ψ>, and when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So when you measure P first, you get an eigenvalue of P, say p, and the state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector. Then you measure Q on that new state.

So the problem is to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, and then -1 when measuring Q.

Wait, but when you measure P, you only get one of its eigenvalues. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, and see what the possible outcomes are when measuring P, and whether 0 is among them.

Let me find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2
