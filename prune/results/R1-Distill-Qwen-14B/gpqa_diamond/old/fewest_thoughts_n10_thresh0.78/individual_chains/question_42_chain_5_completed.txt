Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about exoplanets and their orbital periods. The planets are discovered via the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I don't know if that method affects the way we calculate the orbital periods here. Maybe it's just context.

The problem gives me ratios of equilibrium temperatures between the planets and the ratios of their masses. Then it asks about the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's, given that all have the same albedo (0.3). 

So first, I need to recall the formula for equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula: 

Te = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ) ]^(1/4)

Where:
- L is the star's luminosity,
- a is the planet's albedo,
- D is the distance from the star,
- σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but maybe there's a simpler way to relate the temperatures of the planets since they orbit the same star. Since they're all orbiting the same star, L and σ are the same for all. The albedo is given as 0.3 for all, so (1 - a) is the same for all. So the only varying factors are the distance D and maybe other factors like greenhouse effect, but in this case, equilibrium temperature is assumed, so we can ignore that. 

So equilibrium temperature Te should be proportional to (1/D)^(1/2), because the formula can be rewritten as:

Te ∝ (1/D)^(1/2)

Wait, let me think again. The formula is Te proportional to sqrt(L/(16 π σ D²)) )^(1/4). Wait, no, the full formula is [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) ) ]^(1/4). So taking that to the 1/4 power. So Te ∝ (L)^(1/4) * (1 - a)^(1/4) * (D^(-2))^(1/4) ) = (L)^(1/4) * (1 - a)^(1/4) * D^(-1/2).

So yes, Te is proportional to sqrt(1/D), because D is in the denominator and raised to the 1/2 power. So if the star's luminosity is the same for all, and albedo is same, then Te is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance D. 

So, Te ∝ 1/sqrt(D). So if I have the ratio of temperatures between two planets, then the ratio of their distances would be (Te1/Te2)^2. Wait, let's double-check. Suppose Planet A has Te_A and Planet B has Te_B. Then Te_A / Te_B = (D_B / D_A )^(1/2), assuming all else equal. Because Te ∝ 1/sqrt(D), so Te_A = k / sqrt(D_A), Te_B = k / sqrt(D_B). So Te_A / Te_B = sqrt(D_B)/sqrt(D_A) = sqrt(D_B/D_A). So squaring both sides, (Te_A/Te_B)^2 = D_B/D_A. So D_B = D_A * (Te_A / Te_B)^2.

Wait, wait, maybe I should think in terms of ratios. Let me get the ratios correct.

The problem says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So Te1/Te2 = 1.4. That would mean Te1 is higher than Te2. Since higher Te implies being closer to the star (since Te decreases with distance), Planet1 is closer than Planet2.

Wait, but let me see. If Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), so higher Te means smaller D. So yes, Planet1 is closer.

So for Planet1 and Planet2:

Te1/Te2 = 1.4 --> Te1 = 1.4 * Te2

So using Te ∝ 1/sqrt(D), so 1.4 = (D2 / D1)^(1/2) --> so squaring both sides, 1.96 = D2/D1 --> D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Wait, wait, because Te1 = (1/sqrt(D1)) * k, and Te2 = (1/sqrt(D2)) * k. So Te1/Te2 = sqrt(D2/D1). So sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4 --> D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 --> D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So Te2/Te3 = 2.3. So sqrt(D3/D2) = 2.3 --> D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 --> D3 = 5.29 * D2.

Wait, wait, let me be precise. Te2/Te3 = 2.3. So Te2 = 2.3 Te3. Using Te ∝ 1/sqrt(D), so 2.3 = (D3 / D2)^(1/2). So square both sides: 5.29 = D3/D2 --> D3 = 5.29 * D2.

But we have D2 as 1.96 * D1. So substituting D2 into D3:

D3 = 5.29 * (1.96 D1) = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1.

Calculating 5.29 * 1.96. Let me compute that:

5 * 1.96 = 9.8; 0.29 * 1.96 = approx 0.5684. So total is 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684. So D3 ≈ 10.3684 * D1.

So the distance of Planet3 is about 10.3684 times that of Planet1.

But we're asked about the orbital period. Kepler's third law relates the orbital period and the semi-major axis (distance) of a planet's orbit. The formula is P² ∝ D³, assuming the same star mass. Since all planets are orbiting the same star, the mass is same, so P² is proportional to D³.

So P ∝ D^(3/2).

So the question is, what is the ratio P3/P1?

Since D3/D1 ≈ 10.3684, then P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute 10.3684^(1/2). The square root of 10.3684 is approximately 3.22, because 3.2^2 = 10.24, 3.22^2 = approx 10.3684. So yes, sqrt(10.3684) ≈ 3.22.

Then, 10.3684^(3/2) is (sqrt(10.3684)) * (10.3684) = 3.22 * 10.3684.

Calculating that: 3 * 10.3684 = 31.1052, 0.22 * 10.3684 ≈ 2.280. So total is approx 31.1052 + 2.280 = 33.385. So approximately 33.4.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 3.22 * 10.3684.

Let me compute 3 * 10.3684 = 31.1052.

0.22 * 10.3684 = let's see: 10.3684 * 0.2 = 2.07368, 10.3684 * 0.02 = 0.207368. So 2.07368 + 0.207368 = 2.281048.

So total is 31.1052 + 2.281048 ≈ 33.386, which rounds to 33.4.

So P3 is about 33.4 times the period of Planet1. So the factor is approximately 33.4.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but let me double-check all steps because sometimes I might have mixed up the ratios.

Wait, the ratio Te1/Te2 is 1.4, which would imply that Te1 is higher, so D2 is larger than D1. So in our calculation, indeed D2 is about 1.96 times D1.

Similarly, Te2/Te3 is 2.3, so Te2 is higher, meaning D3 is larger than D2. So D3=5.29 * D2 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1, which is correct.

So the distance from the star for each planet is D1, D2=1.96 D1, D3=10.368 D1.

So the period ratio is (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.368)^(3/2)=33.4.

So the answer is D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we start by analyzing the given data. The equilibrium temperature \( T_e \) for a planet is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \), where \( D \) is the orbital distance from the star. Since all planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature ratio between any two planets depends only on their orbital distances.

### Step 1: Relating equilibrium temperatures to orbital distances
The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is given as \( \frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = 1.4 \). Using the relationship \( T_e \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \), we find:
\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} \implies 1.4 = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} \implies \frac{D_2}{D_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies D_2 = 1.96 D_1.
\]

Similarly, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3 is given as \( \frac{T_{e2}}{T_{e3}} = 2.3 \). Using the same relationship:
\[
\frac{T_{e2}}{T_{e3}} = \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} \implies 2.3 = \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} \implies \frac{D_3}{D_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies D_3 = 5.29 D_2.
\]

Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \) into \( D_3 = 5.29 D_2 \), we get:
\[
D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 D_1 = 10.3684 D_1.
\]

Thus, the orbital distance of Planet3 is approximately \( 10.3684 \) times that of Planet1.

### Step 2: Relating orbital period to orbital distance
Kepler's Third Law states that the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( D^{3/2} \), i.e., \( P \propto D^{3/2} \). Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1 is:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{D_3}{D_1} = 10.3684 \), we calculate:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}.
\]

First, compute \( \sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22 \). Then, multiply by \( 10.3684 \):
\[
(10.3684)^{3/2} = \sqrt{10.3684} \times 10.3684 \approx 3.22 \times 10.3684 \approx 33.4.
\]

### Conclusion
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately \( 33.4 \) times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
