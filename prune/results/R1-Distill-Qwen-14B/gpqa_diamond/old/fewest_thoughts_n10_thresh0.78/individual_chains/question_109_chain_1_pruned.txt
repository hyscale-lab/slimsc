Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about nucleons emitting a particle and Pauli statistics. Oh right, I remember Pauli's exclusion principle has to do with identical particles and their quantum states. 

The problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on the given conditions.

Wait, let me parse the question again. The initial state is 1S0. The particle X is emitted, so the final state is the NN system plus X. The Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh, right, T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So the sum of these quantum numbers (mod 2) must equal the isospin.

The final state has T(NN) = 0. So, T is even? Because it's zero, which is even. So 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. That means S + L + 1 must be even. So S + L must be odd because 1 mod 2 is 1. So S + L = odd.

Wait, but S is the spin of the NN system. For two nucleons, each has spin 1/2. So their total spin can be S=0 (singlet) or S=1 (triplet). Oh wait, since the initial state is 1S0... Wait, the 1S0 would be S=0, right? Because in the term symbol, S is the spin. 1S0 implies S=0 (since 2S+1=1 → S=0), and L=0 because it's an S state.

So in the initial state, S_initial = 0, L_initial = 0. Then, they emit a particle X. So the process is NN → NN' + X. Wait, no, perhaps it's more like the two nucleons are in a certain state and emit a particle, so perhaps the process is like an emission, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a decay? Or
