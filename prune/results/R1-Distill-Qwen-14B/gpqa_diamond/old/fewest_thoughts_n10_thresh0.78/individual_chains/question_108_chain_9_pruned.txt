Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question says the magnetic field is along the Oz axis and has a small m (orbital magnetic quantum number). The field B is 1 Tesla. I need to compare the average value of the Hamiltonian (⟨H⟩) of the paramagnetic term with the energy transition ΔE of hydrogen, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are whether ⟨H⟩ is much greater, much less, equal, or just greater than ΔE.

First, I remember that the paramagnetic effect arises due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The energy associated with this interaction is given by the Zeeman term. The formula for the Zeeman energy is something like E_Zeeman = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

Wait, the magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -g * (e/(2m)) * ħ * m_s, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, e is the electron charge, m is the mass, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. But wait, in the problem, it's about the orbital magnetic quantum number m. Oh right, the orbital contribution is μ_orbital = (μ_B) * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So the energy would be something like E = -μ_B * B * m.

Wait, but the problem states that m is small, so perhaps m is near zero. But since m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, etc. Or maybe it's for s orbitals, where l=0, so m=0. Hmm, but wait, if m is small, like m=0, the energy would be zero. But perhaps the question is about the paramagnetic term in a situation where m isn't zero. Maybe the average value they're referring to is the expectation value of the perturbing Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is the perturbation due to the magnetic field. The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states in hydrogen, like the Balmer series emission, which corresponds to the wavelength given.

Let me calculate both energies.

First, let's calculate the transition energy ΔE. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3 x 10^8 m/s.

So substituting the numbers: E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7) ≈ 4.088e-19 J. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

Wait, 486.1e-9 meters is 4.861e-7 meters. So 6.626e-34 * 3e8 is 1.9878e-25. Divide by 4.861e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approx 4.089e-19 J. 

But wait, 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.09e-19 J is roughly 2.55 eV. Oh wait, but the hydrogen energy levels are much smaller. Wait, no, the Balmer series corresponds to transitions ending at n=2. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n².

So for example, the Balmer series is n=2 to n=3, n=4, etc. The transition from n=3 to n=2 emits a photon of about 1.89 eV (since E3=-1.51 eV, E2=-3.40 eV, so ΔE= -3.40 + 1.51 = 1.89 e
