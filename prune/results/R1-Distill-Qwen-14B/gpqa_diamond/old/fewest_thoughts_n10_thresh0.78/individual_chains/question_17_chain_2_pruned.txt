Okay, so I have this question about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds with calcium ions. The pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its active form, deprotonated enough to bind the metal ion effectively. The temperature is 25°C, which is room temperature, so standard conditions I guess.

The given K value is 5x10^10. I think this is the formation constant (Kf) for the Ca-EDTA complex. Formation constant tells us how much the complex forms from the ions. So if K is large, the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

Wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Oh, right, because the complex is formed, the free Ca²+ concentration should be low.

So, the formula for the formation constant is Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, which I'll call the complex, so [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M.

Assuming that the EDTA is in excess or that the complex doesn't dissociate much, so [EDTA^4-] can be approximated. Wait, but if the complex is formed stoichiometrically, then each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA. So, for every mole of Ca-EDTA, we have one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA? No, wait, that's not right. Because the complex is formed, so the dissociation would be Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

Wait, the complex is CaY²- (if Y is EDTA^4-). So, the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaY²-.

So Kf is [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But in the solution, we have 0.02 M CaY²- complex. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M. So the [CaY²-] is 0.02 M. Let me write the expression.

Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5x10^10.

But wait, what's the initial concentration of the complex? It's 0.02 M, so we can assume that the solution comes from a situation where CaY²- is 0.02 M, and the rest is dissociated into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But if Kf is very large (like 5e10), the dissociation is minimal, so [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] would be very small compared to 0.02 M.

Wait, but wait. The solution is 0.02 M in the complex, so the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are
