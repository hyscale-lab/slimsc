Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators, specifically the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented as a 2x2 matrix, Ay = c·S. The constant c is given as h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. Wait, I think S looks familiar. Oh right, I remember that the Pauli matrices have similar structures. Let me jot down S:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay is c multiplied by this S. So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, among the options given, which statement is correct.

Wait, but to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I can probably first find the eigenvalues of S since c is a scalar multiplier. Because eigenvalues of a scalar multiple of a matrix are just the scalar multiplied by the original eigenvalues.

So first, what are the eigenvalues of S? Let me calculate the characteristic equation. The trace of S is 0, and the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2). Since i squared is -1, this becomes 0 - (-(-1)) → 0 - (1) → -1? Wait, let me compute determinant again.

Determinant of S: (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) → - (i^2)(-1) → wait, i^2 is -1, so (-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So determinant becomes 0 - 1 = -1? No, wait wait, the determinant of a 2x2 [[a, b],[c, d]] is ad - bc. So for S, a=0, d=0. bc is (-i)*(i) = (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So ad - bc is 0 - 1 = -1. So determinant is -1.

The trace is 0+0=0. So the characteristic equation is λ^2 - trace λ + determinant = λ^2 - 0λ + (-1) = λ^2 -1 =0. So eigenvalues are λ= +1 and λ=-1.

Ah, so S has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Therefore, Ay, being c multiplied by S, will have eigenvalues c*(+1) and c*(-1).

Given c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues of Ay are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly mention these. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts are ±h/(4π). Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Because the eigenvalues I found are real, right? Because S is Hermitian? Wait, is S Hermitian?

Wait, S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as flipping the sign of the off-diagonal elements. So S is equal to its conjugate transpose. So S is Hermitian, which means its eigenvalues are real. Therefore, eigenvalues of Ay would be real as well.

Looking at the options, option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az. Hmm, well, the square of the angular momentum operator. But that might be a different matter. Let me think about each option.

Option A: It says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because our eigenvalues are purely real. So A is incorrect.

Option
