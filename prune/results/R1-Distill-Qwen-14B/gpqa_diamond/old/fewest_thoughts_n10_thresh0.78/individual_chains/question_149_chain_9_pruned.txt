Okay, so I've got this question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what we'd expect if it's a single proton. So the integral together is 1H because each peak is part of it, right?

The peaks aren't due to spin-spin coupling because the coupling pattern rules that out. So that's not the issue. Now, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks with the same mass. Both have the same mass spectrum as expected.

Wait, so what could cause the same mass to appear twice in LC-MS? Oh, maybe they're isomers? Or maybe something else. But the same mass would mean same molecular weight, so it's not like a fragment or something. Oh wait, same mass but different structures... but the problem says the same mass as the expected molecule. So they're probably the same molecule but in different forms.

Looking at the options. Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. That would probably have a different mass than the expected, right? Because the precursor would be the previous step, maybe a fragment or another compound. But the question says the mass is the same, so probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular mass, same physical properties except for how they interact with chiral environments. So in LC, if the column is achiral, both enantiomers would elute at the same time, right? But wait, LC-MS would show two peaks if it's a chiral column. Oh wait, the question says the LC-MS is at elevated temperature. Maybe the mobile phase or something else affects retention times? Or perhaps the column is achiral, leading to two peaks. Wait, but if the column is achiral, enantiomers would not separate. So if they're eluting as two peaks, maybe the separation is happening because the column is chiral. So in that case, the peaks would come from enantiomers. But wait, the question states that the mass is same for both, which fits enantiomers.

But wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. In enantiomers, the alpha-protons are in equivalent environments, so why would they split into two peaks? Because in enantiomers, the environment is mirrored, so the protons would have the same shift. So if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak, not two. Because each enantiomer contributes the same peak. So that makes me think that B might not be the correct answer.

Wait, but the question says the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So perhaps the structure is such that the proton is in a diastereotopic position. Wait, diastereotopic protons are in different environments. If the molecule has some kind of symmetry, but removing it would make the protons non-equivalent. Hmm, but if it's a diastereomer, then their NMRs would show different shifts.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not too sure about this one. Double coupling might refer to something in the reaction process, but not sure how it
