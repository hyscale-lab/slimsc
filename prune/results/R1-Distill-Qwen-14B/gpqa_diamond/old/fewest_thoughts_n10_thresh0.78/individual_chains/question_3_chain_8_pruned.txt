Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to think it through step by step. Let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle in a given state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve probabilities and the states, right?

So the particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, I should check if these coefficients are normalized. Let me compute the square of each and add them. 0.5 squared is 0.25. sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so its square is (3/4) which is 0.75. Adding 0.25 and 0.75 gives 1, so it's normalized. Good, that's correct.

The operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state.

Since the operator is a linear combination of σz and σx, maybe I can compute the expectation value for each part separately and then combine them. So, the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

I think σz and σx are Pauli matrices. Let me recall their forms. Oh right, σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], and σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. But wait, more importantly, I should remember how to compute their expectation values.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So for σz, the expectation value is just the probability of being in |↑⟩ multiplied by +1 plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ multiplied by -1.

The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the probability of |↑⟩ is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and the probability of |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now for σx. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which corresponds to the spin in the x-direction. The expectation value of σx for a given state is calculated differently because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, not σx. I think I need to express the state in terms of the eigenstates of σx.

Alternatively, I remember that the expectation value of σx can be found using the inner product. So ⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Let me write out the state |ψ⟩ as a vector. Since |↑⟩ is [1;0], and |↓⟩ is [0;1], then |ψ⟩ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So applying σx to |ψ⟩ would swap the components and maybe add a negative sign? Wait, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so σx|ψ⟩ would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the inner product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] with [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Let's compute that:

(0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5.

Wait, 0.5 is 1/2, sqrt(3)/2 is the same as that. So each term is (1/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. There are two such terms, so adding them together gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866, but wait, wait. Let me double-check. Alternatively, I can think in terms of the components.

Wait, maybe another approach. The expectation value of σx is given by ⟨σx⟩ = 2 (probability of σx=+1 minus probability of σx=-1). But wait, how do I find those probabilities?

Alternatively, I can consider that the expectation value for σx is 2 times the imaginary part of the amplitude for |↓⟩. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the state's coefficients.

Wait, another way: σx measures spin in the x-direction. The expectation value is ⟨σx⟩ = (a b* + a* b), where a is the coefficient of |↑⟩ and b is that of |↓⟩. Wait, I'm not sure about that formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for ⟨σx⟩ is 2*(|a|^2 - |b|^2) no, wait, that's for σz. Because σz eigenvalues are +1 and -1, so the expectation is |a|^2 - |b|^2. Wait no, for σz, it's (+1)(|a|^2) + (-1)(|b|^2) = |a|^2 - |b|^2.

But for σx, the eigenstates are (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2). The eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So to find the expectation value, I need to express |ψ⟩ in terms of these eigenstates.

Let me write |ψ⟩ as a linear combination of σx eigenstates. Let me denote |+x⟩ = (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/√2 and |−x⟩ = (|↑⟩ − |↓⟩)/√2.

So |ψ⟩ = c_+ |+x⟩ + c_- |−x⟩.

Compute c_+ and c_-: 

c_+ = ⟨+x|ψ⟩ = (⟨↑| + ⟨↓|)/√2 (0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩) 
= [0.5*(1) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(1)] / sqrt(2) 
= [0.5 + sqrt(3)/2] / sqrt(2)

Similarly, c_- = ⟨−x|ψ⟩ = (⟨↑| − ⟨↓|)/√2 (0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩)
= [0.5*(1) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-1)] / sqrt(2)
= [0.5 - sqrt(3)/2] / sqrt(2)

Then, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is the probability of |+x⟩ times (+1) plus the probability of |−x⟩ times (-1). Because σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So, ⟨σx⟩ = |c_+|^2*(+1) + |c_-|^2*(-1) = (|c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2).

Let me compute |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

First, compute numerator for c_+:

0.5 + (sqrt(3)/2) = (1 + sqrt(3))/2 ≈ (1 + 1.732)/2 ≈ 2.732/2 ≈ 1.366.

So |c_+| = (1.366)/sqrt(2) ≈ 1.366 / 1.414 ≈ 0.966.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute |c_+|^2:

|c_+|^2 = [ (0.5 + sqrt(3)/2 )^2 ] / 2 

Expanding that: (0.25 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2 )) / 2

Which is:

0.25 + (3/4) + (2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2)) ) / 2.

Wait, 0.25 is 1/4, 3/4 is 0.75, so 1/4 +3/4=1. Then, the cross term is (sqrt(3)/2). So the numerator is (1 + sqrt(3)/2) divided by 2. So |c_+|^2 = (1 + sqrt(3)/2) / 2.

Wait, wait, let me do the algebra again.

c_+ = [0.5 + (sqrt(3)/2)] / sqrt(2)

So [0.5 + (sqrt(3)/2)] is (1 + sqrt(3)) / 2.

So |c_+|^2 = [ (1 + sqrt(3)) / (2 * sqrt(2)) ) ] squared.

So |c_+|^2 = ( (1 + sqrt(3))^2 ) / (4 * 2 ) = (1 + 2 sqrt(3) +3 ) / 8 = (4 + 2 sqrt(3)) /8 = (2 + sqrt(3)) /4.

Similarly, compute |c_-|^2.

c_- = [0.5 - (sqrt(3)/2)] / sqrt(2)

Which is (1 - sqrt(3)) / (2 sqrt(2)).

So |c_-|^2 is ( (1 - sqrt(3))^2 ) / (4*2) = (1 - 2 sqrt(3)+3 ) /8 = (4 - 2 sqrt(3)) /8 = (2 - sqrt(3)) /4.

So, ⟨σx⟩ = |c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2 = [ (2 + sqrt(3))/4 ] - [ (2 - sqrt(3))/4 ] = [ (2 + sqrt(3) - 2 + sqrt(3)) ] /4 = (2 sqrt(3)) /4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, so that matches my earlier calculation. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So then, putting it all together, the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Let me compute each term:

10 * (-0.5) = -5.

5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (5*1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 ≈4.33.

So adding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait, the problem says to compute to one decimal place. So -0.67 is approximately -0.7. So the expectation value is -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

Oh wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 0.5^2 is 0.25, (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 0.75. So when calculating expectation of σz, it's 0.25*(1) +0.75*(-1)=0.25 -0.75= -0.5, correct. So 10*(-0.5) =-5.

For σx, I computed sqrt(3)/2≈0.866, so 5 * 0
