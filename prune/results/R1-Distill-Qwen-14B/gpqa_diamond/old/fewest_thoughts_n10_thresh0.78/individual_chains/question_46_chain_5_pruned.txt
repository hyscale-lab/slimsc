Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to tackle. Let's see what it's about. The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst, and I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis... that's where the catalyst breaks and reforms double bonds, right?

Wait, what's the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene? Let me draw that out. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So numbering from the left, it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Oh wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Pent means five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, no, the substituent is at 3. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? No, I think I messed that up. Let me count again. Carbon chain: 1, 2, 3, 4,5. So 1 is the first carbon. The double bond is between 1 and 2. Then, the substituent is a methyl on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is CH(CH3). So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would be five carb
