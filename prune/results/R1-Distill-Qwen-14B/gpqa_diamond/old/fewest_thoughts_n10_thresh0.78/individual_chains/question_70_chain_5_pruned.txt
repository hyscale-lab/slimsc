Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem describes a series of reactions and then asks about the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm. Symmetry groups are often about the shapes of molecules, right? So I'll need to figure out what E is, then determine its structure.

Let me break down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm trying to think of reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio. Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something? Wait, sulfur is bright red when it's in certain forms. Oh, wait, maybe A is iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃), and B is carbon monoxide (CO)? Because when Fe₂O₃ reacts with CO, it forms Fe metal and CO₂. But wait, the reaction ratio... Let me think. Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂. So that's 3 equivalents of CO per Fe₂O₃. But the problem says 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is sodium oxide (Na₂O) reacting with something? Or perhaps something else. Wait, the product C is bright red. Oh! Wait, maybe C is copper(II) oxide? No, copper(II) oxide is black. Alternatively, sulfur is bright red but it's an element, not a compound. Alternatively, maybe C is a product like iodine? I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is iron(III) sulfate or another salt. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something like the production of a metal from its oxide. For example, Fe₂O₃ + CO → Fe + CO₂. But again, the ratio doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Let's think about the second part. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacting with water gives A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. So C is probably a salt that releases H+ ions upon hydrolysis, producing two different acids.

Wait, for example, if C is a nitride, like AlN. When AlN reacts with water
