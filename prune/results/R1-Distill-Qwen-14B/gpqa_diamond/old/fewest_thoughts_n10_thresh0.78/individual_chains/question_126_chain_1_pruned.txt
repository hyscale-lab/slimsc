Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions, each starting with different compounds and using different reagents. After both reactions are complete, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral stationary phase. I need to determine how many peaks the chemist would observe in each case.

Let me break this down. First, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Then, the products are combined and analyzed.

I think I should figure out what each reaction does. Let me start with Reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

Wait, hexan-3-one is a ketone. The structure would be CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-... Let me double-check. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the position is 3, so the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmm, wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one would be: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3, but the actual structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. No, wait, hexane is six carbons. So, 3-ketone: position 3 is the carbonyl. So it's CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. Hmm, but the structure given is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, so the methoxy is on carbon 5. Let me write the structure.

The compound is (S) configuration on the 5-methoxy group. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, no: hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3, but with a methoxy on
