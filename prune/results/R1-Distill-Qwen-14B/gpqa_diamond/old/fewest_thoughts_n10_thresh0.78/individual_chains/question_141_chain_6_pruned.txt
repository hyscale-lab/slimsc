Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The question is about a reaction involving 1-bromobenzene-2-d and treatment with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh right, that's bromobenzene where the bromine is attached at the para position. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: 1-bromobenzene would be bromobenzene itself, but when it's 2-d, does that mean something else? Oh, wait, maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding. Oh wait, sometimes in numbering, but benzene is a ring, so maybe it's 1-bromo-2-di substituents? Or wait, no, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? Or maybe 2-d is something else. Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Wait, the way the question is written is a bit unclear. Wait, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, perhaps that's o-bromobenzene? No, wait, 1 is para, and 2 is meta? Wait, no, 1 is the first position, so 1-bromo means the substituent is at position 1. But benzene is a ring, so numbering can vary. Wait, maybe the structure is 1-bromo-2,
