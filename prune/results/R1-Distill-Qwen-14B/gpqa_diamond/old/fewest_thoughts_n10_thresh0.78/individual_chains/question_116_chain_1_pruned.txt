Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, the problem starts with compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, compound A undergoes monobromination to form B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C then reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. We need to identify D from the given options.

First, I think I should figure out what compound A is. The NMR data is crucial here. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H probably indicates two equivalent CH3 groups. Since it's a triplet, each of these CH3 must be next to a CH2 that's split into a triplet. Wait, let me think: in NMR splitting, the number of neighboring H's plus one determines the split. So a triplet means each H is next to a CH2 with two H's, right?

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H suggests that these are two equivalent CH2 groups. A quartet would come from a CH2 next to another CH2, because each of the H's in the quartet would see two neighboring H's. Wait, no, the quartet would be from a CH2 adjacent to another CH2 which has two H's. Oh wait, when you have a CH2 next to a CH2, like in an ethyl group, it's a quartet. For example, in ethyl groups, the CH3 is a triplet, and the adjacent CH2 is a quartet.

So putting this together, the NMR suggests an ethyl group. Wait, but ethyl would have the CH3 as a triplet and the CH2 as a quartet. So that matches the data given for compound A. So compound A is probably diethyl something. But wait, the triplet is for 6H and the quartet for 4H. Hmm, 6H in a triplet would suggest two CH3 groups, each contributing 3H. And the quartet is 4H, which would be two equivalent CH2 groups, each 2H. So 2 CH3 and 2 CH2 groups. That sounds like diethyl something, maybe diethyl ether? Or perhaps another compound with two ethyl groups.

Wait, diethyl ether would have two ethyl groups attached to oxygen. Its NMR would show two triplets, but wait, in diethyl ether, the CH2CH3 groups are equivalent. So the CH3 would be a triplet, and the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet, but each would be integrated as 6H and 4H, respectively. So that fits. So compound A might be diethyl ether.

So structure of A is CH2CH2OCH2CH3? Wait, no, it's CH3CH2OCH2CH3, diethyl ether. So when it undergoes monobromination, where would the bromine add? Diethyl ether has an oxygen with two ethyl groups. Monobromination could be either via substitution or addition, but since the question says it undergoes monobromination, I think it's substitution. In diethyl ether, the central oxygen is connected to two CH2CH3 groups. So the substitution would occur in one of the ethyl groups. But wait, diethyl ether is symmetrical, so substitution in either ethyl group would give the same product. So the bromine would replace one of the ethyl groups, but wait, diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. So if one ethyl group is
