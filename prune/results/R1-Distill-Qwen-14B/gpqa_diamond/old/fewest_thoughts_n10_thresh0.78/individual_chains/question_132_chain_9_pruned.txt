Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

Wait, all the options except C contain tetramethyl groups, while option C has 1,4-diethylbenzene and another tetramethyl. Hmm, diethyl would probably show up as triplet or something else, but in the given data, the downfield signals (aromatic) are two singlets. Let me think about each part.

First, looking at the aromatic region. Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes equally. So each compound must have an aromatic region that gives a singlet. Wait, but aromatic protons usually are split into multiple peaks unless they are all equivalent. So each compound must have all aromatic protons equivalent, leading to a singlet. Alternatively, maybe they have more than one set of equivalent protons but they all as a group are a singlet.

Wait, but each compound in the mixture contributes equally. So each compound has a singlet in their aromatic region. So each must be a para-substituted or something where all aromatic protons are equivalent, but wait, for a benzene ring with multiple substituents, how?

Wait, let me think about the substitution patterns. For example, if a benzene has four methyl groups attached in such a way that all remaining protons are equivalent, then that ring would give a singlet. So let's consider each option.

The molecular formula is C10H14. Each compound is C5H7 (since each is half of the mixture, each has formula C5H7?), wait no, wait. Wait, the mixture is 1:1 of two C10H14 compounds. No, wait, wait, each compound must have molecular formula C10H14, because the mixture is two C10H14 compounds in 1:1. So each is C10H14.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check the molecular formulas. Because sometimes substituents can affect the formula.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have four CH3 groups on benzene. Benzene is C6H6. Adding four CH3 gives C6+4= C10, and H6 - (4*2) = H6 -8= H-2, but wait, benzene has 6 H. When you add a methyl group, each replaces an H. So four methyl groups replace four H. So H6-4 = 2. So molecular formula would be C10H10? Wait, no, wait. Each CH3 adds a carbon. So C6 (benzene) + 4*(CH3) = C10H14? Let me compute.

Benzene (C6H6). Each substitution of H with CH3 replaces one H. So for four substituents: C6H6 â†’ C6+4*1= C10, H6 -4 = H2. So formula is C10H12? Wait, no, each CH3 has 3 H, so the benzene's remaining H would be 2, so the total H is 2 (from benzene) + 4*(3 from each CH3) = 2 + 12 = 14. So yes, C10H14. So all the options are
