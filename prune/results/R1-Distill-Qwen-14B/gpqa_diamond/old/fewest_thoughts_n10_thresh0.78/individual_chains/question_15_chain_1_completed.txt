Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should prioritize observing that one. Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the RV method. They have the same mass, but different orbital periods and host star properties.

Let me think about what factors affect the transit probability. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. But wait, the RV method already gives us some information, like the minimum mass. Oh, but here, the masses are the same for both planets, so that part is equal.

Transit probability formula: I think it's something like (R_planet + R_star) / a_planet, but maybe it's (R_planet / R_star) divided by something. Wait, no, the actual formula is P = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^0.5)) ), but maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / a), but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: the transit probability for a given system is roughly (R_p / R_s)² times (1 / (a)), but I'm not confident about the exact formula.

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the factors. Let me recall: the probability of a transit is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so it's just (R_p / R_s)^2 * 1/a.

Wait, no, maybe that's not the exact formula. I think the formula for the probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / a) multiplied by (something else). Alternatively, another resource I remember says that the probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)), but I might be wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's (R_p / R_s) divided by the semi-major axis. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s) squared multiplied by (some function of the orbit).

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a)). Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the geometry: the planet will transit if its orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability of that happening is roughly (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (something else). Wait, I think the actual formula for the probability of a transit is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2))} ), but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. The transit probability is usually given by (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by (a_p * (1 - (R_p/a_p)^2)^(1/2)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s) divided by (a_p), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the area. The chance that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Wait, I think the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1/(a_p)) * (something else). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a_p)) * (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^0.5))), but that might not apply here. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula, so maybe I should think of it in terms of R_p and a_p, and the star's radius. Because if the planet's orbit is much larger, the chance of it transiting is lower.

Wait, the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p + R_s) / a_p * ( (R_p + R_s) / a_p ) * ... no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a_p), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it's (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a_p). Hmm. Alternatively, it's (R_p / (R_s + R_p)) )^2 * (1/a_p), but that's getting complicated.

Wait, I think a more accurate approach is to model the transit probability as the area of the star that the planet can block, divided by the area of the orbit at the distance of the planet. But wait, the area of the orbit at distance a_p is π a_p². The area blocked is the area of the circle where the planet can pass in front of the star. The radius of that circle is R_s, so the area is π R_s². But wait, the planet's orbit is a circle of radius a_p, so the area where the planet can be in front is the area of the star's disk as seen from the planet's position. So the probability is (R_s / a_p)^2 multiplied by another factor related to the planet's size.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p) )? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, I found a resource online (but since I can't access it, I'll rely on memory) that says the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s) )

Wait, that would be (R_p^2 / R_s²) * (R_s / a_p) ) = R_p^2 / (R_s a_p)

Hmm, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability increases with the size of the planet and the star's radius decreases (since a larger star makes the transit less likely), and a shorter orbital period (smaller a_p) increases the probability.

Wait, but in this problem, the two planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period (3 times shorter than Planet 2). So Planet_1 is closer to its star.

But the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius.

Wait, but wait, if a star is more massive, it would typically be larger, but in this case, both stars have the same radius. So Planet_1's star is more massive but same radius as Planet_2's star.

So, for Planet_1: a_p1 is smaller because the period is shorter (assuming the same star mass). Wait, but since the period is given, we can relate that to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law says (a_p^3)/(T^2) = G(M_s + M_p)/(4π²). Since M_p is much less than M_s, this simplifies to a_p^3 ∝ T² M_s.

So, a_p is proportional to (T * sqrt(M_s)) )^(2/3). Maybe. Let me think again: a_p³ = (G M_s T²) / (4 π² ), so a_p = [ (G M_s T²) / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3) = T^(2/3) * (G M_s )^(1/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3).

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of ratios. Let's compute a_p1 and a_p2.

Given that T1 = T_2 /3. Because Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2.

And the mass of Planet_1's star is twice that of Planet_2's star (M_s1 = 2 M_s2).

So, a_p1³ / a_p2³ = (M_s1 / M_s2) * (T1² / T2² )

Which is (2) * ( (T2 /3 )² / T2² ) ) = 2 * (1/9) ) = 2/9.

So a_p1³ = (2/9) a_p2³.

Take cube root: a_p1 = a_p2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a_p2 * (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ a_p2 * 0.606.

Wait, (2/9) is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.606. So a_p1 is about 0.606 times a_p2.

So a_p1 is smaller than a_p2.

Now, transit probability depends on R_p, R_s, and a_p. Let's think about the formula again.

I think the correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a_p)

But wait, I'm not sure about that. Let me think again. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The probability is roughly the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, because the planet's orbit is much larger than the star's radius. So the area where the planet can transit is the area of the star. The area of the orbit is π a_p². So the probability might be (R_s / a_p)^2, but that doesn't include the planet's size. Hmm, perhaps that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a_p) )

Wait, no, that doesn't make units sense. Maybe it's (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a_p) )

Wait, R_p is in meters, R_s is in meters, a_p is in meters. So (R_p/R_s) is dimensionless, (R_s/a_p) is 1/meters. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a_p / R_s) ), which would be (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a_p) ) = R_p / a_p. But that seems too simple.

Wait, perhaps it's the ratio of the planet's disk to the star's disk, divided by the area of the planet's orbit. That might be (π R_p²) / (π R_s²) ) / (π a_p²) ) = (R_p² / R_s²) / a_p². So P = (R_p^2) / (R_s^2 a_p^2 )

But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / a_p ), because the area that the planet can cover is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, and the 'volume' (in terms of orbit) is 1/a_p.

Wait, let's think about it: for the same star, if the planet is closer (smaller a_p), the probability increases. Because the orbit is smaller, so the planet has a higher chance of passing in front. But also, for a larger planet, the probability increases.

But in this problem, both planets have the same mass. But mass isn't directly the same as radius. Hmm, but the problem states that both are Earth-like, so perhaps their radii are the same? Wait, the question says the planets have the same minimum masses. So if they have the same mass but different stars, perhaps their radii are the same, assuming similar compositions.

Wait, but the question says "Earth-like planets". So perhaps we can assume that their radii are similar to Earth's. So R_p1 = R_p2 = R_earth.

The host stars have the same radius. So R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

So, now, the transit probability for each planet would be proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/a_p ), if the formula is as I thought.

But wait, Planet_1 has a smaller a_p than Planet_2. Because a_p1 is about 0.6 a_p2.

So, P1 = ( (R_p / R_s)^2 ) * (1/a_p1 )

P2 = ( (R_p / R_s)^2 ) * (1/a_p2 )

So since a_p1 is smaller than a_p2, 1/a_p1 is larger than 1/a_p2.

So the ratio of P1 to P2 would be (1/a_p1) / (1/a_p2) ) = a_p2 / a_p1.

We found earlier that a_p1 = a_p2 * 0.606.

So a_p2 / a_p1 = 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 / P2 = 1.65. So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation. So a_p1 is 0.606 of a_p2. So a_p1 = 0.606 a_p2.

So the ratio a_p2 / a_p1 is 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65. Hence, P1 is 1.65 times P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting than Planet_2.

So the researchers should observe Planet_1 because it has a higher transit probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred with ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times, which is higher than our calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the a_p ratio.

Earlier steps:

a_p1³ / a_p2³ = (M_s1 / M_s2) * (T1² / T2² )

M_s1 is 2, M_s2 is 1. T1 is T2 /3.

So:

(2/1) * ( (T2/3)^2 / (T2)^2 ) = 2 * (1/9) ) = 2/9.

So a_p1³ = (2/9) a_p2³.

Taking cube roots: a_p1 = a_p2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

(2/9) is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606.

So a_p1 is about 0.606 a_p2.

So the ratio a_p2/a_p1 is 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times P2.

So the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says higher, but our calculation says 1.65 times, so option C is correct.

Wait, but wait, I assumed the formula where P is proportional to (1/a_p). But another possibility is that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a_p)).

Wait, let's think again. Another approach: the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a_p (1 - (R_p/a_p)^2)^(1/2)) )).

But since R_p is much smaller than a_p (because a_p is the semi-major axis, which is large), (R_p/a_p) is small, so 1 - (R_p/a_p)^2 ≈ 1, so the denominator is approximately 1. So P ≈ (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a_p).

Wait, but if that's the case, then since R_p is the same for both planets, and R_s is the same for both stars, the probability is inversely proportional to a_p.

So P is proportional to 1/a_p.

So P1 = 1/a_p1, P2 = 1/a_p2.

So P1/P2 = a_p2/a_p1 = 1.65.

So same as before. So the probability ratio is 1.65.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1 because it has a higher probability, and the option is C.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

Option C) Planet_1 preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The probability of a transit depends on the planet's size relative to the star and the orbital distance. The transit probability \( P \) is approximately proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p}{R_s} \cdot \frac{1}{a_p}
\]

where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, \( R_s \) is the star's radius, and \( a_p \) is the planet's orbital semi-major axis.

### Key Information:
1. **Planet Properties**:
   - Both planets have the same mass and are Earth-like, so their radii (\( R_p \)) are assumed to be the same.
   - Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2 (\( T_1 = \frac{T_2}{3} \)).

2. **Star Properties**:
   - Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2} \)).
   - Both stars have the same radius (\( R_{s1} = R_{s2} \)).

3. **Orbital Distance**:
   Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a_p \) is proportional to:
   \[
   a_p \propto T^{2/3} \cdot M_s^{1/3}
   \]
   For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
   \[
   \frac{a_{p1}^3}{a_{p2}^3} = \frac{M_{s1} \cdot T_1^2}{M_{s2} \cdot T_2^2} = \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_2}{3}\right)^2}{1 \cdot T_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
   \]
   Taking the cube root:
   \[
   \frac{a_{p1}}{a_{p2}} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
   \]
   Thus, \( a_{p1} \approx 0.606 \cdot a_{p2} \).

4. **Transit Probability Ratio**:
   Since \( P \propto \frac{1}{a_p} \) and \( R_p \) and \( R_s \) are the same for both planets:
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_{p2}}{a_{p1}} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
   \]
   Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Conclusion:
Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting due to its shorter orbital period and closer distance to its star. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1. The correct option is:

**Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
