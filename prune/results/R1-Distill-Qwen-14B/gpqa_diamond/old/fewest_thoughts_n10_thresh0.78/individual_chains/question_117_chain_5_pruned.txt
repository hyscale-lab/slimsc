Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism, that's when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So if a molecule has at least one chiral center, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

The question gives four compounds, and I need to figure out which ones show optical isomerism. Let's look at each one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings connected. The substituents are at 2 and 2' positions, and there are nitro groups at 6 and 6'. The molecule is a dimethyl ester, so each ester group is on a methyl. Now, biphenyl structures can have stereoisomerism if the rings are connected in such a way that rotation around the bond is restricted. But wait, I think that for biphenyls, unless there's a substituent that causes the rings to not be able to freely rotate, they can't have stereoisomers. So, in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, wait, 2 and 2' are on each ring. The nitro groups are at 6 and 6'—so each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate ester. But wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro, so each ring has a nitro group. Hmm, but will this lead to any chiral centers? Or perhaps the biphenyl itself as a whole could have a plane of symmetry?

I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry. Let me visualize. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Wait, for biphenyl, the positions are 1 and 1' where the rings connect. So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So on each ring, the substituents are at the ortho and para positions relative to the connecting bond. Wait, no, the 2 and 6 positions are across from each other on the same ring. Oh wait, 2 is adjacent to 1, and 6 is adjacent as well, so maybe on opposite sides. Hmm, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Like, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If that's the case, it wouldn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, if the arrangement around the single bond between the two rings is such that the molecule has a non-superimposable mirror image, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, for that, the molecule would need to have restricted rotation, which usually requires bulky groups. Or perhaps in this case, the substituents are such that the molecule can't rotate, making the two rings have different substituents but arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. I'm not too sure about this one. Let me think about it again. Alternatively, maybe the molecule does have a chiral center somewhere else. Wait, the ester groups are on each ring; the ester carbonyl is connected to methyl groups. So each ester is OMe attached to the ring. Wait, in the structure, each ester is at position 2 and 2'—so each ring has an ester group and a nitro group. Wait, 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has substituents at 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). So for each ring, the substituents are at ortho and para positions relative to the connecting bond. So the substituents on each ring are in same positions. So the overall molecule could be symmetrical. If that's the case, then no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. But I'm not 100% certain.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. The structure is CH3-O-C-O-CH2-C(OH)H-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3?

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the middle carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? The hydroxyl is on the middle carbon, which would have four different groups: two CH2 groups, the OH, and the ester group. Wait, let me see. The middle carbon: attached to CH2(OH), CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure would be:

CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH2- ?

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon. So the structure is: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon chain is CH3-COOCH3 attached to a CH2-OH and another CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, maybe it's:

Carbon chain: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The middle carbon (CH2OH) is attached to:

- One CH2(OH) group (as in, the carbon itself is the middle one, so it's connected to two CH2 groups? Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, the formula is HOOC-CH2-OH? No, that's not right. Let me think again. For 2-hydroxypropanoate, the carboxylic acid is on one end, then the middle CH2 has the OH. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, the middle carbon is CH2, attached to OH, CH3 (from COOCH3?), no. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's:

The molecule is CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, that's (R)-2-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester. So the structure is:

COOCH3 attached to a CH(OH)CH3 group. So the carbon attached to the OH has four substituents: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and the other CH2 group? Wait, no, the carbon is CH(OH) connected to two CH3 groups? Wait, that can't be because the formula is 2-hydroxypropanoate. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as:

The molecule is:

CH3

O

C-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 ?

No, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. 2-hydroxypropanoate is an ester derived from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure of that acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. When esterified, it becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the methyl ester. The carbon with the OH is the middle one: it's attached to a CH3, a COOCH3, an OH, and another CH2 group? Or wait, the middle carbon is CH(OH), which is connected to two CH3 groups and the COOCH3 and the OH. Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the middle carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- One CH3 (from
