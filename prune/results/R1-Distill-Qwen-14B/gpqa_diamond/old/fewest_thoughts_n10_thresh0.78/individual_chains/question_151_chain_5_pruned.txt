Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, wait. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually column vectors, and they should be normalized, meaning their squared magnitude should sum to 1. Let me check that first.

The state vector is [-1, 2, 1]. So each component is a complex number, but in this case, they're all real. So the square of each component is (-1)^2 =1, 2^2=4, and 1^2=1. Adding those up: 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, the norm is sqrt(6), right? So the vector isn't normalized. That's a problem because in quantum mechanics, state vectors must be normalized. So I think I need to normalize it first before proceeding.

Wait, but wait, the problem just gives the state. Maybe they expect me to proceed without normalizing, assuming perhaps that it's already normalized or that the probabilities will adjust accordingly. Or maybe it's a typo. Hmm. Let me think. But in any case, I think the correct approach is to normalize the state vector. So I'll proceed with that.

So the state vector is |Ïˆ> = 1/sqrt(6) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Because when you square each component, you get 1/6, 4/6, 1/6. So each term is (1/6), and the sum is (6)/6 =1. So yes, that's correct.

Next, the observable is given by the matrix P. Let me write down matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix. Now, I remember that observables are Hermitian operators because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to possible measurement outcomes. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian
