Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question involves an alien spacecraft traveling at a very high speed towards Earth. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective. Wait, wait, the options mention the astronaut's lifetime is about 150 solar years. So, if the trip takes longer than that, they might not make it. But let's think carefully.

First, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super close to c. So, we're probably dealing with relativistic effects here. Relativity comes into play when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. So, time dilation and length contraction might be involved.

The astronaut's average lifetime is 150 years. But from Earth's frame of reference, how long would the trip take? Let's calculate the distance and time first. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. I think the distance is about 163,000 light-years. Wait, no, I'm not sure. Let me think. Oh wait, the problem says "the Large Magellanic Cloud"—so I need to know the distance between the LMC and Earth. I remember it's approximately 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let's say roughly 160,000 light-years for estimation.

So the distance is about 160,000 light-years. At a speed of 0.99999987c, how long does it take from Earth's perspective? Time is distance divided by speed. So, time t = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987 * c) ). Wait, because 1 ly is the distance light travels in one year. So, if you're moving at v = 0.99999987c, then the time from Earth's frame would be t = distance / v.

But wait, distance is in light-years, v is in terms of c. So, substituting, t = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 * c) ). Since 1 ly = c * 1 year, so the units would cancel. So t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 160,000 years. Because 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so the time is roughly 160,000 years. But wait, that's a long time. But that's from Earth's frame. But the astronaut is on the spacecraft, so their experienced time would be different due to time dilation.

Time dilation is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's calculate gamma. v is 0.99999987c.

So, beta = v/c = 0.99999987. So beta squared is approximately (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that. Let's compute beta squared: (0.99999987)^2 = approx 0.99999974. So 1 - beta^2 is 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. Then, sqrt(1 - beta^2) is sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4 (since sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately 5.1e-4 because (5.1e-4)^2 = 2.6e-7). So gamma is 1 / (5.1e-4) ≈ 1960.77. So gamma is approximately 1960.77.

So, from Earth's frame, the time is about 160,000 years. The astronaut's proper time, which is the time they experience, is t' = t / gamma. So t' = 160,000 / 1960.77 ≈ let's compute that. 160,000 divided by approximately 2000 is 80. So 160,000 / 1960 is about 81.63 years. Wait, 1960 is approx 2000; 160,000 divided by 2000 is 80, but since 1960 is a bit less than
