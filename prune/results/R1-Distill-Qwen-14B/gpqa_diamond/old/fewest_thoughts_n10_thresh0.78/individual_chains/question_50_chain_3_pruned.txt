Okay, so I need to figure out how many loops are in the Feynman diagram based on the given expression. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the process and the divergences that come up. Each loop typically introduces a factor of integration, which affects the overall expression.

The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Right, alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4pi epsilon_0) or something like that. g is probably a coupling constant, maybe from a gauge theory or something else. The (Q/M) term looks like a ratio of some energy scale Q to another scale M.

Wait, the key here is looking at the powers of the constants to determine the loop count. I remember that loop diagrams contribute factors involving (4pi)^L, where L is the number of loops. Because each loop brings in an integral over a four-momentum, and when you regularize it, say using dimensional regularization or cutoff regularization, you might get factors like (4pi)^epsilon (but I'm not sure about the exact form).

Looking at the expression, I see 1/(4pi)^6. That would mean 4pi is raised to the sixth power. So if each loop contributes a 4pi in the denominator, then the exponent would be the number of loops. So 1/(4pi)^6 implies six loops? Wait, but wait. No, wait. Wait, I think I got that backwards. Because each loop gives a factor like (4pi)^{d/2 - something}, but maybe I'm mixing up dimensional regularization and other methods.

Wait, another approach: The number of loops L is related to the superficial degree of divergence, but perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, in the context of perturbation theory, each loop introduces a certain number of factors. For example, in a one-loop diagram, the integral typically brings in a factor like (4pi)^2, because it's a two-dimensional integral (since it's in d=4 dimensions, but maybe in some regularization scheme it's different).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the general formula for the loop integral dimension. In four dimensions, each loop gives a factor of (4pi)^2 * (some other factors) from the integral. So for L loops, you might get (4pi)^{2L} in the denominator if it's coming from an integral. So if the denominator has (4pi)^6, then 2L =6, so L=3? Wait, but wait, the expression has 1/(4pi)^6. So the denominator has (4pi)^6. If each loop contributes (4pi)^2 to the denominator, then 6/2=3 loops. Hmm, that would point to 3 loops.

But wait, another way: when you compute loop integrals, often you have to factor out (4pi)^2 per loop. So for a one-loop diagram, you'd have (4pi)^2 in the denominator, two loops would have (4pi)^4, etc. So 1/(
