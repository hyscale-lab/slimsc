Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that when a benzene ring has substituents, they can activate or deactivate the ring, affecting where the substitution happens. The question is about the para-isomer yield in each case and then ordering them from lowest to highest weight fraction of the para-isomer.

The substances given are numbered 1 to 6, and I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of para-isomer. The options are A, B, C, D.

Let me think about each substituent. Electrophilic substitution, like bromination, depends on the directing group of each substituent. 

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, it'll go para to the methyl. But wait, because it's a meta director? No, no, methyl is activating, so ortho and para. So the major product would be a mixture of ortho and para. But since it's excess Br2, probably a monobromination, but if it's excess and more than one H is replaced, maybe it's a di-substitution? Wait, the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed, so each has only one Br. So for each, the substitution happens once, but the substituent directs where.

Wait, but when multiple positions are possible, the para may be more favored if the substituent is a strong activating group. Wait, for toluene, the methyl directs to ortho and para. The para is more favored because of steric hindrance in ortho? Or is it that in some cases, the ortho is possible but para is major? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no, I think for toluene, para is the major product when bromine is used. Because the methyl group is an activating group, and the para position is more accessible, so yes.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That's ethyl benzoate, I think. The substituent here is COOEt. The carbonyl group is deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So it's a meta director. So the substituent is deactivating and meta-directing. So when bromine reacts, the Br will add para to the substituent? No, wait, meta-directing means that the incoming group will enter at meta positions relative to the substituent. Wait, no. Wait, when the substituent is meta-directing, the incoming electrophile comes in the meta position relative to it. So bromine would attack the meta position, meaning that the para position isn't the site. Wait, but wait, the substituent is at a certain position; the bromide would come at meta relative to that.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of directing. For example, in benzoic acid, the substituent is a strong deactivating (COOH is deactivating due to resonance), so it's meta-directing. So in the case of ethyl benzoate (PhCOOEt), the substituent is a carbonyl group, which is deactivating and meta-directing. So the bromine would add to the meta position. But wait, wait: in a benzene ring with a substituent, the substitution occurs in the positions ortho, meta, or para to the substituent. So if the substituent is meta-directing, the incoming group goes meta to it. So for PhCOOEt, the substituent (COOEt) is in position 1, so Br would go into position 3 or 4? Wait, no, position 3 is meta from 1, but position 4 would be para. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the effect on the ring. When a substituent is electron-withdrawing, it deactivates the ring, making substitution slower, but directs incoming groups to certain positions. So COOEt, being an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), is a meta director. So bromine will substitute meta to it. So the major product would have Br in meta position, so the para-isomer is not a major product. Wait, but the question is about the para-isomer, so in this case, the para position relative to what? Hmm, perhaps the substituent is in position 1; the para position would be position 4. But if the substituent is meta-directing, the Br will go to position 3 or 5. So in this case, the para-isomer is not formed. So the yield of para would be low, maybe negligible.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the para-isomer of the product. So for each compound, when bromine is added, what's the distribution between para and other isomers. So for that, the substituents will influence the site of substitution.

3) C6H5-Cl: That's chlorobenzene. Cl is a substituent which is ortho/para directing but deactivating (because it's an EWG). So it's a meta director? No, Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So for chlorobenzene, bromine can substitute at ortho, para, but the ring is deactivated, so substitution is slower than benzene.

Wait, but for substitution, Cl is a meta director? No, wait, Cl is a ortho/para director because it's an electron-donating group by resonance (though it's an EWG by inductive effect). Wait, wait, actually, Cl is an ortho/para director because it can donate electrons via resonance. So when Cl is attached, the incoming electrophile adds to ortho or para positions. So in chlorobenzene, Br would add either ortho or para to Cl. But wait, which is more favored? For meta directors, the product is meta, but for ortho/para directors, more ortho and para, but which is more major? I think that for Cl, the para position is more favored because of steric reasons. So the major product is para-substituted.

4) C6H5-NO2: That's nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So when bromine reacts, the Br will add meta to the nitro group. So the para-isomer would not form. So the yield of para is low, but perhaps some ortho and para (if para is possible? Wait, no, nitro is meta director. So the Br will go meta, so the para position relative to the substituent is not substituted. Therefore, the para-isomer is not formed. So the yield of para is zero in this case.

Wait, but wait. The substituent is in position 1. The meta position is 3, and the para position is 4. So substituting in meta (3) would make the Br in position 3, so the product is m-bromo nitrobenzene. So the para-isomer (Br in position 4) is not formed, so the yield would be zero for para.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene. The ethyl group is an activating (electron-donating) group, so it's an ortho/para director. So when bromine substitutes, it'll go ortho or para to the ethyl group. Which is more favored? I think para is more favored because ortho might have more steric hindrance. So the major product is para substitution.

Wait, but sometimes in such cases, the ortho is possible but para is major. So the yield of para is higher here.

6) C6H5-COOH: That's benzoic acid. The substituent is COOH, which is deactivating (due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carboxylic acid group) and meta-directing. So bromine will add meta to the COOH group. So the para position isn't a site for substitution, so the para-isomer isn't formed. So the yield is low.

Wait, but wait. Benzoic acid is a strong deactivating group. So Br would substitute meta. So in this case, the para product isn't formed.

So, let me list each case and the para-isomer yield.

1) Toluene (PhCH3): substituent is activating, ortho/para director. So Br can go ortho or para. Which is more? I think para is major. So the para-isomer is a high yield.

2) Ethyl benzoate (PhCOOEt): substituent is deactivating, meta director. So Br goes meta. So para-isomer is not formed. So yield is low.

3) Chlorobenzene (PhCl): substituent is deactivating (Cl is EWG), but ortho/para director. So Br goes ortho or para. Which is more? I think para is major because ortho is hindered. So higher yield of para.

4) Nitrobenzene (PhNO2): substituent is deactivating, meta director. So Br goes meta. So para isn't formed. So para-isomer yield is low.

5) Ethylbenzene (PhC2H5): substituent is activating, ortho/para director. Para is major, so high yield.

6) Benzoic acid (PhCOOH): substituent is deactivating, meta director. So Br goes meta, so para isn't formed. So low yield.

So now, the order of the para-isomer yield is:

Looking at each substance:

1) High
2) Low
3) High
4) Low
5) High
6) Low

Wait, no. Wait, let me correct:

Wait, for 1, toluene: para is major, so high para yield.

3) Chlorobenzene: substituent is Cl, which is ortho/para director. Since it's deactivating, the ring is less reactive, but substitution is still possible. The major product would be para. So the para-isomer has a relatively high yield.

5) Ethylbenzene: substituent is ethyl, ortho/para director, major product is para. So high yield.

So these three have high yield: 1,3,5.

Others (2,4,6) have low or zero para.

Wait, but what about the relative yields among 1,3,5. Which has the highest, and which the lowest.

Wait, maybe the activating groups have higher para yields. But between toluene (methyl), ethyl, and chlorobenzene?

Wait, chlorobenzene is deactivating, but it's an ortho/para director, so substitution is slower but para is a major product.

So the para yield would be lower for chlorobenzene than for toluene or ethylbenzene, because the ring is less reactive. Or wait, no, since the substituent is directing, but the reactivity is lower. So the para product is formed, but perhaps not as much as in the activating groups.

Hmm, but in terms of the yield of the para-isomer, the activating groups (toluene, ethylbenzene) would have higher yields because the ring is more reactive. Chlorobenzene is less reactive, so the para product may have a lower yield compared to toluene or ethylbenzene.

So arranging the para yields:

Lowest: 2 (PhCOOEt) and 4 (PhNO2), 6 (PhCOOH) have low, maybe same or in order.

Wait, but wait. Let me think:

Which substituents make the para product more or less likely.

In toluene (1), the activating group (CH3) makes the ring more reactive, so para is major. So high para.

In ethylbenzene (5), similar to toluene, but substituent is larger (ethyl). Would that affect the para yield? Maybe the para product is major but perhaps less than toluene because ethyl is bulkier, making para substitution slightly less favored because of steric hindrance. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl (maybe?), but I'm not certain about that.

Wait, the activating groups are in order: methyl (activates more than ethyl?), perhaps not. I think the order of activating is similar for alkyl groups; maybe ethyl is more activating than methyl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the para product in ethylbenzene has a higher yield than toluene because ethyl is a stronger activating group. Or perhaps the opposite.

Alternatively, maybe the para product yields are, from highest to lowest: 5 (ethylbenzene), 1 (toluene), 3 (chlorobenzene). Or perhaps 1 is higher than 3.

Wait, perhaps in chlorobenzene, the para product is major but the overall yield is lower because the ring is less reactive. So for the same substituent, the para is major, but the total substitution is lower.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each compound, what fraction of the product is the para isomer.

So, for toluene, the product is mostly para and some ortho. So 1: high para fraction.

For ethylbenzene, same: high para.

Chlorobenzene: para is major, but since the ring is less reactive, perhaps the para isn't as dominant as in toluene. Or maybe it's similar in dominance but lower overall substitution.

Wait, perhaps the para yield order is 5 (ethylbenzene) > 1 (toluene) > 3 (chlorobenzene).

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps in chlorobenzene, the para product is major. But compared to activating substituents, the para product may have a similar or lower yield.

Wait, let me think about actual data. For example, in toluene, the para substitution is about 60-70%, and ortho is about 30%. For chlorobenzene, para substitution is about 35-45% (I think), because Cl is deactivating but ortho/para. So perhaps the para yield in 1 (toluene) is higher than in 3 (chlorobenzene).

So, placing the substances in order of increasing para yield:

The para yields (from low to high) would be:

Low: 2 (PhCOOEt), 4 (PhNO2), 6 (PhCOOH) < 3 (PhCl) < 1 (PhCH3) <5 (PhC2H5)

Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, it's possible that PhCOOEt, PhNO2, and PhCOOH (substances 2,4,6) cannot form a para product because their substituents are meta directors, so their para-isomer yields are zero. So their para fractions are zero.

But wait, no, because sometimes even if a substituent is meta-directing, the para position is possible through some other mechanism, but I think that's not the case. For meta-directing groups, the Br will go into meta positions, so the para product is negligible.

So, the para fraction for 2,4,6 is zero. But wait, 3 is PhCl, which is ortho/para, so para is possible. 1 and 5 are ortho/para, so para is possible.

So the order would be:

Substances with para fraction increasing: 2,4,6 (0), then 3 (low), then 1, then 5 (high).

Wait, but 3 (PhCl) has a para product, but the fraction may be lower than 1 and 5.

So the order from lowest to highest:

2,4,6 (lowest, zero), then 3, then 1, then 5 (highest).

So the order of substances based on their para yield (from lowest to highest):

2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

But the question is about substances 1-6. So the order is 2,4,6 in the lowest, followed by 3, then 1, then 5.

Wait, but the question is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of para. So the order would be: 2,4,6 (lowest), then 3, then 1, then 5.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

The options are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me reevaluate the para fractions.

Wait, for substances 2,4,6: their substituents are meta directors (COOEt, NO2, COOH), so the para product is not formed. So their para fraction is zero. So they have the lowest para fractions.

Now, among the others:

3: Cl is ortho/para, but deactivating. So para is major but the ring is less reactive, so the para fraction is lower than in substances with activating groups.

1: CH3 is activating, so para is major.

5: C2H5 is activating, but the substituent is larger, so perhaps steric hindrance makes para less favored than ortho, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the more activating the substituent, the more the para product is formed. So:

Substances with activating groups (1,3,5) have higher para fractions than those with deactivating (2,4,6, which have zero for para).

So the order is:

Lowest para fractions: 2,4,6 (all zero), then 3 (Cl, which is deactivating but para is possible), then 1, then 5.

Wait, no. Because for 3, Cl is deactivating, so para is possible but the fraction is lower than in activating groups.

So the order would be:

2,4,6 (para 0) <3 (para some, low) <1 (para high) <5 (para even higher? Or maybe not).

Wait, perhaps ethyl is a bigger group than methyl, so in ethylbenzene, the para product is less favored than in toluene due to steric hindrance. So 1's para fraction is higher than 5's.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each substituent's effect on the para product.

Substance 1: Toluene (PhCH3). Activating, ortho/para. Para is major, so high yield.

Substance2: PhCOOEt. Deactivating, meta. Para is not formed. So zero.

Substance3: PhCl. Deactivating, ortho/para. Para is major, but due to deactivation, the overall substitution is less. So the para isomer is formed, but the para fraction may be lower than in activating groups.

Substance4: PhNO2. Deactivating, meta. Para not formed. Zero.

Substance5: PhC2H5. Activating (stronger?), ortho/para. Para is major. So higher para fraction than 1?

Wait, but toluene's para fraction is around 60-70%, ethylbenzene's is perhaps similar or a bit lower because ethyl is bulkier.

So, if 5's para fraction is higher than 3's but lower than 1's.

So the order is:

Substances with no para (2,4,6) < 3 (PhCl) <1 (PhCH3) <5 (PhC2H5).

So the increasing order is:

2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

So arrange the six substances in order of increasing para fraction:

Substances 2,4,6 have para fraction 0.

Substance3: para fraction is about, say, 30%.

Substance1: para fraction about 60%.

Substance5: para fraction about 70%.

So the order is: 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

But wait, the options don't have all three (2,4,6) at the lowest, but the options list all 6 substances in order.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, so 4 comes before 2, which comes before 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

Hmm, but according to our analysis, 2,4,6 are tied at the lowest, then 3, then 1, then 5.

But the options don't have a situation where 2,4,6 are all first. So perhaps I need to think about the actual para fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's directing ability affects the order.

Wait, another possibility: the para yield is determined by the substituent's ability to direct.

Substituents that are strong meta directors (like -NO2) do not allow para substitution, so their para yield is zero.

Substituents that are meta directors (like COOEt, COOH) also have zero para.

Substituents that are ortho/para directors can have para substitution, but their activating or deactivating nature affects how much.

So, the para fraction order would be:

Substituents with meta directors (2,4,6) have zero.

Substituents with ortho/para but deactivating (3) have some para, but lower than activating.

Substituents with ortho/para and activating (1,5) have higher.

Now, between 1 and 5, which has a higher para fraction?

If 5 has a larger substituent, the para position might be less favored because of steric hindrance. So perhaps 1's para fraction is higher than 5's.

So the order would be:

Substances 2,4,6 (zero) < 3 (some para) <1 (high para) <5 (moderate para? Or lower than 1?).

Wait, perhaps in ethylbenzene, the para product is the major product, but the fraction is lower than toluene's.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's size doesn't affect the para fraction as much as the activating nature.

So, the order would be:

2,4,6 (lowest, zero) <3 <1 <5.

So, the sequence is 2,4,6 are first, then 3, then 1, then 5.

But how to arrange 2,4,6? Do their para fractions differ? For 2,4,6, all have substituents that are meta directors, so their para fractions are zero.

So they all tie for the lowest. But the options don't have all three in the same position. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps some substituents can lead to some para product, even if they are meta directors. For example, sometimes substituents can have some ortho and para substitution, but in the case of meta directors, the para product is a minor component.

Wait, but if a substituent is a meta director, the major product is meta, but minor could be ortho and para. So perhaps in some cases, there's a little para product. But in that case, the para fractions for 2,4,6 would be low but non-zero.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to proceed with the assumption that 2,4,6 have zero para fraction.

Now, let's look at the options.

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

So, the order is 4, then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

But according to our analysis, 2,4,6 are tied for lowest, then 3, then 1, then 5.

Option B:6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3.

No, 5 and 1 are higher, but this doesn't fit.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Option D:3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4.

No, that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering 5's position. If the substituent is more bulky, perhaps the para product is less favored, making 5's para fraction lower than 1's.

So the order would be 2,4,6 (0) <3 <1 <5.

But how do 2,4,6 compare among themselves? If their substituents are different, but all are meta directors, perhaps the substituents' electron-withdrawing strength affects the substitution reactivity but not the para fraction. So their para fractions are zero in all cases.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any that start with 2,4,6. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's directing effect affects the possibility of para substitution. Let me think for each substituent:

1) CH3: activates, ortho/para. Para is major.

2) COOEt: deactivates, meta. Para is not formed.

3) Cl: deactivates, ortho/para. Para is major, but since ring is deactivated, the overall substitution is slower, but the fraction is lower.

4) NO2: deactivates, meta. Para not formed.

5) C2H5: activates, ortho/para. Para is major.

6) COOH: deactivates, meta. Para not formed.

So, the para fractions are:

1: high

3: moderate (lower than 1)

5: high (maybe higher than 1, but not sure)

2,4,6: zero.

So, the order of para fractions from low to high is: 2,4,6 (zero) <3 <1 <5.

But again, the options don't seem to capture this, or perhaps I'm misarranging.

Wait, the options list all six substances in order. So I need to see which option has 2,4,6 in the first three positions, then 3, then 1, then 5.

Looking at option A:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5.

So order is 4, 2, 6, 3, 1,5.

Which would imply 4's para fraction is the lowest, then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

But according to my analysis, 2,4,6 are tied for the lowest.

But the options don't allow for a tie. So perhaps I need to find another approach.

Alternative approach: the number of possible para products.

Wait, maybe the para product is more favored in certain substituents. For example, in 3 (PhCl), the substituent is ortho/para but deactivating. So the para product is possible but not as dominant as in activating groups.

So the order of para fractions:

Substances with meta directors: 2,4,6 (lowest, zero)

Substituents that are ortho/para and deactivating: 3 (next)

Substituents that are ortho/para and activating: 1 and 5.

Now, between 1 and 5, which has a higher para fraction? Toluene's para fraction is about 60%, ethylbenzene's is about 50%? Or higher?

I think toluene's para fraction is higher than ethylbenzene's because ethyl is a larger group, leading to more steric hindrance in the para position.

Wait, no. Maybe ethyl is less bulky at the position. Alternatively, perhaps ethyl is a stronger activating group, leading to a higher para fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the bulky substituent in ethylbenzene makes the para substitution less favored than in toluene. So 5's para fraction is lower than 1's.

Therefore, the order of para fractions is:

2,4,6 (0) <3 <5 <1.

Wait, no. Because 5 would have a higher para fraction than 3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall real data:

In toluene, the para product is about 70% and ortho about 30%.

In chlorobenzene, the para product is about 35%, as it's less reactive.

In ethylbenzene, the para product is about 55-60%.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's size affects the para fraction. Toluene, being a small substituent, has a higher para fraction than ethylbenzene.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

The para fraction from low to high:

2,4,6 (0) <3 (PhCl) <1 (PhCH3) <5 (PhC2H5).

So the order of the six substances would be 2,4,6 first, then 3, then 1, then 5.

Looking at the options, none have 2,4,6 all first. So perhaps the correct option is A.

Wait, option A is: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Which implies that 4 has the lowest para fraction, followed by 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

But according to my analysis, 2,4,6 are tied at zero, so they should be first. But in the options, they're not tied.

Alternatively, perhaps the order among 2,4,6 is as follows:

Which substituent is the strongest deactivating? 4 is NO2 (very strong deactivating), then 6 (COOH, which is also strong), then 2 (COOEt, which is weaker).

So the para fractions for 2,4,6 are all zero, but their reactivity is 4>6>2?

Wait, no, the reactivity is lower for stronger deactivating groups. So 4 is the least reactive, then 6, then 2.

Wait, but what determines the position in the order of para fractions? If all of them have zero, their order is irrelevant. But perhaps the question is considering reactivity but that's not directly related to para fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction is not zero for all three. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in some cases, even with a meta director, a minor amount of para product is formed. So their para fractions are non-zero but very low.

In that case, perhaps the substituents with the weakest deactivating effect would have higher para fractions (but still low).

So substituent 2 (PhCOOEt) is a carbonyl group, which is deactivating but perhaps less so than NO2 and COOH.

So the order of para fractions for 2,4,6 would be: 2 (lowest para fraction) <4 <6.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because NO2 is a stronger deactivator. Alternatively, perhaps the strength of deactivation affects the amount of para product. A stronger deactivator makes the ring less reactive, so the para fraction is lower.

So, among 2,4,6:

COOEt (2) is less deactivating than NO2 (4) and COOH (6).

So 2 would have a higher para fraction (still low) than 4 and 6.

Wait, but I'm not sure. If COOEt is less deactivating than NO2 and COOH, then the ring is more reactive for 2 than 4 and 6. So when adding Br, it's easier for 2 to have some para substitution.

So, the order of para fractions for 2,4,6 would be: 2 (lowest) <4 <6.

Wait, no, higher reactivity would lead to more substitution, but perhaps the para fraction is higher. Wait, but if all have meta directors, their para fractions are zero. So I'm stuck.

Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about each option and what it suggests.

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

So, the order is:

4 (NO2) <2 (COOEt) <6 (COOH) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

This would imply that 4 has the lowest para fraction, followed by 2, then 6, etc.

But according to our analysis, 2,4,6 have zero para, so 4 is same as 2 and 6.

But in this option, 4 is first, then 2, then 6, which is not correct.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3.

No, that can't be right.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

Nope.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4.

No.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A, because 4 is more deactivating, so in the case where para fraction is low, 4 has the least, then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is based on the substituent's directing effect and their ability to form para products.

So, substances that form para products (1,3,5) have higher para fractions, and others (2,4,6) have zero.

Among 1,3,5:

1: para fraction high (70%)

3: para fraction moderate (30%)

5: para fraction high (maybe higher than 1)

Wait, but I thought that ethyl is a larger group, so para fraction in 5 is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps 5's para fraction is higher than 1's.

Alternatively, perhaps 5's para fraction is higher than 3's but lower than 1's.

So, the order among 1,3,5 is 3 <1 <5.

So the total order would be:

2,4,6 (zero) <3 <1 <5.

But the options don't have that.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option A is the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct order is:

The substances are arranged based on their substituents' directing effect and activating/deactivating nature.

Substituents that deactivate and are meta directors (2,4,6) have the least para product. Among them, the order may depend on the substituent's strength.

Then, substituents that are activating and ortho/para (1,5) have higher para fractions, with 5's being higher than 1's.

Substituent 3 is Cl, which is deactivating but ortho/para, so lower para fraction than 1 and 5.

So the order would be:

2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

So arranging the numbers in order:

2,4,6,3,1,5.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match, but option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5. Which is 4 first, then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

Wait, but according to my conclusion, 2 comes after 4 and 6. No, I thought 2 is more reactive than 4 and 6 because COOEt is less deactivating than NO2 and COOH.

Wait, perhaps the order of substituent strength is: NO2 (4) is the strongest deactivator, then COOH (6), then COOEt (2). So their para fractions are zero, but with 4 <6 <2 < ... .

But in terms of the order from low to high, the substituents with stronger deactivators would have lower para fractions. But since all are zero, their order among themselves is irrelevant. 

In that case, the correct option would be the one where the substituents with zero para are first, followed by 3, then 1, then 5.

But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps among the meta directors (2,4,6), the order is 4 <6 <2. So 4 has the lowest para fraction, then 6, then 2.

Then 3,1,5.

In that case, the order is 4,6,2,3,1,5.

Looking at the options, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3. No, that doesn't fit.

Option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5. No, it's 4,2,6.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the substituent's directing effect (i.e., whether it allows para substitution) is the main factor, and the actual para fraction. So, the substituents that allow para substitution (1,3,5) are higher in the order, and those that don't (2,4,6) are lower.

So the order would be:

2,4,6 (para fraction zero) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

So the correct order is 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct option is A, which is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 6,4,2,3,1,5.

But that's not any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's directing effect is the main determinant. So, the substituents in order of para product yield are:

Substituents leading to higher para yields: 1,5,3.

Substituents leading to lower para yields: 2,4,6.

But I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to go with option A.


To determine the order of substances 1-6 based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in their electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine, we analyze the directing effects of their substituents and their impact on the para-isomer yield.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substance 1 (C6H5-CH3 - Toluene)**:  
   The methyl group (-CH3) is an **activating, ortho/para-directing group**. Bromination occurs at the ortho and para positions, with the para-isomer being the major product due to reduced steric hindrance compared to the ortho position. Thus, the para-isomer yield is **high**.

2. **Substance 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5 - Ethyl Benzoate)**:  
   The ethoxy carbonyl group (-COOEt) is a **deactivating, meta-directing group**. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta position, with no significant para-isomer formation. Thus, the para-isomer yield is **zero**.

3. **Substance 3 (C6H5-Cl - Chlorobenzene)**:  
   The chlorine atom (-Cl) is a **deactivating, ortho/para-directing group**. Bromination occurs at the ortho and para positions, but the ring's reduced reactivity due to deactivation results in a lower para-isomer yield compared to activating groups. Thus, the para-isomer yield is **moderate**.

4. **Substance 4 (C6H5-NO2 - Nitrobenzene)**:  
   The nitro group (-NO2) is a **strongly deactivating, meta-directing group**. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta position, with no significant para-isomer formation. Thus, the para-isomer yield is **zero**.

5. **Substance 5 (C6H5-C2H5 - Ethylbenzene)**:  
   The ethyl group (-C2H5) is an **activating, ortho/para-directing group**. Bromination occurs at the ortho and para positions, with the para-isomer being the major product. The para-isomer yield is **high**, potentially slightly lower than toluene due to steric hindrance from the larger ethyl group.

6. **Substance 6 (C6H5-COOH - Benzoic Acid)**:  
   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a **strongly deactivating, meta-directing group**. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta position, with no significant para-isomer formation. Thus, the para-isomer yield is **zero**.

### Order of Increasing Para-Isomer Yield:
- **Substances 2, 4, 6**: These have **zero para-isomer yield** due to their meta-directing substituents.  
- **Substance 3**: Chlorobenzene has a **moderate para-isomer yield** due to its ortho/para-directing but deactivating chlorine substituent.  
- **Substance 1**: Toluene has a **high para-isomer yield** due to its activating methyl group.  
- **Substance 5**: Ethylbenzene has a **high para-isomer yield**, slightly lower than toluene due to steric hindrance from the ethyl group.

Thus, the correct order is **2 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**.

### Correct Option:
**A) 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**

Answer: A
