Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid that's been dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The NMR data is given, and the key is the NOESY spectrum which shows a cross-peak in the major product but not in the minor. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected by that cross-peak.

First, let me summarize the given information:

1. The starting material is a cis-alkene dicarboxylic acid. Dehydration forms an anhydride. So, the structure of the anhydride is probably a cyclic structure because that's common for dicarboxylic acids when dehydrated. The cis-alkene would influence the structure of the anhydride.

2. The NMR data for the anhydride: 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aromatic or conjugated system. Wait, but wait, the anhydride from a dicarboxylic acid would typically have a structure with two carbonyl groups. Oh, but the 1H NMR has a single peak, so maybe it's a symmetric structure with equivalent protons. High ppm (7) suggests maybe a vinyl proton or something like that, but I'm not too sure.

Wait, 7 ppm is more typical of aromatic protons. But in an anhydride, maybe there's an aromatic ring? Or perhaps it's a conjugated diene? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride like succinic anhydride, but succinic's H NMR doesn't have a peak at 7 ppm. Because succinic anhydride has no protons on the oxygenated carbons; the protons are on the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls. The H's adjacent to carbonyls are usually around 2.4-3.5 ppm as singlets or multiplets. So what gives a peak at 7 ppm?

Wait, maybe the anhydride is formed from a diacid with a double bond. So if the dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene, when it dehydrates, it forms a cyclic anhydride with a conjugated double bond. Like, perhaps a structure where the anhydride has a double bond next to the carbonyl groups. So for example, if the starting acid is something like cis-butenedioic acid, then the anhydride would have a conjugated dien structure.

Wait, but then the 1H NMR has one peak at 7 ppm. Maybe that's the protons on the double bond. If the double bond is between two carbons that are each attached to an oxygen (like in a cyclic anhydride), then those pro
