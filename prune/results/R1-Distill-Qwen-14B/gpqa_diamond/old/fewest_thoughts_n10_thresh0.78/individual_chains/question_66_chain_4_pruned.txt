Okay, I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Operators in SMEFT are used to parameterize beyond the Standard Model physics, right?

So the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1. Lorentz Symmetry, 2. Poincare symmetry, 3. CP symmetry, 4. CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely one of them. Because the Standard Model is Lorentz symmetric, and SMEFT is an effective theory built on top of that. So any operator in SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry. Because if they didn't, that would imply physics beyond what we can handle with the usual framework.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it should respect Poincare symmetry. Because field theories are based on these symmetries. So both Lorentz and Poincare must be respected. So options that include both 1 and 2 would be correct.

Now, CP symmetry. Wait, does SMEFT enforce CP symmetry? I'm a bit fuzzy here. CP symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation and parity. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric on its own. For instance, CP violation occurs in the CKM matrix. So if SMEFT includes operators that go beyond the Standard Model
