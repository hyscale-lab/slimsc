Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products for two reactions. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll think out loud.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, using t-BuOK as the base. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products A and B.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) â†’ A.

Hmm, okay, I remember that when ketones react with something like acrylates, it's probably a Claisen condensation or some kind of addition. Wait, no, Claisen is between esters, right? Oh wait, maybe it's a crossed aldol addition. Because the base like t-BuOK would deprotonate something.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclic ketone. So maybe it's an aldol reaction. The ketone has two substituents: 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl. Wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, and there are substituents at 2 (ethyl and methyl?) Wait, no, wait: 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl would imply that positions 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group, but wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. Wait, maybe it's 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? No, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group? That can't be possible because each carbon in cyclohexane can have only so many substituents. Oh wait, no, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's 2-
