Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these organic compounds show optical isomerism. I remember optical isomerism has something to do with the molecules being able to rotate plane-polarized light, which usually happens when there's a chiral center. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So if a molecule has a chiral center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, causing optical activity.

Let's look at each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions of each ring. Wait, the substituents are nitro groups and carboxylate ester groups. So each ring has two substituents. Since the rings are connected by a single bond, do they have a plane of symmetry? Oh, wait, maybe not. Wait, if the groups are arranged in such a way that each substituent on each ring is in the para position relative to the connecting bond, but since the substituents are on 2 and 6 positions, let me visualize this. If the rings are connected at position 1 and 1', then the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting point. So each ring has two substituents: a nitro and a carboxylate ester.

Wait, but for the molecule to have a chiral center, there needs to be a carbon with four different groups. Are there any such carbons here? The carbons attached to the oxygen in the ester groups are probably not chiral because they're connected to two methyl groups (since it's dimethyl). Or wait, no, in the ester group, the structure is O-CO-OCH3, but wait no. The correct ester structure is O-CO-O..., but in this case, it's a dimethyl ester, so each ester group is O-CO-OCH3. So the carbonyl group is at position 2 and 2' on each ring. So the carbons where the ester groups are attached might not be chiral because each is connected to a benzene ring, two oxygen atoms (as ester groups
