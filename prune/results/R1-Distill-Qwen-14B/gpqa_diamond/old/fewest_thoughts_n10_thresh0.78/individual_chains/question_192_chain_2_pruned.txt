Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about a spherical conductor with a cavity inside. So, the setup is an uncharged conductor at first, but then a small positive charge is placed inside the cavity. I need to find the electric field at a point outside the conductor.

Alright, let me visualize this. There's a big sphere, radius R, and inside it, somewhere off-center, there's a smaller spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the main sphere's center. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R, so the cavity is entirely within the conductor.

Now, a charge +q is placed inside this cavity. So, when a conductor is uncharged, any internal charges can induce charges on the surfaces, but I'm a bit fuzzy on exactly how that works here. Wait, right, in electrostatics, the charges inside a conductor will redistribute to cancel any internal electric fields. But wait, the conductor itself is initially uncharged. So when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, what happens?

Oh, right! The conductor being neutral, the charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But wait, wait. Because the conductor is initially neutral, the total induced charge must be zero. So, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) will have an induced charge of -q, because that's opposite to the charge inside. And the outer surface of the conductor must then have a charge of +q to balance it out. Because the conductor was neutral, the inner surface gets -q, and the outer surface gets +q.

So, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. Now, the question is about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Since the conductor's outer surface has a charge, the field outside should behave as if all the charge is concentrated at the center, right? Because for a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface can be treated as a point charge when outside.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor, so according to Gauss's Law, the electric field at a point outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total enclosed charge. So in this case,
