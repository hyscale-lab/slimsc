Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets using the TTV method, but I think the key here is about orbital periods and how that affects temperature.

So the system has five exoplanets with circular orbits, and they're in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so that part should be straightforward because albedo affects temperature, but since it's the same, maybe it cancels out in the ratio.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... Right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_earth * (L / L_sun)^(1/4) * (a / 1 AU)^(−1/2). But wait, since all planets orbit the same star, I think their luminosity L is the same as L_sun in this context. So the (L/L_sun) term would be 1, right? So the temperature depends only on the distance from the star, which is represented by 'a' in the formula.

But wait, we don't have 'a' given. We have periods. So I need to relate the period to the distance. Oh, Kepler's third law! That says that the square of the period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), so P² ∝ a³. So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So if I can find the ratio of a_4 to a_2, then I can find their equilibrium temperatures.

Let me note down the given ratios. The periods are given in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has P1=1, P2=2, P3=2.5, P4=3.5, and P5=5, all in the same units (like Earth years or whatever, but units should cancel out when taking ratios).

So, the ratio of periods P4:P2 is 3.5:2. Since a is proportional to P^(2/3), the ratio a4/a2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.
