Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So LTE means that in each region of the star's photosphere, the gas behaves like a perfect blackbody at a certain temperature.

Wait, right, when we talk about the excitation of atoms in LTE, this relates to the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation tells us how the population of energy levels changes with temperature. The equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n is the number density, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy levels are given, and the ratio of the excitation is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2. Wait, no, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are "twice as excited in a specific energy level" as those in star_2. So, the excitation in star_1 is higher. So, the ratio n_1/n_2 = 2, maybe? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So for a particular energy level, the number of atoms in that level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let's say the energy levels are E_i and E_j. But wait, the energy difference between the levels is given, so let's say E is the difference E_i - E_j. But wait, the problem says the energy difference for the considered levels is 1.38e-23 J. So we can plug that into the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, but if we're comparing two stars, each with their own temperature, T1 and T2, then let's consider the ratio of the populations in the excited state to the ground state (or perhaps another state) for each star.

Wait, perhaps in each star, the population of the excited state is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). So for star_1, the population ratio is (n1) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, (n2) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1/n2 = 2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's phrased as "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, I think that means the number density of atoms in that specific energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

But wait, no, I think it's the excitation, so the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for each star. Wait, perhaps the excitation is the ratio of the upper state to the lower state. So for each star, the excitation is (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2. So (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2). 

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation per atom is considered. Hmm, not entirely sure, but I think the ratio is in terms of the population of the higher state relative to the lower state. So for star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2.

But wait, the question says the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So, let's model this. Let me write the Boltzmann equation for each star.

For star_1:
n_upper1 / n_lower1 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1))

For star_2:
n_upper2 / n_lower2 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

But the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2). Because in star_1, the excitation is twice as much. So substituting,

(g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * (g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

We can cancel (g_upper/g_lower) from both sides, assuming they are the same for both stars (same element, same energy levels), which they are.

So exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Take natural log on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Let me rearrange this:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

So,

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but the problem involves only the temperatures T1 and T2. Let me see the options.

The options are in terms of ln(2) equals some expression involving T1 and T2.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, our equation is:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ]

So unless [ΔE/(k)] is 1, which I don't think it is.

Wait, let me compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant, about 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wait, wow, that's convenient. So ΔE/(k) =1 K.

So then the equation simplifies to:

ln(2) = 1 * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which is:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches.

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves comparing the excitation levels of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, star_1 and star_2, under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the population of energy levels to temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratio is given as 2:1, meaning the number of atoms in a specific excited energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. The energy difference between the levels is provided as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).

Using the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

the excitation ratio for each star is:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Since the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, we have:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions and canceling \( \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \) (assuming it is the same for both stars):

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
