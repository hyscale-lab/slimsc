Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran qPCR on serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect, so each cycle doubles the target. The R² is 1, so the data fits perfectly on the curve. The slope is -3.3. Wait, I remember that the slope in a qPCR curve is related to the efficiency. The formula for the slope is ln(10)/log10(efficiency). But wait, when efficiency is 100%, the efficiency is 1, so ln(10)/(ln(1)) is undefined because ln(1)=0. That can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Oh right, the slope in a linear regression model for qPCR data (which is usually a log vs. CT plot) is related to the efficiency. If the efficiency is 100%, then each cycle doubles the target. So the calculation would be slope = - (1 / efficiency) * log10(efficiency). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula for the slope is (log10(efficiency) / (1 - efficiency)). Wait no, actually the standard formula is slope = -3.322 / efficiency, but when efficiency is 1, it's -3.322. Oh wait, the given slope is -3.3, which is close to that. So that makes sense because with 100% efficiency, the slope is about -3.322. So the slope here is correct.

Now looking at the data. Each concentration is diluted ten-fold from the previous. So 100000, 10000, 1000, 100, 10 copies per microliter. The CT values for each are 33.9-34.5, then around 30.6-31.2, then 27.3-27.9, 24-24.6, and 20.7-21.3. 

Wait, I'm trying to see how the CT relates to the concentration. Each ten-fold dilution should result in a decrease in CT by about 3.3 cycles, because each cycle is a doubling. So if you have 10x less, you'd need 3.3 more cycles to reach the same fluorescence. Wait, but in qPCR, lower starting quantity means higher CT (since it takes longer to reach the threshold). So if you dilute by 10x, you expect CT to increase by about 3.3. 

Wait, let me think: For each ten-fold dilution, the log10 is -1. So for a perfectly efficient qPCR (100% efficiency), the change in CT should be approximately 3.3219 (since 10 cycles ≈ 1000x amplification, so each 10x dilution would require about 3.3 cycles more). 

Looking at the data: Let's calculate the difference between each dilution. From 100000 to 10000 (10x less), the CT goes from about 34 to 31. So 34 - 31 = 3. That's a change of 3 cycles. Then from 10000 to 1000, 31 to 27.3. That's about 3.7 cycles. From 1000 to 100: 27.9 to 24.6. That's about 3.3 cycles. From 100 to 10: 24.6 to 20.7. That's 3.9 cycles. 

Wait, but each step was a 10x dilution, so each should ideally change by about 3.3 cycles. The first change is 3, then 3.7, then 3.3, then 3.9. So some are a bit off. But the slope is -3.3, which suggests that on average, each 10-fold dilution corresponds to a 3.3 cycle change. 

But looking at the data, the CTs for each concentration have triplicates. For example, at 100000 copies, the CTs are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average is about 34.2. At 10000
