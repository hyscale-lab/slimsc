Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of a di-substituted aromatic compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.

First, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means it's something like benzene with two substituents attached, maybe in the para or ortho positions. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have specific absorption bands; I remember that the carbonyl (C=O) in esters typically appears around 1740 cm^-1. So, the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let's break them down.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H: So the aromatic ring has two sets of protons, each with a different environment. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents are probably in positions that create two distinct aromatic proton environments. For example, if the substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would be equivalent, but wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. If it's para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, so the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons. Wait, actually, in para substitution, the ring would have two equivalent sets, but maybe only one set of protons if the substituents are identical and symmetrical. Hmm, but this compound has two substituents which may not necessarily be the same. Oh, wait, wait. Wait, the question says di-substituted, but doesn't specify if the substituents are the same. Hmm. Well, but NMR shows two aromatic signals, so two different sets. So substituents must be in a way that splits the ring into two distinct proton environments. For example, in ortho positions with two different substituents. Or maybe one substituent is in the para position and another in the adjacent position? Or perhaps one substituent is in one position and the other is in another position, making the ring have two different proton environments.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to a double bond, like in an ester group maybe? Or in an alkene. Wait, the
