Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/ N. Oh wait, and N is the normalization constant. The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to find the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy del_b, which is the difference between the entropy of rho (non-Gaussian state) and tau (Gaussian reference state).

Wait, I remember that Gaussian states are like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. Non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian Wigner functions, like Fock states or Schrödinger cat states.

The relative entropy of entanglement or something similar? Or maybe it's the relative entropy between the state and a Gaussian state. Right, the formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Wait, wait, actually, relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But here the formula is different: it's trace(rho ln rho) minus trace(tau ln tau). So that's not the standard relative entropy. That might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different measure where it's the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and the entropy of tau. Because the von Neumann entropy S(rho) is trace(rho ln rho). So if tau is a Gaussian state, and rho is the non-Gaussian one, then del_b would be S(rho) - S(tau).

Wait, but why would you subtract the other way around? Oh, maybe it's because del_b is defined as rho's entropy minus tau's entropy. I should note that.

But for a Gaussian state tau, the von Neumann entropy can be calculated using the purity or the eigenvalues of its density matrix. Wait, Gaussian states are either thermal or have some specific properties. But I'm not sure about the exact entropy here.

But wait, let me think about the state in question. The state is a superposition of two coherent states, |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are Gaussian states. So the state |psi>
