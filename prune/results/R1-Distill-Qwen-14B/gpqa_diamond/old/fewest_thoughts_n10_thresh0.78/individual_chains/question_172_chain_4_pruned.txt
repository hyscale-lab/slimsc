Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the temperature. Oh right, Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) means that each layer of the photosphere is in equilibrium with its own radiation field. So the excitation levels depend on the temperature there.

The problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation is higher in star_1. I think the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's call this ΔE. The problem states that for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Wait, wait, but I should think about the ratio n_1/(n_0) or something, where n_1 is the excited state and n_0 is the ground state.

Wait, the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So if I denote the excitation level in star_1 as 2x, then star_2 is x. So maybe the ratio for star_1 is 2, star_2 is 1. Or perhaps the ratio of the populations is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2 for that energy level.

But wait, I need to find the relation between the temperatures T1 and T2. The Boltzmann factor must be playing a role here. Since the excitation is higher in star_1, that suggests higher temperature because higher temperatures increase the excitation (more energy available to populate higher states).

Wait, but let me think. The population ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ). So if star_1 has a higher population in the excited state, that would imply that exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) is larger than for star_2. But wait, no, because a higher temperature would make the exponent less negative, so exp(-x) would be larger when x is smaller. Wait, let me clarify.

Suppose ΔE is positive. For star_1, the ratio is n1_1 / n1_0 = (g1/g0) exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ). Similarly for star_2, n2_1 / n2_0 = (g2/g0) exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ). But the problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. So n1_1 / n1_0 = 2 * (n2_1 / n2_0).

But wait, unless the ground state (n_0) is the same for both? Hmm, maybe the problem is assuming g factors are the same for both stars, or perhaps we can neglect them for this problem. The question says "twice as excited", which I think refers to the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. So if star_1 has twice the ratio (n1_1/n1_0) compared to star_2, then:

n1_1/n1_0 = 2 * (n2_1/n2_0)

So plug in the Boltzmann factors:

(g1/g0) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = 2 * (g2/g0) exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Assuming that the statistical weights are the same for both stars, because it's the same element (iron) in the same energy levels, so g1 and g2 are the same. So g1/g0 = g2/g0 = same. So I can cancel those out.

So exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me write
