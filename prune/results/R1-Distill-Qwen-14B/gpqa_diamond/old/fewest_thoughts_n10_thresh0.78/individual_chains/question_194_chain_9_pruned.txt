Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. Hmm, I remember the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). 

Wait, each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. But calculating each one individually might be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the energy expression. E is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So the total sum inside the brackets can vary. Let me denote the sum as S = S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3. Then E = -J * S.

So for each state, I need to calculate S and then compute exp(β J S) because E = -J S, so exp(-β E) = exp( β J S ). Or wait, no: exp(-β E) would be exp( β J S ), because E = -J S → -β E = β J S. So each state contributes a term of exp( β J S ) to Z.

Now, how many states have a particular value of S? Let me find all possible S values and their multiplicities.

Wait, S is the sum of three terms, each of which is ±1. So each term can be +1 or -1. So the maximum possible S is 3 (if all three terms are +1), and the minimum is -3 (if all are -1). But wait, let me think. Let me list all possible cases.

Wait, each S is the sum of three pair products. Let me consider all possible spin configurations.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute S for each possible state of the three spins and count how often each S occurs.

Each of the three spins can be +1 or -1. Let's list all 8 possible states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
   S = (1)(1) +
