Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and the conditions under which it's valid. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation describes the current-voltage behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current regime. I think that when the space-charge effects are significant, the equation comes into play.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V² / L³). Let me try to recall what each variable represents. ε is the dielectric constant, μ is the carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Oh right, this equation is for the dark current, meaning under conditions where there's no light-induced generation, so recombination is the main thing happening.

Wait, the question is about the validity conditions. I think the equation assumes that the current is limited by the space-charge effects, which implies that the electric field is strong enough that the space charge itself modifies the electric field. So, for this equation to hold, certain conditions must be met.

Looking at the options, they all talk about whether the device is single-carrier, trap-free, Ohmic contact, etc. So I need to remember the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney model.

I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption that the device is a single-carrier one. So options D, which mentions two-carrier, might not be correct because Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier devices, like diodes where either electrons or holes are the majority carriers.

Ohmic contacts mean that the contact doesn't create a barrier for the carriers. So in an Ohmic contact, the carriers can move without much resistance. Alternatively, a Schottky contact would have a barrier, but I'm not sure if that affects the Mott-Gurney equation's validity.

Wait, the equation assumes that the current is space-charge limited, which happens when the injection is incomplete. Ohmic contacts might imply complete injection, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe the equation works regardless of the contact type as long as certain other conditions are met.

Also, the equation assumes that the carriers are not trapped (since it's trap-free). So any option that says trap-free is a possibility.

Looking at the options:

Option A) Trap-free single-carrier with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Mott-Gurney equation is in the SCLC (space-charge limited current) regime. So in that case, the current is due to the space charge, and the dominant term is the electric field created by the charge build-up. So, would the conditions involve drift or diffusion?

Wait, in the derivation, the Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption that the current is due to the space charge, and that the electric field is such that the space-charge creates the field that causes the current. So in that case, the current is dominated by the space-charge effects, and drift current would be significant, not negligible. Hmm, but let me think.

Wait, what's the difference between drift and diffusion currents? Drift current is due to the electric field, while diffusion is due to concentration gradients. In the space-charge limited case, the space charge creates a varying electric field, which leads to drift current. So the Mott-Gurney equation accounts for the drift current, so the condition is that the drift current is dominant, not that it's negligible. So any option that says "negligible drift current" would not be correct. Or wait, the other way around.

Wait, no. Wait, in the SCLC regime, the current is limited by the space charge, which implies that the space charge's effect on the electric field is significant. So, the electric field from the space charge causes the drift current. So the drift current isn't negligible; in fact, it's the main component. So options that say 'negligible drift current' would be incorrect. So the Mott-Gurney equation is valid when drift current is the dominant factor, not negligible.

Wait, looking back, the question is about the validity conditions. So the options are about which conditions allow the equation to be valid.

Option B says 'no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.' Hmm. No injection barrier would imply that carriers are injected fully, perhaps. But wait, the Mott-Gurney equation is for the case where the injection is incomplete, right? Because if the injection is complete, then the current would be determined by something else, like the Ohmic limit.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down. The Mott-Gurney equation describes the current in the SCLC regime, which is when the space charge is so large that it limits the current. This happens when the applied voltage is such that the injected carriers are insufficient to form a screening layer, so the electric field remains strong. So in this case, the movement of carriers is dominated by the electric field (drift) rather than concentration gradients (diffusion).

So, the conditions for Mott-Gurney are: single-carrier device, trap-free (so no recombination or scattering issues), and the current is limited by the space charge, which suggests that the electric field is strong enough that drift is the main current component. Also, the contacts are Ohmic, I think. Or perhaps it doesn't matter as long as the injection isn't the limiting factor. Wait, wait.

Ohmic contacts imply that the carriers can move without much barrier, so current can flow more easily. But for the SCLC regime, the current is limited by space charge, not by the contact barriers. So perhaps the contacts being Ohmic or not might not directly affect the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation, as long as the space-charge is the limiting factor.

Wait, but let me think about the injection. The Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the carriers are being injected but with incomplete injection. So for that, the contacts must allow some injection but not be so good that the current is determined by the contact's resistance.

Ah, I think that for the Mott-Gurney equation to apply, the injection should be Ohmic but incomplete, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the equation doesn't require Ohmic contacts, but rather that the space charge is the dominant effect.

Alternatively, some sources I've studied before say that the Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free, single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and in the SCLC regime. So the validity requires an Ohmic contact.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option.

Option A: single-carrier, trap-free, Ohmic contact, negligible drift current.

No, that can't be right because the SCLC is about drift current dominating.

Option B: single-carrier, trap-free, no carrier injection barrier (so maybe Ohmic?), and negligible diffusion current. So the current is dominated by drift, not diffusion. Because if diffusion current is negligible, the equation would hold. But wait, Mott-Gurney equation includes the effect of the space charge, which leads to drift current. So if diffusion is negligible, it's right.

Option C: single-carrier, Schottky contact, negligible diffusion. Schottky contact implies a barrier, but if the contact is Schottky, maybe that affects the injection. But Mott-Gurney assumes that the current is limited by space charge, so perhaps the contact's type (Ohmic or Schottky) doesn't matter as long as the injection is not the limiting factor. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the contact is Schottky, it might introduce a barrier that affects the current, but in the equation, the contact type is probably assumed to be Ohmic.

Option D: two-carrier, Ohmic contact. Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier, so D is wrong.

So now, options A, B, C are possibilities.

But wait, the equation is for a single-carrier. So D is out.

Option A: negligible drift current. But if the SCLC is when drift is dominant, then A is incorrect because it says drift is negligible.

Option B: negligible diffusion. So if diffusion is negligible, then the current is drift dominated, which aligns with SCLC. Also, no injection barrier would mean Ohmic-like injection, perhaps.

Option C: Schottky contact. I think Mott-Gurney assumes Ohmic contacts because in Schottky barriers, the injection is limited by the barrier height, but in SCLC, the current is limited by space charge, not by the barrier. Or maybe the contact type doesn't affect the validity as long as the space charge is the dominant effect.

Wait, the Mott-Gurney equation derivation assumes that the space charge is the main factor, which would require that the electric field is determined by the space charge. So for that, perhaps the contact's barrier is not an issue as long as the current isn't limited by the contact. So if the contacts are Ohmic, the current isn't limited by them, so the space charge can build up, allowing the Mott-Gurney equation to hold.

So, which option matches that?

Option B says: trap-free single-carrier, no injection barrier (so perhaps Ohmic), negligible diffusion. So if diffusion is negligible, then the current is due to drift, which is correct for SCLC.

Option A: Ohmic contact, negligible drift (no, drift is dominant).

Option C: Schottky contact. But in Schottky contact, there's a barrier, so maybe the current is limited by the barrier at lower voltages, but once the voltage is high enough, space-charge dominates. So if the condition is that space-charge is the dominant effect, then the contact type might not affect the validity of the equation. So perhaps the equation holds regardless of contact type as long as the space-charge is the limiting factor.

So perhaps the correct conditions are: single-carrier, trap-free, and in the SCLC regime. The equation doesn't depend on the contact type as long as the space-charge is dominant.

Wait, but the options are about the statements that are true regarding the validity.

Looking back, the equation is given as J = ... So which conditions are required for that equation to be valid.

In the derivation, the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the current is limited by the space charge, which implies that the carriers are being accelerated by the electric field (drift current is dominant). It also assumes that the device is single-carrier, trap-free, and that the electric field is approximately uniform (which comes from the assumption of a planar device with uniform doping). Additionally, it's assumed that the space charge is such that the current is in the SCLC regime.

Now, the options are about the validity conditions. Let's look at the options again.

Option B: trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion.

So, no injection barrier (so perhaps Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion current. So if diffusion is negligible, then the current is due to drift, which is correct for SCLC.

But wait, wait. The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption that the space charge is building up, leading to a strong electric field, which causes drift current. So, if the diffusion current is negligible, then the drift current is dominant, which fits the SCLC scenario.

So option B seems to fit because it says negligible diffusion current, which would imply that drift is the main current. Also, trap-free and single-carrier, which are necessary.

Option A says negligible drift current, which would be the opposite of what's needed. So A is wrong.

Option C mentions Schottky contact. I'm not sure if Schottky contacts affect the validity, but the equation should be applicable regardless because it's about space-charge. But the option says negligible diffusion, which is correct, but the contact is Schottky. Not sure if that's a problem.

But the question is, which of the options is correct.

Another point: The Mott-Gurney equation is valid when the current is space-charge limited, which implies that the injection is such that the space charge builds up enough to limit the current. Ohmic contacts allow for easier injection, so for the equation to hold, the injection must be possible but not so high that other factors (like Ohmic limits) dominate.

So, if the contacts are Ohmic, you can achieve the space-charge limit. If they are Schottky, perhaps the injection is more limited, but once the voltage is high enough to overcome the barrier, then the equation would apply.

But according to the options, the correct one is which?

Looking at the options, option B says 'no carrier injection barrier'. No carrier injection barrier would imply that the contact is Ohmic, perhaps. So if the contact is Ohmic, then the injection is not a barrier.

So option B is trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (so Ohmic), and negligible diffusion. That would fit.

But wait, the Mott-Gurney equation includes the mobility and the electric field, which relates to drift current. So the equation holds when drift current is dominant, which requires negligible diffusion current. So option B's condition is correct.

So option B seems correct.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current-voltage behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation is valid under specific conditions, which are analyzed as follows:

1. **Single-Carrier Device**: The Mott-Gurney equation is derived for single-carrier devices, where either electrons or holes dominate the current. This eliminates any option involving a two-carrier device, such as Option D.

2. **Trap-Free Device**: The equation assumes that the device is trap-free, meaning there are no additional scattering or recombination effects that would complicate the current-voltage relationship. This rules out any option that does not explicitly state "trap-free."

3. **Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC) Regime**: In this regime, the current is limited by the space charge, which creates a strong electric field that dominates the carrier motion. This implies that drift current is the primary contributor to the total current, and diffusion current is negligible. Therefore, any option stating "negligible diffusion current" aligns with the conditions for the equation's validity.

4. **Contact Type**: The equation assumes an Ohmic contact, as this ensures that the current is not limited by the contact itself but rather by the space-charge effects. A Schottky contact introduces a barrier, which could complicate the current flow, but the equation remains valid as long as the space-charge effects dominate. However, the explicit mention of "no carrier injection barrier" in Option B aligns with the assumption of an Ohmic contact.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States "negligible drift current," which contradicts the SCLC regime where drift current is dominant. This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: States "trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current." This aligns with the conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation, as it assumes an Ohmic contact (no injection barrier) and negligible diffusion current, allowing drift current to dominate. This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Mentions a Schottky contact, which introduces a barrier. While the equation can still apply if space-charge effects dominate, the explicit mention of a Schottky contact makes this option less consistent with the standard assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation.
- **Option D**: Refers to a two-carrier device, which is not valid for the Mott-Gurney equation. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current, as described in Option B.
