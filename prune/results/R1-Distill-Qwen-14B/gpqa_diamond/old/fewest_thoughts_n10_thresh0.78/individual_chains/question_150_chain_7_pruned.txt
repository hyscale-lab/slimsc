Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula, NMR data, and a series of reactions. The options are four different aldehydes with various substituents. Hmm, I've got to think through this methodically.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated by (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, and I assume X=0 because there's no halogen indicated. So, (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=(10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Since each ring or double bond is one DoU, and each triple bond is two, etc.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and don't have adjacent protons, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde attached to something else, like a conjugated system.

Next, 6.98 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That's in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Maybe para-substituted aromatic protons? Wait, para would be a doublet of two protons? Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system.

6.51 ppm is another doublet of 2H. Hmm. So two sets of doublets, each 2H. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. Let me think: in para substitution, each set of two protons would be a doublet if there's coupling between adjacent (ortho) protons. Wait, no, para substitution would mean each aromatic proton has two neighbors (ortho), but perhaps the coupling pattern depends on the substitution.

Wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 are each doublets with 2H. Maybe they are part of two different aromatic rings. Like two para-substituted phenyl groups connected to something else. Let me think about the structure.

Then, 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Broad suggests either exchange (like an acidic proton) or coupling in a complex environment. 2H as a singlet, maybe they are adjacent protons, like in a conjugated diene? Or perhaps an enol structure? Or maybe they are part of a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like in a carbonyl.

3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. This is a lower field region, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Like CH2 next to an oxygen, perhaps an ether or ester. Or maybe part of a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Putting this together: an aldehyde proton (9.72), two sets of aromatic protons (probably two benzene rings, each para-substituted?), then another two protons in a doublet, and two more as a doublet in the 3.66 ppm.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons.

If it's two benzene rings, each is 6 carbons, but that would be 12, which is too much. So perhaps it's a single benzene ring with substituents. Alternatively, maybe two aromatic rings attached to a central structure.

Wait, C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe the molecule has a benzene ring with some substituents, perhaps a side chain. Since the NMR shows two aromatic regions, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene? Or two separate benzene rings attached to a side chain.

Wait, the initial structure probably has an aldehyde group (based on the 9.72 ppm peak). So
