Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay of a Pi(+) meson. The reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a muon(+) and a neutrino. The given rest masses are Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of kinetic energies.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the Pi is initially at rest, its momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta because the total momentum must still be zero.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. Oh wait, in this case, the neutrino is a neutrino, so it's considered massless for these kinds of calculations? Or do I need to account for its mass? Hmm, I think in beta decay processes, the neutrino is considered to have negligible mass, so maybe we can treat it as massless here.

So, the Pi meson is at rest, so its energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The decay products are the muon and the neutrino. So, the muon will have some kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, and the neutrino will have just kinetic energy because its rest mass is negligible.

Wait, but the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so the remaining energy would go into their kinetic energies. So, the total energy after decay should be equal to the initial energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu. E_mu is gamma * m_mu * c², and E_nu is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible). But wait, since neutrinos are leptons, and their masses are not zero, but for this problem, perhaps we can treat them as massless to simplify.

Wait, another approach: in the rest frame of the Pi, the decay products must have equal and opposite momenta. So, the magnitude of the momenta of mu and nu are the same.

The energy of the muon would be E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c²? Or wait, units are in MeV, so perhaps I can use natural units where c=1. So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu² ), and similarly for the neutrino, but since the neutrino's mass is negligible, E_nu ≈ p.

But since the Pi is at rest, the total energy must be conserved. So, E_pi = E_mu + E_nu. So, 139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu.

Also, the total momentum must be zero, so p_mu = p_nu in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, p_mu = p_nu = p. So, E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²), and E_nu = p (since m_nu is zero or negligible).

So putting it into the energy equation: 139.6 = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p.

Hmm, I need to solve for p. Let's denote p as x for simplicity.

So, 139.6 = sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x.

Let me rearrange this equation: sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides: x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So, left: x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides: (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Compute (139.6)^2 and (105.7)^2.

Wait, 139.6 squared is approximately (140)^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less, so (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Wait, but 139.6 squared is (139.6)^2. Let me compute it accurately:

139.6 * 139.6:

= (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2
= 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, 105.7 squared is (105.7)^2. Let's compute that:

105.7 * 105.7 = ?

Well, 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and cross terms: 2*(100)*(5.7) = 1140. Sum: 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So, the left side is 11172.49, and the right side is (19488.16) - (2*139.6)*x.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Rearranging, 279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 minus 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So, 279.2 x = 8315.67 → x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 29 = ?

279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is 8376 → 279.2 * 29 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

But 8315.67 is higher than 8096.8, so let's see: 279.2 * 29.8 → 29.8 * 279.2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just calculate 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Approximately, 279.2 * 29.8 is around 8315.67.

Wait 279.2 multiplied by 29.8:

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.8.

279.2 * 30 is 8376.

But 29.8 is 30 - 0.2, so 279.2 * (30 - 0.2) = 8376 - (279.2 * 0.2) = 8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16.

Wait, but our numerator is 8315.67, which is a bit less than 8320.16.

So, perhaps 279.2 * x = 8315.67 → x ≈ 29.8 - (8320.16 - 8315.67)/(279.2 * 0.1).

The difference is 8320.16 -8315.67 = 4.49.

So, 4.49 / (279.2 * 0.1 )= 4.49 / 27.92 ≈ 0.16.

So, x is approximately 29.8 - 0.16 → 29.64.

Wait, but wait, that would make x ≈29.64.

So p ≈29.64 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me get a more accurate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach would help.

Wait, 279.2 ≈ 280.

8315.67 / 280 is approximately 29.7.

So, x ≈29.7 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me compute 279.2 * 29.7:

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

279.2 * 0.7 = 195.44.

Adding them gives 8096.8 +195.44= 8292.24.

But we have 8315.67, which is higher by 23.43.

So, 23.43 /279.2 ≈0.084.

So, x is 29.7 +0.084 ≈29.784.

So approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Maybe I should proceed with the exact calculation.

So, x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈29.78 MeV/c.

So, p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Now, E_nu = p = ~29.78 MeV.

The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Let me compute 29.78 squared: approx 29.78^2 = (30 -0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 +0.22² = 900 -13.2 + 0.0484 ≈886.8484.

105.7 squared is 11172.49 as before.

So, E_mu = sqrt(886.8484 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.3384) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So, E_mu ≈109.81 MeV.

But E_mu includes its rest mass (105.7 MeV). So, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

And the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV, which is its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.

Wait, but looking back, the options are for two particles. So the kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.78 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options, let's check option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That matches closely.

Wait, another thought: did I account for the neutrino's mass correctly? If the neutrino has a non-negligible mass, then its energy would be sqrt(p^2 + m_nu^2 ), but since in the problem the neutrino is just called nu, perhaps we can treat it as massless. If it's treated as massless, then E_nu would be p, which we have as ~29.78 MeV.

So, the KE of the muon is about 4.11 MeV, and the KE of the neutrino is ~29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's the correct choice.

Wait, let's make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recalculate the p.

Calculating 8315.67 / 279.2:

Well, 279.2 × 30 = 8376, which is larger than 8315.67. So 29.7?

Wait, 279.2 × 29.7 = ?

Let me compute 279.2 *29 = 8096.8, 279.2 *0.7= 195.44. So total 8096.8 +195.44=8292.24. 

Wait, but 8315.67 -8292.24=23.43.

So, 23.43 /279.2 ≈0.0838.

So, 29.7 +0.0838=29.7838 → approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

So, E_nu=29.78 MeV → KE is the same, since m_nu is zero.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(886.8 + 11172.49)=sqrt(12059.29)= about 109.81 MeV.

So, KE_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

So, approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

So, the answer should be D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the decay products in the reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \text{ (at rest)} \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest mass of the \(\pi^+\) is \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\), and the rest mass of the \(\mu^+\) is \(105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino is treated as massless for this calculation.

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy conservation**:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
   \]
   where \(E_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\), \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\), and \(E_{\nu} = p\).

2. **Momentum conservation**:  
   Since the \(\pi^+\) is initially at rest, the momenta of the \(\mu^+\) and \(\nu\) are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p
   \]

### Solving for \(p\):
From energy conservation:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} + p
\]
Let \(x = p\). Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)x + x^2
\]
Simplify:
\[
(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)x
\]
Substitute \((105.7)^2 = 11172.49\) and \((139.6)^2 = 19488.16\):
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x
\]
Rearranging:
\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49
\]
\[
279.2x = 8315.67
\]
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c}
\]

Thus, \(p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c}\).

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Neutrino energy**:  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum:
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
   This is also its kinetic energy.

2. **Muon energy**:  
   The muon's total energy is:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}
   \]
   Substituting \(p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c}\) and \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}
   \]
   Compute:
   \[
   (29.78)^2 \approx 886.8, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49
   \]
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.29} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
   The muon's kinetic energy is:
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energy of the \(\mu^+\) is approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\), and the kinetic energy of the \(\nu\) is approximately \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\). Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**Option D: \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\)**.
