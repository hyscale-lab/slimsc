Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, let me break this down.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star when observed from different points in the Earth's orbit. The formula for distance in parsecs is 1 over parallax, right? So distance d = 1 / plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallax values since they appear to move more.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what way? Oh, wait, probably in space, meaning that the number density of stars is constant in all directions. So, the number of stars per cubic parsec is the same everywhere.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, let's think about how many stars you'd observe within a certain range of parallax.

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, as plx increases (which means the star is closer), the number of stars at that plx would depend on the volume of space at that distance.

Wait, no. Wait, the number of stars in a shell at a particular distance. So, for a given distance d, the volume of a thin shell would be the surface area of a sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness dd. So, the volume element is 4πd² dd.

If the stars are uniformly distributed, the number in that volume is n * 4πd² dd
