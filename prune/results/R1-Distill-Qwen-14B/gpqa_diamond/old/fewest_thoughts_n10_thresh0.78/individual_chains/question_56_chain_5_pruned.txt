Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a 3,0,0 state decaying to a 1,0,0 state via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out the transition route and the corresponding probability. 

Wait, dipole transitions... Right, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. The selection rules for dipole transitions are that the change in the angular momentum quantum number l must be ±1. Oh right, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1, but the overall change is determined by the transition. 

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. The question says it's via two dipole transitions. So the electron goes from 3s to something, then to 1s. 

Wait, wait. Let me think about possible transitions. The first transition is from n=3, l=0 to some state, then again to n=1, l=0. So each dipole transition must follow Δl = ±1. 

Starting at l=0, so the possible next l is 1. Because Δl can be +1 or -1, but from 0, it can't go to -1. So first transition must go to l=1. So from |3,0,0⟩, the next state must have l=1. So the first step is to |3,1,m⟩, right? Then from there, the next transition would have to change l again by ±1. Since the final state is l=0, the second transition must have Δl = -1. So from l=1 to l=0.

So the possible intermediate states are n=2 or n=3? Wait, no. Because each transition is between different energy levels. So the first transition must change n. Let's see: the initial state is n=3, l=0. So when it transitions, n must change by at most ±1. Because for dipole transitions, the change in n is Δn = 0, ±1, but in reality, the most common transitions are Δn = ±1. So from n=3, the first transition could go to n=2, since n can't go below 1. So the first step would be from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩.

Then, the next transition would go from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. Because from l=1, you can go to l=0 (Δl = -1), and n=2 to n=1 (Δn = -1). 

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,m⟩. What are the possible m values? For l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. 

Now, the question is about the probability of this transition path. The options give various probabilities, like 1/3, 1/4, or 2/3. 

Hmm, wait, how do I calculate the probability here? I think it's about the transition dipole moment and the selection rules. The transition probability is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, which includes the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the spherical harmonics integrals.

The probability amplitude for a two-step process is the product of the probabilities of each step. Or wait, no, more accurately, each transition has a certain probability, and the overall probability is the product if the steps are independent, but maybe some factors come into play.

Wait, no, perhaps each dipole transition is allowed, and the path is via an intermediate state. So the question is about the possible intermediate states and the correct branching paths.

Wait,
