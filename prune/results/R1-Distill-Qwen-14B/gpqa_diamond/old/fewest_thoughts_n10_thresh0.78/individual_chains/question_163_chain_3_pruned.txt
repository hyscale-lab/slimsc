Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think it through. The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. Hmm, right, when you add an acid to a hydroxide, they should react. 

The problem states that we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3, and the total volume is 100 cm³. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve it. Also, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given from A to D.

First, I think I should calculate how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with in moles. The formula for molar mass would help here. Fe has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol, and each OH group is 17.01 g/mol. Since there are three OH groups, that's 51.03 g/mol for the hydroxides. So the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol.

So the moles of Fe(OH)3 are mass divided by molar mass. That's 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol. Let me write that as approximately 9.356e-4 moles.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think. When it reacts with a strong acid, like HCl or H2SO4, it will neutralize the hydroxide ions. The reaction equation would be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

Wait, the acid is monobasic and strong. So each molecule contributes one H+ ion. So the reaction would require 3 H+ per Fe(OH)3 molecule. So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

That's 3 * 9.356e-4 = 0.0028068 mol of H+.

The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume needed can be found using the formula Molarity = moles / volume (in liters). So volume = moles / Molarity.

Converting moles to liters, so 0.0028068 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028068 L, which is 28.068 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. That's pretty close. But wait, I should check if I've done the calculations correctly.

Wait, let me make sure about the reaction. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, and when it reacts with a strong acid, each OH- will take a H+. So for each Fe(OH)3, 3 H+
