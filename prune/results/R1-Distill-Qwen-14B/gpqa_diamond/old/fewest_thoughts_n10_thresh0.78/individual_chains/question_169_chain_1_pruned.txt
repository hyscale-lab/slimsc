Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's see what it says. The problem is about a decay process where two nucleons of flavor A convert into two of flavor B, and emit two particles E and V each. So the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. Then there's a variant where instead of two V particles, one exotic, massless particle M is emitted. So the new reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

The question is about how the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles changes in the variant compared to the original decay. The options are about whether the spectrum becomes discrete or remains continuous, and whether the endpoint increases or decreases.

Wait, I remember that in particle decays, the energy spectrum of emitted particles can be continuous or discrete based on conservation laws. Oh right, like in beta decay. In beta minus decay, the emitted electron has a continuous spectrum because the process involves the weak interaction and the conservation of energy and momentum. But wait, when there are multiple particles emitted, like in the first case with two E and two V, each E and V carry away some energy.

In the original decay, two E and two V are emitted. So the system's total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since E and V are lighter, I guess they are the decay products. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics.

Wait, the original decay's E particles have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. So the maximum energy an E can have is Q. That suggests that the endpoint is determined by the available energy in the decay. So when the decay emits more particles, maybe the energy distribution changes.

Now, in the variant, two E are emitted but instead of two V, it's one M which is massless. So the decay products are 2E and M. Since M is massless, maybe it doesn't contribute to the mass of the system as much. Or does it affect the energy distribution?

Let me think about energy and momentum. The total energy available is fixed by the mass difference between the initial and final states. The initial is two A's, the final is two B's, two E's, and M. Since M is massless, its rest mass is zero, so its energy is equal to its momentum times c, but
