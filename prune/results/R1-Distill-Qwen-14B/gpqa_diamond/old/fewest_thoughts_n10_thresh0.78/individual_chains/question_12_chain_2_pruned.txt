Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about pion decay. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion at rest decays into a muon and a neutrino. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c² and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². I remember that neutrinos are very light, but I think for this problem, we can consider them to have negligible mass compared to the other particles. So the neutrino's rest mass is approximately zero.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem says to find the kinetic energy of the product particles. So the products are the muon and the neutrino. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the total momentum must also be zero because momentum is conserved. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So their magnitudes are the same, but their directions are opposite. So if the muon is moving in one direction, the neutrino is moving in the opposite direction with the same momentum magnitude.

But wait, considering the masses: the muon is much more massive than the neutrino. So the muon will have much lower kinetic energy compared to the neutrino. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, maybe it's moving at a speed very close to the speed of light. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that affects the calculation yet.

Let me recall conservation laws here. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is just its rest energy, which is m_π c². So the total energy after decay should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Since the pion is at rest, its energy is m_π c². So:

m_π c² = E_mu + E_nu

And since momentum is conserved, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

But E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which includes its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Similarly, E_nu is the energy of the neutrino, which is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero.

So E_mu = sqrt( (p c )² + (m_mu c² )² ) / c²? Wait, no, units might be confusing here. Let me get the units right. The energy E is in MeV, mass m is in MeV/c², and p is in MeV/c.

Wait, so the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The expression for relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m c² )^2 ). So E_mu is sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m_mu c² )^2 ), and E_nu is p c, because for massless particles, E = p c.

So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m_mu c² )^2 ) + p c = m_π c².

So we can write the equation:

sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m_mu c^2 )^2 ) + p c = m_π c^2

Let me divide both sides by c² to make it easier. Let me set c=1 for simplicity in units. So,

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_π

Because m_π c² is the rest energy, and with c=1, it's just m_π in MeV.

So, let me denote m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

So the equation is sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Let me substitute variables to make it easier. Let me let x = p.

So,

sqrt(x² + m_mu²) + x = m_pi

I can rearrange this equation to solve for x.

sqrt(x² + m_mu²) = m_pi - x

Now, square both sides:

x² + m_mu² = (m_pi - x)^2

Expand the right-hand side:

(m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi x + x² )

So,

x² + m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi x

Rearranging:

2 m_pi x = m_pi² - m_mu²

So,

x = (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi)

Let me compute that.

m_pi = 139.6 MeV
m_mu = 105.7 MeV

m_pi squared is (139.6)^2 ≈ let's calculate:

139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2 * 140 * 0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV²

m_mu squared is (105.7)^2.

105.7^2: 100^2 = 10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and (100+5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So,

m_pi² - m_mu² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Then,

x = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6) ) 

Calculate denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So,

x ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 8.31567 / 0.2792 ≈ approximately 29.8 MeV/c.

Wait wait, that can't be right because the muon's rest mass is 105.7, and p is 29.8, so p < m_mu. So sqrt(p² + m_mu²) would be sqrt(886.8 + 11172.49)= sqrt(12059.29)= ~109.8 MeV/c².

Wait, but let's proceed. So x is about 29.8 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 139.6 squared is 139.6 *139.6. Let me compute that accurately.

139.6 * 139.6:

Calculate 140 * 140 = 19600.

But 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140.

So (140 - 0.4)² = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.
