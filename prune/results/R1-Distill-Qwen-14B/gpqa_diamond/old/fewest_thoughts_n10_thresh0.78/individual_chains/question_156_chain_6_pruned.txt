Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question involves two reactions with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes typically adds an epoxide group across the double bond. Since the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), the reaction might form different epoxide products based on the stereochemistry.

Wait, in epoxidation, the geometry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's structure. For a trans double bond (E), the epoxide that forms would have the substituents on opposite sides, leading to a trans epoxide. Similarly, a cis double bond (Z) would form a cis epoxide. So Reaction 1 starts with E-octene, leading to an epoxide with specific stereochemistry, and Reaction 2 with Z-octene leading to another.

But wait, wait. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, right? For each starting alkene, it should form a single epoxide. So Reaction 1 gives an epoxide from E-octene, and Reaction 2 gives an epoxide from Z-octene.

But then, after the epoxidation, the question mentions treatment with aqueous acid. Oh right! When epoxides are treated with acid, they undergo ring-opening reactions. The acidic conditions protonate the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. The ring opens in a process where the most stable carbocation is formed. Since oct-4-ene is symmetric (both ends are similar), the attack can happen from either side.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure. Oct-4-ene is
