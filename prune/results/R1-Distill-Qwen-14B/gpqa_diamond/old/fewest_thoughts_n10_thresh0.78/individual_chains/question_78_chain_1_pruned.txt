Okay, so I've got this question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a point charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're supposed to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a later time t, where t is greater than tr. Oh right, tr is the time when the field was generated. So, the field at time t is based on the charge's position and velocity at tr.

I remember that the potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential V is related to the electric field E, and the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B. For a static charge, the electric field is radial and depends on 1/r, but when the charge is moving, there's also magnetic effects.

Wait, the charge's velocity at tr is v. So, the potentials would depend on this velocity because the magnetic field arises from moving charges.

The options given are A, B, C, D. Let me recall the expressions for V and A when a charge is moving. Oh right, the scalar potential should account for the retarded time, but maybe in this question, they're considering the static case as an approximation, or perhaps it's more about the form of the potentials when the charge is moving.

Wait, no, the question states that we're considering the field at time t, which is after the charge's position at tr. So, we're dealing with retarded potentials here. The retarded time tr is the time it takes for the influence of the charge's motion to reach the observation point r.

So, the general form of the scalar potential due to a charge in motion is something like V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(r')) where r' is the distance at the retarded time. But when the charge is moving, the expressions for V and A involve terms related to the velocity and the vector from the charge's position to the observation point.

Wait, another thought. The potentials can be expressed using the retarded position. So the vector d is the displacement from where the charge was at tr to the observation point r. So d = r - r', where r' is the position of the charge at tr.

Wait, but in the options, the
