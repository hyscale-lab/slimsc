Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data. Let's see what the data says and how to approach it.

First, the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, assuming no halogens (X=0), so:

C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2.

So: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds or 3 degrees) and maybe a carbonyl group (another degree) and an amide or something else. Or maybe a ring plus a double bond and some other structures.

Looking at the IR data: Strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. These are usually indicative of N-H stretches. But wait, the first is medium to strong, the second strong. Another strong band at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is in the range for an ester or maybe a ketone, but esters are more around 1740-1720. Wait, 1720 could also be a carboxylic acid, but that's usually broader and maybe a bit lower. So maybe an ester or amide.

The 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) - that's a triplet, likely a CH2CH3 group, so an ethyl group. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2, so maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) - broad singlet, 2H. Hmm. Could be a CH2 next to an electronegative atom, maybe an O or N. If it's a broad peak, perhaps it's an NH group, but wait, in the IR we saw N-H stretches. But wait, in the IR, the peaks are at 3420 and 3325. Those are N-H stretches, which would be from a secondary amide (NH) or maybe an aromatic amine (like aniline). But in the NMR, at 4.0 ppm, a broad singlet for 2H... maybe it's an OCH2 group. Alternatively, could it be a NH2 group? But that would be a triplet if it's adjacent to CH2. Hmm, not sure yet.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) - quartet. 2H. A quartet suggests coupling with a CH2 group. At 4.5
