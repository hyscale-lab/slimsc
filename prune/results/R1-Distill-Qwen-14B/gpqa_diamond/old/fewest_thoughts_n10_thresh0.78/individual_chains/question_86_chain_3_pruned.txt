Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on unknown compounds A and B. The products in both cases are enantiomers: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The options given are four possible combinations of A and B.

Hmm, I remember that the stereochemistry of the product in such reactions can depend on the reducing agent used and the starting material's configuration. The reducing agents here are LiBH4 and BH3, but wait, I think BH3 is typically used in a specific kind of reaction. Oh right, BH3 is used with THF as a solvent, and it's a milder reducing agent compared to LiBH4. Oh wait, no, actually, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent. Wait, LiBH4 can reduce esters and ketones, but BH3 is usually used for ketones but not esters. Or wait, no, BH3 is often used in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, but when it comes to esters, maybe it's different. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another thought: when reducing a ketone to an alcohol, the stereochemistry can depend on the reducing agent. For example, BH3 followed by H2O2 and then acid work-up (which is the typical method) would give a specific stereochemistry based on the starting material's configuration. But LiBH4 is a different reducing agent. Oh wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and can also affect stereochemistry? Or perhaps not. Wait, no, the difference might not be in the stereochemistry but in the regiochemistry or the ability to reduce certain functional groups.

Wait, but both reactions here are producing the same molecule, just as enantiomers. So the starting materials must have been such that their configurations lead to opposite configurations in the product when reduced with different reagents.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are ketones or esters. Because the product is a ketone? Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structureâ€”pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, so it's like a cyclic ether. The substituents are a ketone at position
