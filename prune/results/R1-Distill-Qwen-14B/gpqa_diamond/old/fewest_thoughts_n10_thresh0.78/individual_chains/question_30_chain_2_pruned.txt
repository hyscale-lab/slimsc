Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry and light emission. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question says a textile dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons and emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember that in organic compounds, especially those with conjugated pi systems, the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) determines the wavelength of light absorbed. When a molecule absorbs a photon, an electron jumps from HOMO to LUMO.

But wait, the question is about emission. Oh right, when a molecule emits light, it's after it has been excited. So the emission happens after excitation, but the absorbed light is usually in the higher energy, which causes the emission. Or maybe I should think about the complementary colors.

Oh, right! The color emitted is the complementary color of what's absorbed. Because when a compound absorbs a certain wavelength, it doesn't emit that; instead, it emits the remaining colors. So if it emits, say, red, it must have absorbed the complementary color, which is cyan or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the energy first. The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. To find the wavelength, I can use the equation E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. But wait, converting eV to joules. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 3.746e-19 J.

Then, λ = hc/E. Let's plug in the numbers.

λ = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (3.746e-19 J)

Calculating the numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 3.746e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 / 3.746e-19 = approx 5
