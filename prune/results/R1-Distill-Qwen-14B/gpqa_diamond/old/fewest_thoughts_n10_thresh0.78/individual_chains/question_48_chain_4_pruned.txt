Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. I'll break down each step to figure out what each product looks like, especially the final product 4, and then count the distinct hydrogen atoms.

First step: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. I remember that ketones can undergo various additions. Bromine (Br2) in a certain solvent might lead to a specific reaction. Oh wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, so maybe it's an addition reaction. But wait, waitâ€”bromine can also lead to enol formation if in a different condition. Alternatively, I think that when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, it's probably undergoing a nucleophilic addition. Wait, no, bromine in a less polar solvent might lead to an electrophilic addition. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination through an enol mechanism. Oh right! I think cyclohexanone can undergo a bromination on the alpha-carbon through an enolate. So, when the ketone is treated with Br2, it probably forms a dibromide or maybe a bromohydrin, but wait, no, the typical reaction of ketones with bromine is the addition across the carbonyl group, but in this case, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Wait, maybe
