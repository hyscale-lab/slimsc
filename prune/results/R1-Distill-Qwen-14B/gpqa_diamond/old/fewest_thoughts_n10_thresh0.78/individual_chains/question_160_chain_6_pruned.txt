Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length a. A monochromatic light, which means it's a single wavelength λ, is shining along the z-axis and hitting the aperture vertically. The result is a pattern of intensity maxima and minima in the far field. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh right, and we can approximate tanθ as θ because the angles are small.

Wait, I remember that when you have a circular aperture, the first minima occur at a certain angle, but this is a polygon with a very large number of sides, so it's almost circular. Maybe the approach is similar but the formula is slightly different.

Let me think about the basics. For single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at angles θ where a sinθ = mλ, with m being the order. But that's for a slit of width a. But wait, in this problem, the aperture is an N-gon. When N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle, so perhaps the formula for the minima would be similar to the single-slit diffraction but with a different parameter.

Wait, the problem says all apothems are the same. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? For a circle, the apothem is just the radius. So in this case, when N is large, the apothem a is the radius of the circular aperture. Wait, no. Wait, for a polygon, the apothem is related to the radius (the distance from the center to a vertex) through the formula a = R cos(π/N), where R is the radius of the circumcircle. When N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem a is approximately equal to R, because cos(π/N) approaches 1 as N becomes large. So in the limit as N approaches infinity, a ≈ R.

So the problem reduces to a circular aperture with radius a. Wait, but wait. No, wait. Let me think again. For a circle, the radius is the same as the apothem because all points on the circumference are equidistant from the center. So for a polygon approaching a circle, the apothem a would be equal to the radius R
