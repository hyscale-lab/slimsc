Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So the scenario is that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they did in vivo imaging and saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene showed high variability. The question is asking which process is happening.

Wait, I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? They're like these clusters in the small intestine and are important for immune responses, especially against pathogens that enter through the digestive system. So when the rotavirus proteins are delivered orally, they probably get taken up by the Peyer patches.

The GFP is on the capsid proteins. But some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Stomach acid is strong, so maybe the proteins didn't survive being in the stomach. But then, some made it to the Peyer patches. So the ones that did survive must have been taken up by the immune system.

In the Peyer patches, the immune cells would process these antigens. Antigen-presenting cells, like dendritic cells or macrophages, take up the antigens and present them to T cells. But in this case, the question is about the variable heavy chain genes. Variable regions are part of the B cell receptors, so this must be about B cells.

High variability in the variable heavy chain genes. Oh, right! When B cells are activated, they undergo somatic hypermutation. That's the process where mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the B cell receptor genes, increasing the diversity of the antibodies produced. This helps the immune system respond more effectively to specific antigens.

So in the Peyer patches, the B cells that encounter the rotavirus antigens would start proliferating. As they proliferate, they undergo somatic hypermutation. That explains the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes because each cell's receptor might have slightly different mutations.

Let me look at the other options. Option B is complement activation. Complement is involved in destroying pathogens, but I don't see how that relates to the variability in the variable regions. Option C is class switching, which changes the type of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but that doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions. Option D is VDJ recombination, which occurs during the initial development of B cell receptors in the bone marrow. But VDJ is a process that happens once, during B cell maturation, not during an immune response. Since the question is about something happening after antigen exposure, it's more likely somatic hypermutation.

So the process must be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence of these proteins is observed to be partially destroyed by stomach acid and partially entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The Peyer patches are known to play a key role in immune responses to orally ingested pathogens. After isolating the proliferating cell population from these patches, sequencing the variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is indicative of a process that introduces mutations into the variable regions of B cell receptors. This process is known as **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response to increase the diversity and specificity of antibodies. Somatic hypermutation is consistent with the observed results, as it explains the diversity in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating B cells in the Peyer patches.

Other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **Complement activation (B):** This process involves the destruction of pathogens and does not explain the variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **Class switching recombination (C):** This process changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not directly account for the observed variability in the variable regions.
- **VDJ recombination (D):** This process occurs during the initial development of B cell receptors in the bone marrow and is not relevant to the immune response observed in this experiment.

The correct process is **somatic hypermutation**, which explains the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of the B cells in the Peyer patches.
