Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's three elements, so it's a 3x1 vector. So the system is in a 3-dimensional state space, probably a qutrit or something like that. 

Then, there are two observables, P and Q, each represented by a square matrix. I need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q after P. Oh wait, no, the measurement order is first P, then Q. Or wait, the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P," so the order is P first, then Q. But wait, the probabilities are for P being 0 and Q being -1.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, measuring one observable affects the state for the next measurement. Because when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the process is: measure P, which collapses the state into an eigenstate of P, and then measure Q on this new state.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the joint probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 in sequence. So I think I need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0, then measuring Q (on the new state) gives -1.

Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. Because when we measure P, the system will collapse into one of P's eigenstates, and the eigenvalue is the result.

Wait, but operator P is given by a matrix. Let me write it down.

The matrix for P has elements:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

So P is a 3x3 matrix. Similarly, Q's matrix is given as:
First row: 1,0,0
Second row: 0,0,0
Third row: 0,0,-1

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1. Each corresponds to the respective basis vectors.

Wait, but Q's matrix is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are just the diagonal entries. So the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors. So for Q, if I measure 1, the state is |1> = (1,0,0), if I measure 0, it's |2> = (0,1,0), and if I measure -1, it's |3>
