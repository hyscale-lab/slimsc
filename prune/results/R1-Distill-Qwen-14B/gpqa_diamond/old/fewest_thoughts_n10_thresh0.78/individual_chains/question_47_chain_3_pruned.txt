Okay, I need to figure out which compound C9H11NO2 is based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me start by looking at the molecular formula. The formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, substituting: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees. That could be a benzene ring (which counts as 3, since it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds), a double bond or a carbonyl, and maybe an amide or something else. So the structure likely includes a benzene ring with substituents.

Now, looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Since they're medium to strong, maybe in an amide or an amine. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, probably an ester or amide. Esters typically show around 1740, but amides are lower. Hmm, wait, 1720 is more like an ester? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl or an amide. Another thought: if it's an amide, the carbonyl is around 1680, but maybe if it's an aromatic amide, it could be a bit higher. Or maybe it's an ester. Alternatively, maybe a ketone, but that's less likely with the other data.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: that's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet suggests coupling with a neighboring CH2. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: could be an OCH2 group or maybe an NH2 as a broad peak, but wait, in NMR, NH protons usually are broad, but maybe in this case, it's an OCH2. Alternatively, an ethoxy group's CH2 might be near 4. So maybe ethoxy something.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H: quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe another CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to an O. Like a CH2 connected to an oxygen, and next to another CH2. For example, in an ethyl ester, the CH2 next to O would split into a quartet.

7.0 ppm, doublet, 2H and 8.0 ppm, doublet, 2H: this looks like para-substituted aromatic protons. The two doublets probably indicate two sets of protons in a para arrangement. So the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. For example, if there's an electron-withdrawing group and an electron-donating group, but wait, the substituents could be an amide or an ester group.

Now, let me think about the options given:

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. The benzamide group would have a CONH2. So in the IR, we should see amide N-H stretches around 3350-3200 (broad), and the carbonyl around 1680. But the IR here shows 1720, which is higher, perhaps more like an ester. So maybe this option isn't correct.

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would be a formamide (HCONHR) where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2, but if it's N-(4-
