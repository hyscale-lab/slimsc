Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let me go through the scenario step by step.

The researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model to overexpress the GADD45G protein. They're using a plasmid with an inducible system and introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. The construct was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine, and they're selecting for antibiotic resistance. But when they test the expression, it's not happening as expected.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, it's the plus strand of the construct. I need to analyze this sequence to find the issue.

First, I should check if the reading frame is correct for the HA tag and the GADD45G coding sequence. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it should be the first part of the protein. If the HA sequence is messed up, maybe the tag isn't being recognized, but the question suggests the problem is in the construct.

Looking at the sequence, I notice that the HA tag (which is the sequence for the antigenic determinant) is at the very beginning. The HA peptide is typically around 11 amino acids, so the DNA sequence for that should be about 33 nucleotides (since each codon is 3 nucleotides). Let me look at the start of the sequence.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Following that, I see TACCCATACGATGTT... Wait, ATG is the start, then TAC is tyrosine. Let me write this out as a potential reading frame.

But wait, the HA tag is introduced. The HA epitope is usually from the influenza virus, and its DNA sequence is something like TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGA (I think). Let me see if the initial part of the sequence matches that.

The beginning is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC G... So, the first codons after ATG (which is position 3) are TAC (tyr), CCA (pro), TAC (tyr), GAT (as), GTT (val), CCA (pro), GAT (as), TAC (tyr), etc. Wait, that seems correct for the HA tag. So the HA is correctly inserted.

But when looking at the construct, I should check for any stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) in the reading frame because that would cause premature termination. If the HA tag includes a stop codon, the ribosome would terminate early.

Looking at the beginning of the sequence, let me break it into triplets (codons):

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC G... Wait, the initial part is:

ATG (start), TAC (tyr), CCA (pro), TAC (tyr), GAT (as), GTT (val), CCA (pro), GAT (as), TAC (tyr), GCC (ala), CAA (gln), ATT (ile), ACT (thr), CTG (leu), ... Hmm.

Wait, I thought the HA sequence is around TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGA... Let me count the letters. The HA tag's coding sequence is about 33 nucleotides long, so let's see:

The first 33 nucleotides after ATG would be positions 4-36: TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GGC CAA ATT (I think). Wait, let me count:

The provided sequence starts after ATG as:

TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GGC CAA ATT ACT ...

Wait, that's each triplet. So the first codon after start is TAC (tyr), then CCA (pro), TAC (tyr), GAT (as), GTT (val), CCA (pro), GAT (as), TAC (tyr), GGC (gly), CAA (gln), ATT (ile), ACT (thr), CTG (leu), etc.

Wait a second, the HA tag is usually 11 amino acids. Let's see if any of these triplets introduce a stop codon in the same frame.

Looking at the first 33 nucleotides (positions
