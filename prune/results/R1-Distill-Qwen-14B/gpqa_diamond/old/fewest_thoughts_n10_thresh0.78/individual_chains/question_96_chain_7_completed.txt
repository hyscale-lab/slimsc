Okay, so I've got this problem about a supermassive black hole and I need to find the order of magnitude of its entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let's try to break it down.

The question gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon as 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. I think I remember that the angular size relates to the actual size of the object. Oh right, there's this formula involving the small angle approximation: θ ≈ (radius of the object) / (distance to the object). But wait, θ needs to be in radians for that formula to work accurately.

So first, I need to convert θ from degrees to radians. I know that 180 degrees is π radians, so to convert, I multiply θ by (π/180). Let me calculate that. 

θ in radians = 1e-17 degrees * (π rad / 180 degrees) ≈ (1e-17) * (3.1416/180) ≈ roughly 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, using the small angle formula, θ ≈ R / d. So R ≈ θ * d.

Wait, but d is given in parsecs. I should convert that to meters because we usually use SI units for these calculations. One parsec is about 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters.

So R ≈ θ_in_rad * d = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.0857e26 m. Let's compute that:

1.745e-19 * 3.0857e26 = (1.745 * 3.0857) * 1e( -19 +26 ) = around 5.372 * 1e7 m. So approximately 5.372e7 meters. Wait, that's about 5.372e7 meters, which is 5.372e4 kilometers. That seems a bit small for a supermassive black hole. Oh wait, wait. Wait, supermassive black holes can have millions to billions of solar masses. The Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2GM/c², so for a mass M, R is proportional to M. Let me think: the Schwarzschild radius for the Sun is about 3 km. So if this black hole has R ≈ 5e7 meters (which is 5e4 km) that would correspond to about 1e5 solar masses (since 3 km * 1e5 = 3e5 km). But supermassive black holes are up to millions or billions of solar masses, so maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me re-calculate R.

Wait, θ is 1e-17 degrees. Let me compute again: θ (radians) = 1e-17 * (pi / 180) ≈ 1e-17 * 0.0174532925 ≈ 1.7453e-19 radians.

Then R = θ * d = 1.7453e-19 * 3.0857e26 m.

Multiply 1.7453e-19 by 3.0857e26: 1.7453 *3.0857 ≈ 5.37; exponents: 1e-19 *1e26 =1e7. So R ≈ 5.37e7 m. Hmm, that's 5.37e4 km, which is 53,700 km. But the Schwarzschild radius for a supermassive BH, say, Sag A*, is about 20 million km. Wait, so this is way smaller. Hmm, that suggests I might have a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, distance is 1e10 parsecs, which is 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 m. So that's right. Hmm, but maybe I messed up the calculation of R.

Wait, 1e-17 degrees is a very small angle. So the actual calculation might be correct. So R is about 5e7 meters, which is 5e4 kilometers. So R_s = 2GM/c². Let me find M.

R_s = 2.95 km per solar mass. So M = R_s / 2.95 km * solar mass.

Wait, R_s is 2GM/c², yes. For the sun, R_s is about 3 km. So in this case, R is 5e7 meters = 5e4 km. So M = (R_s) / (2.95 km) * M_sun.

Wait, R_s = 5e4 km =5e7 meters is R_s, so M = (5e4 km) / (2.95 km) * M_sun ≈ (5e4 / 2.95) * M_sun ≈ approx 16951.5 M_sun. So about 1.7e4 solar masses. Wait, that's not supermassive—like the Milky Way's supermassive BH is about 4e6 solar masses. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the formulas for entropy.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to compute the mass. The problem is asking for the entropy of the black hole. I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Wait, the formula is S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), but I'm a bit confused about the exact constants. Let me write down the formula correctly.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ) * (1/(k_B)), wait no, let me check again. No, the formula is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G). Or perhaps S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) * (k_B), where l_p is the Planck length. Alternatively, I think the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (1/(k_B)) or something like that. Wait, the entropy formula is S = (A k_B c^3 )/(4 ħ G) * (1/(something?)). Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

Wait, the formula is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G). Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think: the area A is in m². The constants:

ħ has units of J·s.

G is m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.

c is m/s.

k_B is J/K.

So, let's compute the units of S.

A (m²) * c^3 (m^3/s^3) ) / ( ħ (J s) * G (m^3/(kg s^2)) )) )

Wait, this might get messy, but perhaps the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (1/k_B) ? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G) * (1/(something?)). Alternatively, perhaps I should just look up the correct formula.

Wait, the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ) * k_B? Wait, no. Let me think again. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A k_B c^3) / (4 ħ G) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) ) * (k_B), where l_p is the Planck length. Since l_p = sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ), so l_p² = ħ G / c^3. So A/(4 l_p^2) ) = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) ), so S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (k_B^2/(something?)) Hmm, perhaps it's better to just take the formula as S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (1/(k_B))? Or maybe it's S = (A k_B c^3 )/(4 ħ G) ?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Let me think about the units. Let's compute the units of S.

A is in m².

c^3 is (m/s)^3 = m³/s³.

ħ is J·s = (kg m²/s²) s = kg m²/s.

G is m³/(kg s²).

So putting them together:

(A c^3) / (ħ G) → (m² * m³/s³) ) / ( (kg m²/s) * (m³/(kg s²)) )) )

Denominator: (kg m²/s) * (m³/(kg s²)) ) = (kg m^5)/(kg s^3) ) → m^5/s^3.

So numerator: m^5 / s^3.

So (m^5/s^3) / (m^5/s^3) ) → dimensionless. So S would be that times constants, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should just accept that I might have the formula correct in terms of the area and compute it.

But perhaps to proceed, I should first compute the area A of the event horizon, then plug it into the entropy formula.

The area A of a sphere is 4π R². So once I find R, I can compute A.

So R is approximately 5.37e7 meters. So A = 4 * π * (5.37e7 m)^2.

Calculating (5.37e7)^2 = approx (5.37)^2 = 28.8369, so 28.8369e14 m². Multiply by 4 * π: 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.5664. So 12.5664 * 28.8369e14 ≈ 362.7e14 m² → 3.627e16 m².

Wait, that would make A about 3.6e16 m². Now, applying the entropy formula: S = (A k_B c^3) / (4 ħ G). But I'm not confident about the factors here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * k_B? Wait, no, let me get this right.

Wait, another approach: the entropy of a black hole is given by S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon in square meters.

Wait, let me look up the formula: I think it's S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (k_B), or perhaps including the Boltzmann constant. Alternatively, I've read that S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G). Let's proceed with that.

But perhaps the exact formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ) * k_B^2? No, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to refer to the formula as S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G). Let me proceed with that.

So, plugging in the numbers:

A = 4 π R² = 4 * π * (5.37e7 m)^2 ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * (2.88e15) m² → 3.627e16 m².

Constants:

k_B = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

c = 3e8 m/s.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

G = 6.67430e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So S = (A * c^3) / (4 * ħ * G) * k_B.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me make sure.

Wait, the correct formula is S = (A c^3) / (4 ħ G) * (k_B), perhaps? Or is it S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (k_B) ?

Wait, perhaps the formula is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G), which would make the units work out as entropy in J/K.

So let's write S = (A * k_B * c^3) / (4 * ħ * G).

So plugging in the numbers:

A = 3.627e16 m².

k_B = 1.38e-23 J/K.

c = 3e8 m/s.

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J s.

G = 6.6743e-11 m³/kg/s².

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator:

A * k_B * c^3 = 3.627e16 m² * 1.38e-23 J/K * (3e8 m/s)^3.

First, (3e8)^3 = 27e24 m³/s³ = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

So:

3.627e16 * 1.38e-23 = (3.627 *1.38) e(16-23) → 5.007e-7.

Multiply by 2.7e25 → 5.007e-7 * 2.7e25 = 13.52e18 = 1.352e19 J m²/(s³ K) ? Wait, maybe I should compute the units later.

Denominator:

4 * ħ * G = 4 *1.05457e-34 J s * 6.6743e-11 m³/kg/s².

Compute 4 *1.05457e-34 =4.218e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.218 *6.6743) e( -34 -11) → approx 28.13e-45 → 2.813e-44 J s m³/(kg s²).

Wait, J is kg m²/s², so let's see:

J s = kg m²/s.

m³/(kg s²) → (kg m²/s) * m³/(kg s²) ) = m^5/(s^3).

Wait, but perhaps I should just compute the numerical value.

So numerator is approx 1.352e19.

Denominator is 2.813e-44.

So S = numerator / denominator = 1.352e19 / 2.813e-44 ≈ (1.352/2.813) * 1e(19 +44) → approx 0.4806 * 1e63 → 4.806e62.

So S ≈ 4.8e62 J/K.

Looking at the options, option A is 1e62, option D is 1e65, etc. So 4.8e62 is about 1e62, so the order of magnitude is 1e62. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, when I computed R, I found R ≈5.37e7 meters. Then A =4π R² = 4 *3.1416*(5.37e7)^2. Let me compute that:

5.37e7 m squared is (5.37)^2 =28.8369 → 28.8369e14 m².

Multiply by 4π: 4 *3.1416=12.5664 → 12.5664 *28.8369e14 → let's compute 12.5664 *28.8369.

12.5664 *28 = 351.8592, 12.5664 *0.8369 ≈10.509. Sum is 362.368 → so A≈362.368e14 m² → 3.62368e16 m². So that part is correct.

Now, the constants and numbers:

k_B=1.38e-23, c=3e8, so c^3=2.7e24 m^3/s^3.

So A *k_B=3.62368e16 *1.38e-23 = (3.62368 *1.38)e(16-23) → approximately 5.00e-7.

Multiply by c^3: 5.00e-7 *2.7e24=1.35e18.

Denominator:4 * ħ *G=4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

Compute ħ*G: 1.05e-34 *6.67e-11 = (1.05 *6.67) e-45 →≈6.99e-45.

Multiply by4: 4 *6.99e-45 =2.796e-44.

So S= (1.35e18) / (2.796e-44) = (1.35/2.796) * 1e(18+44) → 0.4816 * 1e62 → 4.816e61. So approximately 4.8e61 J/K.

Wait, that's 4.8e61, which is about 5e61. The options are A)1e62, B)1e59, C)1e66, D)1e65.

Hmm, 4.8e61 is 4.8 ×10^61, which is 0.48 ×10^62. So the order of magnitude is 1e62, which is option A. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but wait—am I sure about the formula? Because another way I've heard the formula is S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G) → which is what I used. So the calculation seems correct.

But let me recheck the calculation of R. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps.

θ = 1e-17 degrees.

Convert to radians: θ = (1e-17) * (pi/180) ≈ (1e-17) * 1.745e-2 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Distance d = 1e10 parsec = 1e10 *3.086e16 m =3.086e26 m.

R = θ * d = 1.745e-19 *3.086e26 = (1.745 *3.086) e( -19 +26 ) → 5.373e7 m.

Yes, that seems right. So R is 5.373e7 meters.

So yeah, the calculations are correct. So the entropy is about 5e61 J/K, which is ~1e62. So the correct option is A) 1e62.


To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius \( R \)
The angular size of the event horizon is given as \( \theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \), and the distance to the black hole is \( d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \). Using the small-angle approximation \( \theta \approx \frac{R}{d} \), we first convert \( \theta \) from degrees to radians:
\[
\theta \, (\text{radians}) = 10^{-17} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]
Next, convert \( d \) from parsecs to meters:
\[
d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} = 10^{10} \times 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]
Using \( R = \theta \cdot d \), the Schwarzschild radius is:
\[
R = (1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.086 \times 10^{26}) \approx 5.373 \times 10^{7} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the event horizon \( A \)
The area of the event horizon is given by \( A = 4 \pi R^2 \). Substituting \( R = 5.373 \times 10^7 \, \text{m} \):
\[
A = 4 \pi (5.373 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 4 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot (2.887 \times 10^{15}) \approx 3.627 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the entropy \( S \)
The entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:
\[
S = \frac{A k_B c^3}{4 \hbar G},
\]
where:
- \( A = 3.627 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2 \),
- \( k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \hbar = 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \),
- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \).

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
A k_B c^3 = (3.627 \times 10^{16}) \cdot (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{24}) \approx 1.352 \times 10^{19} \, \text{J·m}^2/\text{s}^3.
\]
Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \cdot (1.054 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \approx 2.813 \times 10^{-44} \, \text{J·s·m}^3/\text{kg·s}^2.
\]
Finally, compute \( S \):
\[
S = \frac{1.352 \times 10^{19}}{2.813 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 4.8 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Step 4: Determine the order of magnitude
The entropy \( S \) is approximately \( 4.8 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \), which corresponds to an order of magnitude of \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **A) \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \)**.

Answer: A
