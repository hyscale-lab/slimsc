Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about optical isomerism, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question is asking which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism. The options are four compounds, and the choices are A to D. 

First, I need to understand what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism happens when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they have a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Chiral centers can't be superimposed on their mirror images, leading to enantiomers which are non-superimposable mirror images. These enantiomers are optically active, meaning they can rotate plane-polarized light. So, the key is to look for compounds with at least one chiral center.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   Hmm, the name suggests a biphenyl structure, which is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 6 and 6' on each ring, and also at 2 and 2'. Each of these is a nitro group (dinitro) and a methyl ester (dicarboxylate, so OMe groups). Wait, does this create any chiral centers?

   Let me visualize the structure. The central single bond between the two benzene rings is the biphenyl. The substituents at 2 and 2' positions are both -COOCH3 groups. Are there any chiral centers here? Well, the carbons where these groups are attached are part of the aromatic rings, which are spÂ² hybridized. So, they can't have four different substituents because the other two substituents are part of the ring and identical. So, the central carbon (the one connecting the two benzene rings) is connected to two nitro groups (no, wait, the dinitro is on 6 and 6'. So, maybe the central carbon isn't the issue here.)

   Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. The ester groups are at 2 and 2', which are each attached to a methoxy group. So, each of those is a carbonyl group. Are those carbons chiral? Let me think. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center. The adjacent carbon (the one attached to the ester oxygen) would be CH2 or something else? No, in the ester group, the structure is O-C-O. So, for the ester R-O-CO-OCH3, the carbonyl is part of the ester. So, the central carbon in the ester isn't a chiral center because it's connected to two oxygen atoms and maybe something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

   Alternatively, perhaps the central biphenyl structure allows for some kind of stereoisomerism, like cis-trans around the single bond. But that's geometric isomerism, not optical. So, unless there's a chiral center, optical isomerism isn't possible. Wait, maybe the substituents on each ring create a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think again. The substituents on the biphenyl ring are at positions 2,2',6,6'. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carbonyl ester at 2. 

   Wait, maybe the biphenyl is connected in such a way that each substituent leads to a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such positions that the central carbon (the one connecting the two rings) is a chiral center. But wait, the central carbon is part of a single bond and is connected to two benzene rings and two other substituents? No, the structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The other substituents are at 2,2',6,6'. So
