Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Okay, the given Lagrangian is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. I remember that gamma matrices are involved in the Dirac equation and things like that. 

The question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. I think the first step is to find the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. Because in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constants tells us about renormalizability.

Wait, right, a renormalizable theory is one where the coupling constants have positive or zero mass dimension. Because if their dimension is negative, you need an infinite number of terms, making the theory non-renormalizable.

So, to find [κ]_M, I need to figure out the dimensions of each part of the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because it's integrated over four-dimensional spacetime (since the action is dimensionless, and d^4x has dimension -4 in mass units).

Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So, let's break down L_int.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}.

I know the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension (3/2). So ψ̄ would also have the same dimension as ψ, since it's just the adjoint. So ψ̄ has [ψ̄]_M = 3/2.

What about σ_{μν}? σ is made from the commutator of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're part of the spinor representation, right? So σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}]_M = 0.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is derived from the gauge field A, which has mass dimension 1. The field strength tensor is the derivative of A minus the commutator of the gauge fields. So each derivative ∂_mu has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1. So F^{mu nu} would have dimension 2, because each term in F is (∂A) or (A^2), but since A is dimension 1, ∂A is (1+1)=2. So F has dimension 2.

Putting it all together: The term is κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

Each part's dimensions: 
ψ̄: 3/2, σ: 0, ψ: 3/2, F: 2.

Multiply them together: 3/2 * 0 * 3/2 * 2 = Wait, wait, no. Wait, actually, the product is the sum of their dimensions. Because when you multiply things with dimensions, you add exponents. So:

[ψ̄] = 3/2
[σ] = 0
[ψ] = 3/2
[F] = 2

So the product is (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the term inside is dimension 5. 

But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the coupling κ must make up the difference. So κ has to have dimension 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, but wait, is that right? Because the Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by this product, so the dimension of the entire term is [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2. So [κ] + (3/2 +3/2) + 2 = [κ] + 3 +2 = [κ] +5. That has to equal 4. So [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. Yep, that's right.

So κ has dimension -1.

Now, the renormalizability. The theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0. Because if the dimension is negative, you need higher and higher order terms, leading to non-renormalizable interactions.

Since κ has dimension -1, which is negative, the theory is not renormalizable. So the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options, option C says [κ]_M = -1 and the theory is not renormalizable. Option A says dimension -1 and renormalizable, which can't be right.

Wait, let me double-check the F^{mu nu} dimension. The field tensor F is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. Each A has dimension 1, so ∂A has dimension 1+1 = 2. So F has dimension 2. That's correct.

So, yes, the coupling has dimension -1. Hence, the theory isn't renormalizable.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and the renormalizability of the theory, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. 

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields and operators
1. The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$, so $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
2. The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ for a gauge field has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.
3. The operator $\sigma_{
