Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and their observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths below 790 nm. 

Wait, I remember that when we observe distant objects like quasars, their light gets redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. So the peak wavelength we see might be longer than the original emitted wavelength. Oh right, this has to do with the Lyman-alpha forest and the Lyman-alpha emission line. The Lyman-alpha line is usually around 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. But if the quasar's light is redshifted, that line would move into the optical or infrared.

The peak at 790 nm suggests that the Lyman-alpha emission is now at this wavelength. So if the rest wavelength (emitted) is about 121.6 nm, the observed wavelength is 790 nm. So the redshift z can be calculated using the formula z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1.

Let me calculate that. So z = 790 / 121.6 - 1. Let's see, 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.5. So 6.5 minus 1 is 5.5. So z is about 5.5. Hmm, that's a high redshift, which implies the quasar is very far away.

Now the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. The universe parameters are given as Lambda-CDM model with Hubble constant H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m =0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and it's flat. So I need to find the comoving distance at redshift z=5.5.

Wait, what's the formula for comoving distance? Oh right, the comoving distance D_C is related to the integral of 1/H(a) da, where a is the scale factor. The scale factor a is 1/(1+z), so for z=5.5, a is 1/(6.5) ≈0.1538.

But wait, the comoving distance is calculated by integrating from a=0 (now) to a=1/(1+z). No, wait, no: the integral is from a=1/(1+z) to a=1, I think. Because the comoving distance is the integral of c/H(a) * da / a^2? Hmm, maybe I should recall the proper formula.

The comoving distance is given by (c/H0) * ∫ (from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda). Because for a flat universe, Omega_k=0, so E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m (1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda).

Wait, the exact formula is a bit tricky. The comoving radial distance is given by (c/H0) * ∫ (from 0 to z) [1 / sqrt(Omega_m (1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda)] dz'. 

So I need to compute this integral for z=5.5. Hmm, but doing this integral by hand is going to be tough. Maybe I can remember some approximate values or use an approximation.

Alternatively, I can think about the approximate comoving distances for high redshifts. For example, at z=1, the comoving distance is around 2 Gpc, but wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Wait, no, wait, with H0=70, the age of the universe is roughly 14 billion years, since H0 ≈70, so 1/H0 is about 14 billion years divided by 70, which is about 200 million years. Wait, no, sorry, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, which is 70/(3.086e19) s^-
