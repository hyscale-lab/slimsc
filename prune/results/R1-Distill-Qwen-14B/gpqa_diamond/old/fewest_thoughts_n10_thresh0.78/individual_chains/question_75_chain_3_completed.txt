Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Sometimes these questions can be a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about a researcher creating a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're trying to overexpress this protein using a construct, but it's not working. The problem is that when they look at the plus strand sequence of their construct, they can't overexpress the protein. They have to figure out why.

So, the construct has the coding sequence for GADD45G with a hemagglutinin tag added at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they test the expression, it's not working. So they're looking for the reason.

The options are A to D. Let's go through them one by one.

The construct's plus strand is given, and the sequence is quite long. I'm thinking maybe there's an issue in the reading frame or a stop codon causing early termination.

Looking at the sequence, I should check for any in-frame stop codons. The hemagglutinin tag is at the N-terminus, so it should be the first part of the protein. If the HA tag's sequence is correct, then the problem might be elsewhere.

Wait, let's think about the construct. They introduced the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the coding sequence starts with the HA sequence followed by GADD45G. If the HA sequence has a stop codon, that could cause the ribosome to terminate early.

Looking at the options, option B is that the ribosome terminated early. That would result in a truncated protein, which might not be detected if the antibody is specific for the HA tag. Alternatively, if the HA tag itself has a stop codon, that would also cause issues.

Wait, let's look at the plus strand sequence. The very beginning is 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Hmm, ATG is the start codon, methionine. TAC is tyrosine. Then CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine again, GAT is aspartic acid, etc. So the HA tag is probably part of this initial sequence.

Wait, the HA tag is a specific sequence. The HA tag is usually something like YPYDVPDYA or similar. But the given sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT... Let me see. ATG is Met, TAC is Tyr, CCA is Pro, TAC is Tyr, GAT is Asp. Hmm, that doesn't look like the standard HA tag. Maybe the HA sequence they inserted has a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag introduced a stop codon. Because if the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon, like TAG or TGA or TAA, that would cause the ribosome to stop early.

Wait, let's look for any in-frame stop codons in the given sequence. The plus strand is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this, right?

Wait no, actually, the plus strand's sequence is the same as the mRNA, except T instead of U. So the mRNA would have the same sequence but with U's. So the mRNA is the same as the plus strand, just U instead of T.

So the coding sequence starts with ATG, which is a start codon. Then TAC is Tyr, CCA Pro, TAC Tyr, GAT Asp, etc. Let me scan through the sequence to find any in-frame stop codons.

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in triplets.

Let me parse the sequence in triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAA GAA GTC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGT GCA GGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA...

Wait, at the end of the first part, I see TGA. Let me check that.

Looking at the sequence:

...ACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGA...

Wait, the last part I looked at is "GCT GCA TGA". Oh wait, GCT is Ala, GCA is Ala, TGA is a stop codon.

Wait: the mRNA is 5' to 3', so the coding sequence is in triplets.

In the given plus strand sequence, the TGA occurs in the middle. Let me count the nucleotides.

Wait, the sequence is:

...CGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, so towards the end, I see 'TGA' as the last six nucleotides: 'TGA' would be positions... Let me find where exactly. Let me look through the sequence.

Looking for 'TGA' in the plus strand. Let me see:

Looking at the latter part: ...ATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Hmm, in the middle, I see "GCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCAT..." Wait, maybe I should look for TGA in the coding frame.

Wait, perhaps the TGA is within the coding region. So, if the construct's coding sequence includes a TGA stop codon, that would terminate translation early. Let me see.

Looking at the beginning: ATG, then TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), etc. So the first 30 nucleotides: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAA GAA GTC GCG GCC AGG...

Wait, in the middle, let's see:

"CGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGG..."

Wait, the part "TGA" is in "TGAACGTGG". So the triplet before that is 'TGA'?

Wait, let's see the exact sequence. Starting from position where TGA occurs:

Looking for triplets, so:

...GCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGG...

Breaking it into triplets:

GCAT GAG T TG C TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG CTC CTC ACT GCC GGC GT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAAC GTG GAC...

Wait, the triplet after 'AGC' would be 'GTC' (Val), then 'AGG' (Arg), etc.

Wait, but in the sequence, I found a 'TGA' in the middle. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps it's in the latter part:

Looking at the sequence, towards the end: ...CAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGG...

Wait, looking for 'TGA' in the mRNA (which is the same as the plus strand, except Ts become Us.

Wait, suppose the sequence is:

...GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAAC GTG GAC...

Wait, the 'TTGA' part is in 'TTGAACGTGG'. So the triplet would be TGA. So, the triplet is T-G-A. So, in the plus strand, that's TGA. So in the mRNA, it's U-A-A? Wait no, wait. The mRNA is made from the template DNA, which would be the complementary strand. Oh wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the construct's plus strand is the same as the coding strand. So the mRNA is synthesized as a complement to the template strand, which is the opposite of the plus strand. Wait, no. Let's clarify:

In DNA, the plus strand is the same as mRNA except T instead of U. So the mRNA is synthesized using the template (minus) strand, which is complementary to the plus strand.

So the plus strand sequence is the same as the mRNA, except Ts are Us.

So in the plus strand, any TGA would correspond to TGA in the mRNA, which is a stop codon (TGA is a stop codon).

Wait, but in the sequence, I see "TGA" appears as part of the coding sequence. Let me see:

Looking at the part where the sequence is:

...GTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGG...

Breaking into triplets: GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGA...

Wait, so the triplet after AGT is CTT GAA CGT. So that's CTT (Leu), GAA (Glu), CGT (Arg). Hmm, not a stop codon there.

Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me scan the entire plus strand sequence.

Wait, the very end of the sequence is ...GAGTGA3'. So the last few nucleotides are GAG TGA.

Hmm, 'TGA' is a stop codon. So the last part is ...GAG TGA. So the last codon is GAG (Glu) and then TGA (stop), but wait, no. Wait, the entire sequence is a single long stretch. Let's see:

The entire sequence ends with ...GAGTGA3'

So the last six nucleotides are GAG TGA.

Which would be two triplets: GAG and TGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. Oh! So the coding sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the construct is designed to have the HA tag followed by GADD45G. So the coding sequence should be HA followed by GADD45G, ending with the normal stop codon.

But in this construct, the sequence ends with a TGA, which would cause the ribosome to stop early. So the construct's coding sequence is introducing a premature stop codon at the end, right? But wait, how?

Wait, the given plus strand is the coding strand, so the mRNA would have the same sequence except U instead of T. So the mRNA would have ...GAG UGU...? No, wait: the given plus strand is 5' ATG ... TGA 3' at the end. So the mRNA would be 5' A UG ... U G A 3', so the triplet would be UGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, but wait: the last part of the plus strand is ...GAGTGA3'. The mRNA would have ...GAG UGA...

So the last codon would be UGA, which is a stop. So the construct's coding sequence ends with a stop codon, which would cause translation to terminate early. That would mean the protein is not being produced because the ribosome stops at the UGA.

But why is that happening? Because in the construct, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, followed by GADD45G. So the construct should end with the normal stop codon of GADD45G, not an additional one.

So perhaps during the cloning process, the construct was not inserted correctly, and the GADD45G sequence was truncated, ending with a TGA.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag has a stop codon in it. Because HA is a tag, sometimes people include a tag followed by a stop codon, but if the stop codon is in the middle, it will cause premature termination.

Looking back at the options, option B is that the ribosome terminated early. That fits because the construct's coding sequence has a premature stop codon.

Wait, but why is there a stop codon? Was it introduced when they added the HA tag?

Another possibility: maybe the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon. For example, if the HA tag is designed to be in frame but includes a stop codon, that would cause the problem.

But in the given construct sequence, the HA tag is at the very beginning. Let me check the start. The first few codons are ATG (Met), TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAA (Glu), GAA (Glu), etc. So the HA tag would be the first part, but if the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon, that would cause the problem.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, like YPYDVPDYA, which is about 11 amino acids. So the DNA sequence for the HA tag would be about 33 nucleotides (11 codons). Let me think: each amino acid corresponds to three nucleotides.

So if the HA tag was added correctly, the first 30 nucleotides should code for the HA tag, and then the GADD45G starts. But in the given sequence, the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAA GAA GTC GCG... So those are the initial codons.

Wait, maybe during the cloning, the HA tag was added in a way that introduced a stop codon. For example, if the HA tag sequence was not properly cloned and introduced a TAA, TAG, or TGA in frame, the ribosome would stop early.

But in this construct, the plus strand's coding sequence ends with a TGA in the middle, which is a stop codon. So that's causing the problem.

Wait, but why is the plus strand's sequence ending with a TGA? Because perhaps the cloning process added an extra TGA at the end, which is causing the premature stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct was designed to have a stop codon after the HA tag, but it's placed in the wrong position.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag's DNA sequence may have a TGA in it. For example, if the HA tag's coding DNA includes TGA, which would code for stop in the mRNA.

Looking at the given sequence, the first 10 or so codons are:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAA GAA GTC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGT GCA GGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA ...

Wait, after about 30 nucleotides, I see the triplet TGA (positions 27-29: TTC CGG AAA ... Wait, no, let me count:

Wait, let me write the sequence in triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAA GAA GTC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGT GCA GGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA ...

Wait, so after the HA tag (assuming it's the first few codons), the sequence continues. So the HA tag is probably the first 10 codons or so.

Wait, but in this case, the TGA is somewhere in the middle of the coding sequence, not at the end. So the ribosome would stop there, producing a truncated protein. So the HA tag wouldn't be present at the N-terminus, because it's being cut off.

Wait, but the HA tag is at the N-terminus. If the stop codon is in the middle of the HA tag, the protein would be truncated before the HA tag is completed, making it impossible to detect with an HA-specific antibody. Alternatively, if the stop is after the HA tag, then the HA would be present but the GADD45G wouldn't be expressed.

But in the given sequence, the TGA is in the middle of the coding sequence. Let me count the codons.

The first codon is ATG (1), then TAC (2), CCA (3), TAC (4), GAT (5), GTT (6), CCA (7), GAA (8), GAA (9), GTC (10), GCG (11), GCC (12), AGG (13), ACA (14), CAG (15), TTC (16), CGG (17), AAA (18), GCA (19), CAG (20), CCA (21), GGT (22), GCA (23), GGG (24), GAA (25), AGC (26), GCT (27), GCA (28), TGA (29).

So the 29th codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the protein would be 29 codons long, but the HA tag is the first few, so perhaps the HA tag isn't even fully expressed.

So why is there a stop codon in the middle? That's a problem. It could be that during cloning, a mutation introduced a stop codon. Alternatively, the HA tag's sequence might have had a stop codon.

Looking at the options, option A says the sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. A missense mutation changes an amino acid, but not necessarily causing a stop. But if the mutation introduced a stop codon, that would be a nonsense mutation. So A says the HA sequence has a missense, but that might not explain a premature stop.

Wait, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be due to a stop codon in the coding sequence, which is what we're seeing. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but another option is C: the lack of a linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain. That would involve the protein being produced but then degraded. But the issue here is that the construct isn't overexpressing the protein, which suggests it's not being made correctly.

Option D: the tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. But UAA is a stop codon, and all stop codons are read by the release factors, not tRNAs. So D is incorrect.

So the possible options are A, B, or C.

A is a missense in HA, which wouldn't cause a premature stop unless it's a nonsense mutation. But the question says the HA determinant's sequence is introduced. If the HA sequence includes a stop codon, that would cause the problem. Alternatively, the HA was incorrectly added, introducing a stop.

But looking at the given construct's sequence, the stop codon is present in the coding region, which suggests that the construct has a TGA in the middle. This would cause the ribosome to terminate early, so option B would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag sequence was not correctly cloned, leading to a frame shift, but the given sequence doesn't show any frame shift; the stop is in frame.

Therefore, the problem is that there's a premature stop codon, causing early termination. So the answer is B: the ribosome terminated the translation early.


The question involves a researcher attempting to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The researcher introduced a coding sequence for GADD45G with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus but was unable to overexpress the protein. The issue lies in the construct's coding sequence, which was provided for analysis.

Key observations and reasoning:

1. **Construct Sequence Analysis**: The plus strand of the construct was analyzed for in-frame stop codons. The sequence ends with the triplet `TGA`, which is a stop codon. This stop codon appears in the middle of the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely.

2. **Impact of Premature Stop Codon**: The premature stop codon prevents the full-length protein from being synthesized. This explains why the protein is not being overexpressed as expected. The HA tag, intended to be at the N-terminus, would also be truncated or absent, making it undetectable with HA-specific antibodies.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA sequence would alter an amino acid but would not necessarily introduce a premature stop codon. This does not fully explain the lack of protein expression.
   - **Option B**: The presence of a premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early. This aligns with the observed issue of failed protein overexpression.
   - **Option C**: Proteolysis due to the lack of a linker sequence would degrade the nascent protein after synthesis. However, the issue here is that the protein is not being synthesized at all, making this option unlikely.
   - **Option D**: tRNA for the `UAA` codon does not exist in the mouse, but `TGA` is the stop codon in question, and stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. This option is irrelevant.

4. **Conclusion**: The premature stop codon in the coding sequence is the primary cause of the issue, leading to early termination of translation and failure to express the full-length protein.

Answer: B
