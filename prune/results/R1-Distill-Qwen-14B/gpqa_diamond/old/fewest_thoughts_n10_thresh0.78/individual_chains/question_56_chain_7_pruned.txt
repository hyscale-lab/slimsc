Okay, so I've got this question about hydrogen atom transitions, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state in the hydrogen atom. It decays to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and probabilities. I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. Dipole transitions are the most common, right? So the selection rules for dipole transitions are important here.

From what I recall, the selection rules for the quantum numbers are:
- Δn = 0, ±1 (but n can't be zero)
- Δl = ±1
- Δm = 0, ±1 (and for Δm=0, l must change by ±1; when Δm=±1, l must change by ±1 as well)

Wait, actually, more precisely, for dipole transitions:
- Δn can be ±1 (though sometimes, for higher transitions, maybe others are allowed in some cases, but the standard is ±1)
But wait, sometimes the question might allow other changes, but I think in this case, since it's two transitions, let's think step by step.

The starting state is n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0.

It needs to decay to n=1, l=0, m=0. So that's a transition from n=3 to n=1. But since dipole transitions only allow Δn = ±1 each step, the electron can't drop from 3 to 1 in one step. So it must go through an intermediate state.

So the first transition is from n=3 to n=2 (since Δn= -1 is allowed). Then the second transition is from n=2 to n=1 (Δn= -1 again).

Now, what about the l and m changes?

In the first transition, l starts at 0 (s orbital). The selection rule for l is Δl = ±1, but since l was 0, the only possibility is l
