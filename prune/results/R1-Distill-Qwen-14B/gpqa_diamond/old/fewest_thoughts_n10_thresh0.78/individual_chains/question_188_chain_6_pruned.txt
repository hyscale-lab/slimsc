Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral structure is a type of crystal system where all the edges are of equal length, but the angles between them aren't necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, a, a, and the angles α, β, γ are all equal. So in this case, they're each 30 degrees. 

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the interplanar distance, d_hkl, is calculated using the formula from the Bragg's law, which involves the reciprocal of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Wait, the formula is d = a/(√(h² + k² + l² + ... )) but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression when the crystal isn't cubic. Oh wait, no, that's for the simple cubic system. For a general crystal system, especially with non-orthogonal axes, maybe I need to use the more general formula involving the unit cell parameters and the angles.

I recall there's a general formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters. So the formula is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - (2hk cos α)/(a b) - (2hl cos β)/(a c) - (2kl cos γ)/(b c) ) )

Wait, but in this case, the crystal is rhombohedral, which means a = b = c, and all angles α, β, γ are equal. So substituting a = b = c = a, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So the formula simplifies. Let's plug in h, k, l as 1,1,1 for the (111) plane.

So, the denominator becomes sqrt( (1²)/(a²) + (1²)/(a²) + (1²)/(a²) - 2*(1*1) * cos(30°)/(a²) - 2*(1*1)*cos(30°)/(a²) - 2*(1*1)*cos(30°)/(a²) )

Wait, wait a second. Let me make sure. The general formula is:

d^2 = 1/( (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - (2hk cos α)/(a b) - (2hl cos β)/(a c) - (2kl cos γ)/(b c) )

But since a = b = c = a, and α = β = γ = 30°, let's substitute.

So each term becomes:

h²/(a²) = 1/(a²), same for k and l. Since h=k=l=1, each term is 1/a².

So the sum of the first three terms is 3*(1/a²) = 3/(a²).

Now the next terms: each cross term is (2hk cos θ)/(a²), since a = b = c.

Wait, let me think. For the cross terms, the general formula has (2hk cos α)/(a b). But since a = b = a, that becomes 2hk cos α / a².

But in this case, h=k=1, so 2*1*1 * cos(30°) / a².

Same for the other cross terms. Let me see: for the term (2hl cos β)/(a c), since c = a, it's also 2*1*1 * cos(30°)/a².

Same for (2kl cos γ)/(b c) which becomes 2*1*1 * cos(30°)/a².

So each of the three cross terms is 2 cos(30°) / a². And since there are three such terms, their sum is 3 * 2 cos(30°)/a² = 6 cos(30°)/a².

Putting it all together:

d² = 1 / [ (3/a²) - (6 cos 30° / a²) ]

Factor out 1/a² from the denominator:

d² = 1 / [ (3 - 6 cos 30°) / a² ) ] 

Which simplifies to (a²) / (3 - 6 cos 30° )

So d = a / sqrt(3 - 6 cos 30° )

Wait, let me compute this.

First, cos 30° is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 3 - 6*(√3/2) = 3 - 3√3.

√3 is approximately 1.732. So 3√3 ≈ 5.196.

So 3 - 5.196 ≈ -2.196. Wait, that can't be right because the denominator can't be negative. Oh wait, did I make a mistake in the signs?

Wait, looking back at the formula, the denominator is (h²/a² + ... - ... ). So in the formula, the terms are positive first, then subtracted by the cross terms. So in the way I substituted, the denominator is (3/a²) - (6 cos30°/a²) = [3 -6 cos30°]/a²

So 3 -6*(√3/2) = 3 -3√3 ≈ 3 -5.196 = -2.196. That would give a negative value under the square root, which doesn't make sense. Hmm. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the signs. Let me think again.

The general formula for d^2 is:

d^2 = 1/[ (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2hk cos α/(a b) - 2hl cos β/(a c) - 2kl cos γ/(b c) ) ]

But in the case where α, β, γ are the angles between the edges, maybe I should have cosines of the angles, but for a rhombohedral structure, the angles between the axes are 30 degrees each. Wait, but for the Miller indices, when the structure is rhombohedral, is it the same as a cubic system but with the angles being different?

Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the reciprocal of the metric tensor. Let me think about the metric tensor approach.
