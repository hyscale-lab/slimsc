Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, you have to use special relativity equations. Let me think about what the question is asking.

The problem says two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, relative speed. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, if one object is moving at u and another at v, the relative speed isn't just u-v. I remember something about the formula from special relativity. Oh yeah, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Right, but wait which one is moving faster. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the second astronaut, the first is approaching at what speed?

Wait, wait, actually, the relative speed depends on the frame of reference. Since both are moving in the same direction, I think the formula would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. Let me plug those in.

Calculating numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c. Oh wait, that's about 0.14c when rounded. So the relative speed is 0.14c. That matches options C and D.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1
