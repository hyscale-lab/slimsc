Okay, so I have this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. So, the question is about an astronaut from an alien civilization traveling to Earth at a very high speed, almost the speed of light. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to remember what I know.

The problem states that the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is a huge fraction. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes from their perspective. Wait, so this is about proper time, right? The astronaut's own experienced time.

I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Time moves slower for the moving object from the perspective of a stationary observer. But wait, in this case, we're looking at the astronaut's own time, which is the proper time. So, I think we need to use the time dilation formula from special relativity.

The formula for time dilation is the proper time (tau) equals the coordinate time (t) multiplied by the square root of (1 - v squared over c squared). But wait, wait. No, the formula is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Alternatively, t is the time measured in the stationary frame, and tau is the moving frame's time.

Wait, but in this scenario, the Earth is our destination, and the spaceship is moving at a high velocity. So, perhaps the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is needed, but the problem doesn't give any distance. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh, wait, the question is from the astronaut's perspective, so perhaps we should calculate the distance they travel, but considering their own experienced time.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the time experienced by the astronaut to reach Earth. So, from the astronaut's frame, they are stationary, and Earth is approaching them at 0.99999987*c. So, the distance would be contracted in their frame. But wait, how do we compute that?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the shortest time measured in the spaceship's frame. So, the proper time tau is the time experienced by the astronaut.

Wait, but to compute that, I need to know the distance to Earth as measured in the spaceship's frame. Hmm.
