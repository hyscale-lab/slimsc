Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

Wait, Pauli matrices. Oh right, each σ has components σx, σy, σz. So when you take the dot product with n, it's like a vector of matrices multiplied by the components of n. But actually, the exact direction of n doesn't matter because it's a unit vector, right? So maybe the eigenvalues don't depend on the direction of n.

Oh wait, I remember that for any Pauli matrix, say σ·n, the eigenvalues are plus and minus 1. Because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have determinant -1. The eigenvalues of σ·n would be ±1 because the trace is zero and the determinant is -1. Let me double-check that. The trace is n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. Each Pauli matrix has trace zero, so the trace of σ·n is zero, meaning the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The product of eigenvalues is determinant, which for σ·n is (1)(-1) = -1. So the eigenvalues must be +1 and -1.

So the Hamiltonian is ε times σ·n. So the eigenvalues would be ε times the eigenvalues of σ·n. That is, ε*(+1) and ε*(-1). So eigenvalues are ε and -ε. Looking at the options, option B is +ε, -ε. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thought. Wait, sometimes in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices are multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, no. The Pauli matrices σ are 2x2 matrices with entries like [[0,1],[1,0]] etc. But in the Hamiltonian, if it's written as H = ε σ · n, I think ε would have to have units of energy. So the σ·n term is dimensionless because n is a unit vector, so σ·n has eigenvalues ±1, and thus H has eigenvalues ±ε.

Wait, but wait a moment. Could ε be in units that require the eigenvalues to be scaled? Like, sometimes spin terms are ε times something with ħ. Let me think. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but in some contexts, spin operators are (σ · n) multiplied by ħ/2. For example, the spin angular momentum is (ħ/2) σ · n. So in that case, the eigenvalues would be ± ħ/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ ·n, so the eigenvalues are ε times ±1, so ±ε.

Looking at the options, option B says +ε, -ε. So that's the answer. Option C has ε multiplied by ħ/2, which would be the case if H were (ε/2) times σ·n, but that's not what's given here.

Wait, another way to approach: let's compute the eigenvalues. The matrix H is ε times a unit vector dotted into
