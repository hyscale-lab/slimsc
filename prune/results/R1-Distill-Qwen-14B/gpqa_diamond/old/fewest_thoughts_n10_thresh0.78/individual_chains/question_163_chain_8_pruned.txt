Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this. Also, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble hydroxide. So, to dissolve it, we probably need an acid to react with it. Oh right, because the hydroxide will react with a strong acid to form a salt and water. So the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with HCl (a strong acid) to produce FeCl3 and water.

The reaction equation should be: Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. Wait, wait, no. Let me write it correctly. Monobasic acid means it can donate one H+ ion. So for Fe(OH)3, which is a trihydroxide, the reaction would be 1 mole of acid reacting with 1 mole of Fe(OH)3. No, wait, no. Wait, Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups. So, to neutralize each OH-, you'd need an H+ from the acid. So for each Fe(OH)3, you need 3 H+ ions. So the acid must supply 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3.

So, the balanced equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. Yes, that makes sense because each HCl provides one H+.

So, first, I need to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are in 0.1 grams. The formula mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(16 +1) = 55.85 + 3*17=55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol (exactly 0.0936 mmol, since 0.1/106.85 is approx 0.00093597).

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 0.1 / 106.85 = approximately 0.00093597 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl (as per the reaction), the moles of HCl needed would be 3 * 0.0009359
