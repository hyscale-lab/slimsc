Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction. Hmm, let me think. The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is falling vertically on this aperture. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. Oh, and we can use the small angle approximation where tan(theta) is approximately theta.

Wait, I remember that when the number of sides N becomes very large, the polygon approaches a circle. So the aperture is almost circular. But wait, the apothem is the same for all sides. Apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' relates to the radius of the circumscribed circle, which is the distance from the center to a vertex. The formula for apothem is a = R * cos(π/N), but when N is large, N approaches infinity, so π/N is very small. So cos(π/N) is approximately 1 for large N. That suggests that the apothem a is approximately equal to the radius R of the circumscribed circle. So as N becomes very large, the polygon becomes a circle with radius R = a.

Wait, but does that make sense? Let me think. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So the inscribed circle has radius a. The circumscribed circle (radius R) is larger. Wait, no—wait, correction. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumscribed circle's radius is larger. So for a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to R by a = R * cos(π/N). So when N approaches infinity, π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) approaches 1. Therefore, R ≈ a, since a = R * cos(π/N). So the polygon's inscribed circle has radius a, and the circumscribed circle has radius R which for large N is almost a. But when you have a very large N, the polygon is very close to a circle, so the far field diffraction pattern would resemble that of a circular aperture.

Wait, but wait. Circular apertures have their own diffraction patterns, the Airy disk. The minima in the Airy disk occur
