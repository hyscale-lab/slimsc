Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some processes happening in the immune system. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the scenario is that they've tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and given them to mice orally. Then they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some tangled in mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability. The question is about which process is happening.

Wait, so what do I know about these processes? Let's think about the options.

Option A: Somatic hypermutation. I remember that this is a process where B cells undergo mutation in their variable regions after antigen stimulation. This increases diversity and affinity. It happens in the germinal centers during the immune response.

Option B: Complement activation. That's part of the innate immune response, right? Complement proteins help in opsonizing pathogens or causing lysis. But I don't see how this directly relates to the variability in heavy chain genes.

Option C: Class switching recombination. This is when the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) changes. It involves switching the heavy chain isotype but doesn't change the variable regions. So the variable regions' diversity isn't affected here.

Option D: VDJ recombination. That's the process during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region of the heavy chain. This happens during the maturation of B cells and is part of the initial diversification.

Wait, but the question says that after the mice were given the GFP-tagged proteins, they observed that some were destroyed by stomach acid and others in mucus. Then they found the fluorescent Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Peyer patches are a site where antigens are sampled and immune responses are initiated.

The GFP-tagged proteins probably didn't get into the systemic circulation much because some were destroyed. But those that reached the Peyer patches would be taken up by antigen-presenting cells, maybe M cells or dendritic cells. Then these antigens would be presented to B cells, leading to their activation and proliferation.

So the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene after sequencing suggests that the B cells are diversifying their receptors. But when does that happen? Somatic hypermutation occurs after the initial VDJ recombination, in the germinal centers. So during the immune response, especially in secondary lymphoid organs like the Peyer patches (which are a type of secondary lymphoid tissue), the B cells undergo hypermutation to increase diversity.

Wait, but VDJ recombination is during the early stages of B cell development, in the bone marrow. So after that, when an antigen is encountered, the B cells go to the lymphoid tissues and undergo further diversification through somatic hypermutation. So in this case, since the GFP is part of the rotavirus capsid, which is a protein antigen, the immune response is likely generating a diverse set of B cells specific to that antigen.

So the high variability in the variable regions suggests that these B cells have undergone somatic hypermutation, which is process A. Because that's when the variable regions are further diversified to create a more specific and stronger immune response.

Wait, but another thought: when you have a new antigen, the initial recognition is via B cells with pre-existing receptors. Then, in the germinal centers, they undergo hypermutation to increase the affinity. So the high variability would be due to this process. So the process happening here is somatic hypermutation.

So the correct answer would be A) somatic hypermutation.


The question involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice. Some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, while others reached the Peyer patches, where they were isolated and sequenced for variable heavy chain genes. The observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that increases diversity in B cell receptors.

- **Option A: Somatic hypermutation**  
  This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, where B cells undergo mutations in their variable regions to increase diversity and affinity. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes after antigen stimulation.

- **Option B: Complement activation**  
  This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly relate to the variability in heavy chain genes. It is not relevant to the described scenario.

- **Option C: Class switching recombination**  
  This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the heavy chain. Therefore, it does not explain the observed variability.

- **Option D: VDJ recombination**  
  This process occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region of the heavy chain. However, this initial diversification occurs before antigen exposure and is not relevant to the observed variability after antigen stimulation.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid tissues like the Peyer patches after antigen stimulation. This process diversifies and refines B cell receptors during the immune response.

Answer: A
