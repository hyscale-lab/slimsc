Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator. I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the standard deviation formula, which involves the expectation values of the operator and its square.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. But the state is given as a column vector. Oh, right, the state is already provided. So I don't need to find it; I just need to compute the uncertainty in P_z.

First, I should probably write down the given matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z. Let me jot them down.

P_x matrix:
First row: 0, ħ/√2, 0
Second row: ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2
Third row: 0, ħ/√2, 0

P_y matrix:
First row: 0, -iħ/√2, 0
Second row: iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2
Third row: 0, iħ/√2, 0

P_z matrix:
First row: ħ, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -ħ

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the eigenstates of P_z are the basis here. That means the state we have is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis.

The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me check if this vector is normalized. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.

Calculating: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4, (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 +1/4 = (1 + 2 +1)/4 =4/4=1. Yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, the uncertainty in P_z is ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). Since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, but the operator P_z is in the same basis as the state. Wait, wait. No, the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

Wait, no. I think the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z. Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so any state expressed in these basis vectors is in the P_z eigenbasis. So the state is |ψ> = a|↑> + b|→> + c|↓>, where |↑>, |→>, |↓> are the eigenstates of P_z with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ, respectively.

Wait, but the given state is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So the components correspond to the eigenstates of P_z, which are in the basis |1> = (1,0,0), |2>=(0,1,0), |3>=(0,0,1). So the state is ψ = -1/2 |1> + (1/√2) |2> -1/2 |3>.

But P_z in this basis is diagonal. So when we compute <P_z>, it's just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities, right?

Wait, no, wait. Because the state is already in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value <P_z> is simply the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, where the weights are the probabilities.

So, each component of the state gives the amplitude for each eigenstate of P_z. The eigenvalues for |1>, |2>, |3> are ħ, 0, and -ħ, respectively.

So, the expectation value <P_z> is |a|^2 * ħ + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

Given that a is -1/2, |a|^2 is 1/4. b is 1/√2, |b|^2 is 1/2. c is -1/2, |c|^2 is 1/4.

So <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0.

Wait, that's zero? So the expectation of P_z is zero.

Now, the expectation of P_z squared is <P_z²>. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z squared is also diagonal with eigenvalues squared. So P_z² for each basis state is (ħ)^2, 0, and ( -ħ )^2 = ħ².

So, <P_z²> is |a|^2 (ħ²) + |b|^2 (0) + |c|^2 (ħ²) = (1/4) ħ² + (1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So, ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty is ħ divided by square root of 2. Looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2.

Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in assuming that the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z. Because the problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So yes, the state is expressed in that basis, so yes, the expectation values are as I computed.

So the answer is option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ in the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state is given as the column vector $|\psi\rangle = (-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, so the state is expressed in the $P_z$ eigenbasis. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the basis states $|1\rangle = (1, 0, 0)$, $|2\rangle = (0, 1, 0)$, and $|3\rangle = (0, 0, 1)$, respectively.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is the weighted sum of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, where the weights are the probabilities $|c_i|^2$ of the state components:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -1/2$, $b = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c = -1/2$. The probabilities are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal in the $P_z$ eigenbasis, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
