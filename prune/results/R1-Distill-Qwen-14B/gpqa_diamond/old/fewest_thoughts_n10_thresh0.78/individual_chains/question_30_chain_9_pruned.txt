Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Wait, right, the energy of the emitted light is related to the energy gap of the molecule. 

The question says the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. I think the energy of the absorbed photon has to be higher than the emitted one. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state, and then it emits a photon when it returns to a lower state. So the energy of the absorbed light should be higher than the emitted energy.

Let me recall the formula. Oh right, energy (E) is related to wavelength (λ) by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. But I might need to find the wavelength of the emitted light first.

Wait, but the question is about the absorbed light, not the emitted. So maybe I should find the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. Or wait, the emitted photon's energy is the difference between the two states. So if the molecule emits 2.3393 eV, that's the energy gap.

Wait, no. Let me think. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy state (ground) to a higher energy state (excited). Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon with energy equal to the energy difference between these two states. So the energy of the emitted photon is E = E_absorbed - E_other? Wait no, the absorbed photon's
