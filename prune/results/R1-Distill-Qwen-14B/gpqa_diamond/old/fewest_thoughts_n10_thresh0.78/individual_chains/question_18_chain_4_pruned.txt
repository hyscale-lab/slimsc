Okay, so I need to solve this question about the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars based on their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's start by understanding what's given.

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I'm not sure if the mass matters here. The problem is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant unless it's about something like stellar evolution, but the question says to use the EW method under LTE, so I'll focus on the abundances.

The given data are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, ratio [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2]?

Wait, no. The question says "the ratio of silicon atoms", so that would be (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2). Oh, wait no, the problem says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that's Star_1's silicon divided by Star_2's silicon.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be the ratio of their photospheric abundances. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the given data.

We have [X/Y] notation, which is log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0. That means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun's. So log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) â†’ n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Same for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun.

Now, the other abundances: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) = 0.3.

And [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. So [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) = 0.3.

Wait, but I'm trying to find n_Si1 / n_Si2.

Hmm, perhaps I can express n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of n_Fe and n_Mg, and then relate
