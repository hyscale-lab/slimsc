Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question involves two reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B from each, then match them with the options given.

First, let me look at each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + THF, KH, H+ → A.

Hmm, what's the structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol? A spiro compound has two rings connected by a single atom. So, it's a spiro structure with a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring, right? The substituents are a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) and an alcohol (OH) on the same carbon, which is the bridgehead.

The reaction conditions are THF (tetrahydrofuran, a solvent), KH (which is potassium hydride, a strong base), and then H+ (probably an acid workup). So, I'm thinking this is an elimination reaction. Potassium hydride is a strong base, so it would deprotonate and lead to an E2 or E1 mechanism.

Wait, the starting material is an alcohol with a neighboring double bond. So, maybe it's a situation where an elimination occurs, forming a ring. The spiro structure might undergo some kind of cyclization. Alternatively, since there's a vinyl group, perhaps a conjugate addition or some cyclic transition state.

Wait, another thought: sometimes when you have an alcohol adjacent to a double bond, especially in a strained ring, elimination can lead to ring formation. If the alcohol is on a bridgehead, maybe it's a possibility of forming a larger ring through elimination.

In spiro compounds, when a base abstracts a proton that's beta to both the hydroxyl and the double bond, elimination could occur, forming a new ring. So the OH is on the bridgehead, and the double bond is in the 5-position. The base (KH) would deprotonate a hydrogen that's adjacent to the OH and the double bond, leading to the formation of a new double bond and a ring expansion.

Wait, the starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the spiro is a 3-membered and a 5-membered ring. The vinyl group is on the bridgehead. So, the structure would be like a bridge with the vinyl group attached. When the base abstracts a proton, perhaps from the adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a new double bond and ring expansion.

Alternatively, since the starting molecule has a double bond, the elimination could form a new ring, possibly leading to a bicyclic structure. The product A is listed with options as either a bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one or a benzo[7]annulene derivative. Benzoannulenes are large ring compounds, like 10-membered rings, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the first product option A in options A and D is (E)-bicyclo[5.
