Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O), giving 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing A and B reagents.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think this through. Let's tackle the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, I remember that it's usually a nucleophilic addition. But wait, under what conditions does that happen?

NaCN is a source of CN- ions, right? So in a ketone, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Or wait, no: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, actually, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. But 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2CN)C(OH)(CH3)2? Wait, but butanenitrile itself is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product here, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, might have the CN group on the second carbon, with a hydroxyl and methyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. So when the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, the product after protonation would become (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, butan-2-one has four carbons with the
