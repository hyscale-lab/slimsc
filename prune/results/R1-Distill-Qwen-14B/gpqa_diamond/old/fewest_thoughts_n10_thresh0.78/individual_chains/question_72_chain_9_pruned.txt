Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because reaction mechanisms can get pretty tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and ending up with product 4. We need to find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

First, let's break down each reaction step.

Step 1: The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. It's reacting with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1.

Hmm, what does this reaction look like? Sodium iodide is a nucleophile, and dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups. Maybe it's an elimination or substitution reaction. Wait, I think this could be a Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, no, the diene and dienophile are reacting. Looking at the starting material, the bicyclo structure is a diene (hepta-2,5-diene), so maybe it's acting as the dienophile? Or wait, the other compound has 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a diene with two dibromomethyl groups on carbons 5 and 6.

Wait, Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene and a dienophile. So perhaps the bicyclo compound is the dienophile. Let me think: the starting material is a bicyclo with two double bonds? Wait, no, it's bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So that's a norbornene structure, right? Norbornene has two double bonds? No, wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene has one bridge, but the starting material has two double bonds: 2 and 5. So the molecule has two double bonds in a bicyclic structure.

Wait, but 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a cyclohexene with two double bonds (since 1,3-diene) and two substituents (dibromomethyl groups) at 5 and 6 positions.

Wait, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction between the norbornene (dienophile) and the cyclohexadiene (dienophile)? Wait, no, Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile. The norbornene has a double bond, perhaps acting as a dienophile. Wait, but wait, our starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So maybe the starting material is a diene, and the other compound is the dienophile?

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. The starting material has the structure bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So that's two double bonds? No, wait, no. Wait, hepta-2,5-diene would imply two double bonds, but in a bicyclo structure, that's not possible. Because bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has one bridged structure. Wait, perhaps it's a monoene, but with substituents. Or maybe I'm misremembering. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the structure.

Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene would have double bonds at positions 2 and 5, but that would mean there are two double bonds in a ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated diene in the bicyclo structure. Hmm, but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a monoene, and the
