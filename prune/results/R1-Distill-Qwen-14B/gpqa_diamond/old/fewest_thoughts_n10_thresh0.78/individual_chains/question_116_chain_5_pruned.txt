Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow and think through each part carefully.

So, the problem starts with Compound A. The proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet (which is two neighboring protons) and a quartet (which is three neighboring protons) might suggest some structure with adjacent CH2 or CH3 groups.

Looking at the integration: 6H and 4H. Six hydrogens could be two CH3 groups, and four hydrogens could be a CH2CH2 maybe? Or perhaps a CH2CH2CH2? Wait, 4H could be two CH2 groups, each with 2H. So maybe it's a structure where there are two CH3 groups attached to a CH2CH2 group.

Wait, another thought: I remember that in diethyl ether, the CH2CH3 groups give certain splitting. Let me think. Diethyl ether has two CH2CH3 groups connected by an oxygen. The protons next to the oxygen would be split by the adjacent CH2. So for diethyl ether, the CH3 groups are typically around 1.2 ppm as a triplet (since they're next to a CH2), and the CH2 next to O would be a quartet around 3.4 ppm. But wait, the quartet here is at 1.3 ppm, which is lower than that.

Wait, maybe it's something else. Maybe it's a cyclopropane structure? No, cyclopropane protons are typically around 0.5-1.5 ppm, but maybe. Alternatively, perhaps it's a neopentyl group, but that might have more complexity.

Wait another angle: The triplet (0.9 ppm, 6H) suggests two equivalent CH3 groups, each with three H, and each being split into a triplet
