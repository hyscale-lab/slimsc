Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, okay, so first, let's break down the given information.

Initial nucleus: mass M, rest energy 300 GeV. Since rest energy E = mc², then M must be E/c², which is 300 GeV/c². But maybe I don't need the actual mass in kg or anything. Let's see.

After fission, two fragments: one is twice as massive as the other. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2. So m1 = 2 * m2. Also, the sum m1 + m2 = 0.99M because it's 99% of the initial mass.

Wait, so substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum:

2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M => m2 = (0.99 M) / 3.

So m2 = 0.33 M, and m1 = 0.66 M.

Wait, but M is the initial mass. So the initial rest mass is 300 GeV/c², so m1 is 0.66 * 300 GeV/c²? Hmm, but maybe we don't need to compute that exactly yet.

Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their velocities must be inversely proportional to their masses.

In the non-relativistic case, we can use the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy. But wait, the problem is comparing the correct T1 (which I think is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) with the non-relativistic approximation. So I probably need to calculate

Okay, I'm trying to tackle this physics problem. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about atomic nuclei fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Hmm, atomic fission, so splitting a nucleus into two parts. I remember that in fission, a heavy nucleus like uranium splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a lot of energy.

The nucleus is initially at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is given as 300 GeV. Wait, 300 GeV is a huge amount of energy. But when it fissions, it splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. Oh, right, the more massive one has a rest mass twice the other.

Wait, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. So the initial mass M is 300 GeV/c²? But wait, the rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. Oh, right, in units where c=1, it's 300 GeV, but when dealing with mass, it's M = 300 GeV/c². But perhaps for calculations, we can treat energy and mass as related by E=Mc².

So the total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M. So the sum of the masses of the two fragments is 0.99 M. And the more massive fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let me denote the less massive fragment as m, so the other is 2m. So m + 2m =0.99 M => 3m =0.99 M => m=0.33 M. So the two fragments have masses 0.33 M and 0.66 M. Wait, because 0.33 + 0.66 is 0.99 M.

Wait, but the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero, because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

So their kinetic energies plus their rest mass energies should account for the total energy. Before fission, the nucleus had energy M c², which is 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum
