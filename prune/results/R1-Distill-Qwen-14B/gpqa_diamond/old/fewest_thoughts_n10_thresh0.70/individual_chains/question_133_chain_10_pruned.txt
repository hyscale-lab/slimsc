Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's see what I can remember.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. Oh wait, I remember that 1 cm³ is a milliliter, so that's 200 mL, which is 0.2 liters. Right, because molarity is moles per liter.

In the solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, in this solution. Oh wait, orthophosphate is the conjugate base, so I think that comes into play with the phosphate buffer system.

First, I think I need to calculate the moles of each compound. Let's start with KH2PO4. Its molecular weight (Mw) is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / Mw. So 1.00 g divided by 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. Let me do that: 1 / 136.09 is approximately 0.007344 moles? Wait, let me do the exact calculation. 136.09 grams is one mole, so 1 gram is 1/136.09 ≈ 0.007344 moles.

Next is Na2HPO4·2H2O. Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 / 177.99 is approximately 0.005613 moles. Wait, because 177.99 is approximately 178, so 1/178 is about 0.005618. So roughly 0.005613 moles.

Now, what do these compounds dissociate into? KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it should dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and one HPO4^2- ion. So each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-. So how do H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- relate to PO4^3-?

I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The different species are H3PO4 (triprotic), H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (orthophosphate).

The H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-. The given Ka values are for H3PO4:

Ka1 = 7.5e-3 (for H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-)
Ka2 = 6.2e-8 (for H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-)
Ka3 = 1.8e-12 (for HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-)

Wait, but in solution, the phosphate species will depend on the pH. Since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, it's probably acting as a buffer. But since the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-, I need to find how much of H
