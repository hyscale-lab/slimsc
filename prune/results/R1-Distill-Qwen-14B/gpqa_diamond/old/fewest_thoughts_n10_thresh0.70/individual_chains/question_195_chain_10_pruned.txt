Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about two planets orbiting a star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2 around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. Now, the second planet has a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We need to find the maximum orbital period of this second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur. Both planets share the same orbital plane, and their orbits are circular.

Hmm, so I remember that for a planet to transit its star from our point of view, it must pass directly in front of the star from our line of sight. The transit impact parameter is the distance (in units of the star's radius) from the center of the star that the planet's path comes closest. So if the impact parameter is 0, it's a central transit; if it's larger, it's a grazing transit.

But wait, what about occultation? That's when the planet passes behind the star from our perspective. For that to happen, the planet must be further away from the star than the star's radius, right? Because the planet has to be behind the star for us to see it disappear. Or wait, no, because the planet's orbit is much larger than the star's radius, but relative to the star's size. So, for occultation to happen, the planet's orbital distance must be such that when it's behind the star, the planet is within the star's disk. Or perhaps more accurately, the planet must be in a position where, from our viewpoint, it's blocked by the star.

Wait, no. Occultation occurs when the planet moves behind the star, so the star is between us and the planet. For this to happen, the planet must be orbiting the star at a distance where, during its orbit, it can be directly behind the star. So, the orbital distance of the planet must be larger than the star's radius, considering that the star is much larger than the planet.

But in this problem, the planet's size is given, but perhaps the key is the relative orbital distances. Because both planets are in the same orbital plane, their transits and occultations are aligned in some way.

Wait, the problem is about the maximum orbital period of the second planet. So what determines whether both transit and occultation are possible?

I think it's about the relative positions of their orbits. For the second planet to sometimes transit in front of the star (from our view) and sometimes be occulted behind the star, the two planets must be in such a configuration that their orbital distances allow this.

Wait, but each planet's transit and occultation are events that depend on their orbital distances relative to the star, as well as their orbital periods. Hmm, perhaps it's about the Hill sphere or something related to orbital stability, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the transit occurs when the planet passes in front of the
