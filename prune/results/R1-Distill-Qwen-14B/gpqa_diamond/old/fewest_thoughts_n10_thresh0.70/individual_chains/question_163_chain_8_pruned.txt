Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. I remember that when a hydroxide reacts with an acid, they neutralize each other. 

Alright, the problem says that we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I need to find out how much 0.1 M strong monobasic acid is needed to dissolve it completely. Then, also find the pH of the resulting solution. 

First, I think I should find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The formula for moles is mass divided by molar mass. Fe has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol, and each OH- is 17.01 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(17.01). Let me calculate that. 

55.85 + 3*17.01 = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol. So moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1g / 106.88 g/mol. Let me compute that: 0.1 / 106.88 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Or 9.36 x 10^-4 moles.

Fe(OH)3 is a base, and when it reacts with a strong acid, like HCl, it should form Fe^3+ and water. The reaction equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:3. That means each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions from the acid.

So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles.

The acid provided is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter, so to find the volume, I can use moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). Rearranging, Volume = moles / Molarity.

So Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters. Converting to cm³ (since 1 L = 1000 cm³), that's 28.08 cm³. Wait, but the options have 28.05 cm³ as option C. Oh, maybe I should be more precise with the calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron is Fe^3+, so the hydroxide is OH^- each. So Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.845 g/mol, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So each OH is 17.008 g/mol. So 3*17.008 is 51.024. Adding Fe's 55.845 gives 55.845 +51.024= 106.869 g/mol. So 0.1g / 106.869 g/mol is approximately 0.0009358 moles. So that's about 9.358e-4 moles.

So H+ needed is 3 * 9.358e-4 = 0.0028074 mol. 

The acid is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.0028074 / 0.1 = 0.028074 L = 28.074 cm³. So approximately 28.07 cm³, which rounds to 28.07. Looking at the options, C is 28.05 cm³, which is close. Maybe a more precise calculation would get that.

Wait, perhaps I should do the exact calculation. Let me compute 0.028074 * 1000 exactly. 0.02
