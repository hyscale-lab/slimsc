Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the potentials in an electromagnetic field. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r at time t. The setup involves the charge's velocity v at an earlier time tr, which I think is the retarded time. 

I remember that when charges are moving, the potentials are not just static like in Coulomb's law. Instead, they involve the velocity of the charge because of the motion. So I'm thinking about retarded potentials here.

The scalar potential V for a moving charge. From what I recall, the scalar potential due to a charge in motion isn't just q/(4πε₀ r), because that's the static case. But with motion, there's a correction factor. Oh wait, wait, the static case is when the charge isn't moving, so V would be q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, I think there's a term involving the velocity. Or wait, maybe the scalar potential is actually static and the vector potential is what depends on the velocity. Hmm.

Wait, no. I think the scalar potential for a moving charge might still be similar, but perhaps with some relativistic correction. Or maybe the scalar potential depends on the velocity in a specific way due to the way the fields transform. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the options have different forms. Let me look at the options. Option A says V is q/(4πε₀ r) and A is (v squared over c squared) times V. Option B has V the same, and A proportional to v/(c squared) times V.

Option C and D have more complicated expressions with terms involving d and v. d is the vector from the field generation point (at time tr) to r. So d is the distance vector, and in the denominator, terms like d c minus d dot v. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh, right, the Liénard equations for the potentials involve terms like c(t - tr) minus d·v, where d is the distance vector. So the denominator might look like (c*(t - tr) - (r - r'))·v, but wait, for a moving charge, the potentials are given by integrals over the charge's past positions.

But wait, in the context of the problem, the potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time tr. So I think the expressions for V and A involve terms like (c*(t - tr) - (r - r')) · v. Let me think.

The scalar potential V(r,t) is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v/c²)(t - tr))] something. Wait, no, the denominator would involve c multiplied by the time difference minus the dot product of the position vector and v. Or maybe it's the other way around. Oh, right, the denominator is (d c - (d · v)), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the field point r. Wait, no, let's

Okay, so I've got this question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when a charge is moving, it generates both electric and magnetic fields. But wait, the question is specifically about the potentials, V and A. I think the potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations, right?

So, the setup is that there's a charge q moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a point r at time t. The vector d is the vector from where the field was generated at time tr (which is earlier) to the observation point r. Oh, and tr is the time when the field was generated, so the charge's velocity at that time is v.

I remember that the scalar potential V is typically associated with the electric field, and the vector potential A with the magnetic field. Also, I think the potentials are expressed using retarded times because the fields propagate at the speed of light, so the current or charge distribution at an earlier time affects the potential at a later time.

Wait, the scalar potential for a stationary charge is straightforward: V = q/(4πε0 r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated. Oh right, because the motion introduces a magnetic component as well. So the potentials shouldn't be the same as in the static case.

I think the general expressions involve a term that includes the velocity of the charge. Let me recall the Lienard's formulas or the retarded potential expressions.

Oh, right! For a moving charge, the scalar potential V involves the charge divided by the distance, but adjusted by factors involving the velocity, and the vector potential A is proportional to the velocity of the charge.

Wait, the scalar potential isn't just q/(4πε0 r) anymore because the charge is moving. So the denominator probably isn't just r anymore but something like (distance) minus (velocity dot product), scaled by the speed of light.

I remember that the scalar potential V can be written as (q/(4πε0)) * (γ)/(R - (β · R) c), where γ is the Lorentz factor and β is v/c. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, I think the denominator might involve (c * d - d · v) or something like that, where d is the vector
