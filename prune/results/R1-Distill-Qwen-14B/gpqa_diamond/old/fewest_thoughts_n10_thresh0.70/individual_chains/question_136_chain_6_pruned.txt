Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². So, the magnitude of the field is 1/r², and it's only in the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, I remember from my vector calculus class that there's something called the divergence theorem. Oh right! The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. The theorem states that the integral of ∇·f over a volume V is equal to the flux of f through the surface S enclosing that volume. So, ∫∫∫_V (∇·f) dV = ∫∫_S f · dA.

Wait, but in this problem, I don't immediately know the flux through the surface. Maybe I can compute the divergence first and then see what the integral gives me.

So, first, let's find the divergence of f. The field f(r) has only a radial component and depends only on r, the distance from the origin. In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field that's purely radial and depends only on r is given by a specific formula. I think the divergence in spherical coordinates for such a field (f_r) is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r). 

Wait, because the field is only radial, the other components (theta and phi) are zero. So the divergence simplifies to just the derivative term.

Given f(r) = 1/r², so f_r = 1/r². Let's compute the divergence:

∇·f = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ).

Let me compute that step by step. r² multiplied by 1/r² is r²*(1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero.

So ∇·f = (1/(r²)) * d/dr (1) ) = (1/r²)(0) = 0.

Wait a minute, so the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin? Because at the origin, the field might have a different behavior, but since our volume is a sphere of radius R around the origin, r isn't zero except exactly at the center. So inside the sphere, the divergence is zero.

But wait, does that mean the integral of the divergence over the volume is zero? Because if the integrand is zero everywhere inside, then the integral should be zero.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the divergence theorem again. If the divergence is zero everywhere except possibly at a point, then the volume integral would be equal to the flux through the surface. But if the divergence is zero, then the flux should also be zero, right? But wait, that's not correct because sometimes the divergence can be zero everywhere except a point, making the flux non-zero.

Wait, another
