Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ ⋅ n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So σ is made up of the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some direction. So the dot product would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. So H must be a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix σ_i are ±1. But in this case, H isn't just a single Pauli matrix but a combination of them in some direction.

Oh right, when you have a spin-½ system, the spin operator is often represented as S = (ħ/2) σ. So the eigenvalues of S would be ±ħ/2. But wait, in this Hamiltonian, it's ε times the Pauli vector in the direction n. So maybe the Hamiltonian is proportional to the spin component in the n direction.

I think the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices' components are ±1. So if you have H = ε σ ⋅ n, then the eigenvalues should be ±ε, because the eigenvalues of σ ⋅ n are ±1. Oh wait, wait. Because σ is a vector of matrices, and when you take the dot product with a unit vector n, you get a matrix whose eigenvalues are ±1, right? Because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have determinant -1, so their eigenvalues are +1 and -1 when multiplied by a unit vector.

So then, if H is ε times that, the eigenvalues would be ε times those, so ±ε. Let me double-check.

Wait, another way: The matrix σ ⋅ n is a Hermitian matrix because it's a sum of Hermitian matrices (Pauli matrices are Hermitian) scaled by real numbers (n components). So it's Hermitian, meaning its eigenvalues are real.

The trace of σ ⋅ n is zero, because each Pauli matrix has trace zero. So the sum would also have trace zero. The determinant of σ ⋅ n is determinant of (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ
