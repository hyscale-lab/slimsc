Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can get tricky. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is asking which sequence of reactions will lead to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different series of reagents.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking it down: ethan-1-one is acetone, which has a ketone group (C=O) at the end of a two-carbon chain. So the structure is (Ph group attached to the carbonyl carbon). The phenyl group is substituted with bromine at the 3-position and nitro at the 5-position. So the substituents are at the meta and para positions relative to each other? Wait, let me draw this out.

Benzene ring with substituents:
- At position 3: Br
- At position 5: NO2

Wait, numbering the ring: if the phenyl group is attached to the ketone (which is at position 1), then the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions. So the ketone is at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5. Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so when the substituents are at 3 and 5, are they adjacent or opposite? Hmm, I think 3 and 5 would be meta to each other, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So positions 1, 3, 5 are all meta to each other in a way. Wait, no. Let me think: position 1 is where the phenyl is attached. Then positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 go around. So, 1 is the point of attachment, then 3 is two carbons away from 1 (so meta), and 5 would be four carbons away from 1, which is also meta. Wait, but 3 and 5 are across from each other? No, 3 and 5 are adjacent. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, each carbon is next to two
