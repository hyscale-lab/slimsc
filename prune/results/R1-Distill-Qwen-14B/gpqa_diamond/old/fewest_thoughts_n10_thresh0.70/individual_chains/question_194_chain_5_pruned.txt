Okay, so I have this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [ S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3 ]. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). But wait, each state corresponds to a particular configuration of the spins S1, S2, S3. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. So I'll need to calculate E for each of these states and then sum up the corresponding exp(-β E) terms.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8 states. The system's energy depends on the products S_i S_j. Let's see, each term S_i S_j is 1 if the two spins are the same and -1 if they're different. Because when both are +1, their product is +1; same if both are -1. If one is +1 and the other -1, their product is -1.

The energy E is -J times the sum of these three terms. So E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me denote each term S_i S_j as either 1 or -1.

Wait, but when the spins are all aligned, say all +1 or all -1, each product S_i S_j would be 1. So for example, S1S2 =1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Then the sum is 3, and E = -J *3. That would be the lowest energy state, I think.

Alternatively, if two spins are aligned and one is opposite, maybe the sum would be different. Let me think: suppose S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So
