Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the problem says an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are one upper-right and one lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, so Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma for the electron is 4, and for the positron it's 2. Since they're moving towards each other, their velocities are opposite.

First, I should figure out the energy and momentum of each particle before the collision. Because in particle physics, energy and momentum must be conserved. So the total energy and momentum of the system before collision must equal those after.

Electron and positron have the same mass, right? The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV/c². So their rest energies are the same.

The electron's gamma is 4, so its energy is gamma * m * c². So 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV. Similarly, the positron's gamma is 2, so energy is 1.022 MeV.

Wait, but since the positron is moving to the left (from the right), its momentum direction is opposite. So the electron's momentum would be p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e in the positive x direction. The positron's momentum p_p would be gamma_p * m_e * v_p in the negative x direction (since it's moving left).

But wait, since they're moving towards each other, the electron is moving right (from left), positron left (from right). So their momenta in the same direction? No, wait: if the electron is moving along the positive x (right) direction, and the positron is moving along the negative x (left) direction, then their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, no. The problem says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left,
