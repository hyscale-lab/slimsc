Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem says that a supernova occurs, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galactic center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait. So, the Galaxy and the ejecta are each other's inertial frames. That suggests that they're moving at a constant velocity relative to each otherâ€”I think this is a scenario where special relativity applies because they're inertial frames. So we need to consider time dilation and maybe length contraction or something.

Let me break this down. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. Because they're inertial, we can use the Lorentz transformations to relate the two frames.

The problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. We need to find how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame during this period, and then calculate the distance the ejecta travels in that time.

Wait, no. Wait. Actually, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame would depend on the time measured in the Galaxy's frame. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, so the distance would be velocity multiplied by time as measured in the Galaxy's frame.

But the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame.

Ah, right, because time intervals can differ between frames due to time dilation. So the key is to find the time in the Galaxy frame that corresponds to 50 seconds in the ejecta frame.

But wait, which frame is moving relative to the other? The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards
