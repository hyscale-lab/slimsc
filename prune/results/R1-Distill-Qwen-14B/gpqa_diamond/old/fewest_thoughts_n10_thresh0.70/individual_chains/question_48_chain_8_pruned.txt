Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem goes like this: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to give product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to make product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (that's a mouthful!) to form product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are A) 6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, I think I should break this down step by step. Let me sketch each reaction and see what each product looks like.

First, cyclohexanone. That's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The structure is cyclohexane with a carbonyl group (O=) attached.

Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2). I remember that when ketones react with bromine, especially in a cyclic ketone like cyclohexanone, it's likely an enolate formation or perhaps a bromination via some mechanism. Wait, wait. Oh, wait! No, wait another thought. Cyclohexanone can undergo a bromination via the enol mechanism. So, the carbonyl oxygen would help form an enol, which then reacts with bromine. So, the product 1 would be 2-bromocyclohexanone. Or wait, maybe it's cyclohexyl bromide. Wait, noâ€”bromine adds in the presence of a base? Or is it an addition reaction?

Wait, another angle: Adding Br2 to a ketone. Oh, right, that's the haloform reaction? No, wait, the haloform reaction is when CH3CO is treated with X2 and a base, leading to CO2X and CHX3. But cyclohexanone doesn't have a CH3 group attached to the carbonyl, so that's probably not the case here.

Wait, maybe it's an addition reaction. The carbonyl group is electron-deficient, so
