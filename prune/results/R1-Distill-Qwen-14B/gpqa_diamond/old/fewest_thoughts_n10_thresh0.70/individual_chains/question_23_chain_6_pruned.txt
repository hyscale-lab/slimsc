Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about a reaction involving a specific compound and hydrogen bromide (HBr). I remember that HBr is a strong acid and a good electrophile, often used in various substitution and addition reactions.

The compound in question is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me draw its structure in my mind. So it's a benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether group is O connected to a butenyl chain. The butenyl is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Breaking that down: butenyl means four carbons, with a double bond. The numbering starts from the oxygen. So the structure is O attached to a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The butenyl is 3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if I number from the oxygen). Wait, no, the correct numbering for but-3-en-1-yl would be the double bond between carbons 2 and 3 of the four. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Also, there are two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, but the group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Butenyl means four carbons with a double bond. But-3-en-1-yl: the double bond starts on carbon 3. Wait, but butenyl has four carbons, so if the double bond is between 3 and 4, but that's not possible because butenyl is four carbons, so numbering would be 1,2,3,4. So 3-en-1-yl would be double bond between 3 and 4, but that's not possible because butenyl is four carbons, so the double bond can be between 1-2 or 2-3. Wait, maybe I should
