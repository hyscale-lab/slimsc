Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reaction mechanisms, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

Alright, the question is about reacting ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, after some time, they checked using TLC and found the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to figure out which products are formed from the options given.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. Let me visualize it: the benzene ring has an ether group (-O-) attached. The other end of the ether is a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. That means the chain is four carbons long, with a double bond starting at the 3rd position. So, on the first carbon (attached to the ether), there's a double bond to the second carbon, which is connected to two methyl groups. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, and the substituents are on the first carbon. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait. No, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond starting at position 3. Oh wait, no, but the double bond in but-3-en-1-yl would be between carbons 2 and 3, because the position is the starting point. Wait, the numbering can be a bit tricky.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is: the substituent is on carbon 1, and the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, but butene is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at 3? That can't be because but has only four carbons. So maybe it's CH2-CH2 double bond, but that's but-1-ene. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbering. Let me write it out.

The
