Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this enamine reaction problem. I've got some organic chemistry knowledge, but I'm a bit rusty, so I'll need to think it through carefully.

The question gives me a reaction: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium reacts with reagent A to form product B. I need to choose the correct reagents and identify what B is.

First, I remember that enamines are typically formed from secondary amines and carbonyl compounds. The process usually involves two steps: the formation of a Schiff base, followed by elimination to form the imine (enamine) under certain conditions.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is already an enamine. Hmm. So maybe the reaction is about the enamine acting in a nucleophilic substitution or something else.

Wait, the problem says that the reagent A is a sequence of steps. Let's look at the options for A.

Option A's reagents are: LDA, DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+. Alternatively, another option is just LDA followed by DME, CH3CH2I, and H3O+.

Wait, LDA is a strong base, a lithium diisopropylamide. DME is 1,2-dimethoxyethane, a solvent. CH3CH2I is ethyl iodide, often used for alkylation.

So maybe the enamine is undergoing some kind of alkylation or deprotonation.

Wait, the starting material is an enamine, which is a conjugated amine. Enamines are good nucleophiles. They can attack electrophilic centers, maybe in substitution reactions. But another possibility is that the enamine is undergoing some kind of alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is being treated under basic conditions to form a more substituted structure.

Wait, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Let me try to draw its structure. So, the ethanaminium part is CH2NHCH3, but with the pentan-2-ylidene group attached. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- but that's not right. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- but with a double bond. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is (CH2)2CHCH2CH2- but with a double bond starting at position 2. So maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2- but that's pent-2-enyl. Hmm.

Wait, the structure is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the ethanaminium is CH2NHCH3. The substituent is pentan-2-ylidene. So the full structure would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2) but with a double bond at position 2. Wait, actually, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-. So attached to the N is a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- (but with a double bond between C2 and C3?), wait no, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-?

Wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- but with the double bond starting at C2. Let me think: pentan-2-ylidene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, but that's a single bond. Oh wait, no, the ylidene implies a double bond. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond in position 2, so it's CH2=C-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that would be pent-2-enylidene.

Wait, maybe the structure is (CH2)2CHCH2CH2- but with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-configured.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an enamine which is part of a conjugated system.

So, the starting material is an enamine, and I'm adding reagent A to it. The possible reagents in the options involve LDA, DME, CH3CH2I, and then H3O+.

Hmm, LDA is a strong base, but when used in such reactions, perhaps it's deprotonating something to form an enolate or to perform alkylation.

Wait, in the case of enamine alkylation, you can use a strong base like LDA to deprotonate the enamine. But wait, enamine is a conjugated system, so maybe it has acidic protons.

Wait, the double bond in the enamine is conjugated to the N. So the alpha protons (next to the double bond) might be acidic. Deprotonating with a strong base like LDA would generate a stronger base, perhaps an enamine anion.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is being alkylated. So the enamine (a good nucleophile) attacks an alkylating agent, like ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I), but that would require some activation.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the enamine is being used in a Wittig-like reaction, but that's usually with aldehydes.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the products.

Option C says product B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. That would be 4-heptanone.

Option D's product is heptan-4-one as well.

Options A and B's products are pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Wait, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the structure would be CH2=C(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)2+?

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

N-methyl-N-(pent-2-enylidene)ethanaminium. So the enamine is CH2=CH-(CH2)3- attached to the N.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2 attached to N(CH3) with a positive charge.

Wait, perhaps the enamine is a conjugated system, which when treated with certain reagents, may undergo some reaction.

Now, let's think about the options.

Option C: A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product B is heptan-4-one.

So, let's see. The starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium.

If we treat it with LDA, which is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a proton from the enamine, generating a conjugate base. Then, when ethyl iodide is added, perhaps an alkylation occurs.

Wait, but enamine alkylation typically uses a base to deprotonate the alpha position, making it nucleophilic, which then attacks an alkyl halide.

Wait, but in the presence of LDA, which is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, perhaps it deprotonates the enamine at the alpha position, forming an enamine anion. Then, the enamine anion would attack the ethyl iodide, leading to alkylation. After that, perhaps the workup with H3O+ would protonate and release the product.

Wait, but what would the product be?

So, the starting enamine is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2 attached to N(CH3)2+. After alkylation, perhaps the ethyl group is added to the nitrogen? Or perhaps to the carbon chain?

Wait, another approach: the enamine could be acting as a nucleophile, attacking an alkylating agent. Suppose the enamine has a carbon that can be alkylated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents are leading to a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: the enamine is being used in a conjugate addition. The LDA would deprotonate the alpha position, making it a strong base, which then could attack a carbonyl.

Wait, but in this case, the enamine is the starting point. Let's think of the reaction steps.

Step 1: LDA (a strong base). It would deprotonate the enamine. The enamine has two alpha positions (the carbons adjacent to the double bond). Deprotonation would form an enamine anion.

Step 2: CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide) is added. The enamine anion would attack the ethyl iodide, resulting in alkylation. So the ethyl group would add to the carbon where the proton was abstracted.

Wait, but if the enamine is CH2=C-R, then deprotonation at the CH2 would give a carbanion adjacent to the double bond. Alkylation would add an ethyl group to that carbon.

Then, upon protonation (step 3 with H3O+), you would get a new enamine structure, longer chain perhaps.

Wait, but the enamine is part of a conjugated system. Let me think: the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the structure is:

N(CH3) attached to CH2-C=CH-(CH2)2CH3? Or is it CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2- attached to N(CH3) with a positive charge.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

The enamine is: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3, so it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps it's (E)-configured, so the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2- attached to N(CH3)2+. So, the enamine is an ethanaminium with a pentan-2-ylidene group, which is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

But wait, that's more like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2- attached to N(CH3)2+. So the enamine is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N(CH3)2+.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the structure, but perhaps I don't need to dwell on it. Let's think of the reaction steps.

So, the enamine is treated with LDA (a strong base), which deprotonates it, forming an enamine anion. Then, ethyl iodide is added, leading to alkylation. Then, acid workup.

But wait, what product would form from this?

If the enamine is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N(CH3)2+, and we deprotonate the alpha carbon (the CH2 next to the double bond), the anion would form at that position. Then, ethyl iodide would add an ethyl group there.

So, after alkylation, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHEt-N(CH3)2+, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl is added to the carbon that was deprotonated.

Wait, perhaps the structure after alkylation would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHEt, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl is added to the nitrogen? No, because ethyl iodide is an alkylating agent, and the enamine has a lone pair on the nitrogen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: looking at the product options. Option C says the product is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)3CH3? No, wait, heptan-4-one is:

(CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3. So, seven carbons, ketone at position 4.

Hmm. So how would that form from the starting enamine.

Wait, maybe the enamine undergoes some kind of cyclization or addition. Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is being hydrolyzed.

Wait, another possibility: The enamine (which is a conjugated amine) could react with an electrophilic source. But in this case, after alkylation, perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the enamine is being treated with LDA, which deprotonates it to form an enolate. Then, ethyl iodide adds, and upon protonation, it forms a new enamine. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is being used in a Michael addition or some other conjugate addition, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the reaction sequence is for the deprotonation, alkylation, and then hydrolysis. Enamines can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to form ketones.

Wait, that's a key point. Enamines are typically hydrolyzed to ketones when treated with aqueous acid. So perhaps the reaction steps involve alkylation of the enamine, followed by hydrolysis to form a ketone.

So, let's think: starting with an enamine, if you alkylate it, making a longer chain, and then hydrolyze, you get a larger ketone.

So, the starting enamine is from a secondary amine and a carbonyl. Let's model the starting enamine as something like R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is a five-membered group. After alkylation, it's longer, leading to a seven-carbon ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is as follows:

Step 1: Deprotonate the enamine with LDA to form an enamine anion.

Step 2: Alkylation with ethyl iodide adds an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.

Step 3: Acid workup (H3O+) leads to protonation, but perhaps then hydrolysis occurs, converting the enamine into a ketone.

Wait, but when you hydrolyze an enamine, you typically get a ketone. So perhaps after alkylation, when you acidify, the enamine is hydrolyzed to a ketone.

So, the original enamine is from a secondary amine and a ketone. For example, perhaps it's derived from N,N-dimethylethanamine and pentan-2-one.

Wait, but in the starting material, it's N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the ethanaminium part is CH2NHCH3+, and the substituent is a pentan-2-ylidene group (CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-).

So, the enamine is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-N(CH3)2+.

If we deprotonate this enamine with LDA, we get an enamine anion at the alpha position (the CH2 next to the double bond). Then, adding ethyl iodide would alkylate that position, adding an ethyl group.

So the structure would become CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-CHEt-N(CH3)2+.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe the ethyl adds to the nitrogen? No, because the nitrogen is already substituted with two methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the enamine is more like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond and attached to the N.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2-C=N-CH(CH3)+, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the chain becomes longer, leading to a longer ketone upon hydrolysis.

Wait, the starting enamine could be derived from a ketone. So, for example, if the starting enamine is from N,N-dimethylethanamine and pentan-2-one, then the enamine would be:

N,N-dimethylethanamine with a pentan-2-ylidene group, which would be CH2=C-CH2-CH2-CH2 attached to the N.

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the enamine structure is formed by the condensation of a secondary amine and a ketone. For instance, when N,N-dimethylethanamine reacts with pentan-2-one, the enamine formed would have the structure CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-N(CH3)2.

But in this case, the starting material is the enaminium ion, which suggests it's protonated.

So, after alkylation (adding an ethyl group), perhaps the enamine becomes longer. Then, upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be shifted.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-N(CH3)2+. After alkylation, maybe we add an ethyl group to the nitrogen? But that would make it CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-N(CH3)2-Et+, which doesn't make sense because the nitrogen can't have too many substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation occurs at the carbonyl group, but that doesn't fit with the enamine structure.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the product options again.

Option C and D have B as heptan-4-one. So product is a seven-carbon ketone at position 4.

The starting enamine has a pentan-2-ylidene group, which is five carbons in the substituent. But perhaps the alkylation adds two more carbons (ethyl group), making the chain longer.

Wait, but pentan-2-ylidene is five carbons. Adding ethyl (two carbons) might make it seven, but perhaps not directly.

Alternatively, maybe the starting enamine's substituent is four carbons, and adding ethyl makes it six, leading to a seven-carbon ketone.

Wait, perhaps the enamine has a three-carbon substituent. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: when an enamine is hydrolyzed, it forms a ketone. The position of the ketone depends on where the enamine was. For example, if the enamine is R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2, then hydrolysis would give R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH, but that's not a ketone. Oh wait, no, enamine hydrolysis gives a ketone by adding water across the double bond. So, for example, an enamine like R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 would hydrolyze to R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH, which isn't right. Wait, no, the hydrolysis of an enamine typically gives a ketone. So, for example, if the enamine is R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, then hydrolysis would form a ketone in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the enamine is a five-membered conjugated system. Let's think: the enamine is R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting enamine is derived from a four-carbon ketone and a three-carbon amine. Then, after alkylation, the chain is extended, leading to a longer ketone upon hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps the reagents are leading to the formation of a longer chain.

So, the enamine is treated with LDA, which deprotonates to form a strong base. Then, ethyl iodide alkylates the alpha position, adding an ethyl group. Upon hydrolysis, this would form a ketone with a longer chain.

So, if the starting enamine has a five-carbon substituent (pentan-2-ylidene), adding an ethyl group (two carbons) would make it seven carbons. Then, hydrolysis would form a ketone in the middle.

Wait, but the product is heptan-4-one, which is seven carbons with the ketone at position 4. That would be:

CH2CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, heptan-4-one is:

(CH2)3-CO-(CH2)3CH3. So, seven carbons, ketone at position 4.

So, if the starting enamine's substituent is four carbons, adding an ethyl (two carbons) would make six, but hydrolysis would give a ketone at position 4.

Wait, perhaps the starting substituent is three carbons, and adding two more makes five, leading to a seven-carbon chain upon hydrolysis.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's think about the reaction steps.

Option C says the reagents are LDA, DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+. The product is heptan-4-one.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. LDA deprotonates the enamine to form an enamine anion.

2. Alkylation with ethyl iodide adds an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.

3. Acid workup (H3O+) leads to protonation and hydrolysis, converting the enamine into a ketone.

So, hydrolysis of the alkylated enamine would produce a ketone. The position of the ketone depends on the structure after alkylation.

If the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, which might be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N(CH3)2+.

After deprotonation, the enamine anion would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-^−-N(CH3)2.

Then, alkylation with ethyl iodide would add an ethyl group to the alpha carbon (the CH2 next to the double bond). So, perhaps that carbon becomes CH2Et.

Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break down. Since enamine hydrolysis typically gives a ketone, perhaps the position of the ketone will be adjacent to the ethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylated enamine is longer, leading to a longer ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine has a four-carbon substituent. Adding ethyl makes it six carbons, and hydrolysis gives a five-carbon ketone. But that doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, if the substituent is three carbons, adding ethyl makes five, leading to a seven-carbon ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting substituent is CH2=CHCH2- (three carbons). Adding ethyl would make it CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2- (five carbons). Then, hydrolysis would form a ketone in the middle.

Wait, when an enamine is hydrolyzed, the double bond is converted into a ketone. For example, R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2 becomes R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH, but no, that's not a ketone. Wait, no, the hydrolysis of an enamine (R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-) would add water across the double bond, giving R2N-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, but that's not a ketone. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me recall: Enamines are hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form ketones. The hydrolysis of an enamine R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- would, upon hydrolysis, form R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. But that's not a ketone. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the enamine is R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, and upon hydrolysis, it would form R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH, but that's not a ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the structure.

Wait, no, the enamine structure is R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- where the double bond is between the first and second carbons. So, it's R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- but with a double bond between the first and second carbons, making it R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. So, structure is R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the starting material again. The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the substituent is pentan-2-ylidene, which is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-N(CH3)2+.

After alkylation, the chain would be longer. Suppose we add an ethyl group to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen, making the structure CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-CHEt-N(CH3)2+.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl adds to the nitrogen, but that would make it CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-N(CH3)2Et+, which isn't possible because the nitrogen can't have too many substituents.

Hmm. Perhaps the alkylation occurs at the alpha position, making the enamine longer. Then, upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be formed.

If the enamine is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-N(CH3)2+, and after alkylation, it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH2Et-N(CH3)2+, then upon hydrolysis, that would form a ketone.

Wait, but that seems like adding more carbons. So the enamine becomes longer, and hydrolysis would break the double bond into a ketone.

So, if the starting enamine has five carbons (pentan-2-ylidene), adding ethyl (two more) would make seven. Upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be at position 4, because the chain is seven carbons.

Wait, heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)3CH3. So that would fit if the starting enamine's substituent is five carbons, and we add two more (ethyl), making seven.

But wait, the starting substituent is pentan-2-ylidene (five carbons), so adding ethyl would make seven, right?

Wait, no. Pentan-2-ylidene is five carbons, but when you add ethyl (two more), you get seven. So, upon hydrolysis, you get a seven-carbon ketone.

Hmm, that would align with option C, which has product B as heptan-4-one.

So, the sequence of reagents is LDA (deprotonates), DME (solvent), then CH3CH2I (alkylates), then H3O+ (workup, hydrolysis). So, the reagents are steps (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Looking at the options:

Option C: A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+; B is heptan-4-one.

Option D: A is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; B is heptan-4-one.

Wait, the options have different sequences. So, option C's step (i) is LDA and DME as separate steps. Or is DME a solvent?

Wait, in the options, when a step includes multiple reagents, it's written as (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

So, for option C, step (i) is LDA and DME (but DME is a solvent, so it's perhaps just the solvent used with LDA). Step (ii) is CH3CH2I. Step (iii) is H3O+.

In option D, step (i) is LDA, and step (ii) is DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

Wait, but LDA is typically used in DME as the solvent. So, perhaps step (i) is LDA in DME. Then, step (ii) is adding CH3CH2I. Then, step (iii) is H3O+.

Which matches option C, where A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

So, the product is heptan-4-one, which is option C.

But wait, let me check other options. Option D's product is also heptan-4-one, but the reagents are different.

Option D's reagents: (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

So, in step (i), LDA is used, perhaps without DME. Then, in step (ii), DME is added along with CH3CH2I and H3O+.

But that might not make sense, because LDA is typically used in DME as a solvent. So, perhaps option C's sequence is correct.

So, product B is heptan-4-one, formed by first deprotonating the enamine with LDA in DME, then alkylation with ethyl iodide, then acid workup leading to hydrolysis to form the ketone.

So the correct option is option C.


The reaction involves the enamine (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium undergoing a sequence of reagents to form a product. The analysis of the reaction steps and the options provided is as follows:

1. **Understanding the Enamine Structure**: The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, which consists of an enamine system where the nitrogen is substituted with a methyl group and a pentan-2-ylidene group (CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2-). The enamine is protonated, forming an enaminium ion.

2. **Reagent Sequence Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: The sequence includes LDA, DME, CH3CH2I, and H3O+. However, the product is stated as pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine, which does not align with the expected reaction outcome.
   - **Option B**: The sequence is similar to Option A, but the product is the same as in Option A, making it incorrect.
   - **Option C**: The sequence is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. This sequence involves deprotonation of the enamine with LDA in DME, alkylation with CH3CH2I, and subsequent hydrolysis with H3O+. This sequence is plausible and leads to the formation of heptan-4-one as the product.
   - **Option D**: The sequence is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. While the product is correct (heptan-4-one), the reagent sequence is less logical because LDA is typically used in DME as a solvent, making Option C more consistent.

3. **Reaction Outcome**: The enamine undergoes deprotonation with LDA, forming an enamine anion. Alkylation with CH3CH2I adds an ethyl group to the alpha position. Upon hydrolysis with H3O+, the enamine is converted into a ketone. The starting enamine's pentan-2-ylidene group (five carbons) and the added ethyl group (two carbons) result in a seven-carbon chain. Hydrolysis places the ketone at position 4, forming heptan-4-one.

4. **Correct Option**: Option C provides the correct reagent sequence and product. The sequence (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+ leads to the formation of heptan-4-one.

Answer: C
