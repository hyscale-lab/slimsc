Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Let me read it carefully. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Hmm. Right, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum for hydrogen. But when quasars emit this light, and if it's absorbed by neutral hydrogen clouds, those clouds must be at a certain redshift so that the absorbed light is in a wavelength detectable by optical telescopes.

Wait, ground-based optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs it. So the observed wavelength must be in the optical range, which is longer than UV. So the redshift must shift the 1216 Angstroms into the optical range.

What's the typical optical range for ground-based telescopes? I think optical wavelengths are from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Wait, but 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. So when it's redshifted, it has to move into the visible range.

So the redshift z is such that the observed wavelength lambda_obs is equal to lambda_emit * (1 + z). Lambda_emit here is 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers
