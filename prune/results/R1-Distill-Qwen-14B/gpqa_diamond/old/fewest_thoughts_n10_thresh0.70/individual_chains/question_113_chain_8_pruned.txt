Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's look at each of these one by one and see what information they give.

Starting with the FTIR. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a very broad peak, maybe even a broad O-H stretch. But if it's an alcohol, the peak would be a bit less broad? Hmm, not too sure, but O-H is a likely candidate here.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is a strong peak, which makes me think of carbonyl groups. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 cm^-1 peak could be another carbonyl, but perhaps conjugated or part of a different functional group. Wait, 1650 is a bit lower than 1700. What about conjugated carbonyls? Like in an aromatic ring, maybe an aromatic ketone or something like that. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated ester or an acid. Or could it be an amide? No, because the options don't have nitrogen. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl (like ester, ketone) and the 1650 is something else. Could that be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching? No, aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600, so 1650 is a bit high. Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. For example, a conjugated double bond, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Like in an enone structure. That would cause the carbonyl peak to be at a lower wavenumber because of conjugation.

So perhaps the compound has a conjugated carbonyl group. So maybe an ester with a double bond nearby, or maybe a ketone adjacent to a double bond.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond. So the compound must have a double bond, either isolated or conjugated.

And the Mass Spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I'm trying to think what fragments give a mass of 45. Common fragments with 45 could be (methyl group plus something else?), but wait, the most common fragment at 45 I can think of is the CH2=CH-O- group, maybe from an ester. Or perhaps it's
