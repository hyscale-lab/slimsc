Okay, so I've got this physics question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators consistent with certain symmetries, up to a certain dimension. The idea is that you start with the Standard Model and add higher-dimensional operators to account for new physics effects.

So which symmetries are involved here? Well, the Standard Model itself respects certain symmetries, and SMEFT should preserve those unless they're broken by the new operators. But wait, noâ€”operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the SM. Because if they didn't, you'd be changing the underlying symmetry structure, which isn't what SMEFT is about. SMEFT is more about adding interactions without changing the basic model's symmetry structure.

Let's think about each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry. So any operator added in SMEFT must also be Lorentz-invariant. That makes sense because otherwise, you'd have terms that don't respect relativity, which is a big no-no in particle physics.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Wait a second. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's a bigger symmetry group. But in a theory like SMEFT, the operators are typically local, meaning they're written in terms of fields at the same point (local operators), which are Poincare-invariant. Well, wait, but operators in the effective theory are local, so they should be Poincare-invariant. So does that mean all operators must respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, no. Because the Poincare group includes translations, so operators would have to be invariant under spacetime translations. That would mean that the operators must be renormalizable, but wait, SMEFT includes higher-dimensional operators which are non-renormalizable. Wait, but non-renormalizable operators do respect Poincare symmetry because they're local. So I think that all operators in SMEFT are Poincare-invariant. So both Lorent
