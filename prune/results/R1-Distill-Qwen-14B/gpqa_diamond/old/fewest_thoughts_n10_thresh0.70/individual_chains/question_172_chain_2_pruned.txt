Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, so that makes sense. The question is about iron atoms in two stars, star_1 and star_2. It says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2.

Wait, twice as excited... I think that means the excitation level is higher. So the probability of the iron atoms being in that higher energy state is higher in star_1. Oh right, this relates to the Boltzmann distribution. Because in thermal equilibrium (LTE here), the population of energy levels depends on temperature.

The Boltzmann equation, right? It's something like the ratio of populations between two energy levels. The formula is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight.

In this problem, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, but wait, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I think n_1/n_2 = 2, but wait, which is which? Let me think: n1 is the number in star_1, n2 in star_2. So n1 = 2 n2.

But wait, the question says "twice as excited," so the population in the higher energy level is higher. Let's assume that E_i is the higher energy level, E_j is lower. So for each star, we can write their own ratios.

So for star_1: (n_i1)/(n_j1) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - ΔE/(k T1) )
For star_2: (n_i2)/(n_j2) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, the question states that the energy difference is the same for both stars, right? The problem says the energy difference is approximately 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE is same for both stars.

Wait, but the problem says
