Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about calculating the uncertainty in the P_z operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that the system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for P_z, I'll need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩.

But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it might not be an eigenstate of P_z. So when I calculate ⟨P_z⟩, it's just the expectation value of P_z in that state. Similarly, ⟨P_z²⟩ is the expectation value of P_z squared.

First, I think I should write down the matrix for P_z. The problem gives it as:

Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

So P_z is a diagonal matrix with ħ, 0, -ħ on the diagonal.

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1
