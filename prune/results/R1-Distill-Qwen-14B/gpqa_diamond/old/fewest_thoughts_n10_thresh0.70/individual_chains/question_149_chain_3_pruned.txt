Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum shows all the expected peaks except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. The shifts are similar, and the integrals add up to 1H. So, that part is confusing. Wait, if it's the same alpha-proton appearing as two peaks, but the integrals together are 1H, maybe it's not a coupling issue. Because if it were spin-spin coupling, like with another proton, you'd see splitting, but the question says coupling pattern rules that out. So, the two peaks are same shift but two separate.

Then the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, which matches the expected molecule. So, the mass is same, but two separate peaks. Since LC is chromatographic, maybe they have different retention times but same mass, so same molecular weight.

Hmm, what could cause two peaks in LC-MS but same mass? Maybe isomers, like diastereomers or enantiomers. Because enantiomers have same mass but would have different retention times if the column is chiral. But if the LC is run at elevated temperature, maybe the column isn't chiral. Wait, but the problem says the peaks are clearly defined and same intensity. Oh, wait, if it's a mixture of enantiomers, they would elute together on a regular column, but if the LC has a chiral column, they would separate. But the question says the same mass, so same molecular weight. So, either diastereomers or maybe some other isomer.

Looking at the NMR, the same alpha-proton as two peaks. That's odd. Let me think. Why would an alpha-proton split into two peaks? If there's some kind of exchange happening, but that usually leads to broader peaks, not two distinct ones. Another possibility is that the proton is in a different environment in some molecules. Wait, if there are diastereomers, each would have different NMR shifts. Wait, but in this case, the two peaks have similar shifts, so maybe the diastereomers are very similar in that environment.

Wait, but the question says the integral of both peaks together is 1H. So each is integrating as 0.5H? That doesn't make sense. Or maybe each is 1H, but together they add up to 2H, but the question says it's 1H. Hmm, no. Wait, the question says, "together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral." So each is contributing 0.5 each? So maybe each peak is 0.5H, adding up to 1H. That suggests that the proton is split into two environments, each with half the integral. That could happen if the proton is in a different environment in some molecules.

Wait, but the question says that the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, same shift, same integral (together 1H). So maybe the compound is a racemic mixture
