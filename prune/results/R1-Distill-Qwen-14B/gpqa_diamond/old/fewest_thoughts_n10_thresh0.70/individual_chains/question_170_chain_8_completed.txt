Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a given spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I think this means the spinor is represented as a column vector, so it's [3i; 4]. Wait, I should probably write that down: the spin state χ is (3i, 4) T. So in vector form, that's (3i, 4) as a column.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ | S_y | χ⟩. Oh right, because the expectation value is the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state.

But wait, what's S_y in terms of the Pauli matrices? Oh yeah, the spin operator S for a particle like an electron is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y. And the σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So σ_y is a 2x2 matrix.

So putting it together, S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, to compute the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩, I need to compute χ† S_y χ. Wait, χ is a column vector, so χ† is the conjugate transpose, which would be a row vector. But wait, the spinor given is (3i, 4), so the conjugate would flip the signs of the imaginary parts. Let me think: 3i is purely imaginary, so its conjugate is -3i. And 4 is real, so the conjugate is 4. So χ† would be [-3i, 4].

So now, I need to compute χ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by χ. Let's break it down.

First, compute S_y χ. Let me write that out. S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix. So I can factor that out, compute the matrix times the vector, then multiply by (ħ/2) at the end.

So the matrix part is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Multiplying this by the vector [3i; 4]:

First element: 0*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second element: i*(3i) + 0*(4) = i*(3i) + 0 = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So the result of σ_y * χ is [-4i; -3]. Then, multiplying by (ħ/2) gives S_y χ = (ħ/2) * [-4i; -3].

Wait, no, wait. Because S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y. So when I compute S_y χ, it's (ħ/2) * σ_y χ. So the σ_y χ part is the matrix multiplied by the vector.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it correctly. Let me recalculate σ_y multiplied by the spinor.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The spinor is [3i; 4].

So the first component of σ_y * spinor is 0*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = -4i.

The second component is i*(3i) + 0*(4) = 3i². Since i² is -1, that becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y * spinor = [ -4i ; -3 ].

Now, S_y * spinor is (ħ/2) multiplied by that vector. So S_y * χ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, I need to compute χ† multiplied by this result. χ† is [-3i, 4], as I determined earlier.

So χ† * (S_y χ) is [-3i, 4] multiplied by (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ].

Let's compute the inner product without the constants for now. So:

(-3i) * (-4i) + 4 * (-3) = ?

Wait, wait, matrix multiplication: each element of the row vector multiplies the corresponding element of the column vector, then sum.

So first term: (-3i) * (-4i) = (3i)(4i) = 12 i². i² is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

Adding these together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the inner product is -24 multiplied by (ħ/2). Wait, because S_y χ was (ħ/2) times the vector. So the entire expression is (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ ) / 2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, so the expectation value is -12 ħ? Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ /25. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the normalization. Oh wait, because the spinor χ must be normalized. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their inner product with themselves is 1. But wait, the given spin state is (3i, 4). Let me check the normalization.

Compute ⟨χ | χ⟩: (3i)*(-3i) + (4)(4) = ( -9 i² ) + 16. i² is -1, so -9*(-1) = 9. 9 + 16 = 25. So the norm is 25. Therefore, this state isn't normalized. So, to compute the expectation value correctly, I should consider that the actual state is χ / sqrt(25) = χ /5.

Because in quantum mechanics, the state must have a norm of 1, so the correct state is (3i/5, 4/5). Otherwise, the expectation value would be different.

Ah, so I think I missed that in my initial calculation. I should normalize the state first. So χ is [3i, 4]^T divided by 5.

So let me redo the calculation with the normalized state. So the normalized χ is [3i/5; 4/5].

Then, the expectation value is ⟨χ | S_y | χ⟩. Let's proceed.

Compute S_y χ again. S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y. So σ_y * χ is:

σ_y * [3i/5; 4/5] = [ (0)(3i/5) + (-i)(4/5), (i)(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) ].

So first component: 0 + (-i)(4/5) = -4i/5.

Second component: i*(3i/5) + 0 = (3i²)/5 = (3*(-1))/5 = -3/5.

So σ_y * χ is [ -4i/5 ; -3/5 ].

Then, S_y χ is (ħ/2) multiplied by this vector, which is [ (-4i/5)(ħ/2), (-3/5)(ħ/2) ].

Now, the conjugate transpose of χ is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

So the inner product χ† (S_y χ) is:

( -3i/5 ) * ( (-4i/5)(ħ/2) ) + (4/5) * ( (-3/5)(ħ/2) )

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-3i/5) * (-4i ħ/(5*2)) → (3i)(4i) (ħ)/(5*5*2) → 12 i² ħ/(25*2) → 12*(-1) ħ/(50) → -12 ħ/50.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Let me recompute.

First term:

( -3i/5 ) * [ (-4i/5)(ħ/2) ) ] 

= ( (-3i)(-4i) )/(5*5) * ( ħ/2 )

= (12 i² )/(25) * ( ħ/2 )

i² is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

So first term is (-12)/(25) * ħ/2 = (-12 ħ )/(50).

Second term:

(4/5) * [ (-3/5)( ħ/2 ) ] 

= (4 * -3 ) / (5 *5 ) * ħ/2 

= (-12)/(25) * ħ/2 → (-12 ħ)/(50).

So adding both terms: (-12 ħ /50) + (-12 ħ /50 )= (-24 ħ)/50.

Simplify: (-24/50) ħ = (-12/25) ħ.

Wait, that's (-12/25) multiplied by ħ. So the expectation value is (-12 ħ)/25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I get the signs right in the σ_y multiplication?

Hmm. Let me recalculate σ_y times χ.

σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

χ = [3i/5; 4/5].

So first component of σ_y χ: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = (-4i)/5.

Second component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = (3i²)/5 = (3*(-1))/5 = -3/5.

Yes, that seems right.

Then, the inner product with χ†, which is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

So [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] multiplied by [ (-4i/5)(ħ/2 ), (-3/5)(ħ/2 ) ].

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute the entire expression without factoring out the ħ/2 first.

Alternatively, another approach: compute χ† S_y χ = (1/5)² (3i, 4) * σ_y * (3i;4 ), multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, no, because χ is [3i;4], so the inner product is (3i,4) * σ_y * (3i;4 ), but scaled by (1/5)^2, because the state is [3i/5;4/5].

Wait, perhaps this alternative approach would clarify. Let me try.

The state is χ = [3i/5;4/5 ].

So, χ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

Compute χ† σ_y χ:

= [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] * σ_y * [3i/5;4/5 ].

So first compute σ_y * [3i/5;4/5 ] as we did before, which is [ -4i/5; -3/5 ].

Then, [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] multiplied by [ -4i/5; -3/5 ].

So:

( -3i/5 ) * ( -4i/5 ) + (4/5)*( -3/5 )

= [ (12 i² )/(25) ) ] + [ (-12)/(25) )

i² is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

So first term: (-12)/25.

Second term: -12/25.

Sum: (-12 -12 ) /25 = -24/25.

Multiply by ħ/2: ( -24/25 ) * ( ħ/2 ) = (-12 ħ )/25.

So yes, that's the same result as before. So the expectation value is -12 ħ /25, which is option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalization of the Spin State**:  
   The given spin state is not normalized. The norm is computed as:  
   \[
   \|\chi\|^2 = (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]  
   Thus, the normalized spin state is:  
   \[
   \chi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Spin Operator \( S_y \)**:  
   The spin operator along the y-direction is given by:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y, \quad \text{where } \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Therefore:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Compute \( S_y \chi \)**:  
   First, compute \( \sigma_y \chi \):  
   \[
   \sigma_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \cdot \frac{3i}{5} + (-i) \cdot \frac{4}{5} \\ i \cdot \frac{3i}{5} + 0 \cdot \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Then, multiply by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \):  
   \[
   S_y \chi = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{2i\hbar}{5} \\ -\frac{3\hbar}{10} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \langle \chi | S_y | \chi \rangle \)**:  
   The conjugate transpose of \( \chi \) is:  
   \[
   \chi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Now, compute \( \chi^\dagger S_y \chi \):  
   \[
   \chi^\dagger S_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{2i\hbar}{5} \\ -\frac{3\hbar}{10} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Break this into components:  
   - First term: \( \left(-\frac{3i}{5}\right) \left(-\frac{2i\hbar}{5}\right) = \frac{6i^2\hbar}{25} = \frac{-6\hbar}{25} \) (since \( i^2 = -1 \)).  
   - Second term: \( \frac{4}{5} \left(-\frac{3\hbar}{10}\right) = \frac{-12\hbar}{50} = \frac{-6\hbar}{25} \).  
   Adding these:  
   \[
   \chi^\dagger S_y \chi = \frac{-6\hbar}{25} + \frac{-6\hbar}{25} = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( \frac{-12\hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
