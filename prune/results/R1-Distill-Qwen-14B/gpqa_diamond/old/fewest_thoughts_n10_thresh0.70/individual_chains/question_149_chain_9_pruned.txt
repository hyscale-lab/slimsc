Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's start by breaking down the problem.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR and LC-MS data are showing some anomalies. The NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. The shifts are similar, and the integrals add up to 1H, which is what's expected for that proton. So they're not splitting each other because the coupling is ruled out. Wait, because the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so that's not the issue here.

Hmm, so what else could cause two peaks for the same proton? Maybe something to do with the structure having some sort of symmetry or diastereotopic protons? Or perhaps the molecule is in a different conformation in solution, causing the same proton to resonate at slightly different shifts. But wait, the integrals together are 1H, so that suggests each peak is integrating to about 0.5H each? Or maybe each is 0.5H, adding up to 1H total. So, maybe the proton is a diastereotopic one, meaning it's in a chiral environment where the two protons that were once equivalent are now non-equivalent. But wait, diastereotopic protons would split into two peaks, but then the coupling would influence that, right? But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin, so maybe it's something else.

Looking at the options: Option D says it's a mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereoisomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show distinct peaks. But if the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers, each would have their own set of protons. Wait, but in this case, the same alpha-proton is showing two peaks. So maybe in one diastereomer, the alpha proton is in one environment, and the other diastereomer has it in a different environment, causing two different shifts. But would that be the case?

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So the same mass, so same molecular weight. So the molecular formula is the same. That suggests that
