Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see.

The problem starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, wait, C3H6 is either propene or cyclopropane. Oh wait, no, cyclopropane is C3H6 too. But more commonly, I think when someone says C3H6, they mean propene, which is an alkene. So maybe A is propene.

Then it undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh right, that's a typical bromination condition for alkenes. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add bromine across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane maybe? Or wait, no. Propene has three carbons: CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding bromine (Br2) in CCl4 would add across the double bond. So that would give 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So adding Br2 would add one Br to each carbon, making 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, but when you have two adjacent bromine atoms, like 1,2-dibromopropane, reacting with alcoholic KOH, what happens? Let's think. After the first elimination, maybe one Br leaves, and then another elimination occurs. Wait, but two Brs on adjacent carbons—maybe it's a vicinal dihalide. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, it should undergo dehydrohalogenation twice. So first, eliminating HBr to form a double bond again, but wait—no, because we have two Brs. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, so the reaction with KOH (in alcohol) would cause elimination of both Brs, forming an alkyne? Because
