Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, but since it's proportional, I probably need to normalize it first. Oh right, because the state vector should satisfy <alpha|alpha> = 1. So the first thing I think I need to do is normalize |alpha>.

The state is given as a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of the z-component of the spin operator. So let me write that out:

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>

But wait, that's not normalized yet. To find the normalization factor, I calculate the inner product of |alpha> with itself. The inner product of |up> and |down> are orthogonal, right? So their cross terms would be zero. So the norm squared would be |1+i|² + |2 - i|².

Calculating |1+i|²: that's (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because 1+i's magnitude squared is 1² + 1² = 2.

Then |2 - i|²: 2² + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Got that part down. Now the next part is about the operator whose matrix elements are given by A_ij. The matrix is such that A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what are the indices here? Since the state is two-dimensional (since it's a spin-½ system, with
