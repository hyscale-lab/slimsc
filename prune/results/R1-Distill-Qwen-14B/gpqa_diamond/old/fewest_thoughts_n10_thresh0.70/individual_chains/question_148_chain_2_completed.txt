Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Okay, so the problem is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds known. The question talks about substances A1 to A5, each with specific properties.

First, let's break down each part.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. So the reaction could be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing xenon usually involves fluorine, like in the formation of XeF2 or XeF4 or something like that. Wait, but A1 is a binary compound of fluorine and Y. So maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, perhaps something like ClF3 or something similar. Wait, but ClF3 is a binary compound, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is a halogen, like Cl, Br, I.

Wait, but let's think about the decomposition. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So A1 could be a compound that releases F2 when it breaks down. For example, if A1 is YF3 and it decomposes into YF2 and F2, but wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF4, which might decompose into YF3 and F2. But I'm not entirely sure yet.

Then, A2 has a oF (I think that's the oxidation state of fluorine) of 31.96%. Wait, that's probably the percentage by weight of fluorine. Or maybe it's the oxidation state. Hmm, wait, oF is often used to denote the oxidation number. Wait, 31.96% is approximately the abundance of fluorine-19, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the percentage composition by mass. Let me think: if A2 contains F with an oxidation state of, say, -1, then perhaps the compound has a certain formula.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible compounds. Since Y forms five binary compounds with F, Y must be a non-metal that can exhibit multiple oxidation states. Common candidates are oxygen (but O has only a few with F?), nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine, maybe.

Wait, for example, chlorine can form ClF, ClF3, ClF5, etc. Wait, but how many binary compounds? Let's see: ClF, ClF3, ClF5, maybe others? I'm not sure about the exact count.

Wait, five binary compounds. Let me think about other elements. Sulfur forms SF4, SF6, maybe others? Nitrogen: NF3, N2F4? Hmm, but maybe not five. Alternatively, perhaps Y is iodine. Iodine forms IF, I2F7, IF3, IF5, perhaps more? Wait, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, another angle: A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon can form several fluorides, like XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. The formation of these usually involves a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine itself is a strong oxidizing agent, but perhaps A1 is a compound that when it reacts with Xe, produces XeF compounds. So perhaps A1 is a diatomic molecule, but that's unlikely. Or maybe Y is a halogen, and YF has a high oxidation state.

Wait, another thought: If A1 is ClF3, which is a strong oxidizing agent. ClF3 could oxidize Xe, perhaps, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe Y is oxygen. But oxygen's compounds with F are limited, like OF2 and perhaps others.

Wait, maybe Y is a group 17 element (halogen), such as chlorine. Let's consider that Y is Cl.

So if Y is Cl, then the compounds could be ClF, ClF3, ClF5, etc. Wait, but how many binary compounds are known? ClF, ClF3, ClF5, maybe ClF7? Or perhaps I'm getting the count wrong. Let me think: Cl forms several fluorides. For example, ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7, but perhaps some are not stable or exist only in certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe Y is Br, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says five binary compounds are known. Let me think of possible elements. Fluorine itself doesn't form binary compounds beyond F2. Chlorine can form ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7, and another? Hmm, maybe ClF2? Or perhaps other structures. Wait, I'm not certain about the exact count.

Alternatively, maybe Y is oxygen. OF2 is a binary compound, but I'm not sure if there are five. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can approach it by looking at the decomposition. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. Suppose A1 is YF3. If it decomposes into YF2 and F2, that could work. But let me check the formula.

Let me think about the decomposition reaction. Suppose A1 is YF3, which decomposes into YF2 and F2. So:

YF3 → YF2 + F2

But that would require the fluorine in YF3 to split into YF2 (where F is in a lower oxidation state) and F2 (which is elemental fluorine). Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF4, which decomposes into YF2 and F2. Let me see:

YF4 → YF2 + F2

In terms of stoichiometry, let's see:

YF4 → YF2 + F2

But how does that balance? Let's write the equation:

YF4 → YF2 + F2

Let me balance it. On the left: 1 Y, 4 F. On the right: 1 Y, 2 F (from YF2) + 2*2 F (from F2) → total 6 F. So that's 4 F on the left, 6 on the right. So to balance, perhaps we can have:

2 YF4 → 2 YF2 + 3 F2

Yes, that would balance.

So if A1 is YF4, upon decomposition, it produces YF2 (A2) and F2.

In this case, the fluorine percentage in A2 (YF2) can be calculated.

Wait, the question states that in A2, the oF is 31.96%. Wait, if oF is the oxidation number of F, then in YF2, F would have an oxidation state of -1 (since Y is likely in +2 oxidation state, assuming Y is a group 2 element, but wait, Y is a halogen? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps Y is in a higher oxidation state.)

Wait, maybe I should approach this with the given information. Let's suppose A2 is YF2, and the fluorine content is 31.96% by mass. Let's calculate the molecular weight (MW) of YF2.

The formula for percentage composition by mass is (mass of F / MW of compound) * 100 = 31.96%.

So,

(Mass of F in YF2) / (MW of YF2) = 0.3196

Each F atom contributes 19 g/mol (approx). So in YF2, there are 2 F atoms, so 2*19 = 38 g/mol from F.

Let me denote the atomic weight of Y as M. So the MW of YF2 is M + (2*19) = M + 38.

The percentage of F is (38 / (M +38)) *100 = 31.96%

So,

38 / (M +38) = 0.3196

Multiply both sides by (M +38):

38 = 0.3196*(M +38)

Divide both sides by 0.3196:

38 / 0.3196 ≈ M +38

38 / 0.3196 ≈ 118.9 (since 0.3196 * 120 ≈ 38.35, so 38/0.3196 ≈ 118.9)

So,

118.9 ≈ M +38 → M ≈ 118.9 -38 = 80.9 g/mol.

So Y has an atomic weight of approximately 80.9. Let me think about which element has an atomic weight around 80.

Looking at the periodic table: Y is likely a halogen. Chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35.45, which is way below 80. Bromine is about 79.90, which is close to 80. So Y is probably Br.

Wait, but earlier I thought Y is Cl, but the calculation suggests Y is Br since 79.9 is close to 80.9.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Equation:

38 = 0.3196*(M +38)

Divide 38 by 0.3196:

38 / 0.3196 ≈ 118.87 (since 0.3196 * 118 = 37.76, 0.3196*119=38.07. So 38 is about 119).

So M +38 = 119 → M = 81 g/mol.

Which element has a MW of about 81? Bromine is about 80, close. So Y is Br.

Wait, but let me think. If Y is Br, then the compounds would be BrF, BrF3, BrF5, BrF7, etc. Do five binary compounds exist for bromine with fluorine? I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe Y is Cl. Let's see: If Y is Cl, which has a MW of ~35.5. Then, let's plug into the equation again.

Wait, no, because earlier calculation gave Y as ~81. So Y is Br.

So, A2 is BrF2. Then A1 is BrF4, which decomposes into BrF2 and F2.

Wait, but I'm not certain if BrF4 is a known compound. Let me think. Maybe I made a wrong assumption earlier about the decomposition.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is BrF5, which decomposes into BrF3 and F2. Let me try that approach.

Wait, but let's see. A1 is a bright-red substance. BrF3 is actually a brownish-yellow liquid, and BrF5 is a colorless liquid. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the colors wrong.

Wait, another thought: ClF3 is a yellowish liquid, and it's a strong oxidizing agent. So perhaps A1 is ClF3. Let me think about that.

If A1 is ClF3, then upon decomposition, what could it form? Maybe ClF and F2. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps ClF3 decomposes into Cl and F2, but that seems less likely.

Wait, but let's reconsider the problem. The more important point is that Y's atomic weight is about 81, making Y bromine. So let's proceed with Y=Br.

So, A1 is BrF5. When it decomposes at 293 K, it produces A2, which is BrF2, and F2 gas. Wait, but I'm not certain if BrF5 decomposes into BrF2 and F2. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is BrF3, which upon decomposition gives BrF and F2? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the approach is getting too complicated. Let's think about the other parts of the question.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. So A3 is YF, perhaps. Wait, but let's proceed step by step.

Then, A4 is another compound. Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 gives A5. In water, A5 decomposes into two substances.

Hmm, perhaps A4 is a salt, and adding Y in a 1:1 ratio causes a reaction, perhaps a displacement reaction.

Wait, another thought: If A4 is a compound of Y and some other element, perhaps. Or maybe it's a solution of HFO (hydrofluoric acid), but that's not a binary compound of Y and F. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt. For example, if Y is Br, then A4 could be a solution of NaBr. Then adding Br in a 1:1 molar ratio would not make sense, unless it's a redox reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrO3 or something. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: A5 is obtained by adding Y to A4. When A5 is added to water, it decomposes into two substances. So perhaps A5 is a salt that hydrolyzes in water. For example, if A5 is CaF2, but that's not reacting with Y.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4, and adding Y (Br) in a 1:1 ratio leads to some reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should focus more on the first part since the other parts are a bit confusing.

So, from the first part, I think Y is Br. So Y is Br.

So the compounds are BrF, BrF3, BrF5, BrF7, etc. Are there five binary compounds? I'm not too sure, but let's proceed.

So A1 is BrF5, which upon decomposition gives BrF2 and F2. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is another compound.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the fluorination of Y to get A3. If Y is Br, then A3 is BrF, perhaps. So when Y is fluorinated, it gains F atoms. But I'm not certain about the specific compounds.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the second part of the question. The key part is to determine the molecular weight (MW) of A4.

The problem asks for the range in which the MW of A4 falls. The options are A) 140-160, B)220-240, C)160-180, D)110-130.

If Y is Br, then A4 could be a compound of Br and F, like BrF3 or another. Alternatively, A4 might be a salt; for example, if A4 is KBrO3, which is a strong oxidizing agent. Wait, but that's K (potassium) and Br and O. But A4 is a binary compound of Y (Br) and F, so it's BrF something.

Wait, but another thought: A4 could be a solution of a compound, perhaps something like HBrO4 or similar. Wait, but HBrO4 is a strong acid, and when heated with Br, perhaps it could form another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a metal bromide, like NaBr. But then adding Br would not make much sense.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrO3, which upon reaction with Br (elemental) could form something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrO4. Let's think: HBrO4 is a strong acid. When you add Br in a 1:1 molar ratio, perhaps a displacement reaction occurs.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between HBrO4 and Br2. Let me think.

HBrO4 is a strong acid, and Br2 is a diatomic molecule. When they react, maybe they form BrO4^− or some other species. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces HBrO3 and HBr. Let me write a possible reaction:

HBrO4 + Br → HBrO3 + HBr + O2 ?

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a redox reaction where HBrO4 acts as an oxidizing agent and Br is the reducing agent.

Wait, but perhaps this is getting too detailed. Let's think about the decomposition of A5 in water. If A5 is a salt, perhaps it's something like KBrO3, which when dissolved in water doesn't decompose but perhaps reacts. Or perhaps A5 is NaBrO3, which is stable in water.

Wait, another angle: After adding Y (Br) to A4, you get A5. Then, when A5 is placed in water, it decomposes into two substances. So perhaps A5 is a salt that breaks down into an acid and a base, or maybe into two different substances.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a metal bromide that hydrolyzes in water. For example, if A5 is MgBr2, upon hydrolysis it would form Mg(OH)2 and HBr, but that's a possibility.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me get back to the first part.

So, if Y is Br, then A4 is a binary compound of Br and F. Let's think about possible compounds. BrF, BrF3, BrF5, BrF7, etc. Now, the question is about the molecular weight of A4.

If A4 is BrF3, then its MW is 80 (Br) + 3*19 (F) = 80 + 57 = 137 g/mol. That falls into option D (110-130) or perhaps into A (140-160). Wait, 137 is between 130 and 140, so not exactly in any of the ranges. Hmm.

Alternatively, if A4 is BrF5, its MW is 80 + 5*19 = 80 +95=175 g/mol. That's in option C (160-180).

Wait, but earlier I thought A1 is a higher fluoride like BrF5, which upon decomposition produces BrF2 and F2. But in that case, if A4 is BrF5, then adding Br in a 1:1 molar ratio would... I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is BrF, which has a MW of 80 +19=99, which is in option D (110-130). But 99 is below 110, so perhaps option D is 110-130, so it wouldn't include 99.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction when Y is added to A4. Y is Br, and it's added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4. The product is A5, which decomposes in water into two substances.

If A4 is a solution of HBrO4, adding Br (which is a reducing agent) might lead to the formation of HBrO3 and Br2. But I'm not certain.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of NaBrO3. Adding Br would perhaps not react, unless under specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrO, which upon reaction with Br could form HBr and O2, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to focus on the initial calculation that Y's atomic weight is about 80, making it Br. Then, A4 would be a compound like BrF3 or BrF5.

If A4 is BrF5 (MW 175), which is between 160-180 (option C), or BrF3 (137), which is between 130 and 140, but the options don't include 130-140. The options are 110-130 (D), 140-160 (A), 160-180 (C), and 220-240 (B).

So BrF5's MW is 175, which is in option C. Alternatively, if A4 is BrF4, which has a MW of 80 + 4*19= 80+76=156, which is also in option C (160-180? No, 156 is below 160). So perhaps A4 is BrF5.

But wait, earlier I thought that Y is Br because the calculation from A2's fluorine percentage gave a MW of about 81, which is Br. So if A4 is BrF5, then its MW is 175, which is in option C (160-180). So the correct option would be C.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is another compound. Let me think about the reaction where adding Y (Br) in 1:1 molar ratio to a hot solution of A4 produces A5.

If A4 is NaBrO3, then adding Br2 (elemental) would not react under normal conditions. Or perhaps the reaction is a redox one, where NaBrO3 is reduced by Br2.

Wait, another possibility: A4 could be HBrO4 (which is a strong acid). Adding Br in a 1:1 ratio might not make sense, but perhaps it's a reaction where HBrO4 is reduced. For example, HBrO4 can act as an oxidizing agent, and Br (elemental) could reduce it.

The reaction could be something like:

HBrO4 + Br → HBr + BrO3^- 

But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Let's write it as:

HBrO4 + Br → HBr + BrO3^- 

Let me balance the equation.

First, separate into H+ and BrO4^- reacting with Br.

BrO4^- + Br → Br^- + BrO3^-

Let me balance the Br atoms: 1 on each side.

Oxygen: 4 O on left, 3 O on right. So perhaps add H2O to the right.

BrO4^- + Br → Br^- + BrO3^- + H2O

Now balance O:

Left has 4 O, right has 3 O in BrO3^- plus 1 O in H2O → 4 O. So that's balanced.

Now balance H:

On right, H2O has 2 H. So add 2 H+ on the left.

BrO4^- + 2 H+ + Br → Br^- + BrO3^- + H2O

Now, balance charges.

Left side: BrO4^- has -1, 2 H+ is +2 → total +1. Br is 0. So total charge on left is +1.

Right side: Br^- is -1, BrO3^- is -1 → total -2. H2O is neutral. So net charge on right is -2.

To balance, perhaps we need to adjust. Let me see, perhaps multiply by a factor.

Let me write the reaction:

BrO4^- + 2 H+ + Br^- → Br^- + BrO3^- + H2O

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

HBrO4 + Br → HBr + BrO3^- 

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe this approach isn't productive. Let me think again.

Since the problem is about the molecular weight of A4, and if I'm confident that Y is Br, then the possible compounds are BrF, BrF3, BrF5, etc.

If A4 is BrF5, then its MW is 80 + 5*19= 175, which is in option C (160-180).

Alternatively, another possible compound is BrF3, which is 80 + 3*19= 80+57=137, which doesn't fit any of the options except perhaps option A (140-160), but 137 is just below 140.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a salt, like KBrO3. Its MW would be K (~39) + Br (80) + 3 O (16*3=48) → 39+80+48= 167 g/mol. That's in option C (160-180). And KBrO3 is a known compound.

Wait, but the question states that A4 is a binary compound of Y and F. So if Y is Br, then A4 must be a Br-F compound, not a salt with other elements like K.

Wait, so A4 is a binary compound of Br and F, so it should be BrF_x.

So, if A4 is BrF5 (MW 175), then the answer is option C.

Alternatively, if A4 is BrF3 (137), which is option A (140-160) is just above. But 137 is below 140, so it's not in any of the given ranges except D (110-130) if it's 137. But 137 is 137, which is in D's upper end.

Wait, the options are:

A)140-160

B)220-240

C)160-180

D)110-130

So 175 is in C, 137 is in between D (110-130) and A (140-160). But 137 is not in either. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation for Y's atomic weight.

Earlier, I had:

38 = 0.3196*(M +38)

So,

M +38 = 38/0.3196 ≈ 118.87

M ≈ 80.87 g/mol.

Which is about 81, which is Br.

So A2 is YF2, which is BrF2. If A2 is BrF2, then what is A1?

Earlier, I thought A1 is BrF5, which decomposes into BrF2 and F2. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is BrF3, which upon decomposition gives BrF and F2. But then A2 would be BrF, which would have a different fluorine percentage.

Wait, let me calculate the fluorine percentage in BrF.

BrF's MW is 80 + 19 =99 g/mol.

Fluorine's mass is 19. So (19/99)*100 ≈ 19.19%, which doesn't match the given 31.96%.

Hmm, so A2 can't be BrF. So if A2 is BrF2, and it's 31.96% F by mass, then A4 could be BrF5 (175 g/mol).

So the correct option is C) 160-180.


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of a binary compound A4, which is a compound of element Y and fluorine. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Key Information from the Problem:**
   - Y forms five binary compounds with fluorine.
   - A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine by mass) and fluorine gas (F2).
   - A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating it is a strong oxidizing agent.
   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, and A3 can also interact with xenon.
   - A4 is a binary compound of Y and fluorine. Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4 produces A5, which decomposes into two substances in water.

2. **Identifying Element Y:**
   - The decomposition of A1 and the fluorination of Y suggest Y is a halogen.
   - The calculation for the fluorine percentage in A2 (YF2) indicates that Y has an atomic weight of approximately 81 g/mol, which corresponds to bromine (Br).

3. **Possible Binary Compounds of Br and F:**
   - Bromine forms several binary compounds with fluorine, including BrF, BrF3, BrF5, and BrF7. These compounds are consistent with the problem's description of five binary compounds.

4. **Determining A4:**
   - A4 is a binary compound of Br and F. The decomposition of A1 and the properties of A5 suggest A4 is likely BrF5, as it is a known compound with the appropriate molecular weight and reactivity.

5. **Molecular Weight of A4:**
   - The molecular weight of BrF5 is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{MW of BrF5} = 80 \, (\text{Br}) + 5 \times 19 \, (\text{F}) = 175 \, \text{g/mol}.
     \]
   - This value falls within the range of 160–180, corresponding to option C.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the analysis, the molecular weight of A4 is in the range of 160–180.

**Answer: C**
