Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step. 

Alright, the question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The mass is m, the maximum amplitude is A, and it follows Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. Oh right, and the speed of light is c.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², and at maximum amplitude x=A, that's (1/2)kA². So the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. This question is about the relativistic case, so things are more complicated.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; there's also rest mass energy. The total energy should include both the kinetic and the potential. Oh right, in special relativity, the total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So the oscillator's total energy at any point should be the sum of its kinetic and potential energies. But wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is different? Or is it the same as classical? The problem says it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx, so the potential energy is still (1/2)kx². So at maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². 

At maximum speed, the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy E would be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) plus the kinetic energy. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement, and the kinetic energy is maximum when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium point, where x=0. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, potential and kinetic energies oscillate. So at x=0, all energy is kinetic, and at x=A, all is potential. So
