Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, let me think. I remember that ESPRESSO is on the VLT, right? The question is about the signal-to-noise ratio each star would give after a 1-hour exposure. The S/N needs to be at least 10 per binned pixel.

I need to figure out which of the given stars meet this condition. So, each star's parameters are given, like their absolute magnitude and distance. Oh, right, absolute magnitude relates to the star's intrinsic brightness. The formula I think I need is the distance modulus which connects apparent magnitude (m) with absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d in parsecs). The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10). 

So for each star, I can calculate their apparent magnitude. Once I have m, I can find the flux they provide. Wait, but how does that translate to the S/N ratio? I remember that the S/N ratio in astronomy depends on the star's brightness, the exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency.

ESPRESSO's sensitivity is a key factor. I think I should look up the typical S/N per second for ESPRESSO. Wait, from what I recall, ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, and its sensitivity might be such that it can detect stars down to a certain apparent magnitude within a certain exposure time.

Let me think. The ESPRESSO system is designed for high-precision spectroscopy. I believe it's optimized for bright stars because it's used for things like radial velocity measurements of exoplanets. So it might not detect very faint stars. 

But how does the apparent magnitude affect the S/N? The S/N ratio increases with the square root of the exposure time and the flux from the star. The flux from a star is inversely proportional to the square of the distance and depends on its intrinsic brightness (luminosity). 

Wait, the formula for flux is F = L / (4πd²), but maybe I should think in terms of magnitudes. The apparent magnitude m tells us how bright the star appears. There's a relation between flux and magnitude: each step of 5 magnitudes is a factor of 100 in flux. The formula is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where F_0 is some reference flux.

So, for each star, I calculate m, then find F. Then, using the exposure time (1 hour = 3600 seconds) and ESPRESSO's efficiency, I can compute S/N. But I don't have the exact numbers, so maybe I can find a way to compare them.

Wait, perhaps I can find the S/N threshold in terms of apparent magnitude. Let's say that for a star at a certain m, the S/N per pixel is 10. I can find what m corresponds to S/N=10 in 1 hour.

But I'm not sure about the exact relation. Alternatively, perhaps I can compare the stars based on their distance and absolute magnitude, calculate their apparent magnitudes, and see which ones are bright enough.

Let's compute the apparent magnitude for each star:

a) Canopus: It's a
