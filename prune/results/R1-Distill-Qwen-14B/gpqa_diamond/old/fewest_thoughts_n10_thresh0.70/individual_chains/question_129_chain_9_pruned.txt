Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me read through the question and the hints carefully.

Alright, the reaction scheme goes like this:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to give compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (which I think is nitrous acid) to give compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints provided are:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different ketones, so E must be a ketone. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at hint a). The reaction of compound A with a phosphorous ylide gives a specific structure. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, which form alkenes by reacting with carbonyl groups. So, compound A probably has a carbonyl group.

Wait, the product of the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that structure. It's a cyclopentane ring. Positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups. Position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached.

Wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=. So the ring at position 4 has a substituent that's an allyl group? Or maybe a substituted methylene group. Alternatively, the propan-2-ylidene group is (CH2) group attached to a CH(CH3)=.

Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclopentane with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. At 1 and 2, methyl groups. At 4, a propan-2-ylidene group, which is CH2-C(CH3)=, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, the structure is a cyclopentane where at position 4, there's a substituent which is a propenyl group—so like a double bond attached to the ring.

So the Wittig reaction adds an alkene to the carbonyl group of compound A. So compound A is a carbonyl compound, like a ketone or aldehyde. But since the product is an alkene, A must have a carbonyl group. So A is likely a cyclopentanone derivative.

Wait, because the product after the Wittig is a substituted cyclopentane with a double bond. So when a cycloketone undergoes a Wittig reaction, the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a CH2 group connected to the ylide's R group as a double bond. So the ylide would add an R2C=CH2 group or similar.

Wait, no, the Wittig replaces the carbonyl O with the R from the ylide. So if the ylide is PR3+CH2CH2R', the carbonyl becomes CH2R'.

Wait, more accurately, the Wittig reaction converts a carbonyl group (like ketone or aldehyde) into an alkene. So if A is RCO-R', reacting with a ylide (like from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide) would form RCH2-R' and an alkene.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the product. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane has methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at 4, a propan-2-ylidene group. Let me think about the structure.

Propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=, but wait, the full structure is (propan-2-ylidene) means that the substituent is a =CH-CH(CH3)- group? Or perhaps more accurately, it's a CH2 group attached to a CH(CH3) that's double bonded.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it. Let's imagine the cyclopentane ring. At position 4 there's a substituent. That substituent is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be CH2–C(=CH2)–CH3? No, wait. Propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3? I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to think that the substituent is a propenyl group attached at position 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is cyclopentane with substituents at 1,2 (methyl groups), and at 4, a group that is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. No, perhaps not. Let me think differently.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopent
