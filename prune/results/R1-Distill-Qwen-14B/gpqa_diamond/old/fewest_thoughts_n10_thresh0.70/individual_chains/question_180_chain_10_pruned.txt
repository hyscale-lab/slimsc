Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about calculating the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this probably involves electrostatic potential energy.

Alright, let's read the question again carefully. There's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each has a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. The problem says that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system.

Wait, so the setup is: the 13th charge is at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P. But wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. I'm thinking, are these 12 charges arranged in a particular way around P? Like, maybe a sphere or something? Or are they all at the same point?

Hmm, no, the problem doesn't specify their arrangement beyond their distance from P. So I think I can model this as each of the 12 charges being at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other might not matter because the question is about the potential energy of the entire system.

Now, the system's energy would be the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But wait, how do I calculate the potential energy for each pair here?

I remember that the electrostatic potential energy between two point charges is given by the formula U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²). But since I'm dealing with multiple charges, I need to consider all possible pairs.

Wait, but wait a second. Here are 13 charges. The fixed charge is at P, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So, each of these 12 contributes to the potential energy
