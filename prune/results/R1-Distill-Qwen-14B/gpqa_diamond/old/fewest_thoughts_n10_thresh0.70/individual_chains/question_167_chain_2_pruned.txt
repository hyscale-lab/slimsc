Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

First, let me read the problem carefully. The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. And N is the normalization constant, sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). The task is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure del_b, which is defined as trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

The given parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The options are A to D, with A being 2.48, B 0.25, C 1.38, and D 0.

Wait, non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. Gaussian states are like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. The Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's highly non-Gaussian. But the question is about calculating the relative entropy to a Gaussian state.

So the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state rho and that of a reference Gaussian state tau. Wait, no, actually, the formula is del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), right? Because the relative entropy is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), which is the von Neumann entropy of rho minus that of tau.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Von Neumann entropy S is -Tr(rho ln rho). So del_b would be S(rho) - S(tau). But I'm not entirely sure if it's that way around. Let me think. The problem states it as Tr(rho ln rho) minus Tr(tau ln tau), which would be the negative of the von Neumann entropy difference. Because S(rho) is -Tr(rho ln rho). So Tr(rho ln rho) = - S(rho). Similarly, Tr(tau ln tau) = - S(tau). So del_b
