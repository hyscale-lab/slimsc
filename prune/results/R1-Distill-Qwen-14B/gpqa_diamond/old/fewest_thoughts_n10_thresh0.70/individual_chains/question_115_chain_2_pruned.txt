Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the setup is: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. When they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and since energy and momentum are conserved, I should probably use those principles here.

First, let's recall some basics. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But I think for energy calculations, the relativistic energy might be more useful. The rest mass energy of an electron (and a positron, since they're antimatter) is mc², which for an electron is about 0.511 MeV. But since the Lorentz factors are given, I can compute their total energies.

So, the electron has gamma_e =4, and the positron gamma_p =2. Their energies would be gamma * m c². So electron's energy is 4 * 0.511 MeV, and positron's is 2 * 0.511 MeV.

Wait, but the positron is moving from the right, so its direction is opposite to the electron. So the electron is moving to the right (left to right) and the positron is moving to the left (right to left). So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Now, when they collide and annihilate, the two photons are produced. Both photons have the same energy, so their energies are equal. Also, their directions are upper-right and lower-right, so each makes some angle with the horizontal axis, one above and one below.

Since the problem is symmetric, perhaps the angles are symmetric above and below the horizontal. So the angle between them would be the sum of each angle from the horizontal. Or maybe the angle between them is the difference, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let me think about conservation of momentum. The
