Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. Wait, I remember that in quasars, broad emission lines are present, and the peak around 790 nm might be part of the Lyman series or something else. Oh wait, the Lyman-alpha line is around 121 nm, but that's in the UV. As the universe expands, light from distant objects is redshifted. So if the observed wavelength is longer, that means the object is moving away, right?

So the quasar's emission line is being observed at 790 nm. If the rest wavelength of that emission line is something else, like maybe the Lyman-alpha emission, which is at 121 nm. Wait, no, Lyman-alpha is in UV, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the Balmer series, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Lyman limit or something else.

Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. Let me think: near infrared starts around 700 nm, so 790 is in the near IR. If the rest wavelength is shorter, say, in the UV, like Lyman-alpha at 121 nm, then the redshift would be (790 / 121) - 1. Let me calculate that: 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.528. So 6.528 minus 1 is 5.528. So z is about 5.53.

Wait, but what if the rest wavelength is longer? Like, maybe 400 nm (visible light)? Then 790 /400 =1.975. So z=0.975. Hmm, but quasars are typically very distant, so z would be higher. So perhaps the redshift is about 5.5.

But the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance is a way to measure distance in an expanding universe. It depends on the cosmological parameters given.

The parameters given are H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m =0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Omega_total=1).

Comoving distance (D_C) is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z)) ) dz, where E(z) = sqrt( Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda ). For a flat universe, that's correct.

So the formula for comoving distance is D_C = (c/H0) * âˆ«(from 0 to z) [1 / sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda)] dz'.

I need to calculate this integral for z=5.5.

Wait, but wait, how do I compute that? I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps I can remember approximate values or use an online calculator. Alternatively, I can think about the lookback time or other distance measures.

Wait, when z is high,
