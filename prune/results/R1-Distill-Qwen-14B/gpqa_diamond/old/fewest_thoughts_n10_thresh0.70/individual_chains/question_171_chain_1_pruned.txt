Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about electrophilic substitution reactions, and I'm supposed to figure out the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer they produce. Hmm, let's see. Electrophilic substitution usually happens on aromatic rings, right? So each of these substances has a benzene ring with some substituent attached. The bromine is in excess, so it's probably a bromination reaction.

The question is about the para-isomer yield. I remember that substituents on the benzene ring can activate or deactivate the ring and also direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para. So the position where bromine adds depends on the substituent's directing effects.

Each substituent has an effect. Let me think—activating groups are usually electron-donating, and they direct incoming groups to ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups are electron-withdrawing and typically direct meta, unless they are strong deactivating groups like nitro which are meta directors.

Wait, but wait, let me list each substituent and their directing effects:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's electron-donating (through +I effect). So it should direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. So para is a major product here.

But wait, I thought sometimes bulky substituents can affect where the substitution happens. Like, steric hindrance might make para more favorable if the substituent is big and the ortho positions are crowded. But methyl is a small group, so maybe para is a major product.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That's a benzoyloxy group attached. Wait, no, wait. The substituent is COOEt, which is an ester group. Ester groups are deactivating because they are electron-withdrawing through resonance. So they are meta directors. So the incoming Br+ would go to the meta position. But wait, wait, sometimes I get confused. For ester groups, are they meta or para directors? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I remember that groups which are strongly deactivating, like nitro groups (-NO2), are meta directors. Ester groups (like -COOR) are also deactivating because the carbonyl group withdraws electrons via resonance. So they are meta directors. So the major product would be meta for this compound. But wait, if the substituent is an ester, is it ortho, meta, or para directing? Oh wait, no, the ester is a meta director. So the product would be meta-substituted.

But wait, if the substituent is a strong deactivating group, like nitro, then the para position won't be favored. But for some groups, like halogens, they are deactivating (since they are electron-withdrawing) but ortho/para directors. Because halogens have lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance, making them ortho/para directors despite being deactivating.

So in this case, the substituent is an ester group. So it's deactivating and meta-directing. So the major product would be meta-substituted. Wait, but the question is about the para-isomer. So in this case, the para-isomer would be minor. So the weight fraction of the para-isomer would be low.

3) C6H5-Cl: So the substituent is Cl. Cl is a halogen. It's deactivating because it's more electronegative, but it's ortho/para directing. Wait, why? Because Cl has lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance, which makes the ring more activated in the ortho and para positions despite being deactivating overall. So the Cl directs the incoming Br+ to ortho and para positions. But since Cl is a deactivating group, the reaction might be slower, but the substitution would be at ortho and para.

So for this compound, the major products would be ortho and para brominated. But since the question is about the para-isomer, let's think about how much of it there would be. For such substituents, the ortho and para are roughly in a certain ratio. For example, I think that para is more favored than ortho because the steric hindrance is less in para. So for Cl, the para product is more than ortho. So the weight fraction of para would be higher than for groups that only allow meta.

Wait, but let me check: for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para isomer is usually the major one. Because the two ortho positions are adjacent to the substituent, leading to more steric hindrance, so para is more favored. So for Cl, the para bromination would be major.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group. Nitro is a strong deactivating group, so meta director. So the incoming Br+ would go to the
