Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. The task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, right. So, expectation value. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate of the state multiplied by the operator acting on the state, integrated over all space. But since we're dealing with spin-½ particles, these are just two-level systems, so the state and operators can be represented using 2x1 vectors and 2x2 matrices.

First, maybe I should write down the state. The given state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Wait, let me check the coefficients. Oh, wait a minute—0.5 is 1/2, and sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. But wait, are these coefficients normalized? Because the sum of the squares should be 1 for a valid quantum state.

Calculating the squares: (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. Adding them gives 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So yeah, the state is normalized. Good.

Now, the operator is 10σz + 5σx. So to find the expectation value, which is ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩, I can compute this as 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩. That's because expectation values are linear, so I can split it into the two parts.

So I need to find the expectation values of σz and σx for the given state ψ. Then multiply them by 10 and 5 respectively and add them together.

Let me recall what the Pauli matrices are. σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], and σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Right.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to use the fact that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively.

So, for σz, the expectation value is just the probability of being in |↑⟩ times +1 plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ times -1.

In the state ψ, the coefficient of |↑⟩ is 0.5, so the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient of |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4
