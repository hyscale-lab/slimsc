Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with compound A, leading to compounds B, C, D, and finally asks to identify D from the options given. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the number of protons and their splitting can give clues about the structure.

A triplet with 6H at 0.9 ppm. That's a downfield shift? No, 0.9 is upfield, which is typical for methyl groups attached to something. Maybe a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. Because a triplet suggests two neighboring groups—so maybe like (CH3)2CH- or maybe something like that. Wait, 6H in a triplet—so that's two sets of 3H each. So two methyl groups attached to a CH2. Because a triplet for a CH2 next to another CH2 would split into a quartet, but wait, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. Let me think about splitting. If, for example, the 6H is two methyl groups (each 3H) attached to a CH2. So the CH2 would be between two CH3 groups. So the structure would be CH2(CH3)2. But wait, then the CH2 would be split by what? The CH3s? No, wait, the CH2 would be next to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH3)2CH group.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. The triplet for 6H: if each of the two CH3 groups is attached to a CH2, then each CH3 is adjacent to the CH2. So each CH3 would split into a triplet based on the neighboring CH2. No, wait, more accurately, the CH2 would be split by neighboring protons.

Wait, maybe the CH2 is next to another CH2. Like, perhaps a -CH2-CH2- structure. So if the CH2 is next to another CH2 with two protons, each
