Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but let's see what I can remember.

Alright, so the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass of 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. The problem provides some abundance ratios using the EW method. I think EW stands for Equivalent Width, which is a method used to determine the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere by measuring the strength of spectral lines.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh wait, and the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithmic abundance ratio. Specifically, [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Oh, no, wait, correction: [X/Y] is defined as log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio relative to the Sun's ratio.

Wait, no, another thought. The correct definition is [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if [X/Y] is positive, it means X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun. If it's negative, X is less abundant.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means the log of (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 minus (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun equals 0.3. Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so (n_Fe/n_H)_1 equals (n_Fe/n_H)_sun. Because
