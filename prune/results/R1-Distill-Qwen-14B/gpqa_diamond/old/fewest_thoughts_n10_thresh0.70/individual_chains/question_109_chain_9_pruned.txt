Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read through it carefully and think through what each part means. So the question involves a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. 

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to find which partial wave isn't permitted. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from 1S0 to another state plus a particle.

First, let me break down what each part means. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S must be 0 because (2*0 +1)=1. L is S, so L is 0 (s orbital). J is 0, so the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X. So the final state is NN plus X. But the problem says to consider the final NN state's quantum numbers, right? So X is emitted, and the NN system ends up in a certain state.

Pauli statistics: the isospin T, the spin S, and the orbital angular momentum L of the NN state must satisfy T = S + L +1 mod 2. Oh, wait, the problem statement says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 (mod 2). So T is parity-wise linked to S and L.

Given that T(NN) is 0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which means S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity, because adding two numbers of opposite parity gives 1 mod 2 (since 0+1=1, 1+0=1).

So for the final NN state, S and L must be such that their sum is odd.

Now, each option gives a transition from 1S0 to a new state plus a particle. Let's look at each option.

The options are:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p
B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p
C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f
D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s

Wait, each option shows the initial state, then the final NN state, and then the emitted particle.

Wait, the way it's written, it's the final state. So for example, option A is 7D1, which would be (2S+1)L J? No, wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L^J. So 7D1: 7 is (2S+1), so 2S+1=7 → S=3. L is D, which is 2. J is 1.

So the final NN state in option A has S=3, L=2, J=1. Then the particle emitted is p, which is a pseudoscalar? Or wait, the question says X has parity -1. So X is a pseudoscalar? Or maybe a spin 0 particle with parity -1. Or depends on its type.

Wait, the problem says X is emitted, and X has intrinsic parity -1. So for parity conservation, the overall parity must be considered. But wait, parity isn't necessarily conserved in strong interactions. Wait, but which interaction is this? The problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So it's assuming that parity is conserved. So the parity before and after must be the same.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. The parity of the initial state is determined by the orbital angular momentum L. Since parity is (-1)^L. For 1S0, L is 0, so parity is (+1).

After emitting X, the parity of the final state (NN plus X) must be equal to the initial parity multiplied by the parity of X. Because when you emit a particle, the parity of the system is the product of the parity of the particle and the parity of the remaining system.

Wait, the initial parity is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. Since initial L is 0, P_initial is +1.

The final parity is P_final = P_NN * P_X. Because the two nucleons (NN) have their own parity (which depends on their orbital angular momentum L_NN), and X has its own parity P_X.

So P_initial = P_final.

So, 1 = (P_NN) * (P_X).

But X has intrinsic parity -1, so P_X = -1. So:

1 = (P_NN) * (-1) → P_NN =
