Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the kinetic energy of the product particles in this decay process. Let me read it again carefully. The problem says:

Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) plus a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are for the kinetic energies, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, so the reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. But wait, neutrinos are hard to detect because they have very little mass, right? I think for this problem, we can assume the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the muon's mass. Or wait, maybe the neutrino is treated as having zero mass? I think in these kinds of problems, the neutrino's mass is considered zero because it's a common approximation, especially since it's much lighter than the other particles involved.

So, let's think about energy and momentum conservation here. The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion because it's stationary. The energy after decay will be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But since the muon has a rest mass, its energy will be the sum of its kinetic and rest energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero.

Let me write down the conservation equations. For energy:

m_pi * c^2 = gamma_mu * m_mu * c^2 + E_nu

And for momentum:

0 = gamma_mu * m_mu * v = -p_nu (since they have opposite momenta)

Wait, but I think a better approach is to use the fact that the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. Let's denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p, then the neutrino's momentum is also p but in the opposite direction.

So, for energy:

m_pi c^2 = (gamma_mu * m_mu c^2) + E_nu

And for momentum:

p = gamma_mu * m_mu v

But since E_nu = p c (because for a massless particle, energy is pc), we can write E_nu = p c.

Now, the gamma factor for the muon is gamma = (1 - (v^2/c^2))^(-1/2). Alternatively, since gamma is related to momentum, we can use the relation:

p = gamma m_mu v → but v = c^2 * p/(gamma m_mu c^2) )? Wait, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, I know that the total energy of the muon is E_mu = gamma m_mu c^2, and its momentum is p = gamma m_mu v. But since v = c^2 p/(E_mu), maybe that's not the easiest path.

Wait, another approach: using the invariant mass. The pion is at rest, so all the energy and momentum of the decay products must account for that. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must be zero. So the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta. So, their magnitudes are the same.

Let me consider that the muon has momentum p in one direction, and the neutrino has momentum p in the opposite direction. So, the total momentum is zero.

Now, the energy of the muon is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is p c (since its mass is zero). So, the sum of these energies should equal the pion's rest energy.

So,

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c = m_pi c^2

Let me simplify by dividing both sides by c^2. Let me denote m_pi as M, m_mu as m.

Then:

sqrt( (p c^2)^2 + m^2 c^4 ) / c^2 + p c^2 / c^2 = M c^2 / c^2

Wait, perhaps I should write everything in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics. So, using natural units where c=1.

So,

sqrt( p^2 + m^2 ) + p = M

So, sqrt(p^2 + m^2) + p = M

Let me solve for p. Let me set x = p.

Then,

sqrt(x^2 + m^2) + x = M

Subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x^2 + m^2) = M - x

Now, square both sides:

x^2 + m^2 = (M - x)^2 = M^2 - 2 M x + x^2

Subtract x^2 from both sides:

m^2 = M^2 - 2 M x

Rearranging:

2 M x = M^2 - m^2

x = (M^2 - m^2) / (2 M )

So, p = (M^2 - m^2) / (2 M )

Plugging in the numbers:

M = 139.6 MeV/c², m = 105.7 MeV/c².

Wait, but wait, no, since in natural units, M is in MeV/c², and if c is set to 1, perhaps units are treated in MeV and MeV/c². Hmm, perhaps I should just compute the numerical value.

So, M = 139.6 MeV, m = 105.7 MeV.

Wait, wait. No, because in natural units, c=1, so the mass is in MeV/c². But when we compute M^2 and m^2, we'd have (MeV/c²)^2, but when multiplied by c^2 (since E = m c²), the units get a bit messy. Maybe I should just proceed numerically.

So, M = 139.6, m=105.7.

p = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6 )

Compute numerator: 139.6^2 = let's see, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is a bit less. Let's compute:

139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2 = let's calculate:

100^2 = 10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and cross term 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Divide by denominator 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2:

279.2 * 30 = 8376 → which is slightly higher than 8315.67.

So 30 * 279.2 = 8376. So 8315.67 is 8376 - 60.33, which is 8376 - 60.33 = 8315.67. So how much is 30 - (60.33 /279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

So p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c. Wait, but wait, unit-wise, since in natural units, p would be in MeV/c? Because when E and m are in MeV, and c=1, then p is in MeV/c.

But I'm not entirely sure about the units here, but perhaps I can proceed with the calculation.

Now, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c. But in natural units, c=1, so E_nu = p.

So E_nu = 29.784 MeV.

The muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m^2). Let me calculate that:

p = 29.784, m=105.7.

p^2 = (29.784)^2 ≈ 887.1.

m^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49.

So sqrt(887.1 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.59) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So the muon's total energy is approximately 109.81 MeV.

But wait, the muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's kinetic energy is 29.784 MeV.

So looking at the options, the KEs are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's our answer.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again.

Wait, when I calculated p, I got around 29.78 MeV/c. So E_nu is 29.78 MeV. The muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt( 887 + 11172 ) ≈ sqrt(12059) ≈ 109.8 MeV. So KE of muon is 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

So the muon's KE is about 4.1 MeV, and neutrino's KE is 29.8 MeV. So the product particles have kinetic energies 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, that's option D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use energy and momentum conservation. The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, so its total energy is its rest energy, \(m_{\pi} c^2\). After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon (\(\mu^+\)) and the neutrino (\(\nu\)). The muon has both rest energy and kinetic energy, while the neutrino's energy is purely kinetic (since its rest mass is negligible).

### Conservation Equations
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   \[
   m_{\pi} c^2 = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} + E_{\nu}
   \]
2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   The pion is stationary, so the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p
   \]

### Simplification
Using natural units (\(c = 1\)), the total energy of the muon is \(\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\), and the neutrino's energy is \(p\). Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:

\[
m_{\pi} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p
\]

Rearranging and solving for \(p\):

\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - p
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (m_{\pi} - p)^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p + p^2
\]

Canceling \(p^2\) and solving for \(p\):

\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p
\]

\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}
\]

### Numerical Calculation
Given:
- \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\)
- \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\)

Substitute into the formula for \(p\):

\[
p = \frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}
\]

First, calculate \(m_{\pi}^2\) and \(m_{\mu}^2\):
\[
m_{\pi}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49
\]

\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c}
\]

The neutrino's energy is \(E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\).

For the muon, its total energy is:

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx \sqrt{887.1 + 11172.49} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:

\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
