Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The given data includes FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four possible formulas, and I need to pick the right one.

Starting with the FTIR data: the compound shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. I remember that esters have a characteristic carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740 cm^-1. So that's a key point. The molecule has at least an ester functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum description. It has six signals. Let's break down what each part means.

The first part says two signals correspond to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the aromatic protons could be in different environments. For a di-substituted ring, the substituents can be in para, meta, or ortho positions. If it's para, there are two equivalent sets of aromatic protons. Wait, in para substitution, the ring would have two sets of aromatic Hs: the two Hs ortho to substituents would be equivalent, and the two Hs meta would be equivalent. Wait, no, actually, for a para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other. So in a para-disubstituted benzene, the aromatic protons are all equivalent as two doublets, but wait, if the substituents are different, maybe each set is different. Hmm, maybe I need to think again. For example, if substituents are in the para positions and are different, then the aromatic Hs would split into two sets: perhaps two doublets. Because each substituent is opposite, the Hs adjacent to each substituent would be equivalent. So that would give two doublets, each integrating for two Hs.

But wait, the question states that there are two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. So maybe the substituents are such that the ring isn't too symmetric, leading to two distinct sets of aromatic protons. So that's two signals, each integrating for two Hs each, perhaps.

Next, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to a double
