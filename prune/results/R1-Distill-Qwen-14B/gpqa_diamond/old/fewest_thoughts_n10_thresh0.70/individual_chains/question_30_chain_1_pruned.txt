Okay, so I've got this question about dyes and the colors they emit or absorb. Let me think it through. Hmm, the question says that a textile dye with extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light at 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember something about the complementary color rule. Oh right, when a substance absorbs certain wavelengths, it emits others, and the emitted color is the complement of the absorbed one. Or wait, wait. Oh no, wait. No, not exactly. The color we see is the color that's not absorbed. So if a dye emits light, that emitted light is the color we see, and the absorbed light would be the complementary color. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's start from the basics. The energy of the emitted photon is given as 2.3393 eV. I think I can use the relationship between energy and wavelength to find the wavelength of emitted light. Then, knowing the wavelength, I can find the color.

The formula is E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. So rearranging, λ = hc/E.

Plugging in the numbers. Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. Speed of light c is 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. The energy E is 2.3393 eV. Oh wait, I need to convert eV to joules. 1 e
