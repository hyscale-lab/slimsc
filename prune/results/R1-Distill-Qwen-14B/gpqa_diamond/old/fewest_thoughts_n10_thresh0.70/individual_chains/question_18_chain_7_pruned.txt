Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I don't think the masses matter directly here; the question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass is just extra info.

The elemental abundances given are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, that would be [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2, right? Or wait, maybe the ratio is [Si]_1/[Si]_2, which would be (n_Si1 / n_H1) / (n_Si2 / n_H2). Since [X/H] is defined as log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X/n_H)_sun, that is, [X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - solar value.

Wait, the problem states that the photospheric composition for the Sun is:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5.

But wait, wait, that seems a bit low for the Sun's composition. Let me double-check. Oh wait, maybe I got that wrong. The standard notation is that the abundance is given as 12 + log(n_X/n_H) = some number. So for the Sun, for Fe, the number is 7.5. So 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So for Star_1 and Star_2, we have their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], and [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si].

Let me outline what each of these means.

For Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun. So log(nFe1/nH1) = same as Sun's log(nFe/nH). So [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → so nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The general formula is [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → so nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

So for Star_1, nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 / nH_sun).

Wait, but if Star_1 has the same [Fe/H] as the Sun, then H abundance is same as Sun's? Or is the H abundance in Star_1 different? Hmm, no, because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H]=0, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

So, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3. 

But from the Sun, nFe_sun/nH_sun is known. And nSi_sun is another value, but wait, the Sun's nSi isn't given. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, perhaps we can express everything in terms of H.

Wait, perhaps I can express the silicon abundance in terms of hydrogen for both stars.

Let me think in terms of [X/H] for each element.

For Star_1:

We know [
