Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem says that we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, which probably means we're focusing only on their orbital angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. I remember that in angular momentum coupling, l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, which comes from adding l₁ and l₂. So each electron has l=1 since they're in p orbitals.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z for both electrons. We need to find the joint probability that both L₁z and L₂z have eigenvalues of -ħ. So each measurement should give -ħ.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what the state |1,1,2,-1> means. In coupled basis, this state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum L² and Lz. The state is a combination of the individual angular momenta.

I recall that when you have two particles with angular momenta l₁ and l₂, the total angular momentum l can range from |l₁ - l₂| to l₁ + l₂. In this case, both l₁ and l₂ are 1, so l can be 0, 1, or 2. The given state has l=2, which is the maximum possible, so it's the state where the two angular momenta are aligned in the same direction.

The m value is -1. Wait, m is the z-component of the total angular momentum. So the total m is -1. But each electron has m₁ and m₂ such that m = m₁ + m₂ = -1.

Wait, but since the state is |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>, we're in the coupled basis, so the state is expressed in terms of the individual states. But to find the probability of measuring m₁ and m₂, I think we need to express this coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis.

The uncoupled basis is |l₁, m₁> |l₂, m₂>. So I need to find the expansion of |1,1,2,-1> in terms of |1, m₁> |1, m₂>, and then see the coefficient where m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1.

Wait, but if each L_z measurement gives -ħ, then m₁ is -1 and m₂ is -1 because Lz |m> = ħ m |m>. So the product state would be |1,-1>|1,-1>.

So the probability is the square of the amplitude of this product state in the expansion.

But how do I find this amplitude? I think I need the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to express the coupled state in terms of the product states.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states (p orbitals) to get l=2, m=-1.

The general formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is for combining two states |l₁ m₁> and |l₂ m₂> into |l m>. The coefficients are given by:

⟨ l m | l₁ m₁ l₂ m₂ ⟩ 

Which is the CG coefficient. So for our case, l=2, m=-1, and the possible m₁ and m₂ that sum to m=-1.

Wait, the possible (m₁, m₂) pairs that sum to m=-1 are:

(0, -1), (1, -2) but wait, since each m can be -1, 0, or 1. So possible pairs are:

m₁ = -1, m₂=0 → sum to -1.

m₁=0, m₂=-1 → sum to -1.

m₁=1, m₂=-2 → not possible because m₂ can't be -
