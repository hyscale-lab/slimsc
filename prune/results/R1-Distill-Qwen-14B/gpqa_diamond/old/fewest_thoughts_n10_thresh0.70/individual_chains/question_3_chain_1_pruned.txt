Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-half particle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question says the particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, right, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. So σz is the Pauli z-matrix, right? Its eigenstates are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.

The problem asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Oh wait, expectation value. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is <ψ|O|ψ>, where O is the operator. So I need to compute this for each part.

First, maybe I should break this down into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx, then add them together.

Starting with the σz part. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So the state is a combination: 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me check that they normalize. 0.5^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Yep, that's right.

The probability of spin up (σz eigenvalue +1) is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. The probability of spin down (σz eigenvalue -1) is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = (3/4)=0.75. So the expectation value of σz is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So 10 times that would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now the σx part. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Wait, actually, σx is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]], so it flips the spin states. The expectation value of σx in a state is calculated differently.

The expectation value of σx is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let's compute that.

The state ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the conjugate transpose (bra) is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)*]. Since the coefficients are real, it's just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

σx is the operator, which in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when we apply this operator to |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, we get |↓⟩ and |
