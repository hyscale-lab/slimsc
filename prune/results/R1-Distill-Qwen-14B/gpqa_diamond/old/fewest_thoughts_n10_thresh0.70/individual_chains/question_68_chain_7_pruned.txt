Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is equal to gamma times Sz. I remember that Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction, right? And the magnetic moment mu is aligned with the magnetic field. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then suddenly, the field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. After that, the average z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. The question is about the oscillation frequency.

Wait, so initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The particle's spin is aligned with that, so its magnetic moment is along Z as well. Then the field is switched to Y. So the system's environment changes, and the spin will start precessing around the new field direction, which is Y.

I remember that when a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences torque, causing it to precess. The frequency of this precession is related to the strength of the field and the gyromagnetic ratio gamma.

In the context of spin-½ particles, the energy levels are given by the Zeeman effect. The energy is proportional to the magnetic moment dot the magnetic field. So when the field is along Z, the energies are split into two levels: E = ± (gamma * B * ħ/2 ), wait
