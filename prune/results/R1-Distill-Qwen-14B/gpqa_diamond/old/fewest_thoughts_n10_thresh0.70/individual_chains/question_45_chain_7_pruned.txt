Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, let me think this through step by step.

First, the setup. The well has length L. The particles are spin-1/2, which means they're fermions, right? So they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can hold at most two particles because of the two possible spin states (up and down).

The energy levels for a single particle in an infinite well are given by the formula E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), which is written here as E multiplied by n squared. So E is the base energy unit, E = π² ħ²/(2mL²). That makes sense because for n=1, E_1 is just E.

So, for one particle, the energy levels are E, 4E, 9E, 16E, 25E, and so on. Each n gives a higher energy level.

But since we have four identical fermions, we need to fill up these energy levels according to the Pauli exclusion. Also, because they're spin-1/2, each energy level (each n) can hold two particles (with opposite spins).

So starting from the lowest energy, the ground state will have the lowest possible n. Let's figure out how the particles are filled.

Ground state: n = 1. How many particles can be here? Two, because of spin up and down. So two particles in n=1.

But wait, we have four particles. So the next step is n=2. Each n can hold two particles again. So two particles in n=2. So that's four particles total. So the ground state would have the first two levels filled: n=1 and n=2, each with two particles.

Wait, no. Wait. No, I think I messed that up. Wait, n=1 can have two particles. Then n=2 can have two more. That's four in total. So the ground state is n=1 and n=2 filled, each with two particles each. So the energy would be the sum of the energies of each particle.

Wait, but each particle in a given n has the same energy. So the two in n=1 contribute 2*(1² E) = 2E. The two in n=2 contribute 2*(4 E) =8E. So total ground state energy is 2E + 8E =10E. Wait, but looking at the options, option B and others have 4E for ground state. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm not considering the correct filling. Wait, each n can have two particles (spin up and down), so for four particles, n=1 has two, and n=2 has two. So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So the ground state energy would be 10E? But looking at the options, option B's first excited state is 10E, but that's not the ground state. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, no, the question is about the energies of the ground state,
