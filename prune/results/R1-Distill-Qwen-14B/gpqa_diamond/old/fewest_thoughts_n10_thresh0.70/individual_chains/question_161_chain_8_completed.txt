Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, I remember that mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Right, in a vacuum, the mean free path is longer because there's less gas to collide with. But wait, in this scenario, the vacuum is already super high, like <10^-9 Torr. So the mean free path λ1 is calculated under that condition.

Mike uses vacuum pumps to get that ultra-high vacuum, but some gas molecules are still there. The question says that when he starts the electron beam, the mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. And the sample temperature is the same, so that's not a factor changing here.

Wait, why would the mean free path change? Oh, because when the electron beam is active, it's probably interacting with the gas molecules. I think the electron beam can cause ionization of the gas molecules. When a gas molecule gets ionized, it becomes charged. Charged particles interact more strongly with the electric fields, right? Or maybe they stick to the walls or other surfaces more. 

So if the gas molecules are ionized, their behavior changes. For non-ionized gas, collisions are elastic, but if they're ionized, maybe they stick together or something else. Alternatively, ionized particles could be more likely to be removed by the vacuum pumps. Or perhaps the ions have a longer mean free path because they're less likely to collide with each other or the walls?

Wait, no. Wait, I think I got it backwards. If the gas is ionized, it could lead to more frequent collisions because the charged particles are more influenced by external factors, like the electric fields from the electron beam? Or maybe the ions are more likely to stick to the walls or the sample, reducing the number of gas atoms in the compartment. 

Wait, the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the pressure. Pressure is related to the number of molecules. So if some gas molecules are removed or become ions that stick to walls, the effective pressure would decrease. Wait, no, because the pressure is already ultra-low. Wait, the initial mean free path is λ1. When he turns on the electron beam, if some gas is removed, the pressure would drop, meaning fewer molecules. So if pressure decreases, mean free path increases because λ is proportional to 1/p. 

Wait, but the problem says that the sample compartment's temperature is the same, so pressure is the same. Or is it? Because the presence of the electron beam might cause gas to be pumped out more. Oh, wait, the pumps are already running. Maybe the electron beam is causing more gas to be removed because the ions are being drawn towards the walls or the vacuum system is more effective at pumping them out. 

Alternatively, the electron beam itself could cause the gas molecules to ionize, and these ions are then more easily captured by the vacuum system, effectively reducing the pressure in the compartment. If the pressure drops, then the mean free path would increase. Because, remember, the mean free path λ is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T temperature, d the diameter, and P pressure. So if pressure P decreases (because some gas is being pumped out or stuck), then λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Wait, but the question says that when Mike started the electron beam, the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2. So if the pressure effectively goes down, λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But wait, the scenario says that when Mike started the beam, the mean free path changed. So if some gas is ionized and removed, the pressure in the sample compartment would decrease. So the mean free path would increase, meaning λ2 would be greater than λ1. But looking at the options, option A says λ2 >=1.22 * λ1. Option D is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1, and option C is λ2 < λ1.

Wait, what's the 1.22 factor about? Oh, that's the factor when you go from mean free path to the transmission electron microscopy's resolution. Wait, no, perhaps it's the factor when you consider the effect of the electron beam on the gas. Wait, no, another thought: when gas is ionized, the mean free path might increase because the ions interact more with the walls or are pumped more effectively.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces additional factors like electron scattering. The electron beam causes the gas molecules to scatter electrons, which might actually increase the number of collisions for the electrons, but the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. Hmm, no, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, no, the mean free path of the gas molecules refers to how far they travel before colliding with another molecule or the walls. If the gas molecules are being ionized, they might have a longer mean free path because, as ions, they might be more quickly removed from the compartment by the vacuum pumps. Or perhaps when they become ions, they have more cross-sections for collisions? I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The mean free path depends on the pressure and temperature. If the pressure remains the same, the mean free path remains the same. But if the pressure effectively decreases because some gas is being ionized and removed, then the mean free path would increase. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >=1.22 * λ1. But where does 1.22 come from? Oh, wait, the factor 1.22 is sometimes used in relation to the de Broglie wavelength or the resolving power in electron microscopy, but perhaps it's not directly relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the effective temperature of the gas molecules, causing their mean free path to increase. But the question says the temperature remains the same, so that's not it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think again. The setup: in the ultra-high vacuum, the mean free path is λ1. When the electron beam is on, some gas is being ionized. Ionized gas has a higher chance of being captured by the walls or the vacuum system, effectively reducing the number of gas particles in the compartment. So the effective pressure (n) would decrease. So λ = 1/(n * σ), where σ is the collision cross-section. So if n decreases, λ increases. So lambda_2 would be larger than lambda_1.

So the options that have lambda_2 > lambda_1 are options A and D. So between A and D, which is it? Hmm. The question doesn't provide exact numbers, but the 1.22 factor suggests a specific relation. Wait, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the collision cross-section changes.

Wait, when gas is ionized, the collision cross-section might increase or decrease. I'm not sure. Let me think: neutral gas atoms have a certain cross-section. When ionized, they have a charge, so perhaps they are more likely to stick to surfaces or other particles, altering their effective cross-section. Alternatively, the mean free path equation also depends on whether the molecules are being removed from the system (like being pumped away) or not.

Wait, if the ionized gas is more likely to be removed (by being attracted to the walls or the vacuum system), then the number density n decreases. So λ = 1/(n * σ), so if n decreases, λ increases. So λ2 > λ1. So options A and D.

But why would the option A be 1.22 times? Maybe 1.22 is a factor related to the effective increase in mean free path when considering ionization. Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the mean free path increases by a factor of 2. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path for electrons is different, but the question is about the gas molecules. Hmm. Wait, the question says that the mean free path of the gas molecules changes. So we're talking about the gas's mean free path.

Wait, another angle. In a vacuum, the mean free path of electrons is much longer, but in this case, the gas molecules are affecting the electrons. But the question is about the gas's own mean free path. So perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are ionized, and then these ions might have a longer mean free path because they stick to the walls or are more quickly pumped away.

So the mean free path λ2 would be longer than λ1. So options A and D.

Now, the options are A) λ2 >=1.22*λ1; D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1. So which is it?

Wait, maybe the change is significant enough that the mean free path increases beyond λ1, but not by a huge factor. For example, perhaps the mean free path increases by about 20% or so, leading to λ2 ≈1.22*λ1. Or perhaps the mean free path becomes longer than λ1 by any amount, so option A.

But without specific numbers, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't directly affect the pressure but causes an increase in the mean free path because the gas molecules are more likely to be removed. So λ2 would be greater than λ1, but maybe it's more than 1.22 times? Or perhaps it's only slightly larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be more ionized, but that might not change the mean free path. Wait, ionization might increase the cross-section, making collisions more likely, thereby reducing the mean free path. Oh wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Wait, let me think again. If the gas becomes ionized, the cross-section σ increases because charged particles have more interactions. So, if σ increases, the mean free path λ = 1/(nσ) would decrease. So lambda_2 would be less than lambda_1. Oh, so that's the opposite scenario.

Wait, but how? If the gas becomes ionized, the cross-section for collisions increases. So if the same number of gas molecules are present, the mean free path would be shorter. But earlier, I thought that ionization leads to their removal, which would reduce n, leading to longer λ. So which effect dominates?

Hmm. That's a bit tricky. So two possibilities: either the ions are more likely to be removed (lower n, longer λ), or the ions have a bigger cross-section (higher σ, shorter λ). Which effect is stronger?

If the number of gas molecules decreases, even a little, the effect on λ is 1/n. If n is already very small (ultra-high vacuum), perhaps a small change in n could significantly affect λ. Similarly, if σ increases, that would directly reduce λ.

But without knowing the relative magnitudes of the changes in n and σ, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps Mike's setup leads to a scenario where the gas is being pumped out more effectively when the beam is on, so n decreases, making λ longer.

Wait, but the problem states that the mean free path is no longer λ1. So Mike's initial calculation was based on the vacuum state, but when the beam is on, the mean free path changes. So the question is whether λ2 is larger or smaller than λ1.

If the gas is being ionized, perhaps the mean free path of the gas molecules increases because the ions are more quickly removed. Alternatively, their cross-section for collisions increases, leading to shorter λ.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck between λ2 > λ1 or λ2 < λ1. Let me think about the physics.

In a vacuum, the main sources of collisions for gas molecules are other gas molecules. If the electron beam causes some of them to become ions, these ions can be more effectively pumped out of the system. So the number of gas particles in the compartment (n) would decrease. Since λ is inversely proportional to n, a lower n would lead to a higher mean free path. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Alternatively, if the ions are more likely to collide because their cross-section is larger, then λ would decrease. But which effect is more significant?

Another thought: in an ultra-high vacuum, the mean free path is already very long. The electron beam may ionize some gas, but the number of gas molecules is so low that any change in n would significantly affect λ. So even a small decrease in n would lead to a large increase in λ.

So, considering that, λ2 would be larger than λ1. So, looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1, and option C says λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but the initial question says that Mike's observation was that the mean free path was no longer λ1. So he found that it's λ2. So if the beam causes ionization which leads to a lower n, then λ2 > λ1.

So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So the options are A and D.

The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

But why would the answer be either A or D? The question doesn't provide exact numbers, but perhaps the process leads to a significant change in λ. Or perhaps in reality, the mean free path doesn't change that much, so λ2 is just a bit larger than λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the main effect is that the gas is being pumped out more effectively, so the number of gas molecules is lower than before. So, if the original λ1 was under a certain pressure, the new pressure is lower, so λ2 is larger than λ1. But without knowing the exact change, we can't say exactly how much. But the question asks what we can conclude.

The options suggest that among the choices, the possible conclusions are either λ2 ≥1.22λ1, or λ2 <λ1, or λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't allow the gas to remain neutral, so the presence of charged particles alters their movement, increasing or decreasing the mean free path.

Wait, another angle. The mean free path of electrons in the electron beam is a different matter, but the question is about the gas's mean free path. So the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas to ionize, leading to more charged particles that can interact with the beam, but the gas's own movement is what determines their mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't change the gas's mean free path because the gas is in an ultra-high vacuum, so the main factor is the number of molecules. So if the number of gas molecules is the same, the mean free path remains λ1. But the problem says that the mean free path changed, which suggests that the number of gas molecules changed.

Wait, but the question says that Mike measured λ1 based on the sample compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature. But upon starting the beam, the mean free path became λ2. So perhaps the pressure actually changed because the electron beam caused some gas to be removed or ionized, leading to a lower pressure, hence longer λ.

In that case, λ2>λ1.

So the options are A and D.

But the question doesn't specify whether it's a significant change or not. So the correct answer would be that λ2 is greater than λ1, so either option A or D.

But the initial pressure is already ultra-high, so even a small change in pressure would cause a significant change in the mean free path. For example, in the original state, λ1 is based on P1. If the pressure drops to P2=P1 - delta P, then λ2= (P1/(P2)) * λ1. So if P2 is lower, λ2 increases.

But how much would P2 be lower? If the electron beam is causing some gas to be pumped out, perhaps the pressure drops a bit. But without knowing the exact change, it's hard to say whether λ2 is greater than λ1 by a small or large amount.

The options suggest that the possible answer is either A or C. But according to reasoning, λ2 should be larger.

Looking back at the options:

A) λ2 >=1.22*λ1

B) λ2=λ1 (discrepancy)

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22*λ1

So the conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So the correct options are A or D.

Without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the correct answer is A. But I'm not completely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because the electron beam causes more scattering, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Wait, another angle: the electron beam could cause gas molecules to scatter more, which would decrease the mean free path. But wait, the mean free path refers to the gas molecules' movement, not the electrons. So the electrons' scattering is about how the electrons interact with the gas, but the gas's own mean free path is about how far they travel before colliding.

Wait, perhaps the gas's mean free path is influenced by the electron beam's presence because the electron beam might cause gas molecules to be deflected or ionized, thereby increasing the likelihood of collisions. Or perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't directly affect the gas molecules' movement, except through the process of ionization.

Wait, but the question says that Mike accurately determined the mean free path (λ1) under the ultra-high vacuum conditions. When the beam is on, the mean free path is λ2. So perhaps the presence of the beam causes additional interactions that change the effective pressure in the chamber.

If the beam is causing gas molecules to be removed from the compartment (ionized and stuck to walls or pumped away), the effective pressure decreases, leading to a longer mean free path. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the options are A or D.

But without knowing the exact change, the possible options are A or D.

Wait, the question says that the mean free path Mike found was λ1, but when the beam was on, it changed to λ2. So perhaps the presence of the beam led to a decrease in the number of gas molecules, leading to a longer mean free path.

Thus, the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So among the options, A and D say λ2 is greater.

The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22*λ1.

The question doesn't provide exact numbers, but Mike's observation is that it's no longer λ1. So the change could be either by a small or larger amount.

Given that, perhaps the best answer is A, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to be more ionized, leading to more collisions, thus shorter mean free path (λ2 < λ1). But that's the opposite of my initial thought.

Alternatively, if the beam causes the gas molecules to become ions, which are more likely to stick to the walls, then the number of gas molecules in the compartment decreases, leading to lower pressure and longer mean free path.

So λ2 would be longer than λ1, so the answer would be either A or D.

But how much longer? Without knowing, the options don't specify, but the question says that Mike accurately determined λ1, so perhaps the only conclusion is that λ2 is longer. So the options are A and D. If the answer is that λ2 is longer, then the options are A or D.

But how to choose between A and D.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation of λ1 was based on the assumption that all gas molecules are neutral. When the beam is on, some are ionized, which have a greater cross-section for collisions, so λ would decrease. But wait, if some molecules are ionized and pumped out, then their number (n) decreases, leading to an increase in λ.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. I think the best approach is to conclude that the mean free path increases because the pressure effectively decreases when the electron beam is on.

So λ2 > λ1, so the correct options are A or D.

But looking at the options again. The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

So the correct answer would be either A or C.

Wait, but I'm in a loop. Let me think of a real-world analogy. In an electron microscope, when you turn on the electron beam, does the presence of the beam lead to more gas molecules being ionized and pumped away? I think yes, because the vacuum system is more effective at removing ions, which have a higher charge and are more easily captured.

So if the number of gas molecules decreases when the beam is on, the mean free path increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is larger than λ1.

Looking back at the options, A and D are the possible choices. So which is it?

The question doesn't specify how much λ2 has changed. So perhaps the answer is A) λ2 >=1.22*λ1.

But why 1.22? Wait, perhaps the 1.22 factor comes from the de Broglie wavelength or something else in electron microscopy. Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of the electron beam, the effective pressure decreases by a certain factor.

Alternatively, 1.22 is the factor for the coherence length or something else. Wait, in electron microscopy, the resolving power is related to the wavelength of the electrons. But that's probably not relevant here.

In any case, I think the correct conclusion is that λ2 is larger than λ1, so the options are A or D. Without more data, perhaps the answer is A, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, but that would be if the mean free path decreased, which I thought was possible but less likely.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes more scattering of the gas molecules, which would increase the collision rate, thus decreasing the mean free path. So in that case, λ2 would be smaller than λ1. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path of the gas molecules isn't directly affected by the electron beam, so λ2 would remain λ1. But the question states that the mean free path changed.

I think I'm stuck between options A and C. But based on the reasoning that the electron beam causes gas to be removed (lower pressure, higher mean free path), the answer should be A or D.

Wait, perhaps in the presence of the electron beam, the gas is more likely to be ionized, causing their removal, thus lowering the number of gas particles. This would make the mean free path longer. So λ2 is larger than λ1.

Therefore, the correct answer is either A or D. Without knowing the exact change, but given the options, perhaps the answer is A. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, think of another approach. The mean free path λ is given by the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P). So if pressure P decreases, then λ increases.

If the electron beam causes the number of gas molecules to decrease, P decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

But how much does P decrease? If the decrease in P is significant, λ2 can be larger than λ1 by a factor greater than 1.22. Alternatively, the decrease might be small, leading to λ2 being between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

But without knowing, the options are A and D.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the effect of the electron beam on the gas. The electron beam can cause gas molecules to be ionized, which can be more effectively removed by the vacuum system. Thus, the effective pressure decreases, so λ increases.

But the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. So perhaps the beam's presence leads to a lower pressure, longer λ.

So I'll conclude that λ2 is larger than λ1, so options A or D.

Now, the options are A and D.

But considering that the change might not be more than a certain factor, perhaps it's more likely that λ2 is just a bit larger than λ1, so D would be the answer.

Wait, but why would it be less than 1.22 times? Maybe because the pump can't remove all the gas, so the pressure doesn't drop too much.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam doesn't cause a significant drop in pressure, so λ2 is just a bit larger than λ1.

In that case, option D would be correct: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the correct answer is A.

Wait, another approach. The mean free path is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P). If the pressure P is the same, then λ remains the same. But if the presence of the electron beam changes the effective pressure, perhaps due to the gas being ionized and removed, then P is lower, so λ is higher.

But how much lower is P? If the number of gas molecules is reduced, but not by a huge factor, perhaps λ2 is just a bit higher than λ1.

In that case, option D would be correct.

But without exact numbers, it's hard to tell.

Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is C) λ2 < λ1. Because when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to scatter electrons, which might cause more collisions, thus a shorter mean free path.

Wait, no. The mean free path of the gas molecules is about how far they travel before colliding with each other or the walls, not about how they interact with the electron beam.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up concepts. The mean free path of the gas is about their movement, not about the electron beam. So if the gas molecules are ionized and pumped away, their number decreases, leading to longer mean free path. So λ2 is larger than λ1.

Thus, the correct answer is A or D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1. Because the presence of the electron beam causes more collisions, which would reduce the mean free path.

Wait, but the gas molecules' mean free path is about how far they go before hitting something. If the electron beam is causing them to move more or be removed, perhaps the mean free path would be longer.

Alternatively, the presence of the beam might cause gas molecules to be deflected, leading to more collisions, thus a shorter mean free path.

I'm getting a bit stuck. I think the intended answer is C) λ2 < λ1. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, in the setup, Mike found that the mean free path decreased. So the answer should be C.

But how? Because when the beam is on, the gas's mean free path would be affected.

Wait, perhaps because the electron beam causes the gas to heat up, increasing the temperature. But the question states that the sample compartment temperature remains the same, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to expand, but that's not likely under ultra-high vacuum.

Alternatively, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be ionized, hence their cross-section for collisions increases. So the mean free path would decrease, as σ increases. So λ2 = 1/(n σ). If σ increases, λ decreases.

So, in that case, λ2 < λ1. So the correct answer is C.

But wait, if σ increases, and n stays the same, then λ decreases. But if n decreases because the ions are pumped out, then the effect on λ depends on which effect is stronger.

Hmm. Let's model this.

Original λ1 = 1/(n σ).

When the beam is on, suppose σ becomes σ', and n becomes n'. So λ2 = 1/(n' σ').

We need to find whether λ2 is greater than or less than λ1.

If both σ' > σ and n' < n, then the change in λ is ambiguous.

But perhaps the change in n is more significant than the change in σ.

If n' = k n, and σ' = m σ, then λ2 = 1/(k n * m σ) )= 1/(k m n σ) )= (1/(k m)) * (1/(n σ)) )= (1/(k m)) * λ1.

So if (1/(k m)) >1, then λ2> λ1.

But without knowing k and m, it's hard to say.

But perhaps the main effect is that n' is significantly less than n, leading to λ2 > λ1.

So, perhaps the correct answer is A or D.

But the question says that Mike found the mean free path was no longer λ1; it's now λ2. So, considering all, I think the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but why? Maybe because the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, leading to more frequent collisions, thus a shorter mean free path.

Alternatively, the electron beam's presence might cause the gas to expand, but that wouldn't necessarily affect the mean free path in a straightforward way.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam imparts additional energy to the gas molecules, but the temperature is kept the same, so maybe it's not a factor.

After a lot of thinking, I think the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1.


The question revolves around the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum chamber of a transmission electron microscope. Initially, Mike calculates the mean free path as λ₁ under ultra-high vacuum conditions. However, upon activating the electron beam, he observes a change in the mean free path to λ₂. The task is to determine the relationship between λ₂ and λ₁.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Basics**:  
   The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the pressure (P) and depends on the collision cross-section (σ) of the gas molecules. The formula is:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{n \sigma}
   \]  
   where \( n \) is the number density of gas molecules.

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**:  
   - When the electron beam is activated, it can ionize some gas molecules. Ionized particles (charged) interact differently with the system, potentially being removed more effectively by the vacuum pumps or sticking to surfaces.  
   - If the number of gas molecules (\( n \)) decreases due to ionization and removal, the pressure effectively decreases, leading to an increase in the mean free path (\( \lambda \)).  
   - However, ionization could also increase the collision cross-section (\( \sigma \)) of the gas molecules, as charged particles are more likely to interact with each other or the walls, potentially reducing the mean free path.

3. **Balancing Effects**:  
   - The decrease in \( n \) (due to ionization and removal) tends to increase \( \lambda \).  
   - The increase in \( \sigma \) (due to ionization) tends to decrease \( \lambda \).  
   - The net effect depends on which factor dominates. Given the ultra-high vacuum conditions, the decrease in \( n \) is likely the dominant effect, leading to an overall increase in \( \lambda \).

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (\( \lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1 \))**: Suggests a significant increase in the mean free path. This could occur if the electron beam causes a substantial reduction in \( n \), but the question does not provide enough evidence to confirm such a large change.  
   - **Option B (\( \lambda_2 = \lambda_1 \))**: Implies no change in the mean free path, which contradicts the problem statement that λ₂ is no longer equal to λ₁.  
   - **Option C (\( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \))**: Suggests a decrease in the mean free path, which would occur if the increase in \( \sigma \) dominates over the decrease in \( n \). However, under ultra-high vacuum conditions, the decrease in \( n \) is more likely to have a significant impact.  
   - **Option D (\( \lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1 \))**: Suggests a moderate increase in the mean free path, which aligns with the expectation that \( n \) decreases but not by enough to reach the factor of 1.22.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The presence of the electron beam likely causes some gas molecules to be ionized and removed, reducing \( n \) and increasing \( \lambda \). However, the increase is not expected to be as large as the factor of 1.22. Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that \( \lambda_2 \) is greater than \( \lambda_1 \) but less than \( 1.22 \lambda_1 \).

ANSWER: D
