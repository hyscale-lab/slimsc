Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this nuclear physics question. Hmm, let's read it carefully. 

The problem is about a nuclear decay process. The original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. Both E and V are much lighter particles. The energy spectrum of E is continuous with some endpoint value Q. 

Then there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the new reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. I need to compare the energy spectrum of E in this variant to the original.

Wait, I remember that in decay processes, when particles are emitted, their energy distributions depend on conservation laws, like energy and momentum. But why does the original E have a continuous spectrum? Oh right, probably because the decay has multiple possible outcomes for the particles' energies, leading to a range of possible energies for E.

In the original case, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So a lot of particles are being emitted. The E's have a continuous spectrum because their energies can vary as the decay proceeds, depending on how the energy is distributed among the products.

In the variant, they emit M instead of two V's. M is massless, so it's like a photon or something similar. So the equation becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

Wait, how does emitting M affect the energy distribution of E? Let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

In the original decay, the 2A system is probably at rest. So the total initial momentum is zero. After decay, the total momentum must also be zero. So the momenta of all the products must balance each other.

For the original case, the 2E and 2V particles must share the momentum in such a way that their total is zero. That's why the E's have a continuous spectrum; their energies can vary, but their momenta are tied together with the V's.

In the variant, instead of two V's, we have M, which is massless. So M would carry away momentum, but since it's massless, its energy is equal to its momentum times c squared (assuming c=1 units). Or wait, M is massless, so E = p * c^2, but since it's massless, maybe it's E = |p| * c^2. But M being massless would have E = pc (if we set c=1, then E = |p|). 

But how does this affect the E particles? Let me think about the system. The total energy and momentum must be conserved.

In the original case, the E particles' energies are spread over a continuous range because the V particles can have varying energies, leading to different possible energy distributions for E. But when we replace two V's with a single M, which is massless, perhaps the system allows for more degrees of freedom or fewer constraints, which might change the energy distribution of E.

Wait, in the original scenario, the E's and V's all carry away energy and momentum. So the E particles can have a range of energies, but in the variant, since M is massless and perhaps emitted in a particular direction,
