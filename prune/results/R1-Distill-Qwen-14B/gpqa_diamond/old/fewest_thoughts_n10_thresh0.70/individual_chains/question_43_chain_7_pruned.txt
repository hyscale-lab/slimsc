Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read the question again and break it down step by step.

The molecule in question is a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is the aldehyde group attached to the benzene), and a cyano group. These three are all meta to one another. That means each of them is positioned so that there are two carbons between them. So, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the cyano and aldehyde would be at 4 and 7 (but wait, benzene has six positions, so maybe I should think in terms of numbering them correctly).

Wait, benzene has six positions. So meta would mean two positions apart. Like, positions 1, 3, and 5 would all be meta to each other? Hmm, no, wait: meta is two positions away. So, if one substituent is at position 1, the next meta would be position 3, and another meta would be position 5. So all three substituents (carboxylic acid, aldehyde, cyano) are in positions 1, 3, and 5, but the question says they're all meta to one another. Hmm, maybe they are each separated by two positions. So perhaps each is meta to another.

Wait, the question says: a benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another.
