Okay, so I've got this pretty complicated question about molecular biology and genetics, specifically involving transmembrane receptors and expression vectors. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question involves a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and we're looking at why a green signal isn't showing up in the mice after certain crosses and experiments. So, let's parse the setup.

First, the ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets that form a binding site. So, that's the structure, but I'm not sure how that affects the experiment yet.

The part about the bicistronic lox-Cre vector is crucial. Bicistronic means two genes in one construct. The vector has the ligand ORF at 5' fused to mCherry. Then, the receptor ORF is at 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the ligand is first, then the receptor after.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I remember is a strong promoter, maybe for high expression. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES regulatory element. IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry, so they can drive translation of a second gene without requiring a second promoter. So, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES, which is probably in a polycistronic construct.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is first, followed by the stop cassette with loxP, and then the IRES, then the receptor with another stop in lox2272. So, the construct is ligand (with CBA promoter) followed by a stop (loxP-stop), then IRES, then receptor (with lox2272-stop). So, the ligand and receptor are both expressed from the same vector, but in a regulated way.

When Cre is introduced, it will excise the loxP sites. So, if the ligand is under CBA, and the loxP-stop is in front of mCherry, perhaps when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP would be expressed when the lox2272 stop is removed.

Wait, so the vector is set up so that without Cre, the ligand is expressed along with mCherry, but the receptor is not expressed because the lox2272 stop is in place. Or is it the other way around? Or perhaps the IRES is allowing the receptor to be co-expressed with the ligand in some way.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, which usually means two cistrons (two expression units) in one construct. But here, the ligand is first with its own promoter (CBA) and the stop in loxP. Then the IRES, followed by the receptor and another stop in lox2272.

So, I think the ligand is under the CBA promoter, so it's
