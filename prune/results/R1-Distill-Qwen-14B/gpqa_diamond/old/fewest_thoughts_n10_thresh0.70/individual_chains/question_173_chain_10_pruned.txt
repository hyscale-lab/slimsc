Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm kinda new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about the uncertainty principle, right? I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is involved here. The question says the electron is moving along the x-direction with a certain speed, and there's an uncertainty in its position. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in its energy.

Hmm, wait. So the Uncertainty Principle basically says that you can't simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other. The formula I remember is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, sometimes I've seen it written as just Δx Δp ≈ ħ, depending on the context. I think for this problem, the exact constant factor might not matter as much since we're dealing with orders of magnitude.

So, given that Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters, or 1e-10 meters. And the speed v is 2e8 m/s. But wait, do I need the speed for this problem? Because I'm trying to find the uncertainty in energy, which relates to the uncertainty in momentum. Or maybe velocity comes into play for something else here.

Wait, no. The question is about the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. So perhaps I need to relate Δp to ΔE. Because the kinetic energy of a particle is (p²)/(2m), where m
