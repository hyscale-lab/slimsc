Okay, so I'm trying to solve this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that we have a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are A to D, and I have to pick the correct one.

Alright, so first, the vector field is radial and has a magnitude of 1/r². So in spherical coordinates, the vector field f(r) would be along the r-hat direction. That makes sense because it's specified to have only the radial component.

Now, the question is about the divergence of this field. I remember that divergence in spherical coordinates is a bit different from Cartesian. The divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is given by:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r) + (other terms for angular components), but since our field has only the radial component, those other terms would be zero.

So in this case, f_r is 1/r². Plugging that into the formula:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² (1/r²) ) ].

Let me compute that inside part first. r² multiplied by 1/r² is just 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = (1/r²)(0) = 0.

Wait, but wait a second. If the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin, then the integral of the divergence over the volume of the sphere should be zero. But wait, is there a point where r is zero? Because at r=0, the field is not defined since we're dividing by r², so there's a singularity there. But when we're integrating in volume, we can't just consider a point. So the divergence is zero in all space except at r=0, but the integral would be zero because that's a measure zero point.

Wait, but wait again. I think I might
