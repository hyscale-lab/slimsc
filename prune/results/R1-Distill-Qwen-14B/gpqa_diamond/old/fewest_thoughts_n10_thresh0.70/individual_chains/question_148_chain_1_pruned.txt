Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Hmm. So Y is some element that forms multiple compounds with F. Let me think—binary compounds mean two elements, so Y and F in different combinations.

The substances are labeled A1 to A5. Let's go through each clue step by step.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, like 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the decomposition reaction might look like A1 → A2 + F2 or something similar. The oF of A2 is 31.96%. Wait, oF usually stands for oxygen-free, but maybe here it's the oxygen-free fraction. Or maybe it's the percentage of fluorine by mass. That makes more sense. So the fluorine content in A2 is 31.96%.

Wait, 31.96% F by mass. Let me think about possible compounds. Fluorine has an atomic weight of about 19. So if a compound has a high percentage of F, maybe it's something like YF3? Let's see: for YF3, the percentage of F would be (3*19)/(atomic weight of Y + 3*19) * 100. Suppose Y is Cl? No, Cl's atomic weight is around 35.5. Let's compute. 3*19 = 57. If Y is, say, 35.5, then 57/(35.5+57) = 57/92.5 ≈ 61.6%. Hmm, that's higher than 31.96%. Maybe Y is a heavier element. Let's see: suppose the compound is YF. Wait, would that make sense? YF would have F percentage of 19/(Y+19) *100. We need 31.96% so:

19/(Y+19) = 0.3196 → Y+19 = 19 / 0.3196 ≈ 60 → Y ≈
