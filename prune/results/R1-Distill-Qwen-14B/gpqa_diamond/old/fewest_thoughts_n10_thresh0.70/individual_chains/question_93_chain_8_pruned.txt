Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Let me think through it step by step. 

Alright, the setup is that a scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and ran serial dilutions with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. So, all the technical details look perfect on the surface.

Looking at the data, let's see what's going on. For each concentration, he has triplicate Ct values. 

At 100,000 copies/µl, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. That's a pretty tight spread, like an average of 34.2. Then at 10,000 copies, it's 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Hmm, same pattern, each step down in concentration gives a lower Ct. But wait, each step is a tenfold dilution, right? Because 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10x decrease, then 1,000 is another 10x, and so on.

In qPCR, the Ct (threshold cycle) is inversely proportional to the amount of target. So higher concentrations (more copies) reach the threshold earlier, meaning lower Ct values. So, as concentration decreases by tenfold each step, the Ct should increase by a certain amount based on the efficiency.

The efficiency is 100%, which in qPCR terms usually means a 100% efficient amplification, so each cycle doubles the target. Wait, no, wait. Efficiency is usually expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible, which is 100% when each cycle perfectly doubles the amount. So with 100% efficiency, each cycle doubles the DNA. 

The formula for the relationship between Ct and concentration is usually something like Ct = -log10(N) * (1/slope) + intercept. But wait, I think the standard formula is based on efficiency. So the calculation between dilutions and Ct change depends on both the efficiency and the dilution factor.

Wait, the user said the slope is -3.3. So in the equation Ct = (1 / efficiency) * log10(dilution factor) + some constant. But wait, I might be mixing up the formula. Let's think again.

In a standard calibration curve, the Ct is inversely related to the logarithm of the starting quantity. The equation is usually Ct = a - b log(Q), where Q is the quantity (copies/µl), and a and b are constants. The slope (b) is calculated based on the efficiency. 

The formula for the slope (b) is related to the efficiency (E) as b = -1 / log10(E). Since E is 1.0 (100% efficiency), log10(1.0) is 0, which would make the denominator zero. Wait, but that can't be right because then the slope would be undefined,
