Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quasar question. Hmm, let me think. So the question is about the observations of a quasar's spectrum and figuring out the comoving distance from Earth in a universe described by the Lambda-CDM model. 

Wait, the question says that the quasar has a peak at around 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. Oh right, I remember something about the Lyman-alpha forest or emission lines. But wait, let me get this straight. 

I think the peak at 790 nm might be the Lyman-alpha emission line. Wait, no, Lyman-alpha is at about 121 nm in the ultraviolet. Oh, but when that line is observed redshifted, it would be in the optical or infrared. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's longer than the rest wavelength, which suggests redshift.

So the formula for redshift (z) is observed wavelength (λ_obs) divided by rest wavelength (λ_rest) minus one. Right, z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1. So λ_rest for Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm. 

Let me calculate that. Observed is 790 nm. So 790 / 121.6 is approximately... let's see. 121.6 * 6 is 729.6. 790 is about 6.47 times 121.6? Let me do the division: 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.498. So z would be 6.498 - 1 = 5.498. So z ≈ 5.5. 

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, sometimes the Balmer series is in optical. Like H-alpha is at about 656 nm rest, but if we see it at 790, that would be a redshift. Let me think. H-alpha is 656.3 nm. So 790 / 656.3 is about 1.204. So z would be ~0.204. That's a much smaller redshift. But would the flux drop off below 790? If the peak is in optical, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman-alpha line that
