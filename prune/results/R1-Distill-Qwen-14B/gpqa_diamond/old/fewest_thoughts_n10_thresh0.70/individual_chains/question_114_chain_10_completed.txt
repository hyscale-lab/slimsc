Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem has two reactions, and I need to determine the reagents A and B that are suitable for each. 

First reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. 

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different A and B reagents.

Hmm. Let me think about each reaction.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN and a reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no, butan-2-one would be (CH3)2CO — that's correct.

Adding NaCN — which is a nucleophile. Oh wait, but ketones reacting with cyanide. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it typically undergoes nucleophilic addition. But wait, in the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps?

Wait, in the presence of H3O+ (a strong acid), the ketone would be protonated to make the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- could attack the carbonyl carbon. This would form a cyanohydrin. 

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see. The structure would be: 

The starting ketone is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN-, adding across the carbonyl, the product would have an -OH and -CN group on the same carbon.

So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, adding CN- gives (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think of the structure. 

Butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be:

The main chain is four carbons. The nitrile is on the fourth carbon (butanenitrile), but wait, wait. Let me count. No, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents on the second carbon.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be:

The molecule has four carbons, with a hydroxyl and methyl group on the second carbon, and a nitrile group? Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN — but the product's structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile on the end. So maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the product. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Reacting with HCN (or NaCN in acidic conditions) would form a cyanohydrin. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the molecule would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, butanenitrile has four carbons. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it forms a cyanohydrin, the product would have the structure (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's:

The central carbon (originally the carbonyl) is connected to two CH3 groups, an OH, and a CN. So the formula is C4H7NO. So the product would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Or wait, wait, but wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, which is four carbons. So the product would have four carbons in total. Let's see:

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons (since the ketone is at position 2 of a four-carbon chain, but wait no, butan-2-one is (CH3)C(O)CH2CH3? No, wait no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO — which is (CH3)2CO, which has three carbons? Wait, no, butan-2-one has four carbons. Oh wait, no: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO where the carbonyl is on C2, so the structure is CH2(CO)CH2CH3? No, that's incorrect. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH2CH2)CO. Wait, butan-2-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Oh wait, no, that's pentan-2-one. Wait, butan-2-one would be CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3, but that's not possible because ketones need to be on a carbon with at least two other carbons. Wait, no: butan-2-one structure is (CH3)2CO — so it's (CH3)2-C(=O)-CH2? No, butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is a four-carbon chain (butane) with the ketone group on the second carbon. So structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be pentan-2-one. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the names. Let me think: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Because butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait butane has four carbons, so butan-2-one is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: C=O connected to carbon 1 and 3.

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: CH3.

Wait, no, that would make it (CH3)2CO, which is butan-2-one. So the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be pentan-2-one. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So, the structure is (CH3)2C=O, which is acetone. Oh wait, acetone is propan-2-one. So butan-2-one is a four-carbon ketone. So the structure would be (CH2CH3)COCH3? Or maybe CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-? No, that would be pentan-2-one. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the product isn't the main point for the first reaction; perhaps I should focus on the reagents.

So, the first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A. The product is a cyanohydrin. For the formation of cyanohydrins, the reaction is typically done in acidic conditions, like with H3O+ (protonation of the carbonyl oxygen) to make the carbonyl more electrophilic, allowing the CN- to attack. So reagent A is probably H3O+.

So in the first reaction, A would be H3O+.

Looking at the options: option A says A is H3O+; option B also has A as H3O+; option C and D have A as NaHSO3. So either options A or B for the first part.

Now onto the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the starting compound has a nitrile group, and the product is a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid. How does that happen? 

The typical way to convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is through hydrolysis. The conditions can vary. In acidic conditions, using HCl or H2SO4, perhaps. Alternatively, using H2O with a strong acid or base.

Wait, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. The hydrolysis under acidic conditions would involve adding H2O in the presence of an acid catalyst. Alternatively, under basic conditions with H2O and then acidification.

But the reagent B is H2O, so maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction, perhaps in the presence of an acid catalyst.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile attached to a larger structure. So, perhaps the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

The nitrile group (CN) is converted to COOH under hydrolysis. The common reagents for this are strong acids like HCl or H2SO4, or a strong base like NaOH, followed by acid work-up.

But in the question, the reagent B is H2O, but perhaps with an acid or base as a catalyst.

Wait, the starting material has a hydroxyl group (OH) as well, so it's 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. After hydrolysis, it becomes 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid.

But how does this happen? The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. For example, in the presence of H2SO4 and heat, or using HCl and H2O.

Wait, another possibility is using a strong acid like H2SO4 (which could provide H+), but in the options, B could be HCl or CH3COOH.

Looking at the options for B: in option A, B is HCl; option B, B is CH3COOH; option C, B is HCl; option D, B is CH3COOH.

So, the second reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid in the presence of H2O and reagent B. So which conditions are correct?

Typically, nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid requires strong acidic conditions. For example, HCl with heat. Alternatively, using a strong base followed by acid work-up. But in the options, reagent B is HCl or acetic acid.

Wait, but if reagent B is HCl, then the solution is acidic, which would facilitate the hydrolysis. So, the reaction would proceed via acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. 

So for the second reaction, reagent B would be HCl, which would make the solution acidic, allowing the nitrile to hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait, another thought: sometimes, for nitrile hydrolysis, a mixture like H2O with HCl and heat is used. Alternatively, in the presence of a peroxide, but that's for different conditions.

Wait, but in the options, B is either HCl or acetic acid. So, if B is HCl, that would provide the acidic condition needed. So the second reagent B is HCl.

But wait, another possibility: sometimes, nitriles can be hydrolyzed in the presence of a weak acid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses H2O with a catalyst like H2SO4, but in the options, the only acidic catalysts are HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, so for the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O, but perhaps the reaction requires an acid catalyst. So if the solution is HCl (B is HCl), then the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

So putting it together, for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (from options A and B), and for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl (so options A and C).

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → correct for both?

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Wait, but what about the first reaction. If A is H3O+, that suggests an acid catalyst, which is correct for the cyanohydrin formation.

So if option A is correct for both, then the answer is option A.

Wait, but let's double-check. For the first reaction, butanone + NaCN + H3O+ → cyanohydrin. Yes, that makes sense.

Second reaction, nitrile + H2O and HCl → carboxylic acid. Yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A) A = H3O+, B = HCl → would fit.

But wait, another point: when NaHSO3 is used, perhaps it's for something else. Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- which can act as an acid. But for cyanohydrin formation, H3O+ is typically used as a catalyst.

So considering all this, the correct reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl. So looking at the options, that's option A.

Wait, but wait another point. In the second reaction, the structure is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So when the nitrile group (CN) is at the end, hydrolysis would give a carboxylic acid. But the reaction is happening under what conditions?

The reaction is B = H2O. So the reagent in the second reaction is H2O and B (which is HCl). So the conditions are aqueous HCl.

So, H2O and HCl. That makes sense for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid.

So the options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl → correct.

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH → but CH3COOH is a weak acid. Would that be enough for the hydrolysis? I'm not sure. Maybe HCl is better because it's a strong acid.

So options A and C have B as HCl. For the first reaction, option A has A as H3O+.

Thus, the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to determine the suitable reagents A and B for each step.

### Reaction 1: Formation of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
The starting material is butan-2-one, which reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation typically occurs under acidic conditions, where the carbonyl group is protonated to make it more electrophilic, allowing CN⁻ to attack. The product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, confirms that the reaction involves the addition of CN⁻ to the carbonyl carbon. Therefore, reagent A must be an acid catalyst, such as **H₃O⁺**.

### Reaction 2: Conversion of Nitrile to Carboxylic Acid
The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which reacts with reagent B (H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Such hydrolysis typically requires acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, the reaction likely proceeds under acidic conditions. Among the options, **HCl** is a strong acid that facilitates this reaction, making reagent B = HCl.

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions. H₃O⁺ is suitable for cyanohydrin formation, and HCl is suitable for nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is less effective for nitrile hydrolysis compared to HCl.

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is not suitable for cyanohydrin formation, as H₃O⁺ is typically required for this reaction.

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.

### Conclusion
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which correspond to **Option A**.
