Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about transmission electron microscopes and gas molecules in the vacuum chamber. Hmm, let's break it down.

The setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution TEM at 1000 kV accelerating voltage. He's using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. That's really low pressure, so there shouldn't be many gas molecules around. But even then, some gas particles are present, as detected by a mass spectrometer. So, the sample compartment isn't a perfect vacuum.

Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. I remember the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T temperature, d the diameter of the molecules, and P pressure. Or wait, maybe another version where it's (1/√2) multiplied by something. Either way, lower pressure (P) should increase the mean free path because there's less gas around, so molecules travel longer before hitting another.

But when he starts the electron beam, something happens. Now, the mean free path becomes λ2, which is different from λ1. But the temperature is the same, so T hasn't changed. So why would λ change?

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the chamber. The electrons are at a high energy because the accelerating voltage is high. High-energy electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize or perhaps even get knocked out of the vacuum chamber. Or maybe the electron beam causes the gas molecules to collide more frequently because the electrons are interacting with them.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam heats the gas molecules, but the question states the temperature remains the same. So temperature isn't varying. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the electron beam might cause the gas to become ionized. If the gas molecules are ionized, their effective diameter changes. Or perhaps the presence of charged particles (ions) affects the mean free path because ions interact differently than neutral molecules. Or maybe the electron beam itself contributes to collisions with the gas molecules, altering their mean free path.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving fast and can collide
