Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene, but wait, no, waitâ€”Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, actually a bicyclic structure no, wait, no. No, wait. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic structure? Wait, no, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene? Wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene. Wait, no, I think limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene. Oh wait, no, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene. No, wait. Let me think. Oh, right, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene. Wait, no, limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene. Hmm, maybe I should look that up, but since I can't, I'll proceed with what I know.

Wait, Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, so it has a structure with a cyclohexene ring, I think. It's a bicyclic monoterpene, so perhaps it's a bicyclo structure, like bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene or something. Wait, no, limonene is actually a cyclic monoterpene
