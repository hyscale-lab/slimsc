Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I need to break this down.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an -OH stretch, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an acid. Oh wait, but for a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually broader and around 2500–3300. The 1720 cm-1 could fit that. Also, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches.

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm which is a broad singlet, probably an -OH proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So maybe a substituted benzene with two substituents opposite each other.

In the NMR, at 2.9 ppm, there's a multiplet integrating to 1H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Wait, in a propyl chain, the middle CH2 would be around 1.7. Then, 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to something that's probably a CH, like in an isopropyl or similar. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, like at the end of an ethyl or propyl chain.

Putting this together, the molecule likely has a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group. The substituent might be a propyl chain attached via a carbonyl. Wait, but wait. The IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which is a bit lower than a typical ketone (which is around 1700-1750). Wait, actually, maybe. Alternatively, if it's an acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, so 1720 could fit. But wait, the broad peak at 10.5 is really strong for an -OH, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

So the structure is probably a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a -COOH group. Let me think about the substituent attached to the benzene. The NMR shows a
