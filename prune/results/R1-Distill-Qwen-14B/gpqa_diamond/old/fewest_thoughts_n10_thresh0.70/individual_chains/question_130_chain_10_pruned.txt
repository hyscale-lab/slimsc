Okay, so I've got this question here about redshift and detecting objects using optical telescopes. Hmm, let's think. I remember that redshift is related to how much the universe has expanded since the light was emitted. The Lyman-alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which I think is in the ultraviolet range. Oh wait, but optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs that light, right? So how does that factor in?

The question is about clouds of neutral hydrogen absorbing light from background quasars. So the quasar emits light, and as it travels, the hydrogen clouds absorb at the Lyman-alpha wavelength. But if the quasar is at a high redshift, the wavelength we observe would be longer, right? Because redshift stretches the wavelength.

So when the quasar's light passes through a hydrogen cloud at redshift z, the Lyman-alpha absorption line would be observed at (1 + z) * 1216 Angstroms. But wait, the question is about whether this can be detected with optical telescopes. So what's the cutoff for optical wavelengths?

Optical telescopes typically work in the range of about 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait. 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms and 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength needs to be within that range for an optical telescope to detect it.

So the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = (1 + z) * 1216 Angstroms. We need lambda_obs <= 7000 Angstroms (since that's the upper end of optical). Let's solve for z.

(1 + z) * 1216 = 7000
1 + z = 7000 / 1216
Let me calculate that. 7000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1216 times 5 is 6080. 7000 - 6080 = 920. So 5 + 920/1216. 920/1216 is roughly 0.756. So 5.756. So 1+z is about 5.756, so z is about 4.756. Wait, but that's higher than any of the options given. Hmm, maybe I'm doing this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the maximum redshift where the Lyman-alpha line is still in the optical. Wait, maybe I should have used 4000 Angstroms as the lower limit? That wouldn't make sense because higher redshifts would require longer observed wavelengths. So if the observed wavelength is at 7000 Angstroms, that's the highest z possible.

Wait, but maybe the question is about the lower limit of the redshift. No, the question says 'estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this object such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes'. Wait, that's a bit confusing. A lower limit would be the smallest possible z where detection is possible. So when the Lyman-alpha line is just entering the optical range. Because if the object's redshift is too small, the Lyman-alpha would be in UV, which optical telescopes can't see.

So the Lyman-alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms. For it to be observed in optical, the observed wavelength must be >= 4000 Angstroms? No, because 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm, which is violet. Wait, but optical goes up to about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). So the Lyman-alpha line would be redshifted into the optical when (1 + z) * 1216 >= 4000? No, because 4000 is 400 nm, which
