Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about nuclear physics, specifically about the impulse approximation used in many-body calculations. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which of the four given assumptions together imply the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation assumes that nucleons behave like free particles, right? So, I remember that this approximation is used when considering interactions like electroweak, where each nucleon is treated as if it's not affected by the others except momentarily during the interaction.

Let me look at the options. The four assumptions are numbered 1 to 4. The options are combinations of these. I need to figure out which combination leads to the impulse approximation.

Let's break down each assumption:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
I think this means that the force or interaction acts on each nucleon separately, not collectively. So, each nucleon feels the interaction as if it's the only one, which would support the idea of treating them as free particles.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
Wait, transparent meaning that other nucleons don't affect the interaction much. So, when a nucleon is hit by a force, the others don't scatter or influence the interaction. This would mean that the rest of the nucleus doesn't contribute much to the interaction, making the selected nucleon's response similar to a free nucleon.

3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
Hmm, non-relativistic quarks. So, the internal structure of the nucleon isn't undergoing significant changes, and the binding energies aren't so high that relativistic effects are important. This would imply that the nucleon's internal structure is static on the timescale of the interaction. So, the nucleon can be treated as a composite particle with its quarks not moving much relative to each other when the interaction occurs. But how does this tie into the impulse approximation? Well, if the nucleon's internal movement isn't significant, then the interaction is more like a point interaction, which fits with treating the nucleon as a free particle.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.
Oh, right. Binding forces are the nuclear forces holding the nucleons together. If the approximation says the selected nucleon isn't experiencing these forces during the interaction, then it's like the nucleon is free. So, the binding is ignored, which is a big part of the impulse approximation.

Now, the question is which combination of these four assumptions leads to the impulse approximation.

The impulse approximation assumes that each nucleon interacts as if it's free because the other nucleons don't significantly affect the interaction (they are treated as a cloud) and the binding forces are neglected. So, the key points are that each nucleon interacts individually (1), the nucleus doesn't impede the interaction beyond the one nucleon (2), and the binding forces
