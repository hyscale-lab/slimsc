Okay, I have this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate them. But how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

So, Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me recall them. The first one is Gauss's Law for electricity, which relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed. The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism, which in our world says that the magnetic flux through a closed surface is always zero, implying that there are no isolated magnetic charges. The third is Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction, which deals with the circulation of the electric field and changing magnetic fields. The fourth is Ampère's Law, which relates the circulation of the magnetic field to electric current and displacement current.

Wait, so if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated North or South poles, that means magnetic monopoles exist. In our world, the second equation (Gauss's Law for magnetism) is ∇·B = 0. But with monopoles, that equation would change because there would be a divergence proportional to the magnetic charge density. So the second equation would be different.

But the question is about which Maxwell's equations are different. Let me think. The original four equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (Gauss's Law for electric fields)
2. ∇·B = 0 (Gauss's Law for magnetism)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's Law)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t) (Ampère's Law)

In a universe with magnetic monopoles, equation 2 would change. Because when you have monopoles, the divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, say ρ_m. So equation 2 becomes ∇·B = μ_0 ρ_m or something like that. So equation 2 is altered.

Wait, but what about Ampère's Law (equation 4)? In our universe, Ampère's Law doesn't have a term for magnetic current because there are no monopoles. If there were magnetic currents, equation 4 might also change. Oh wait, but Ampère's Law is about the curl of B, which relates to current and displacement current. If magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect Ampère's Law? Or does it only affect Gauss's Law for magnetism?

Alternatively, sometimes people talk about modifying Ampère's Law to include magnetic current density. In that case, the equation would have another term. For example, the modified Ampère's Law would become ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t + J_m), where J_m is the magnetic current density. But wait, that might not be correct. Because Ampère's Law in standard form doesn't involve magnetic charge; perhaps the other equation (like the one for the curl of E) doesn't
