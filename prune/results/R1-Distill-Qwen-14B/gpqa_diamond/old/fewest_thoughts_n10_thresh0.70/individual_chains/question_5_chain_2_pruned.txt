Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So, first, I should probably write down each component to get a better idea.

The problem says that the operator P has components Px, Py, Pz. So P as a whole is a vector operator made up of these components. The direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane, so the direction vector can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think. Because in the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, right? So the direction vector would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Wait, so the operator P is along direction n, so the operator in question is P·n. That is, P·n = Px sinθ + Pz cosθ. Because n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator we're interested in is P·n = Px sinθ + Pz cosθ.

Our goal is to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. And then, the options are various possible forms of the normalized eigenvector.

But wait, all the given options are in terms of components, perhaps in the eigenbasis. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to construct the matrix representation of P·n. Since P·n = Px sinθ + Pz cosθ, let's compute each part.

Given that Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix.

So, let's write P·n:

P·n = (ħ/2)
