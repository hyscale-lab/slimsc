Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The task is to find by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. So I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity of a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T would be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

So both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. The radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s. I think that refers to their velocities along the line of sight. But since that's radial velocity, it's about the Doppler shift. Oh wait, but if their observed wavelengths are the same because of their temperatures? Or does the radial velocity affect the observed wavelength?

Wait, no, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same. But if the stars are moving, their emitted λ_max would be Doppler shifted.

Ah, so the actual emitted λ_max would be different, but due to Doppler shift, the observed λ_max is the same. Let's think. The Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity (assuming v is much less than the speed of light, we can approximate with (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c), but maybe just considering the first order or using beta = v/c.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach this more carefully. Let me denote v1 as the radial velocity of Star_1 (0 km/s) and v2 as that of Star_2 (700 km/s). The observed λ_max for each star would be λ1_obs = λ1 * sqrt( (1 + v1/c)/(1 - v1/c) ), and similarly λ2_obs = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c
