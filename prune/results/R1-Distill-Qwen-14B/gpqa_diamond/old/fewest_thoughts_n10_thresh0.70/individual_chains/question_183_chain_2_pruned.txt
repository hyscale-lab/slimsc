Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI? The options are A) 1, B) 3, C) 5, D) 0.

Hmm. Index of hydrogen deficiency, I remember that's calculated based on the degrees of unsaturation. Each degree of unsaturation is either a ring or a double bond. So the formula is Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Where C is the number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. But in this case, I think the product after reaction might change the structure, so I need to find out what the product looks like first.

So the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize its structure. It's a cyclohexene ring—so a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? Wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH₂, but attached where? So the cyclohexene has a double bond at position 3, so between carbons 3 and 4 maybe.

Wait, cyclohex-3-ene would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the numbering is such that the substituents are at 2 and 5. Let me think: the ring is numbered, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The double bond is between 3 and 4. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached as a substituent. So the substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

So the molecule is a cyclohexene ring with a formyl group on carbon 2 and a vinyl group on carbon 5. Also, it's a carboxylic acid—wait, wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Oh, wait, the -carboxylic acid is part of the main chain. So the main chain is the cyclohexene with a carboxylic acid group attached. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring where one of the substituents is a carboxylic acid group, and then another substituent is formyl at position 2, and vinyl at position 5.

Wait, let me get this right. The main chain is cyclohexene, and the carboxylic acid is attached to the ring. So the structure is cyclohexene with a COOH group at a certain position, a CHO group at another, and a vinyl group at another.

But I'm not fully confident; perhaps drawing it would help, but since I can't draw, I'll proceed by considering the reaction conditions.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Red phosphorus is usually used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but wait, no, Wolff-Kishner is for removing carbonyl groups by converting them to methylene groups, using heat and NH2NH2 and a base, right? Alternatively, red phosphorus with I might be part of a deoxygenation reaction
