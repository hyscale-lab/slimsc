Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, first, I probably need to calculate the relative speed between them. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction because of the speed addition formula.

Wait, right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different from the classical case. The formula is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u and v are the speeds of the two objects as observed from the rest frame. But wait, here both are moving in the same direction, so I think u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So plugging those in:

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² )

Let me compute the numerator first: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c²) which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that narrows it down a bit.

Next, I need to find the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me calculate each astronaut's energy separately.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 =
