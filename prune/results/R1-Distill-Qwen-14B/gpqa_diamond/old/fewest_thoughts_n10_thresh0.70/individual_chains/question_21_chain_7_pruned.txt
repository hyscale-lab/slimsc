Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It then asks about two compounds: which one doesn't show tautomerism (so part A), and then among two other compounds, which one shows optical isomerism (part B). The options given are A to D, each pairing which compound is A and which is B.

First, I need to figure out part A. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the shifting of a double bond. For example, in compounds like o-phenylenediamine, tautomerism can occur if the structure allows for conjugated double bonds and adjacent hydrogens.

Benzoquinoneâ€”wait, benzoquinone is another name for para-quinone. Quinones have a structure with two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The structure is O=C6H4=O. Now, does this compound undergo tautomerism? I think tautomerism requires adjacent double bonds and hydrogens. In benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are on opposite carbons of the benzene ring. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O, but wait, that's not quite right. Benzoquinone is C6H4O2 with two ketone groups: O double bonds to carbons 1 and 4 (if it's para), but maybe it's 1,4 positions. Wait, but the structure would be like O=C6H4=O, but each carbonyl is at opposite positions.

Wait, but tautomerism is more about the movement of a hydrogen between adjacent atoms, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that, you usually need a carbonyl group adjacent to a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon. For example, in cyclohexanone, you have the carbonyl, and if there's a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon, it can tautomerize. But in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a benzene ring; each is attached to an aromatic ring. Wait, but
