Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says each spin can be either +1 or -1. So each of S1, S2, S3 can take two values. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Since β is 1/(kT), and each state contributes a Boltzmann factor. So I need to consider all possible configurations of S1, S2, S3 and compute the energy for each, then sum exp(-βE) for all these.

But with three spins, each having two possible states, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. That's manageable. Maybe I can list all 8 possible combinations and compute E for each, then sum the Boltzmann factors.

Or perhaps I can find a smarter way without enumerating all possibilities. Let me think about the possible values of the terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3.

Each of these terms is either +1 or -1, because S_i and S_j are each ±1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can vary. Let's think about the possible values of this sum.

Each term (like S1S2) is +1 if the spins are the same, -1 if different. So the sum can be 3 (all three terms +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), or -3 (all three terms -1).

Wait, let's compute all possible cases. Let me think: how many ways can the spins be arranged so that each of the three terms in the energy is +1 or -1.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to note that for each pair, their product is +1 (aligned) or -1 (anti-aligned). Then the sum is the sum of these three products.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the energy in terms of the number of aligned pairs. Wait, but each term is S_i S_j, which is 1 if aligned and -1 if anti-aligned. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is equal to (number of aligned pairs)*1 + (number of anti-aligned pairs)*(-1). Since each pair can be either aligned or anti-aligned, and there are three pairs in total.

So for each state (each configuration of S1, S2, S3), the sum will be (aligned pairs - anti-aligned pairs). Let me denote the number of aligned pairs as N. Since there are three pairs, the number of anti-aligned is 3 - N. So the sum becomes N - (3 - N) = 2N -3.

Wait
