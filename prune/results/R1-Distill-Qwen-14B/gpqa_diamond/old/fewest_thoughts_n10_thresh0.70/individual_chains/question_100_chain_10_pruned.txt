Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. Oh right, C3H6 is propene, because propene has the formula C3H6 (it's an alkene with one double bond). Alternatively, cyclopropane is another possibility, but propene is more likely in bromination reactions since it's more reactive as an alkene.

So, first step: Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Wait, that's probably a free radical bromination. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, when alkenes react with Br2, it's usually an addition reaction. But when using a solvent like CCl4, it's more likely to be an addition rather than substitution. So, if A is propene (CH2=CHCH3), adding Br2 would lead to the addition of Br across the double bond. So the structure becomes CH2BrCHBrCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, when Br2 adds to an alkene, it's a diaddition. So propene would become 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, depending on the position. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3, so adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Next step: compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Oh, that's a dehydrohalogenation reaction. So since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two equivalents of HBr. But wait, wait, wait, 1,2-dibromopropane would eliminate two HBr molecules? Wait, no, each Br is on adjacent carbons. So in the presence of a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it would undergo two elimination steps, but wait, wait, maybe it's one elimination followed by another. Alternatively, perhaps the first elimination gives a double bond, but wait, in this case, the initial structure is 1,2-dibromopropane. When you eliminate HBr from each Br, you can form a triple bond. Wait
