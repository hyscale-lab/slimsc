Okay, so I've got this Michael addition problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually a enolate or something that can form an enolate, right?

So the problem has three different reactions labeled A, B, and C. I need to determine the major products for each and then match them to the options provided.

Let's start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). NaOEt is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates the malonate to form the enolate. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups, so its structure is like CH2(CO2Me)2. The enolate would form at the central carbon because that's where the alpha protons are.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO2Me, attached to a p-tolyl group. Wait, no, waitâ€”3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be the acrylate with substituents on the beta carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CO2Me, but wait, no, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO2Me, but the p-tolyl is on the third position, which would be the alpha to the carbonyl. Wait, maybe I should draw this. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but as (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would imply that the p-tolyl is on the third carbon, which is the end of the double bond. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, maybe the structure is more like: the acrylate is CH2=CH- as the double bond, and the third carbon (the one after the double bond) has the p-tolyl group attached. So it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or maybe it's CH2-CH2 where the middle is the double bond, but the substituent is on the far end. I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-p-tolylacrylate, which would be (E)-CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Wait, no, I think I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, no. The correct structure for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, with the substituent (p-tolyl) on carbon
