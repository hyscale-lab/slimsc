Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO and the given NMR data. It's reacted with three reagents in sequence: NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat. I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, let's look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR shows:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): This is a triplet. A triplet up around 9.7 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm, and if it's a triplet, it might be coupling with two adjacent protons. But wait, aldehydes typically don't have neighboring protons, so maybe it's a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton in a specific environment. Hmm, not sure yet.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, two protons. This could be aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted because the integration is 2H. Like a pair of protons on a benzene ring, para to substituents.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, two protons. This could be another set of aromatic protons. Maybe they are adjacent or in a meta position? Wait, but if the first set is 6.98, which is a bit downfield, maybe they're electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro or something else. But the molecular formula includes a NO, so maybe an amino group? Or perhaps an oxygen substituent like hydroxyl.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. C8H9NO: Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, X=0. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=1
