Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about decay probabilities.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. They then say that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, no, the next 150 minutes after the 50 that have already passed. So the total time from the start would be 200 minutes, but I think the way it's phrased, it's the next 150 minutes from the current point.

Wait, radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? Each atom has a constant probability of decaying per unit time, independent of when it started. So the decay follows an exponential decay model. That means the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed; it's memoryless. 

Wait, so if I have a certain probability that the atom decays within a time T, then the probability of decay in a subsequent time interval isn't affected by the fact that it hasn't decayed before. So the 32% given is for the first 100 minutes. Now, after 50 minutes have passed without decay, the probability for the next 150 minutes would be the same as if we started fresh and looked at 150 minutes?

Wait, no. Wait, no, that might not be the correct approach. Let me think again. Let's model this properly.

The decay probability within a time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. So, the probability that the atom decays before time t is P(t).

We're given that P(100) = 32%, which is 0.32. So:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)
So e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
Take the natural log of both sides:
-100λ = ln(0.68)
So λ = -ln(0.68)/100

Now, the question is about the next 150 minutes. Wait, but the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the remaining time we're interested in is t=150, but we have to consider the survival up to 50 minutes.

Wait, no, because after 50 minutes, the probability that it hasn't decayed is e^(-λ*50). Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes.

Hmm,
