Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, producing electron-positron pairs. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of a gamma-ray is limited by this process. So, the process is gamma-gamma annihilation into e+ e-. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Hmm. I remember that for high-energy particles, their interactions with the CMB (which is a background of low-energy photons) can limit their lifetime in the universe through processes like this. The higher the energy of the gamma-ray, the more likely it is to interact with the CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, right?

So the problem is probably about calculating the energy where the mean free time (the average time before annihilation happens) becomes comparable to the age of the universe. If the mean free time is shorter than the age, then the gamma-rays would annihilate quickly, hence their lifetime is limited.

Wait, the age of the universe is roughly around 13.8 billion years, but I'm not sure if I need to calculate that exactly. Maybe I can use it in seconds. Let me think: 1 year is about 3.15e7 seconds. So 13.8e9 years would be about 13.8e9 * 3.15e7 ≈ 4.3e17 seconds. But maybe I don't need the exact value; perhaps I'll use it symbolically.

The process is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. The cross-section for this process must depend on the energies of the photons involved. I think the cross-section for such a process increases when the center-of-mass (CM) energy is sufficient to produce the electron-positron pair. The threshold energy for this process is when the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the rest mass of an electron, because each electron has rest mass about 0.511 MeV, so the threshold is about 1.022 MeV in the CM frame.

Wait, but both photons are moving in opposite directions (since they're from the CMB, which is isotropic), so their energies add in the CM frame. So to have enough energy, the sum of the two photon energies must be at least 2 * m_e c^2. So the threshold condition is E_gamma * E_CMB >= (m_e c^2)^2 / 2, or something like that. Or wait, maybe the photon energies in the center of mass frame. Hmm.

Wait, photons are massless, so the CM energy squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta vectors are opposite. So if E1 is the energy of the gamma-ray photon and E2 is the CMB photon (with E2 = 1e-3 eV), and assuming that the gamma is moving in the +z direction, the CMB photon is moving in the -z direction. So their momenta are opposite.

So the CM energy squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/(c)) - (E2/(c)) )^2 c^2. Let me compute that:

= (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2)/c )^2 c^2
= (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2
= [E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2]
= 4 E1 E2

So sqrt(4 E1 E2) = 2 sqrt(E1 E2) is the CM energy. At the threshold, this should equal 2 m_e c^2, because that's the rest mass of the electron-positron pair.

So 2 sqrt(E1 E2) = 2 m_e c^2 → sqrt(E1 E2) = m_e c^2 → E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, that's the condition for the threshold. So E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2.

Wait, m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV, which is 5.11e5 eV. Squared is (5.11e5 eV)^2 = approximately 2.6e11 eV². E2 is given as 1e-3 eV. So E1 = (2.6e11) / (1e-3) ) eV = 2.6e14 eV. Wait, that's 2.6e8 GeV? No, wait,
