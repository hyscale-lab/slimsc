Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially for central potentials, we often use polar coordinates because of the symmetry. 

Wait, but wait, what's the form of this potential? Let me break it down. The first term is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential. Because the potential for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2) m ω² r², but here it's in terms of k and r². Then the second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. That seems a bit more complicated. So the potential depends on both r and θ, but is it separable?

I think I should check if this potential can be separated into radial and angular parts. Let me rewrite V(r, θ). The first term is purely radial, (1/2)k r². The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So this can be written as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (cosθ)^2. Alternatively, since r² is common, I can factor that out. V = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

Wait, but cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. I think cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that, the potential becomes V(r, θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that. So (3/2)k times (1/2) is (3/4)k. So inside the brackets: (1/2)k + (3/4)k + (3/4)k cos2θ. Adding the terms without cos: (1/2 + 3/4) is (5/4)k. So V(r, θ) = r² [ (5/4
