Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the net potential energy of a system. The setup is a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conducting spheres and charges, image charges often come into play. But wait, the sphere is grounded, which probably means it's connected to the Earth, so any induced charges would be neutralized except for the image charge.

Wait, the sphere is conducting, so any charges on it would reside on the surface. But since it's grounded, any induced charge would cause electrons to flow in or out until the sphere's potential is zero. Hmm, not sure. Let me think. Oh right, when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere's surface charges rearrange to mimic another charge opposite to q, creating an image charge. But since the sphere is grounded, the net charge on the sphere is zero, but there's an induced charge distribution.

Wait, no. When you have a grounded conducting sphere, any charge induced on it will be canceled by the ground, but the presence of the external charge induces a redistribution of the charges. So the sphere's induced charges would be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is the same as the ground's potential, which is zero.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this methodically. The potential energy of the system should be the work done to assemble the charge configuration. Since the sphere is conducting, the charges will move freely, so the presence of charge q will induce an image charge. But because the sphere
