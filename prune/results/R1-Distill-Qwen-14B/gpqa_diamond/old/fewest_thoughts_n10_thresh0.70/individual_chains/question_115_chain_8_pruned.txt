Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on. 

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. When they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm. So the setup is like this: electron comes from the left, positron from the right, and they collide head-on. Then they annihilate into two photons. Since they're annihilating, their rest mass energy is converted into the photons' energy. But wait, each has their own kinetic energy too because of the Lorentz factors.

Wait, the Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So the total energy of each particle is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass of an electron and positron is the same, right? Because a positron is just the antimatter counterpart of an electron. So their rest mass energy is 0.511 MeV each. But I think when they annihilate, they produce energy equal to twice the rest mass energy, so 1.022 MeV, but wait, in the center-of-momentum frame, perhaps?

But wait, wait. The problem states that after annihilation, both photons have the same energy. So energy is conserved, and the photons have equal energy. Also, their directions are both to the right, but one is upper and the other lower. So the photons are moving in opposite directions in terms of vertical, but same in horizontal. So their directions would form some angle, which we need to find.

I remember that in annihilation, the two photons must be emitted in opposite directions in the center-of-momentum frame to conserve momentum. But wait, in this case, it's not necessarily the center-of-momentum frame because the electron and positron are moving with different speeds. So I think I need to calculate the total momentum and energy before annihilation to find the properties of the photons.

Wait, but the photons are moving in the same general direction (both to the right) but one upwards and one downwards. So their momentum vectors would
