Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what A and the catalyst B are from the options given.

First, let me visualize the structures. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The methyl group is on the third carbon. The product has a cyclohexylidene group attached. Cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexene ring where one of the double bonds is between a carbon and the adjacent ring, making it a sort of bridged structure.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group. Hmm, which would come from some kind of addition or perhaps an alkylation or alkenylation.

Wait, the reaction is acid-catalyzed. So maybe a carbocation is involved, or some electrophilic addition.

Looking at the options, compound A could be either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane. The catalyst options are TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) or acetic acid.

Let me think about possible reactions. 3-Methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic secondary amine. In acid-catalyzed reactions, amines can form their ammonium salts, which are more electrophilic. Or maybe it's involved in some kind of alkylation.

If the product has a cyclohexylidene group attached to the pyrrolidine, perhaps this is an example of a conjugate addition or an alkenylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, pyrrolidine isn't an aromatic ring. That might
