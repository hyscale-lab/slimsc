Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator, and I need to find its eigenvalues. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my quantum mechanics classes.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh right, σ is the Pauli vector, which consists of the Pauli spin matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And n is an arbitrary unit vector, so it's like a direction in space. ε is an energy constant.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, right? So σ · n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the components of n. For example, n has components (n_x, n_y, n_z), so σ · n is n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. And since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

The Hamiltonian is then a 2x2 matrix. To find the eigenvalues, I remember that for any 2x2 Hermitian matrix (which H is, since it's an observable), the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of the Pauli matrices properties.

Wait, another approach: the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1. So maybe σ · n has eigenvalues ±1 as well, scaled by ε. Because if I factor ε out, then H = ε (σ · n).

Wait, wait. Let me think about the eigenvalues of σ · n. Since σ · n is a
