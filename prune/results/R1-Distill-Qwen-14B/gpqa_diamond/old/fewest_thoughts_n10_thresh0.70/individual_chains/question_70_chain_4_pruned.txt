Hmm, okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about chemical reactions and molecular symmetry. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let's parse the reactions given.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, the reaction is A + 8B → C. Since B is a gas, maybe it's something like O2, Cl2, or another diatomic gas. The product C is bright red, which makes me think of something like sulfur trioxide (SO3) or maybe a transition metal compound, but red is a strong color. Another thought: maybe C is an oxide, but some sulfates or other compounds can be red.

2. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. Gas D reacting with C—could D be something like O2 or another gas? Or maybe it's a halogen, but I'm not sure yet.

3. Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, this reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. Since F is strong and G is weak, maybe F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is HNO3 (still strong, but wait, maybe another). Wait, no. Or perhaps G is something like HNO2 or HCN, which are weaker. Alternatively, maybe F and G are different types. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (but that's weak, but H2S is a weak acid). Or wait, another approach: the acids are formed from the reaction of C with water. Let me think about possible compounds.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about what C could be. It forms two acids when it reacts with water. Let me think of a compound that when it hydrates forms two acids. Maybe something like SO3? SO3 reacting with water would form H2SO4 (strong acid) and maybe something else? Wait, no, SO3 + H2O → H2SO4, which is a single acid. Hmm. Or maybe another compound.

Wait, what if C is SO3^2- or something else. Alternatively, perhaps
