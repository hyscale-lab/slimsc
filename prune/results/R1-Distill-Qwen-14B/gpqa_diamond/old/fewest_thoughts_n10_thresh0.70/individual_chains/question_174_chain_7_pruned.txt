Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. 

The question is about finding the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D in MeV.

Wait, so I need to compare the relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) calculations for T1.

First, some key points:

1. The initial nucleus is at rest, so total initial momentum is zero.
2. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum.
3. Since momentum is conserved, the momentum of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

I think I remember that in such cases, the more massive fragment has less kinetic energy than the lighter one because kinetic energy depends on the square of velocity, and the heavier mass moves slower. But wait, that's in the non-relativistic case. Relativistic effects might change things a bit.

Let's structure the problem.

Let me denote the masses of the two fragments. Let's say the smaller mass is m, so the larger is 2m. The sum is 3m = 0.99 M. So, M is the initial mass. So, 3m =0.99 M â†’ m = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. So the lighter fragment is 0.33 M and the heavier is 0.66 M. Wait, but M is the initial rest mass. The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M, so the rest mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The initial rest energy is 300 GeV, so the total energy released (the binding energy) is 3 GeV. But wait, the problem
