Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So the question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². I remember that the harmonic oscillator in 3D is a standard problem in quantum mechanics. The particle is acted upon by a force obeying Hooke's law, which makes sense because the potential is quadratic in r.

The question asks two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll think about the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each dimension. For a 3D oscillator, the energy is given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω, where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Since the potential is isotropic, the problem is symmetric in all three spatial dimensions.

Alternatively, the energy can be expressed in terms of the total quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy becomes E = (N + 3/2) ħω. Each N corresponds to a certain energy level, and the degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy) depends on the number of ways you can have n_x + n_y + n_z = N.

Wait, but the problem is about the third excited state. Wait, what does that mean? In quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state, which corresponds to N=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z = 0). The first excited state would be the next one, which is N=1. So the third excited state would be N=3. Let me think: ground state is N=0 (0th excited), first excited is N=1, second is N=2, third is N=3. So the energy would be (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. That's because each N adds a multiple of ħω. So E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = 9/2 ħω. Looking at the options, option A has (9/2) ħω, and option C also has the same energy. So that's part of the answer.

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy, which is the degeneracy. The degeneracy for a given N is the number of ways you can choose n_x, n_y, n_z such that their sum is N. So for N=3, how many triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) are there where each is a non-negative integer and they add up to 3?

This is a combinatorial problem. The number of solutions is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z =3. The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions is (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ) = (N+2 choose 2). Plugging in N=3: (3+2 choose 2) = 5 choose 2 = 10. So there are 10 eigenfunctions. Therefore, the energy is (9/2) ħω and the degeneracy is 10.

Looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω and 10. That must be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I'm not mixing up anything.

Wait, sometimes I get confused between the principal quantum number in hydrogen and this. But in 3D harmonic oscillator, each N is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So yeah, N=3 for the third excited state. So the degeneracy is 10, which is (3+2 choose 2) = 10.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the energy levels are determined by the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) in each spatial dimension. The energy of a state is given by:

\[
E = \left(N + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total quantum number. The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for a given \( N \) is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = N \), which is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{N + 2}{2}.
\]

The question asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state. The ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \), the first excited state to \( N = 1 \), the second to \( N = 2 \), and the third to \( N = 3 \). Substituting \( N = 3 \) into the energy formula:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

For the degeneracy, substituting \( N = 3 \) into the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and the degeneracy is 10. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \).**

Answer: A
