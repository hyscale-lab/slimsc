Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectral data. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. Here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation, which probably means a benzene ring (3 double bonds) plus maybe one double bond or a ring and a double bond. Alternatively, could be a ring and an amide or ester group.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Amine or amide N-H? But wait, amides show broader N-H stretches. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests an ester or amide carbonyl. Because amides typically have lower carbonyl frequencies than esters, but if it's a primary amide, the N-H would be more intense. Wait, but the IR here has strong bands around 3400, which could be either amines or amides. Hmm.

The 1H NMR data: Let's break it down.

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): that's a triplet, likely from a CH3 group attached to an OCH2 or CH2. Maybe an ethyl group, like -OCH2CH3, but wait, the triplet would be from the CH3, so adjacent to a CH2 with two protons. So an ethyl group, maybe as an ester.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet, 2H. Could be adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe an OCH2 group, but the multiplicity is a singlet, broad. Could that be an NH2 group? But wait, the molecular formula has only one N. Alternatively, maybe a methylene next to
