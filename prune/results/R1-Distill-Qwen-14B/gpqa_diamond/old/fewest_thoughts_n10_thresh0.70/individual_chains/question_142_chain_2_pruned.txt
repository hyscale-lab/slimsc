Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this ρ must be a density matrix for a qubit.

I'm a bit fuzzy on how exactly to map a density matrix to a point in the qubit space. I think qubit space is often visualized in a Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere represents a qubit's state as a point on its surface for pure states, but for mixed states, it's inside the sphere. The density matrix of a qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components.

Wait, the general form of a qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). Oh right, because the Pauli matrices correspond to the x, y, z components. So expanding this, the density matrix becomes (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

In the given problem, ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me compute this. |0><0| is the outer product, which for the standard basis vectors would be a diagonal matrix with 1,0. Similarly, |1><1| would be diagonal with 0,1. Adding them together gives the matrix diag(1,1). So ρ is (1/2) * diag(1,1), which is diag(0.5, 0.5).

But wait, the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. Let me compute that. The identity matrix I is diag(1,1). The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Putting it all together, (I + r·σ)/2 would be (1/2) * [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y ], [ r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z ] ].

But in our case, ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So that's a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements 0.5. So let me set the general form equal to this.

Comparing the two matrices:

(I + r·σ)/2 = [[ (1 + r_z)/2, (r_x - i r_y)/2 ], [ (r_x + i r_y)/2, (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

This should equal [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So setting each element equal:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 --> 1 + r_z = 1 --> r_z = 0.

(1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5 --> same result, r_z=0.

The off-diagonal terms are (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0. So r_x - i r_y = 0.

Which implies that r_x = 0 and r_y = 0. Because if a complex number a + b i equals zero, both a and b must be zero. So r_x is zero, r_y is zero.

So the Bloch vector r has components (0, 0, r_z). But r_z is zero. So the vector is (0, 0, 0).

Wait, but wait a second. The density matrix given
