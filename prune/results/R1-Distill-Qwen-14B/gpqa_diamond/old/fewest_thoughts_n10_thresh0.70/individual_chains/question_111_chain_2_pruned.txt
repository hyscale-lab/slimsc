Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B, each with a reaction. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options given.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so I think this is probably an enolate formation reaction. The acrylate would then act as an electrophile, leading to an alkylation or acylation. Wait, ethyl acrylate is an acryloyl group, so it's an acylation. Oh wait, no, wait. Ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So, when it reacts with an enolate, the enolate would attack the alpha position of the acrylate.

Wait, no, wait. Enolate formation leads to an enolate, which is a strong base. The enolate would attack an electrophilic carbon. In the case of ethyl acrylate, the carbonyl is adjacent to a double bond. So the structure is CH2=CHCOOEt. The alpha position is the CH2 and the CH, but wait, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So maybe the enolate would attack the alpha carbon next to the carbonyl. But wait, the acrylate is an acylating agent, so when the enolate attacks, the acrylate's carbonyl would become connected to the cyclohexanone.

Wait, but in the reaction, cyclohexanone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1, and the substituents are at 2 (ethyl and methyl) and 6 (methyl). So, when the base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the alpha position, which positions are available? The alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl. So the carbonyl is at position 1, so the alpha positions are positions 2 and maybe 6, but wait
