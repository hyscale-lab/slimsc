Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, I remember that the energy levels in a 1D infinite well depend on the quantum number n. Each particle's energy is given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? But wait, the problem states that E is equal to (π²ħ²)/(2mL²), so E is the ground state energy for n=1. So each particle's energy is E multiplied by n squared.

But wait, these are four identical particles, and they're spin-1/2, which means they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each energy level can be occupied by at most two particles (since spin-up and spin-down are allowed). So the total energy of the system will be the sum of the energies of each particle in the well.

Let me think about the possible states. In the ground state, the particles will occupy the lowest available energy levels, each with the lowest possible n, considering their spins.

Since each energy level can hold two particles (because of spin up and down), the first level (n=1) can have 2 particles. The next level (n=2) can hold another 2 particles. But wait, we have four particles in total. So in the ground state, all four particles would be in the first two energy levels. That is, two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the
