Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So an antiproton is slowly moving, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D with various velocities.

Wait, first, I remember that in annihilation processes, the energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe that implies that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Or wait, wait. The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps its velocity is small, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet.

Wait, but the system here is a proton and antiproton annihilating into two pairs of particles, each pair being A⁺ and A⁻. So each A has a mass of 300 MeV. Let me think about the conservation laws.

In the center of mass frame, the initial momentum would be zero because the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite momenta. So in that frame, the total momentum after the annihilation must also be zero. That would mean that the two A⁺ and two A⁻ must move in such a way that their momenta cancel out.

Wait, but each A⁺ and A⁻ is a pair with opposite charge, but same mass. So maybe they are moving in such a way that each A⁺ and A⁻ are moving in opposite directions
