Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step. 

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and there are four options to choose from. My goal is to figure out what each reaction produces and then match them with the options.

Starting with Reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH (which is potassium hydride), and then H+ (protonation). I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is a strong base. So, what's this reaction about?

The starting material is a spiro compound, which means it has two rings connected by a single atom. The structure here is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Looking at the name, the spiro atom is the 1st carbon, which is connected to a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) and an alcohol group (-OH). The rings are nonane (3 carbons in one ring, 5 in the other? Wait, wait, spiro[m.n] means two rings connected at one atom. So 3 and 5, making the main chain 3+5+1 (the spiro C) but I'm not entirely sure about the structure. 

Reaction conditions are with THF, which is a polar aprotic solvent, and KH. KH is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. When I think about strong bases reacting with alcohols or alkenes... Oh wait, maybe this is an elimination reaction. Because when you have an alcohol and a strong base, sometimes they deprotonate to form an alkoxide, which can then undergo elimination if there's a possibility for forming a double bond or a ring.

But wait, the starting molecule already has a double bond. The substituents are a vinyl group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So maybe this is a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of a pinacol-type rearrangement? No, pinacol is for vicinal diols. Or perhaps it's an elimination where the hydroxyl group is removed, forming a carbocation, but that doesn't seem right with a strong base like KH. Or maybe it's a conjugate addition or some kind of cyclization.

Wait, another possibility: the base could deprotonate the alcohol to form an alkoxide, which then could undergo a ring-opening or a ring-forming process. But given that the starting material is a spiro compound, maybe the reaction forms a larger ring through some kind of elimination and cyclization.

Alternatively, considering that after the reaction, they add H+. So perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond elsewhere, which could cause a ring to form.

Wait, another thought: When a spiro alcohol is treated with a strong base, sometimes it can undergo a Cope elimination or some kind of electrocyclic ring-opening. But I'm not quite sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement
