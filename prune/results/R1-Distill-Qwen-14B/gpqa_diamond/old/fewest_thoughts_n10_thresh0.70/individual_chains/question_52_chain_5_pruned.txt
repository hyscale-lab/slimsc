Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused but let's break it down. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. Hmm, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of particles in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. 

So the star has two scenarios: no spots and 40% spots. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does that happen? Oh, right, the spots are cooler, so they emit less radiation. So the observed effective temperature is lower when spots are present.

The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio is given as decreasing when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower. And we need to find by what factor this ratio changes—so without spots divided by with spots.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I think that's in the near ultraviolet or maybe visible? Not sure if that matters, but the important thing is whether it's in the ionizing range. Well, neutral Ti would have electrons that can be excited but not ionized, so the energy for the transition is probably E = hc/λ. Let me calculate the energy. H is Planck's constant, c speed of light, λ is 1448 Å which is 1.448e-7 meters.

But wait, maybe I don't need the exact energy for this problem. The Boltzmann equation is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). Oh, right, where E2 is higher than E1 since it's an excitation. So the ratio depends exponentially on temperature and the energy difference.

When the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. So T drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. Let's find the ratio of the ratios. So the ratio without spots (R1) is (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and with spots (R2) is (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). So the factor is R1/R2 = exp[ (ΔE/k)(1/T1 -1/T2) ].

Wait, that's right because R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ] ? Wait, let me think again. The exponent in R1 is -ΔE/(k T1), and in R2 it's -ΔE/(k T2). So when you divide R1 by R2, the exponents subtract
