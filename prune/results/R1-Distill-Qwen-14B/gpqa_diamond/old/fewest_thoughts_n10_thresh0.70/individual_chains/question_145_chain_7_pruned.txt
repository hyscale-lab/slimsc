Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out how many stereoisomers the given compound has. The compound is 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to draw the structure to visualize where the stereocenters are. The name suggests a 12-carbon chain (since undeca is 11, but wait, undeca would be 12 carbons? Wait, no—wait, undec- means 11 carbons. Wait, maybe I should check that. Wait, no, wait, no, wait—it's actually undec in the name, right? So undeca- is 11 carbons, but wait, the numbering in the compound might start with the other end. Hmm. Wait, the formula is undec, so 11 carbons in total.

The structure is undeca-3,7-dien-5-ol. So the double bonds are at positions 3 and 7. And there's an alcohol group at position 5. Oh, and substituents at positions 2 (methyl), 6 (chloro), and 9 (ethyl). So, let's sketch this.

Numbering from the left: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

Wait, wait: the compound is undec, so 11 carbons. Let's break it down:

Positions 3 and 7 have double bonds. So double bonds between 3-4 and 7-8. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CHCl-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, I might be getting the substituents wrong. Let's see: 2-methyl, so position 2 has a methyl group. 6-chloro, position 6 has Cl. 9-ethyl, position 9 has an ethyl group. And the alcohol is at position 5, so OH on C5.

Wait, let me think again. The compound is 6-chloro-9
