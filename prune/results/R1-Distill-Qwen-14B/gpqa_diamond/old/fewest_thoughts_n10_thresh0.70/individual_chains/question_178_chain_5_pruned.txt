Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian here, right? It's L_int = κ ψ_bar σ_mu_nu ψ F^{mu_nu}. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that the mass dimension of the coupling constant determines whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizable theories have couplings with mass dimension greater than or equal to zero. Wait, no, wait. I think it's the opposite: if the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies, making the theory non-renormalizable. Right, because in four dimensions, renormalizable terms have dimension 4 for the Lagrangian. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Let me recall the mass dimensions of the fields. The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. The field strength tensor F is made from the field A, which is a vector potential. A has mass dimension 1, so F, which is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, should have dimension 2 because each derivative is dimension 1.

Now, let's look at the sigma matrix σ_mu_nu. It's given as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices). So σ has the same dimension as [γ, γ], which is zero? Or wait, considering the commutator, do the indices affect the dimension? No, the gamma matrices don't contribute to mass dimension. So σ_mu_nu is a tensor with two Lorentz indices, but its mass dimension comes from the field it acts on. Wait, no, σ is constructed from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so σ itself is dimensionless. Hmm, maybe I should think about how it acts in the term.

The term is ψ_bar σ_mu_nu ψ F^{mu nu}. Let's break it down:

- ψ_bar is the adjoint spinor, same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2.
- σ_mu_nu is a Lorentz tensor, but dimensionless? Or does it have a dimension? Wait, no. The gamma matrices are dimensionless. The commutator [γ_mu, γ_nu] is a tensor but dimensionless. So σ has mass dimension 0.

Wait, but when you have a tensor like σ_mu_nu, which has two indices, each index doesn't carry a mass dimension. The dimension comes from the fields it's acting on. So the term ψ_bar σ_mu_nu ψ would be like (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) = 3. Then multiplied by F^{mu nu}, which has dimension 2. So the term has dimension 3 + 2 =5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so the coupling constant κ must have dimension -1 to make the whole term have dimension 4. Because 5 + (-1) =4.

So [κ]_M = -1. So that would make the first part: the mass dimension of kappa is -1.

Now, for renormalizability. In four spacetime dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Because higher dimensions (like dimension 1 or more) mean that the interaction is "weaker" at high energies, allowing the theory to be predictive. But if a coupling has a negative
