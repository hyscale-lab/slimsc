Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The problem is about identifying two aromatic compounds in a mixture based on their 1H NMR spectra. 

The question states that the mixture is in a 1:1 ratio and the molecular formula is C10H14. Let's break down what that means. The molecular formula C10H14 indicates a degree of unsaturation. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, no X or N, so (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four degrees: probably one benzene ring (which accounts for 3) and one double bond or ring (so 1 more, making 4 total). So either a benzene ring plus a double bond or another ring. But since all the options are tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzene, I think they all have a benzene ring with substituents.

The NMR spectrum shows two signals (singlets) around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. The aromatic protons usually appear in that region. Singlets mean no neighboring protons, so each set of equivalent protons is not split by adjacent Hs.

Then, there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The 2.2 ppm region suggests CH3 groups attached to something deshielded, perhaps like a benzene ring or an ethyl group. Since the signals are singlets, these CH3 groups are probably in symmetric positions where their neighboring Hs don't cause splitting. 

Wait, but in the options, some compounds have methyl groups and some have ethyl groups. Let me look at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (so four methyl groups in the 1,2,3,4 positions) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (four methyl groups in 1,2,3,5). 

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl and 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, diethyl would be two ethyl groups on the benzene, but the formula is C10H14. Let me check: benzene (6 C) + two ethyl groups (each is 2 C, so 4 C total) gives 6+4=10 C. So molecular formula would be C10H14? Let's see: benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3, so each adds 2 C and 5 H. Two ethyls would add 4 C and 10 H. So total C:6+4=10, H:6 +10=16? Wait, but the formula is C10H14. Oh wait, no, so perhaps I made a mistake. Let me calculate. Benzene has 6 C and 6 H. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3, which adds 2 C and 5 H each. So two ethyls give 4 C and 10 H. So total would be C10 H16. But the question says the molecular formula is C10H14. So this can't be right. Hmm, so maybe option C is not possible because it would require H16. Unless the diethyl has some substituents that reduce H count, but I don't think so. So perhaps option C is incorrect because it doesn't fit the H count. So that leaves us with options A, B, D.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

So, thinking about the NMR data. The aromatic protons. Both compounds are tetramethyl benzene, so they have four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring. The rest of the positions are H. The question is about the splitting of the aromatic protons. For each compound, the number of unique sets of aromatic H's would determine the number of signals in the NMR.

Let me first consider each compound's structure.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. So the benzene has methyl groups at adjacent positions. The remaining positions are 5 and 6, which are H. So, the ring would have positions 5 and 6 each bearing H. But wait, in a benzene ring, the positions
