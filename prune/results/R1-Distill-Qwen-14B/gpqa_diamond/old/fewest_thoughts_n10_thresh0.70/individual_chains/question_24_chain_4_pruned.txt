Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down. 

The question starts by talking about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, decolorizing bromine usually means the substance has double bonds because alkenes or alkynes can react with bromine. So mixture X has some unsaturated compounds.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, a new mixture Y is formed. Mixture Y is a result of a disproportionation reaction and doesn't decolorize bromine water. Disproportionation is when one element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. Since Y doesn't react with bromine, perhaps all the double bonds have been hydrogenated, but wait, it's a disproportionation, so maybe it's a reaction where one molecule splits into two, with a change in oxidation states. 

Hydrogenation of both X and Y, using platinum under severe conditions, gives only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%, and it's a solvent. Also, Z is a constituent of Y. And importantly, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So Z must be a saturated compound, probably an alkane since alkanes don't react with H2 under normal conditions, but maybe under high pressure with a catalyst they can, but in this case, it's stated that Z doesn't react further. 

Wait, the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let me calculate the molecular formula of Z. Let's denote Z as CnH2m. The mass fraction of hydrogen is (2m * 1)/(12n + 2m) = 0.1428. Let's solve for n and m.

0.1428 is approximately 1/7. So, (2m)/(12n + 2m) = 1/7. Multiply both sides by denominator:

2m = (12n + 2m)/7 → 14m = 12n + 2m → 12n = 12m → n = m.

Wait, n equals m. So Z is CnH2n. But wait, the formula for alkanes is CnH2n+2. Hmm, wait, that doesn't fit. Or am I missing something? Maybe Z is not an alkane but something else. Oh wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let's re-calculate.

Hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28% which is approximately 1/7. So, (mass of H)/(molar mass of Z) = 1/7.

Assume Z is CnH2m. Molar mass is 12n + 2m. The mass of H is 2m * 1 = 2m.

So (2m) / (12n + 2m) = 1/7.

Cross-multiplying: 14m = 12n + 2m → 12m = 12n → m = n.

So Z is CnH2n. But alkanes are CnH2n+2, so this is different. Maybe it's an alkene? But if Z is a product of hydrogenation, it should be fully saturated. Wait, but if Z is part of mixture Y, which comes from a disproportionation of X, perhaps Z is a byproduct of that.

Wait, but Z is formed when X and Y are hydrogenated. So when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, and when Y is hydrogenated, it also gives Z. But Y is a product of X's disproportionation.

So, let's think about what X could be. X is a mixture of two liquids with double bonds (since it decolorizes bromine). When heated with platinum, which is a catalyst, the mixture undergoes a reaction. Since it's a disproportionation, perhaps one of the components is undergoing this.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids
