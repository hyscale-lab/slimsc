Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I remember that relativistic effects come into play when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. So, I'll need to use some special relativity equations here.

First, let me parse the question. The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, what's the isotope here? Lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, the mass number A would be protons + neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, so 3 +3 =6. So the isotope is Li-6. Got it. So the nucleus is Li-6, which would have a mass number of 6.

I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed v is 0.96c. The options are in GeV, so I'm guessing the energy required is the total relativistic energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Wait, but wait. The RHIC accelerates heavy ions like gold nuclei, but here it's Li-6. So the energy per nucleus would be gamma * m_p * c² multiplied by the number of nucleons? Or is the rest mass of the nucleus considered as a whole?

Wait, the rest mass energy of a nucleus is the sum of the rest masses of its nucleons minus binding energy. But for a rough calculation, maybe I can approximate it using the mass of the nucleus as a single entity.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering each nucleon's rest mass. Wait, no, I think the nucleus is treated as a single particle. So the rest mass of Li-6 is needed.

So first, I need to calculate gamma, the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can plug that in.

Calculating gamma: Let's compute (v/c) = 0.96, so v
