Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out. So the question is about the comoving distance of a quasar based on some observations and given cosmological parameters.

Alright, the setup: Observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in near-infrared and optical. The flux drops at shorter wavelengths. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, that's the Lyman-alpha forest maybe? Or something to do with the Lyman-alpha emission line. Because the Lyman series is in the UV, but if the observed wavelength is longer, it must be redshifted.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm in the rest frame. So if it's observed at 790 nm, that would be a redshift. Let me calculate the redshift. Redshift z is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So 790 / 121 is approximately 6.52. So z is about 5.52? Wait, no, wait. 790 divided by 121. Let me compute that. 121 times 6 is 726. 726 plus 64 (which is about 121*0.53) would be 790. So 6.52? So z ≈ 6.52? No, wait, 790/121 = about 6.52. So z is 5.52? Wait, no, z is (790 / 121) -1. So that's about 6.528 - 1 = 5.528? So z ≈5.53.

Wait, but wait. The question says the peak is at 790 nm, and below that, flux drops. So that's the Lyman-alpha emission line? Because below that (shorter wavelengths) flux drops, which would imply that the emission is at longer wavelengths. So that makes sense for a redshifted Lyman-alpha line.

So the quasar's emission line is at 790 nm, which is a redshift of about z=5.53.

Now the question is about the comoving distance (for a=1) of the quasar from Earth. The comoving distance is the distance in a universe where the expansion stops (scale factor a=1), right? Or wait, comoving distance is the distance that would be measured if the expansion were stopped, but I might be getting that mixed up. Or wait, comoving distance is the distance that corresponds to the current scale, so it's the distance now, but considering the expansion.

The options are in Gpc: 6,7,8,9.

We need to compute the comoving distance for a quasar at redshift z ≈5.53, given the cosmological parameters.

The cosmological model is Lambda-CDM with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m=0.3, dark energy Ω_lambda=0.7, and flat universe (so Ω_k=0).

So the comoving distance D_C is calculated via the integral from 0 to z of (c / H(z)) dz, where H(z) is the Hubble parameter at redshift z.

The Hubble parameter is H(z) = H0 * sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda).

So D_C = c * ∫ (from 0 to z) [1 / sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z')^3 + Ω_lambda)] dz'

This integral is a bit complicated, but I think there are standard approximations or look-up tables for comoving distances based on cosmological parameters and redshift.

Alternatively, I might remember that for high redshifts, the comoving distance increases, but the exact value depends on the cosmology.

Wait, also, for a flat universe, the angular diameter distance is related to the comoving distance, but I'm not sure if that's needed here.

I think the options are all around 6-9 Gpc, so let's think about what's typical for z=5.5.

Wait, I remember that for z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc. For higher redshifts, it increases.

But I might be getting confused with the proper distance, which depends on the curvature of the universe. Wait, comoving distance is the proper distance multiplied by (1+z), right? Or wait, no. Proper distance at a given time is D_C / (1+z). Hmm, maybe I should just look up an approximate comoving distance for z=5.5 with these parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps using an online calculator would help, but I can't do that now. Alternatively, I might recall that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance for z=5 is about 10 Gpc
