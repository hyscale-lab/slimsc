Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says there's a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics... I remember that potential energy is related to the work done in bringing charges together. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, I think that might affect the charges on it.

So, when a charge q is placed near a grounded conductor, the conductor will have induced charges. The conductor being grounded means that any excess charge can flow to the ground. So, when I bring a positive charge q near the sphere, the free electrons in the conductor will be attracted to the near side, right? That would leave the far side with a deficiency of electrons, which is like a positive charge. But since the sphere is grounded, the excess electrons can leave the sphere, so the induced charges on the sphere are such that the far side has positive and the near side negative. Wait, no, actually, when you have a positive charge near a conductor, the conductor's electrons move towards the charge, so the near side is negative and the far side is positive. But because it's grounded, the far side's positive charge can't build up because the conductor would stay neutral overall.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The conducting sphere is neutral to start with. When I bring a charge q near it, the charges
