Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through. The question gives six substances, and each undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, forming one monobromo derivative. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, especially bromination, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. Depending on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's meta or para directing, the pattern will change.

So each substituent will influence where the bromine adds. The para-isomer's yield depends on how the substituent affects the ring's reactivity and the directing effects.

Let me list the substituents:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethoxy carbonyl)
3) Cl
4) NO2 (nitro)
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Alright, I think about each substituent's directing.

1) Methyl (CH3): It's an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. It's ortho/para directing. So bromine can add in ortho, para, and meta (but maybe more para because of steric hindrance in ortho? Or no, maybe the para is the major product when there's a choice. Wait, when a substituent is ortho/para directing, the para is usually the more favored position if possible. So with methyl, the major product is para. But wait, when there are substituents that may cause steric issues, maybe the para is more favored. But I'm not sure about the exact yield. 

2) COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl): This is a strong electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. It's a meta director. So the bromine would add in the meta position relative to the substituent. So in this case, the main product is meta, which would mean the para-isomer's yield is low. So the fraction of para would be lower than something that's ortho/para directing. 

Wait, but wait, COOEt is an electron-withdrawing
