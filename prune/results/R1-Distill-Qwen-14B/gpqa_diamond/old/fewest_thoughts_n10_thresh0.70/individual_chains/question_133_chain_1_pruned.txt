Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 200 mL, right? And it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and we're asked to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12.

Hmm, orthophosphate is HPO4^2- or maybe PO4^3-? Wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates into different forms. The various KAs relate to the dissociation steps. Let me think. 

So, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps:

1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

Orthophosphate ion usually refers to HPO4^2-, I think. Or maybe PO4^3-, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, wait. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and the orthophosphate ion is the mono-deprotonated form, which would be H2PO4^- or HPO4^2-?

Wait, no. Let me think. The term orthophosphate might refer to the conjugate base. Alternatively, the phosphate ion is PO4^3-. But the problem specifies orthophosphate, which I think refers to the HPO4^2- ion. Or perhaps I should look at
