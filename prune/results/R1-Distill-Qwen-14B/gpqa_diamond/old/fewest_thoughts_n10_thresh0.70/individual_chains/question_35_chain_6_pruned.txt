Okay, I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an operator Ay. Hmm, I remember that eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra and quantum mechanics.

The problem states that Ay is given by c times S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I can write down S as:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And then Ay = c * S. Since c = h/(4π), that's a constant factor.

Wait, I think I should compute the eigenvalues of Ay. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. 

Let me compute that. So the matrix Ay is:

Ay = c * [[0, -i],
          [i, 0]]

So, Ay - a I is:

[[-a, -i c],
 [i c, -a]]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c). Let's calculate that.

(-a)(-a) is a². Then, the second term is (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) * c². (-i)*(i) is -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the second term is (1) * c². But wait, the determinant is (a²) - ( (−i c)(i c) )? Wait no, the formula is (top left * bottom right) - (top right * bottom left). So top right is (-i c), bottom left is (i c). So (−i c)*(i c) = (-i)(i) * c² = (−i²) c² = (−(−1)) c² = c². So the determinant is a² - (c²) = 0.

So the equation is a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c. Since c is h/(4π), that makes the eigenvalues h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, right?

Wait, but let me think again. Because S is a Pauli matrix maybe? Or perhaps it's related to spin matrices. I remember that Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Oh wait, S is similar to the Pauli X matrix times i or something. Let me think: The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Oh wait, that's exactly what S is here! Because S has the form of the Pauli Y matrix. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.
