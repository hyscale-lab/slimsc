Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on a few factors, like the size of the planet compared to the star and how likely the orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight.

So the question gives me two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same minimum mass, so same mass I guess. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, P1 is 3P2, or wait, no, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter. Oh right, so if Planet_2 has period P, Planet_1 has P/3.

The host stars have the same radius because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved but they have the same radii. Interesting. So R1 = R2 = R.

But the host stars have different masses. Star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Star of Planet_2. So M1 = 2M2.

Wait, how does the mass of the star affect the probability of transit? I think the probability depends on the size of the planet and the star. Oh right, the transit probability is higher when the star is smaller, because the planet has a higher chance of blocking our view. But wait, here the stars have the same radius, so that factor is the same for both.

But wait, another factor is the orbital distance. Because the orbital period is related to the distance from the star. The Kepler's third law comes into play here. The period P is related to the semi-major axis a by the equation P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) a³. Since M is the mass of the star and m is the planet. Since the planet mass is much smaller, M+m ≈ M.

So, for Planet_1, P1 = P/3. Let me denote P2 as P, so P1 = P/3.

Using Kepler's law for each planet:

P1^2 = (4π²/(G*M1)) * a1^3
P2^2 = (4π²/(G*M2)) * a2^3

Dividing these equations:

(P1²)/(P2²) = (M2)/(M1) * (a1^3)/(a2^3)

We know Planet_1's period is P1 = P/3, so (P1)^2 = (P^2)/9.

So,

( (P/3)^2 ) / (P2^2) ) = (M2)/(M1) * (a1^3)/(a2^3)

Wait, but P2 is the period of Planet_2, so for Planet_2, P2 is P. So the equation becomes:

(P²/9) / P² = (M2)/(M1) * (a1^
