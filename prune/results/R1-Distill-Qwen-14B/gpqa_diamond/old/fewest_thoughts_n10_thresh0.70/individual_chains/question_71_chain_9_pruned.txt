Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variation. They're in orbital resonance, which means their orbits are in a ratio that's a simple fraction, I think. The orbital periods are given in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1 is the innermost, right? Because usually the orbital period is shorter when you're closer to the star.

The planets have the same albedo, which means the same reflectivity. So when calculating their equilibrium temperatures, albedo won't affect the ratio—since it's the same for all, it cancels out. The question is about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Equilibrium temperature... I remember the formula for that. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by T = T_star * sqrt( (R_star) / (2a) ), where a is the semi-major axis and other terms relate to the star's temperature and radius. But wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the inverse square law. Since the planets are orbiting the same star, the star's T and R terms would be the same for all, so they can be factored out.

So the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of (1/a), because the formula for temperature would be T = T_star * sqrt( (R_star) / (2a) ). But wait, another version I remember is T = T_star * (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), but that's the Stefan-Boltzmann law approach. But maybe using the simpler version where the star's luminosity is fixed, so the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse of their semi-major axes.

But wait, I think the exact formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ), but maybe I should think in terms of a being proportional to the orbital period. Because Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis. For a star with the same mass as the Sun, P² is proportional to a³. So a = (P²)^(1/3) * some constant.

Wait, Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G
