Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's everywhere in the universe. The question is about when high-energy gamma-rays interact with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The process is gamma gamma → e+ e-.

The question is asking, at what energy would the gamma-rays' lifetime in the universe be limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. The options are a bit in the GeV range, which is really high energy, so I'm guessing this is about high-energy gamma-rays.

Wait, so I remember that the interaction of high-energy particles with the CMB can lead to their annihilation or energy loss. For example, the pair production process where a gamma-ray interacts with a CMB photon to produce electron-positron pairs. This process would limit how long a gamma-ray can exist before it annihilates, thus limiting its lifetime.

I think the lifetime of a gamma-ray would be determined by the probability of this interaction. If the probability is high enough, the gamma-ray doesn't travel far before annihilating. So to find the energy where the lifetime is limited, I probably need to calculate when the interaction cross-section becomes significant.

The cross-section for this process (gamma + photon → e+ e-) is probably an important factor here. But I don't remember the exact formula for the cross-section. I think it's proportional to some power of the energy of the gamma-ray. Maybe it's a function of the center-of-mass energy of the two photons.

Wait, the center-of-mass energy squared s would be the sum of the energies squared of the two photons, but in the lab frame, one photon is the high-energy gamma-ray and the other is the CMB photon. Wait, but the CMB photon is low energy, about 1e-3 eV. So, for a gamma-ray of energy E, the CMB photon has E_cm ~ sqrt(E * E_cm). Hmm, wait, the center-of-mass energy squared would be (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - (p_γ c + p_photon c)^2. But since the photons are moving in opposite directions (or maybe same direction?), the momenta would add or subtract.

Wait, photons are massless, so their energy is E = pc for each. So if the two photons are moving in opposite directions, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame would be E_γ + E_photon, and the momentum would be (E_γ - E_photon)/c. Wait, no, the momentum vectors would be opposite, so when adding, the total momentum is |p_γ| - |p_photon|, but wait, that's only if they are moving in opposite directions. Alternatively, if the photons are moving in the same direction, the total energy would be E_γ + E_photon, and the total momentum would be (E_γ/c + E_photon/c) = (E_γ + E_photon)/c. Hmm, maybe I need to think about this more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - ( (E_γ/c) + (E_photon/c) )² c^2. Wait, but this would be because the photons are moving in the same direction. Wait, but in reality, the CMB photons are isotropic, so the gamma-ray photon could be moving in any direction relative to the CMB photon. But for the maximum cross-section, perhaps we assume they are moving head-on, so that their relative velocities are adding in energy. Because in that case, the center-of-mass energy would be higher, leading to a higher cross-section.

So let's model the scenario where the two photons are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta are opposite. So E_γ and E_photon (1e-3 eV) are their energies, and their momenta are E_γ/c and E_photon/c respectively, but in opposite directions.

Then the total energy in the center-of-mass frame would be E_γ + E_photon, and the total momentum would be (E_γ - E_photon)/c. Wait, because if one is moving in the opposite direction, the momentum is negative. So total p = (E_γ/c) - (E_photon/c) in the same direction as the gamma-ray photon.

Then the invariant s is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

So s = (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - [ (E_γ - E_photon) ]^2.

Expanding that:

s = (E_γ^2 + 2 E_γ E_photon + E_photon^2) - (E_γ^2 - 2 E_γ E_photon + E_photon^2)
= E_γ^2 + 2 E_γ E_photon + E_photon^2 - E_γ^2 + 2 E_γ E_photon - E_photon^2
= 4 E_γ E_photon.

So s = (4 E_γ E_photon) (c^4?), wait wait, this is getting a bit messy. Because the units might be off. Let me think in terms of natural units, where c=1. Then s = (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - (p_γ - p_photon)^2.

But since E_γ = p_γ c and E_photon = p_photon c, but in natural units, E = p.

Wait, in natural units, E_γ = p_γ and E_photon = p_photon. So if the
