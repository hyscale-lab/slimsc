Okay, so I have this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory. Hmm, I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Let me think step by step.

Alright, the Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So, σ is antisymmetric, which makes sense because F is also antisymmetric (since it's the field strength tensor, which is antisymmetric in μ and ν).

First, I should figure out the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian to find κ's dimension. I remember that in 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be 4 because it's integrated over four dimensions to give an action which is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1).

So, the Lagrangian has [L]_M = 4. Let's break down each part.

The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let me consider each field's mass dimension.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism. Wait, but wait, this could be for a non-Abelian gauge field, but I think for the purpose of dimension counting, it's similar. The field strength F has the same dimension as the derivative ∂, which is 1 in mass dimension. Because F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ + some terms for non-Abelian, but the dimension comes from derivatives, so [F]_M = 1.

What about the ψ fields? The Dirac spinor ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because, in four dimensions, the Dirac equation is (∫ / ∂ + m)ψ = 0. The term with ∂ has dimension [∂] = 1, and ψ must match. So, [ψ]_M = 3/2. Therefore, ψ̄ is also 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of γ matrices. Each γ has dimension 0 because they're just matrices, so σ_{μν} has dimension 0. So when I have ψ̄ σ ψ, each ψ contributes 3/2, and σ contributes 0. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

So putting it all together:

The term in the Lagrangian is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ) multiplied by
