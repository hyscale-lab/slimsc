Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix, and it's equal to c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h divided by 4π, right? So c = h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix whose first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are similar. Oh wait, yes, S seems to resemble the Pauli Y matrix, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

So Ay is c times the Pauli Y matrix. And we're supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, among the options, decide which statement is correct.

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So let's break it down.

First, let's recall that the eigenvalues of a matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

But wait, let's compute Ay first. Since Ay = c * S, and S is the Pauli Y matrix.

So let's represent Ay. Since c = h/(4π), then:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So the matrix looks like:

Ay = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
      [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, we set up the equation Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue.

The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix (like Y) are known to be ±1. So the eigenvalues of S are ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay, which is c*S, would be c*(±1) = ±c = ±h/(4π).

Wait, no, wait a second. Because
