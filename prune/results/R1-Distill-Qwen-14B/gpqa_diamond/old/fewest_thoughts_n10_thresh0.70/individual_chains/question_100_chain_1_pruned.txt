Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a reaction sequence starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. So, C3H6 is probably propene because that's the common name for CH2=CHCH3. I think that's right because propene has the formula C3H6 and it's an alkene.

So, Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Bromination of alkenes usually refers to an addition reaction. Since carbon tetrachloride is a solvent and probably a non-polar solvent, the bromination here is likely via an electrophilic addition. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) would react with Br2 in CCl4 to form a dibromide. Wait, wait, no. Wait, when an alkene reacts with bromine, it's an addition across the double bond. So for propene, adding bromine would give 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, wait: propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, right? So the bromine adds across the double bond. The product would be 1,2-dibromopropane. So that's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good condition for elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. Since B is a vicinal dibromide (two bromines on adjacent carbons), reacting with alcoholic KOH would lead to an elimination. Vicinal dihalides can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Each Br is on adjacent carbons. So when KOH is present, it would first abstract a beta proton, leading to the formation of a double bond, releasing HBr. But since there are two Brs, perhaps two eliminations happen, but wait, no, only one elimination would happen. Wait, no, because the first elimination would form a double bond, but the dihalide has two Brs, so maybe it's a di-elimination to form an alkyne? Wait, no, wait. Wait, if you have a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromopropane), and you treat it with a strong base, you can eliminate two equivalents of HX (HBr here) to form an alkyne. Because each elimination step removes one HBr and forms a pi bond. So for 1,2-dibromopropane:

(CH2Br)CH2CH2Br → (after first elimination) → CH2BrCH2CH2 → wait, no, wait. Let me think: the structure is CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the initial compound is 1,2-dibromopropane, which is BrCH2-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, wait, no: propene is CH2=CHCH3, so after bromination, it's CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So the structure is BrCH2CH2BrCH3? No,
