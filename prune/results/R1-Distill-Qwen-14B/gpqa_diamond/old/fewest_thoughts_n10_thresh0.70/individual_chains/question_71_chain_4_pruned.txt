Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variation. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They all have the same albedo, and the question is about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2. The options are given, and I need to find the ratio.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I think the formula involves the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but wait, maybe it's T = T_star * (L_star / (16πσ a²))^0.25? Or is it T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a))? No, wait, I'm mixing things up. Let me think.

Oh right, the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula T_p = T_* * sqrt(R_*/(2a)), assuming it's a black body and ignoring any greenhouse effects. But wait, if all the planets have the same star, then R_*, L_*, etc., would be the same for all. So the ratio of their temperatures would depend on their distances.

Wait, the key here is that all the planets have the same albedo, which is the reflectivity. Albedo affects the absorbed sunlight, but in the equilibrium temperature formula, albedo (usually denoted as 'a' or 'A') comes into play. The formula with albedo is T = T_* * sqrt( (1-A) R_* / (2a) ). But wait, if all the planets have the same albedo, then (1-A) is the same for all. So when taking the ratio of their temperatures, the (1-A) and other constants would cancel out.

Wait, but maybe I should just think in terms of the inverse square law for the flux. The equilibrium temperature depends on the fourth root of the flux, because the Stefan-Boltzmann law says power is proportional to T^4. So the flux from the star at a planet's location is L/(4πa²), where L is the star's luminosity and a is the orbital distance.

So the equilibrium temperature is T = [(L (1-A) )/(16 π a² σ )
