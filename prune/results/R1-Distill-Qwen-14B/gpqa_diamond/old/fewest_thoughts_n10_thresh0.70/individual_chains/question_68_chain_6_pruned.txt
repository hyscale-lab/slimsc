Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the setup is about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. Then, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. So when the magnetic field is along Z, the spin is aligned, right? Spin 1/2 particles have their spin quantized along the direction of the magnetic field. So initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz. But when the field changes to Y, the entire scenario changes because the Hamiltonian will now depend on Sy instead of Sz.

Wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * Sz. So the magnetic field B in the z-direction would lead to a Hamiltonian H = -mu · B. Oh wait, but magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so H would be -gamma S · B. But wait, actually, the energy of a magnetic dipole in a field is H = -mu·B. So if mu = gamma S, then H = -gamma S · B.

So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so B = B0 ẑ. So the Hamiltonian becomes H_initial = -gamma B (S_z). The eigenstates are |↑z> and |↓z>, with energies -gamma B (ħ/2) and +gamma B (ħ/2), but wait, wait. Wait, S_z is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. Wait, actually, for spin 1/2, S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But in the problem, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. So H_initial = -mu · B = -gamma S_z B. So the energies are E = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E = +gamma B (ħ/2), but wait, that seems a bit off because usually, the energy of a spin in a magnetic field is proportional to the dot product.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Pauli matrices. Let me
