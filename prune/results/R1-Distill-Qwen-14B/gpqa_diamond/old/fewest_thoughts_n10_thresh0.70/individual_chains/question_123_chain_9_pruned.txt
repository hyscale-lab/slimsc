Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we've got a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. From the ejecta's frame of reference, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. We need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially moving at relativistic speeds, we might need to consider time dilation or length contraction. But wait, let me think again. Since the problem mentions both frames are inertial, maybe it's a case of special relativity.

Wait, the ejecta and the Galaxy are moving towards each other. From the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta would be moving at the same speed, right? Because velocities are relative. So the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s towards the center.

But now, the question is about the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, because time intervals can differ between frames. So we need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame corresponding to those 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, time dilation comes into play here. The time experienced in one frame is different from another when they are moving relative to each other. The formula for time dilation is t' = gamma
