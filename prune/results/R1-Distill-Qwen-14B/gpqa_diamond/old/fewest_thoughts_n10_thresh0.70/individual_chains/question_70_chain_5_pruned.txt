Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and try to piece together the reactions and the substances involved.

The problem starts by talking about solid A reacting with gas B. It uses 8 equivalents of B to form product C, which is bright red. Then, C reacts with gas D in a 2:1 ratio to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Additionally, when C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid and G is a weak one. Also, gas D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out what each of these substances could be. Let's break down each reaction.

First, the reaction between A and B. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. The product C is bright red. I remember that some red products in reactions often involve transition metals, especially in coordination compounds. Maybe something like copper sulfate pentahydrate, which is blue, but wait, not red. Or maybe something else. Another possibility is that the product is a metal oxide or sulfide. Wait, bright red... Oh, maybe it's a nitrate? I'm not sure.

Wait, when solid A reacts with gas B, which is in excess (8 equivalents), perhaps B is acting as a ligand. Maybe A is a metal, and B is ammonia or another ligand. For example, if A is copper metal and B is ammonia, but ammonia is a gas, right? But 8 equivalents of ammonia... Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is another gas like CO, but that's a stretch.

Let me think about the next part. C reacts with gas D to produce E. Gas D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D and B make H, a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, etc. But D and B are gases, so when they react, maybe they form something like H2O? Or another liquid.

Wait, gas D reacting with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. Let me think about possible gases. If B is NH3 (ammonia), and D is HCl (a gas), then reacting them would
