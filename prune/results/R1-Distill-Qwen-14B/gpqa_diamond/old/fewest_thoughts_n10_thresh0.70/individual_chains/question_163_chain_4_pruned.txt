Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve it. Then, we also need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different pH and volume values.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. Since it's a hydroxide, it should react with a strong acid. The reaction would be something like Fe(OH)3 + H+ → Fe^3+ + H2O. But wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so it might not dissolve easily. Oh right, but when you add a strong acid, it should protonate the hydroxide ions, causing it to dissolve.

So, the first thing I need to do is find the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be helpful here. Let's calculate that.

Fe has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So:

Fe: 55.85
O: 3 * 16 = 48
H: 3 * 1 = 3
Total molar mass = 55.85 + 48 +3 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, wait, is that right? Oh, wait, Fe(OH)3 formula is correct. So, 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 would be:

moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let's say approximately 9.36e-4 mol.

But wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the molar mass. Iron is Fe, then three OH groups. So each OH is O (16) + H (1) = 17. So each OH is 17 g/mol, times 3 is 51. Plus Fe: 55.85. So 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. Yep, that's correct.

So, 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol.

But wait, I should use exact numbers. Let me calculate more precisely. 0.1 / 106.85 = 0.0009357 mol, approximately 9.357e-4 mol.

Now, when Fe(OH)3 reacts with a strong acid, like HCl (assuming it's monobasic), each mole of Fe(OH)3 will need 3 moles of H+ ions because the formula has three OH groups. So the reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So, moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 9.357e-4 = 0.002807 mol.

The strong acid is monobasic, so it provides one H+ per molecule. So the number of moles of acid needed is 0.002807 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol/L. So, the volume of acid needed is moles / concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm³. Hmm, but looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³, which is close. But wait, the question is about the minimum volume needed, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait a second, the solution is prepared in 100 cm³ total volume. So, when we add the acid to the Fe(OH)3, the total volume is 100 cm³
