Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting from a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's reacted with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. This forms product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150°C to give the final product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4, with the options being A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out the structure of product 4 and then count the distinct hydrogens. Let me think about each step.

First reaction: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. I remember that when you have a diene with iodide and di bromides, it's likely an elimination or substitution reaction. Wait, but sodium iodide and dibromomethyl groups—oh, maybe it's an example of the Wurtz reaction or some kind of coupling.

Wait, another thought: when there's a dihalide (like dibromomethyl) reacting with a base, it can lead to elimination. Alternatively, if you have a diene and a dihalide, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction? But Diels-Alder usually involves a diene and a dienophile. Wait, but the starting material is a bicyclo diene, so maybe it's acting as the diene.

Wait, but the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is the dienophile? Or maybe it's a diene as well. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's think about the reagents. Sodium iodide is present, and at elevated temperature. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but with two equivalents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cross coupling. Oh wait, when you have a dihalide and a metal like NaI, it can lead to elimination, but with two equivalents, perhaps two eliminations happen.

Wait another idea: the starting material has a tert-butoxy group. The bicyclo structure is norbornene, right? So 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is norbornene with a tert-butoxy substituent at position 7. Norbornene is a bridged bicyclic compound with two double bonds.

So when norbornene reacts with two equivalents of the dihalide and Na
