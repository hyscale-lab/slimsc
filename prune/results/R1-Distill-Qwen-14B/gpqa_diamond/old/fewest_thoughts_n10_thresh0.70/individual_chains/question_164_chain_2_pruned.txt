Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem here. Hmm, it's about binary star systems and their masses. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says there are two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. So the orbital period for system_1 is longer, 2 years, and system_2 is 1 year. Interesting.

Then, the radial velocity (RV) variations are given. For system_1, the two stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So, what's the mass ratio, system_1 mass divided by system_2 mass.

Wait, I remember that in binary stars, the velocity amplitude is related to the mass. Oh right, the more massive star would have a lower velocity because it's more massive and thus doesn't move as much. So the mass ratio is inverse to the velocity ratio.

Let me think about the formula. The mass function comes into play here, I think. The mass function for each star in a binary system is (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ), but since we're dealing with the same system, the inclination might be the same. But wait, maybe I can find the mass ratio without getting into inclination.

Alternatively, another approach: in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star moves slower. The velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass.

So, for each system, the two stars have velocities v1 and v2. The mass ratio is M1/M2 = v2/v1, assuming they're orbiting each other and the period is the same for both. Wait, but the orbital period is the same for both stars in a system. So for each system, the mass ratio is v2/v1.

Wait, noâ€”each system's period is given as the eclipse period, which is the same for both stars in the system. So for system_1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5 km/s. So v1 is 10, v2 is 5. So mass ratio M1/M2 = v2/v1 =
