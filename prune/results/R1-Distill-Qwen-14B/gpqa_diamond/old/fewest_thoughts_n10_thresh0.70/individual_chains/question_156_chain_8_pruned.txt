Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves two reactions, both using mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes usually forms an epoxide. Wait, but wait, when you have an alkene reacting with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. Then treating with aqueous acid might lead to some ring-opening, maybe acid-catalyzed reactions.

Wait, but let's think about each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA. E-geometry, so the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. Epoxidation of an alkene with mCPBA forms an epoxide. Since the starting alkene is E, the resulting epoxide would have a certain configuration. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens. Wait, how does epoxide ring opening work under acidic conditions? The epoxide oxygen becomes protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, the nucleophile (like water) attacks the less substituted carbon because in acid conditions, the more substituted carbocation is more stable, so the nucleophile attacks the more substituted side, leading to the more stable carbocation.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in position 4 and 5, right? So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 where positions 4 and 5 are double bond. So structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmm, maybe I should write it as CH2CH2
