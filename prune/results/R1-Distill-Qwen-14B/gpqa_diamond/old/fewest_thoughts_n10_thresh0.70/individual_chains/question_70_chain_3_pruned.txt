Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember these are related to molecular shapes and point groups. Like, water is VSEPR with bent structure, so its point group is D2h or something. Wait, maybe I should start by identifying all the compounds involved.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so A + 8B → C. What could that be? Bright red... Oh, maybe copper compounds? Copper(II) sulfate is blue, but copper(I) oxide is red. Or maybe something else. Alternatively, think about other red products. Iron(III) oxide is reddish. Wait, but let's think about the other reactions.

When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces extremely hazardous product E. So C + 2D → E. Then, C also reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So, C + H2O → A + F + G. 

D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D + B → H. H is a solvent, maybe something like ethanol, water, or something else. Hmm.

Let's try to piece this together. So first, A and B reacting. Maybe A is a metal, B is a halogen? Or maybe A is a metal oxide and B is a halogen.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible products. Since C reacts with water to produce two acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak. Strong acids could be HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids might be like acetic acid, H3PO4 (but that's more moderate). Wait, but when a metal oxide reacts with water, it typically forms a base, not acids. Oh, but wait—maybe C is a metal sulfide? When metal sulfides react with water, they can produce H2S (which is a weak acid) and maybe another acid if it's
