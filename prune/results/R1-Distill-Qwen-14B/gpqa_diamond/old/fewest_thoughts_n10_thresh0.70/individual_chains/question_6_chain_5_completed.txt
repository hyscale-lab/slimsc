Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So the problem is about a particle of mass m moving in two dimensions, and the potential is given as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. We're supposed to find the energy spectrum from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially for systems with central potentials, we often use polar coordinates because of the symmetry. The potential here seems to depend on r² and also on cos²θ. Wait, cos squared theta. That makes me think that the potential might have angular dependence, but maybe we can separate variables or find some kind of effective potential.

Wait, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Oh right, cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So let me rewrite the potential:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * [ (1 + cos(2θ)) / 2 ]

Let me compute that. So expanding the terms:

= (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² [1 + cos(2θ)]

= (1/2 + 3/4) k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ)

Wait, 1/2 is 2/4, so 2/4 +3/4 is 5/4. So V= (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ)

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Wait, perhaps I should think about whether this potential is separable or if it allows for an effective potential when considering motion in r and θ.

Alternatively, maybe the potential can be rewritten to resemble a shifted harmonic oscillator. Another approach is to think about whether the system is similar to something like the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator but in 2D with some angular component.

Wait, wait a second. Another thought: in polar coordinates, for a potential that includes r² and angular terms, sometimes the problem can be transformed into a harmonic oscillator in radial and angular variables. But I'm a bit rusty on this.

Wait, another idea. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out the r²:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ ]

Wait, 1 + 3 cos²θ can be written as 1 + 3*(1 + cos 2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos 2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of a shifted angular coordinate. Or perhaps it's better to separate the problem into radial and angular parts.

Wait, but in two dimensions, the radial part is straightforward, but the angular part depends on the angular potential. Let me think about the Hamiltonian.

The Hamiltonian in polar coordinates is H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r,θ).

So substituting V(r,θ):

H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Hmm, perhaps I can group the terms involving cos²θ. Let me see:

The angular part of the Hamiltonian is (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Wait, but cos²θ is (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that:

= (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ)

= (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos 2θ.

Hmm, but the (3/4)k r² term is a function of r, so perhaps it can be considered part of the effective potential for the radial motion. But the cos2θ part complicates things.

Wait, but perhaps the angular part can be written in terms of an effective angular momentum term. Let me think about the angular equation.

Wait, the angular part of the Hamiltonian would involve terms in cos2θ, which suggests that the potential is not spherically symmetric but depends on θ. That complicates the separation of variables because the angular part isn't just a function of θ but also appears multiplied by cos 2θ.

Wait, maybe I should make a substitution. Let me consider φ = 2θ. Then cos(2θ) becomes cosφ. But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps this potential can be transformed into an effective harmonic oscillator in some angular variable.

Alternatively, perhaps the angular part of the potential can be written as a function that allows us to treat the angular momentum operator in a specific way.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of a particle in a harmonic oscillator potential with an additional angular dependence, which suggests that the energy levels might be quantized with more than just the usual radial quantum number.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the potential can be rewritten as a sum of terms that resemble harmonic oscillators in r and another variable. Let me see.

Looking again, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

We can factor out (1/2)k r² as the leading term. So:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [ 1 + 3 cos²θ ]

Wait, 3 cos²θ is 3 times cos²θ, which can be written as 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2. So:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [ 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) ]

= (1/2)k r² [ (1 + 3/2) + (3/2) cos2θ ]

= (1/2)k r² [ 5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ]

Hmm, maybe this isn't the right approach. Let me think about the effective potential for the angular part.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the total Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is:

H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

I can group the terms as:

H = [ (p_r²)/(2m) + (1/2)k r² ] + [ (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ]

Hmm, that might not be correct because the cos²θ term is multiplied by r², but perhaps we can treat each part as a separate oscillator.

Wait, another approach: Let's see if the angular part can be expressed as a harmonic oscillator.

The angular part of H is (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (3/2) k r² cos²θ.

Wait, but wait, p_θ is m r² d/dθ, so p_θ² = m² r^4 (d/dθ)^2.

So the angular part becomes:

(p_θ²)/(2m r²) = [ m² r^4 (d²/dθ²) ]/(2m r²) ) = (m r²/2) (d²/dθ²)

So the angular Hamiltonian is:

H_θ = [ (m r²/2) (d²/dθ²) ) ] + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Hmm, but r is a variable here, so this complicates things because the angular part depends on r, which is a radial variable. So maybe this approach isn't the best.

Wait, perhaps instead of separating variables, I should think about this as a problem in which the potential has both r and θ dependence, but perhaps the system can be transformed into a form where the potential is effectively an oscillator in some other coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe I can look for a substitution that makes the potential separable into r and θ parts.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because in 2D, maybe it's easier to write in x and y. Let me try that.

We have r^2 = x² + y², and cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ = x²/(r²).

So substituting into V:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (x²/r²)

= (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, wait, really? Let me check.

Because cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x² / r².

So (3/2)k r² cos²θ = (3/2)k r² * (x²/r²) )= (3/2)k x².

So the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

= (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + (3/2 k x² )

= ( (1/2 + 3/2 )k x² ) + (1/2 k y² )

= 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, that simplifies to a potential in x and y that's quadratic but with different coefficients for x² and y². So that's V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Hmmm, that's interesting. So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is a sum of harmonic oscillators in x and y, but with different frequencies.

Wait, in that case, the Hamiltonian would be separable into x and y parts, each being a harmonic oscillator.

Because the potential is separable, I can treat the x and y motions independently. So the total energy would be the sum of the energies from each direction.

So for a harmonic oscillator in 1D, the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) ℏω, where ω is the angular frequency.

In the x-direction, the potential is (1/2)m ω_x² x², where ω_x^2 = (2k)/m. So ω_x = sqrt(2k/m).

Similarly, the y-direction has V = (1/2)k y², so ω_y^2 = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Wait, but wait, in the x-direction, the potential is 2k x². So comparing to the standard form (1/2)m ω² x², the 2k x² would be (1/2)m ω_x² x² → 2k = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Wait, let me compute:

Standard HO: V = (1/2) m ω² x².

Given V_x = 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x².

So 2k = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, V_y = (1/2)k y^2 → (1/2) m ω_y² y^2 = (1/2)k y^2 → m ω_y² = k → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the energy in the x-direction is E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) ) = (2n_x + 1) ℏ sqrt(k/m) ) * (1/2 * 2) → Wait, perhaps better to compute it step by step.

Wait, no, wait:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x.

Similarly, E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

So E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) → because ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ * sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy E is E = E_x + E_y.

So,

E = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Factor out ℏ sqrt(k/m):

E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Expanding that:

= [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, 2(n_x + 1/2) is 2n_x +1. And (n_y +1/2) is n_y + 1/2.

So adding them: 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ * sqrt(k/m).

So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the potential conversion to Cartesian coordinates.

Wait, yes, when I expanded V(r,θ), I got V(r,θ) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Because:

(1/2)k r² is (1/2)k (x² + y²) → which is (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y².

The other term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ = (3/2)k x².

So sum of those is (1/2 k x² + 3/2 k x²) = 2k x², plus (1/2 k y²).

So yes, the potential in x and y is 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

So each direction is a separate harmonic oscillator with their own frequencies. So yes, the energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in two dimensions under the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \), we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**:  
   The potential can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates by expressing \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \) and \( \cos\theta = \frac{x}{r} \). Substituting these, the potential becomes:  
   \[
   V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]  
   This shows that the potential is separable into independent harmonic oscillators in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, with different spring constants.

2. **Energy Levels in Each Direction**:  
   For a 1D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by \( E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega \), where \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).  
   - In the \( x \)-direction, the potential is \( 2kx^2 \), corresponding to a frequency \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). The energy levels are:  
     \[
     E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]
   - In the \( y \)-direction, the potential is \( \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), corresponding to a frequency \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). The energy levels are:  
     \[
     E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]

3. **Total Energy**:  
   The total energy is the sum of the energies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions:  
   \[
   E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   Factoring out \( \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), we get:  
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, the correct energy spectrum matches **Option C**:  
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

Answer: C
