Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the distance its ejecta travels. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, okay, so惯性参考系的问题。Inertial frames mean we can use special relativity principles here. Because the frames are moving relative to each other, I think I need to consider time dilation or length contraction or something like that.

The problem states that both are inertial frames. So, the Galaxy is stationary in its own frame, and the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s according to the ejecta's frame. Or wait, no, wait. The problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. Which would mean in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s, right?

Wait, no. Because if frame A sees frame B moving at v, then frame B sees frame A moving at v as well, but in the opposite direction. So yeah, if the ejecta's frame (say, S') sees the Galaxy (S) moving at 60,000 km/s towards it, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me check: the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 1/5th of that. So relativistic effects are definitely in play here.

The question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in S' (ejecta frame), time is 50 seconds. I need to find
