Okay, so I have this problem here about two planets orbiting a star. I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let's try to think this through step by step.

So, the question is about finding the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, let's see what information I have. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Both planets are detected using transit and RV methods, which probably means they're pretty close since both methods are effective for nearby planets.

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect, thus influencing their equilibrium temperature.

The problem mentions that each planet induces a Doppler shift in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a shift up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 up to 0.04 Å. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure how this plays into the problem, but I think it's related to the radial velocity method, which measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, perhaps? Because a more massive planet would cause a larger wobble in the star.

Wait, but the RV method gives the mass of the planet based on the Doppler shift. So the amount of shift depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period and distance. But since the star's mass is given, maybe I can use the Doppler shifts to find the planets' orbital distances, or maybe their orbital periods. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about equilibrium temperature, which is determined by the formula:

Teq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) 

Wait, no, the formula I remember is: 

Teq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

But wait, the exact formula for equilibrium temperature is:

Teq = T_star * ( R_star / (2 a) )^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

Where A is the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, A cancels out when taking the ratio.

So, the ratio Teq1/Teq2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1)) / (R_star/(2 a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1). Therefore, I need to find the ratio of their orbital distances, a2/a1.

But how do I get a from the given Doppler shift data?

The Doppler shift comes from the
