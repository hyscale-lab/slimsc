Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, the setup is about two planets orbiting a star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and its orbital period is 3 days. The question is about a second planet, which is biggerâ€”2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still showing both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in circular orbits with the same orbital plane.

Hmm. So, I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we stop seeing its reflected light, maybe. Both of these events require that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits (the planet must be in the line of sight) and that we can also see it behind the star for the occultation. So, the orbital period of the second planet must be such that this alignment occurs.

Wait, but how does the orbital period affect this? Oh, I think it's about the synodic period or something related to the relative motion between the two planets. Because if the second planet's orbital period is too long, it might not catch up with the first planet often enough for the events to occur.

Wait, no. Maybe it's about the orbital periods being such that the two planets are in a configuration that allows the second planet to transit the star as seen from Earth. Or perhaps it's more about the orbital periods being in a ratio that allows the transits and occultations to happen.

Wait, another thought. Occultation happens when the planet moves behind the star. So, for us to see that, the planet must be on the opposite side of the star relative to Earth. So, the two events (transit and occultation) would occur when the two planets are aligned in a certain way relative to each other and the star.

Wait, but the problem says the second planet must exhibit
