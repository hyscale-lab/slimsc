Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that there's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and the orbital period is 3 days. Now, they're asking about a second planet with 2.5 Earth radii. What's the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still showing both transit and occultation events?

Hmm, right. So transit and occultation events. Transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we lose its light. For both to happen, the orbital plane must be aligned so that the observer's line of sight intersects the planet's orbit. So the two planets need to be in the same orbital plane, which they are, as per the question.

Wait, but how does the orbital period of the first planet affect the second? Oh, wait, no, the question is about the maximum period of the second planet. So I think this has to do with the relative positions and the time it takes for both transits and occultations to occur.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up terms. Occultation happens when the planet is behind the star, so the time between transits and occultations depends on the orbital period. Or maybe it's about the alignment of their orbits so that both events can occur.

Wait, I think I need to think about the Hill sphere or orbital stability, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the orbital period of the second planet such that it doesn't orbit too fast or too slow, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. The problem is about the maximum orbital period such that both transit and occultation events occur. So for this, I think that the second planet's orbital period must be such that it's possible for it to pass in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star from our point of view.

Wait, but both events require that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough. So the impact parameter must be small enough for the transit. So the
