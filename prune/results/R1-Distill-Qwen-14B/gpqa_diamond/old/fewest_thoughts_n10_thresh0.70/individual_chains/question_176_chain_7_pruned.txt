Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized. Let me check the norm of this vector. The components are (-1, 2, 1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 = 6. Oh wait, so the state isn't normalized. So maybe I should normalize it first. To do that, I'd divide each component by sqrt(6). So the state vector becomes ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ). Got it.

Next, the operator P is given by a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that down. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, I'm trying to see what kind of operator this is. It looks symmetric, so it's Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable. The eigenvalues of
