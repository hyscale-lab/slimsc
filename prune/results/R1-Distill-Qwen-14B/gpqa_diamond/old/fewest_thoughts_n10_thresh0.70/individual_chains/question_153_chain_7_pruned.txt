Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's break it down step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition, which I remember is a type of nucleophilic addition reaction that occurs at the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. These reactions are important in synthesis because they form carbon-carbon bonds, and the intermediates are enolates, which are resonance stabilized.

So, the problem has three different reactions, labeled A, B, and C, and I need to determine the products. Then, among the options, choose the correct set of products.

Let's start with each part separately.

Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH.

Wait, I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl malonate derivative. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. So when it acts as a nucleophile in a Michael addition, the enolate attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

The other reactant here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw its structure. The acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO2Me, but wait, the substituents are in the 3-position. So the structure is CH2-C(CO2Me)=CH-p-tolyl? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Wait, the compound is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO2R, so substituting at the 3-position would be the CH2 group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH- with the substituents in a certain position.

Wait, maybe the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-O-Me? No, wait, acrylate is CH2
