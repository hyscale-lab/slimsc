Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. So, there's an unknown compound, and we've used three characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to determine the chemical formula from the options given.

First, let's break down each piece of information.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but it's very broad. Carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch, while alcohols are less broad. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid group? Or maybe another O-H containing group.

Then, there are two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typical of carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl, perhaps conjugated? Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution, like conjugated carbonyls or maybe an amide. Wait, but the question says the compound is an unknown, but possible formulas are given.

In the 1H NMR, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like CH2=CH-. So the compound has a double bond, perhaps an alkene. So the structure might have both a carbonyl group and an alkene.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments have a mass of 45? Let me think. 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH2CH3 (but that's 45? Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's compute: CH3OCH2CH3 has a formula of C3H8O2. Wait, molecular weight would be (3*12)+(8*1)+(16*2) = 36 +8 +32=76. No, that's not 45. Maybe 45 is something else. Another approach: possible fragments. 45 could be a carbonyl-containing fragment. For example, CO2 would be 44, but that's not it. Wait, maybe a CH2=C-O- group? Or maybe a ketone. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be an ethyl group with a carbonyl. Let me think about possible fragments.

Alternatively, 45 is the mass of (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. The molecular weight of acetone is 58 (12*3 + 6*1 + 16 = 36+6+16=58). So maybe that's not it. Wait, maybe it's a different fragment. Let's think about the possible options.

The possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Let me list their degrees of unsaturation. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero here.

So for each option:

A) C6H12O2:

Degrees of Unsat. = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond.

Wait, but wait, with O's. Let me think again. The formula is C6H12O2. The general formula is CnH2n+2O2. Wait, but depending on the structure, like an ester might have a double bond. Wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so probably a double bond. So if the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond (from the NMR), then the degrees of unsaturation would be two: one for the carbonyl (C=O) and one for the double bond.

Wait, let's recalculate degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Degrees of Unsat. = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. But if there's a double bond and a carbonyl, that's two degrees. Hmm, that's a conflict. So maybe this option can't have both a double bond and a carbonyl group. So that would mean something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Or maybe it has an aromatic ring, which is three degrees (one ring and two double bonds). But wait, looking at the options, the formulas don't have enough carbons for that. C6 is a benzene ring (three double bonds) plus another ring? Unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

For a general formula, for an alkane: CnH2n+2.

Each degree of unsaturation (like a ring or a double bond) adds 2 to the H count deficit.

So for each compound:

Option A: C6H12O2.

The formula is C6H12O2.

Assuming it's similar to an ester, which has the formula R-O-CO-R'. Let's see, for example, methyl propionate is C3H6O2.

But our compound is C6H12O2.

The general formula for an ester is CnH2nO2. For methyl propionate (n=3), the formula is C3H6O2.

Wait, so for our case, if it's an ester, with n=6, then H would be 14 (2*6 + 2) but we have 12 H. That's a deficit of 2 H, which would imply two degrees of unsaturation. So two double bonds or one double bond and a ring, maybe.

Wait, but our compound has vinyl hydrogens, meaning a double bond. So that's one degree. If the ester group is a carbonyl (another degree), then two in total. So the formula would have to fit that.

So for option A: C6H12O2.

Degrees of Unsat. = (2*6 + 2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. But we have two degrees (double bond and carbonyl), so that would require a degree of unsaturation of 2. So this might not fit. Hmm.

Option B: C6H10O.

Degrees of Unsat. = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 2. So two degrees. So perhaps a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But in the FTIR, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650, which suggest two carbonyls, but that would be three degrees (each carbonyl is a double bond). Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, 1700 could be a carbonyl, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation or another carbonyl.

Wait, if the compound has a carbonyl group and a ring, that would sum to two degrees. But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So, maybe the structure is a cyclic ketone? Hmm, but then what about the O in the formula? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an aldehyde with a ring. But aldehyde would have a peak around 2820 and 2720 for the aldehyde protons, but I don't think that's indicated here.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which I thought was O-H. Option B is C6H10O. So that can be a structure like cyclohexanol with a double bond, but then in the IR, O-H would be present. But how about the other peaks?

Wait, the IR has 1700 and 1650. 1700 could be a carbonyl, but if it's an alcohol, there's no carbonyl. So maybe that's not right. So perhaps option B is not the correct one.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Degrees of Unsat. = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2= 2. Two degrees.

So perhaps a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

In the IR, broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which could be O-H. Then two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated, or perhaps an aromatic ring (but that's usually around 1600). Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

If the structure has two carbonyl groups, like an ester and a ketone, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone) which has one carbonyl, but that doesn't account for the 1650 peak.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an aromatic ester, like phenyl acetate. But benzene rings have strong absorption around 1600. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is another carbonyl, perhaps an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl would have a conjugated double bond, so the carbonyl peak would be around 1680-1700, and the conjugated double bond might show a peak around 1650. Hmm, that could fit.

So if the structure has an ester group (from O2) and a conjugated double bond, then the degrees of unsaturation would be two: one from the double bond, one from the ester. Wait, no, the ester is a carbonyl (another double bond). So that would be two degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, but the ester itself contributes a double bond (carbonyl). So if the molecule has a double bond elsewhere, that adds another degree, making total three. But the degrees of unsaturation for option C is only two. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester with a conjugated double bond. So, R-O-CO-R', where R has a double bond. Let's think about that. For example, methyl acrylate has the structure CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its formula would be C4H6O2. The degrees of unsaturation would be 3: two from the double bonds (the ester and the vinyl group), and one from the oxygen. Wait, no, degrees of unsaturation don't count oxygen. Hmm.

Wait, the degree of unsaturation is only based on C and H. So for methyl acrylate, the formula is C4H6O2. So the calculation is (2*4 +2 -6)/2 = (10-6)/2=2. Two degrees. But the structure has two double bonds (the ester and the vinyl), so that makes sense. So two degrees of unsaturation.

So in the case of option C (C6H10O2), two degrees, but the structure would have a carbonyl (from ester) and a vinyl group (another double bond). So that adds to two degrees. That fits.

In the FTIR, the broad peak at 3000 would be the O-H of an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But in an ester, the O-H is not present. Wait, no. Esters don't have O-H groups. So the FTIR would not show a broad O-H stretch. Hmm, that's a problem. Because if the compound is an ester, then the FTIR shouldn't have a broad peak at 3000, but maybe a sharp one from the ester's O-H? Wait no, esters don't have O-H. They have an OR group and a COOR group, but no hydroxyl.

Wait, so if the FTIR shows a broad O-H, that suggests either an alcohol, a carboxylic acid, or maybe an enol or something else with an O-H group.

Looking back, the options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So which of these would have an O-H group?

Option B is C6H10O. That could be an alcohol, which would have a broad O-H peak. But then, the IR also shows 1700 and 1650, which would be carbonyls. An alcohol wouldn't have carbonyl groups. So that's a conflict. So perhaps option B is out.

Option D is C6H12O. That could be an alcohol as well, but again, not having carbonyl groups.

So the O-H must be part of another group. Like a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the formula would include two O's, but let's see.

What's the formula of a carboxylic acid? It's CnH2nO2. For example, hexanoic acid is C6H12O2. So that's option A.

So, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the formula is C6H12O2 (option A). Then, the IR would show a broad O-H peak at 3000, which fits.

What about the other IR peaks? The 1700 could be the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be something else. Wait, maybe an aromatic ring's absorption, but for a six-carbon chain, it's more likely a conjugated carbonyl or something else.

Wait, but in a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700-1720 cm^-1, which fits the peak at 1700. The 1650 could be an overtone or another group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring, but a six-carbon chain would need to have a benzene ring, but that would require more unsaturation.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So the compound must have a double bond. If it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, then the formula would be C6H10O2 (since it's a carboxylic acid: CnH2n-1COOH → formula is Cn+1 H2n+1 O2. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think: a carboxylic acid is RCOOH. So R is C5H11, then formula would be C6H12O2 (since R is C5H11, RCOOH is C6H12O2). But if R has a double bond, like C5H9 (since R is CH2CHCH2CH2CH2-, but with a double bond, R becomes C5H9, making RCOOH C6H10O2, which is option C.

Wait, that's possible. Because if the R group has a double bond, then the formula would be C6H10O2.

So, let's think about R being C5H9. Then RCOOH is C6H10O2 (since R is C5H9, RCOOH is C5+1=6 carbons, H: 9 + 2 (from COOH) = 11? Wait, wait, no. Let's compute.

RCOOH: R is C5H11 would give RCOOH as C6H12O2. But if R is C5H9 (so double bond in R), then RCOOH would be C6H10O2. Because R has 5 carbons and 9 H: each double bond reduces 2 H.

So R is C5H9, which has one degree of unsaturation (the double bond). Then RCOOH has another double bond (the COOH group, which is a carbonyl). So total degrees of unsaturation would be 2.

Which matches option C: C6H10O2.

So the FTIR would show the broad O-H of the carboxylic acid. The 1700 peak is the COOH carbonyl. The 1650 peak could be from another group, perhaps a conjugated double bond.

But wait, the 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. So R must have a double bond. So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH, or similar. So the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

Now, looking at the mass spectrum. The fragment peak at m/z 45. What could that be?

45 is a significant mass. Let's think about possible fragments. For a compound with a carboxylic acid group, perhaps the fragment comes from the acid part. Or from the R group.

If the acid is broken down, maybe the acid part (like COOH) would lose some groups. Alternatively, the double bond could lead to a fragment.

Wait, 45 could be CH3COOH (30? No, 30 is too low. Wait, molecular weight of CH3COOH is 60. Hmm.

Wait, the molecular formula is C6H10O2. The molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16) = 72 +10 +32 = 114.

So the molecular ion would be at m/z 114. The fragment at 45 is way lower, so it's a significant fragment.

Another approach: think of the possible fragments. 45 is the mass of (CH2)2O (44?), wait, no. Wait, 45 is C3H7O (3*12 +7*1 +16=36+7+16=59, no). Or maybe it's a different combination.

Wait, wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO (but that's 58). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, think about the possible ions. 45 might be the result of losing certain groups.

Wait, 45 could be a CH2CO (43, no). Wait, maybe it's the loss of a larger group leaving a smaller fragment.

Alternatively, think about whether 45 is a common fragment. For example, in esters, the loss of an R group could leave the other part.

Wait, another possibility is the fragment is an ethylene group with something. Or perhaps a ketene ion?

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the breaking of the molecule at the double bond. For example, if there's a double bond in R, breaking at that point could give a fragment.

So, if the compound is RCOOH, and R is CH2CHCH2CH2CH2, but that doesn't have a double bond. Alternatively, R is CH2CH2CHCH2CH2. Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Another approach: let's think about the likely structure. The compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond in the R group. So R is an alpha,beta-unsaturated group, perhaps.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are typically in a conjugated system, like CH2=CH-.

So the structure might be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. That would have the double bond and the carboxylic acid group.

The molecular formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

Now, the mass spectrum: when such a molecule undergoes fragmentation, perhaps it loses a part of the molecule. For example, losing a fragment like CH2CH2COOH, which is 72? No. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks at the double bond, leading to a smaller fragment.

Wait, the molecular weight is 114. If a fragment is at 45, that's almost half (45*2=90, but 114-45=69). Hmm, perhaps it's a cleavage product.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the acid group. For example, the acid could lose CO2, but that gives a fragment of 114-44=70. Not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, the molecule could lose the COOH group as a whole. The COOH group has a molecular weight of 44 (12+16*2 +1 for the O? Wait, COOH is COOH has molecular weight 44 (12 + 16*2 +1? Wait, no: COOH is C=O-O-H. So COOH is 12 + 16*2 + 1 (H) = 12+32+1=45. Oh, wait, that's exactly 45. So the fragment at m/z 45 is the COOH group, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the COOH group is a fragment, but in mass spectrometry, when a neutral fragment is lost, it would not appear as a peak because the ion would lose it. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is something else.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule breaks to form a CH2=CH- group. Let's compute the mass of CH2=CH- plus some other group. CH2=CH- has a mass of 28 (12*2 + 1*4 = 24 +4=28). Hmm, not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a carbonyl-containing group. Let's think about the acid dissociating into COOH and the rest. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the fragment could be the acylium ion, but that's a higher mass. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: think of the possible options and their possible fragments. Let's take each option and see if any would produce a m/z 45 fragment.

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's a carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), then in the mass spec, could it lose CO2 (44) to give a fragment of 114-44=70. But then, the peak at 45 isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester (lactone), but I'm not sure about the fragments.

Option C: C6H10O2. If the structure is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. Upon fragmentation, perhaps the molecule breaks between the double bond and the COOH group. So the fragment would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- and COOH. Wait, the COOH as a fragment would have a mass of 45. So the peak at 45 could be the COOH group as a fragment.

But wait, in mass spectrometry, when a molecule breaks, the two parts are charged. So if the COOH group is lost as a neutral fragment, it wouldn't appear as a peak. Alternatively, if the COOH becomes a charged fragment, perhaps as a protonated ion.

Wait, but mass spec typically shows the mass of the intact ion. So if the molecule breaks, the two parts would have their own m/z. For example, if the molecule breaks into a fragment with mass 45 and another with mass 69 (114-45=69), then both would appear as peaks.

So in this case, the peak at 45 would correspond to the COOH group (mass 45). Therefore, option C would fit this.

Putting it all together:

FTIR shows broad O-H (carboxylic acid), strong peaks at 1700 (carbonyl) and 1650 (possibly conjugated or another group, but perhaps it's the double bond's C=C). NMR has vinyl protons, so a double bond is present. Mass spec has a fragment at 45, which fits the COOH group.

So the formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


The unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The following conclusions were drawn:

1. **FTIR Analysis**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.  
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system or another carbonyl group.

2. **¹H NMR Analysis**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (CH=CH) indicate the presence of a double bond in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of a COOH group, as its molecular weight is 45.

4. **Chemical Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation**:  
   - The degrees of unsaturation were calculated for each option:  
     - **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1. This does not account for the presence of both a double bond (from vinyl hydrogens) and a carbonyl group (from IR).  
     - **B) C₆H₁₀O**: Degrees of unsaturation = 2. However, this formula does not include a carbonyl group, which is evident from the IR spectrum.  
     - **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: Degrees of unsaturation = 2. This matches the structure of a carboxylic acid with a double bond, consistent with the IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry data.  
     - **D) C₆H₁₂O**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1. This does not account for the presence of a carbonyl group or a double bond.

5. **Final Structure and Fragmentation**:  
   - The compound is identified as a carboxylic acid with the formula C₆H₁₀O₂. The broad O-H peak in the IR corresponds to the carboxylic acid, the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak corresponds to the carbonyl group, and the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could correspond to a conjugated system. The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR confirm the presence of a double bond. The fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponds to the COOH group.

Based on the evidence from all techniques, the correct chemical formula is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

Answer: C
