Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused about where to start. Let me read it again.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, stability constants are for the formation of complexes. So each β represents the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ions. Let me think: β1 is for the first complex, probably [Co(SCN)]^(n+), but I'm not clear on the charge here. Wait, Co is Co^2+ initially. So when it binds SCN-, which is also -1 each, the charge of the complex would change.

Hmm, maybe the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)2]^0, [Co(SCN)3]^- , and [Co(SCN)4]^2-? Because each SCN adds -1. So for each βn, n is the number of SCN attached.

So β1 = 9 is for the first complex, which has one SCN. So the complex is [Co(SCN)]^{2+ -1} = [Co(SCN)]^+.

Similarly, β2=40 would be [Co(SCN)2]^{2+ -2} = [Co(SCN)2]^0, which is neutral. That's the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the blue one. So the percentage we're looking for is the fraction of [Co(SCN)2]^0 in the total cobalt species.

So the problem is to find the fraction of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)2]^0.

The total concentration of Co is 0.01 M, and
