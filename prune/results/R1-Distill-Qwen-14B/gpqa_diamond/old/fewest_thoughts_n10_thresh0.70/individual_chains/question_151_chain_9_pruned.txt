Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable is represented by the matrix P. The first row of P is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). I need to find the probability that measuring this observable at time t yields 0.

Hmm, right. So, in quantum mechanics, when you have an observable represented by a matrix, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probability of each outcome is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's projection onto the state of the system.

Wait, but in this case, the matrix P is the observable. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P, and then see which eigenvalue is 0. Then compute the probability of that.

Alternatively, maybe I can diagonalize P or find its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. If 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the state in that eigenvector.

Let me think about the matrix P. Let me write it down.

P is a 3x3 matrix:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, this looks symmetric, so it's a Hermitian matrix, which makes sense because observables are Hermitian.

Now, to find the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of P are the possible outcomes when measuring the observable.

I can try to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

The matrix for P - λI would be:

Row 1: -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ

Computing the determinant of this matrix... Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but let's try.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] 
- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ) ]
+ 0 * [ ... ] (since the third element in the first row is 0, that term drops out)

Wait, no, that's not right. The determinant for a 3x3 matrix is a bit more involved. Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to find the eigenvalues.

Another approach: notice the structure of P. It's a symmetric matrix with a particular pattern. Maybe I can find the eigenvalues by looking for eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps P has a simple structure. Let me think about possible eig
