Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass, right? The question is about figuring out which system is more massive. Let me think about what I know.

So, the problem says there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses, and their periods are given. System_1's period is 2 years, and system_2's is 1 year. Wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses, which I think corresponds to the orbital period of the binary system. So the period is the same as the orbital period of the stars around their mutual center of mass.

Then, spectroscopic observations give the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have RV variations of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. And in system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I remember that radial velocity curves are used to determine the masses of stars in a binary system because the velocities are related to the masses and the orbital period.

Wait, the mass function comes into play here. I think the mass function relates the velocities, the period, and the masses. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me try to recall.

The mass function for a spectroscopic binary is given by:

f(M) = ( (v_2)^3 P ) / (2π G )

Where v_2 is the velocity of the companion, P is the orbital period, and G is the gravitational constant. But wait, I think that's for when you have one star observed (the primary) and you relate its velocity to the mass of the companion. Alternatively, maybe the mass function is used when only one star's velocity is observed, and the other is not. But in this case, both stars' velocities are given.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the velocities and the masses of the two stars. In a binary system, the two stars orbit the center of mass. So their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. Because the center of mass is where m1 * a1 = m2 * a2, where a is the semi-major axis. And since velocity is proportional to (2π a)/P, the velocities would be v1 = (2π a1)/P and v2 = (2π a2)/P. So, v1 / v2 = a1 / a2 = m2 / m1. Because m1 a1 = m2 a2 → a1/a2 = m2/m1. So, v1/v2 = m2/m1.

So, from the velocities, I can find the mass ratio. Let me write down the given velocities.

System_1:
v1 = 10 km/s
v2 = 5 km/s
So, v1/v2 = 2/1 → mass ratio m2/m1 = 2. So m1/m2 = 1/2.

So, the total mass of system_1 is m1 + m2. Let's say m1 = x, m2 = 2x. So total mass M1 = 3x.

System_2:
v1 =15, v2=10 → v1/v2
