Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. So, the question is about an electron moving at a certain speed, and we need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. 

Wait, the problem says the electron is traveling at v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. Oh wait, 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters. So, I need to find ΔE. 

I think the Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Right, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So, first I should calculate Δp, the uncertainty in momentum.

Momentum p is mass times velocity. But since we have an uncertainty in position, maybe I should find the minimum uncertainty in momentum using Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). Wait, no, I think the exact inequality is ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2. So, the minimum Δp would be ħ/(2Δx). 

So, let me compute that. Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 1e-10 m. So, Δp = ħ/(2 * 1e-10). Let's plug in the numbers.

ħ is about 1e-34 J·s, so dividing by 2e-10 m gives (1e-34) / (2e-10) = (1/(2)) * 1e-24 kg·m/s. Wait, because ħ has units of J·s, which is kg·m²/s. So when you divide by m, you get kg·m/s, which is momentum's unit.

So, Δp ≈ 5e-25 kg·m/s. Now, to find the uncertainty in energy, I think we need to relate this to the uncertainty in kinetic energy. Because the electron's energy is its kinetic energy since it's moving at a significant speed.

The kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv². But wait, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is the uncertainty in KE, which would be ΔKE. Since KE is a function of p (because p = mv, so KE = p²/(2m)), maybe the uncertainty in KE can be found using the derivative of KE with respect to p.

Alternatively, perhaps for small uncertainties, we can approximate ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp. Let's think about that. 

The exact expression for KE is (p²)/(2m). So, the derivative of KE with respect to p is p/(2m). So, ΔE ≈ (p/(2m)) * Δp. 

Wait, but p is the momentum of the electron. Wait, but in our case, we're considering the uncertainty. So p is the average momentum, and Δp is the uncertainty around it. So, maybe I can compute E as (p²)/(2m), and then ΔE would be (2p Δp)/(2m) )? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the derivative of KE with respect to p is d(KE)/dp = p/(m). Because KE = p²/(2m), so derivative is (2p)/(2m) )= p/m. Hmm, no, wait: derivative of (p²/(2m)) is (2p)/(2m) )= p/m. So, yes, dE/dp = p/(m).

So, ΔE ≈ (p/(m)) * Δp. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because when you have ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp, that's the first-order approximation. So, if E is a function of p, then the uncertainty in E is approximately the derivative times the uncertainty in p.

But in our case, the electron is moving with a speed v, which gives a certain p. So p = mv, where m is the mass of the electron, about 9.11e-31 kg.

So, let's compute p first. v is 2e8 m/s. So p = 9.11e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = approximately 1.822e-22 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, when I calculated Δp earlier, I got 5e-25 kg·m/s. So, ΔE would be (p/m) * Δp. Let's compute that.

p is 1.822e-22 kg·m/s. m is 9.11e-31 kg.

So (p/m) = (1.822e-22)/(9.11e-31) ) ≈ 2e8 (m
