Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology techniques and genetics. Hmm, let me try to break this down. 

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. They created a bicistronic vector with both ligand and receptor, and then tested expression in mice. But when they looked, there was no green signal. I need to figure out why.

First, let me think about the vector setup. They used a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two ORFs in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, ligand comes before receptor.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that the CBA promoter is strong and often used for expression in various tissues. The receptor is after an IRES element, which is a type of internal ribosome entry site. IRES allows for the translation of the second gene without a second promoter. So the ligand would be expressed from the CBA promoter, and the receptor from the IRES-driven expression.

Now, the stops. There's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand ORF and mCherry. That means that without Cre, the mCherry won't be expressed. Because the stop cassette blocks the ORF. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette before eGFP. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites, right? So Cre recombinase, which recognizes loxP, won't cut the lox2272 sites. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh, right, I think lox2272 is a variant that can be used with Cre but sometimes requires different conditions or maybe another recombinase.

Wait, in the setup: the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So the idea is that when Cre is expressed, it will excise the stop cassettes, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

So, the ligand is under CBA, which is a promoter, so it's expressed. The receptor is under IRES, so it should be expressed as well, but the stop cassettes prevent the fluorescent tags unless Cre is present to excise them.

When they breed the mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wildtype background, and then cross to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre is probably expressed in neural crest-derived cells, like astrocytes or other cells derived from neural crest.

So when the offspring are born, they have the Cre from SOX10-Cre. The Cre should excise the stop cassettes. For the ligand, the loxP sites are between ligand ORF and mCherry. So, Cre would remove the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, for the receptor, the stop is in lox2272 sites. So if Cre can cut lox2272, then the stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit fuzzy on whether Cre can cut lox2272. From what I remember, lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre but has a different arrangement. I think that Cre can recognize and cut lox2272 sites, but perhaps in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the lox2272 is only cut when a certain type of Cre is used, but I think the standard Cre should work.

But in the question, the vector has loxP and lox2272. So, the ligand's stop cassette is flanked by loxP. The receptor's is lox227
