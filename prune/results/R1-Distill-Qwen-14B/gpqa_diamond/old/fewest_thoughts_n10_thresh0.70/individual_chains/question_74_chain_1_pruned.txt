Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it. Alright, the question says that an atom has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed without it decaying, and we want to find out the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, that doesn't sound quite right. No, wait, the next 150 minutes from now? Or from the initial time? Oh, wait, the question says 50 minutes have passed, so the remaining time is 50 minutes left after that (since 100 minutes was the initial period). Or wait, no. Let me read the question again.

Oh, wait. The initial decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, that's the total decay probability in 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed without decay. So, after those 50 minutes, how much time is left? The initial 100 minutes would have started when we began monitoring. So, 50 minutes have passed, so 50 minutes remain in that initial 100-minute window. Or wait, maybe not. Or perhaps the decay process is independent of the initial 100 minutes. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? So the decay probability is based on the time elapsed multiplied by the decay constant. The decay probability is 32% (or 0.32) in 100 minutes. So the decay constant λ can be found using the formula P = 1 - e^(-λt). So here, P is 0.32, t is 100 minutes. So I can solve for λ.

Let me write that down: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). So e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ * 100. So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100.

Calculating that: ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit lower. Let me compute it exactly. Let's see, 0.68. ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the situation is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So, we need the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but wait—no, wait. The next 150 minutes from the time we started observing? Or from the current time?

Wait, the question says, "50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed." So we're at t=50 minutes. We want the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. So that would be from t=50 to t=200 minutes. But wait, the initial decay probability was given for 100 minutes. Is there any connection beyond that? Or does the decay process continue beyond 100 minutes?

Wait, in radioactive decay, the decay follows an exponential law regardless of time. So the decay probability in any time interval is calculated based on the remaining time. So the question is, given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

But wait, in radioactive decay, the decay is memoryless. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the probability for the future. So the probability of decay in the next t minutes is still based on the time t multiplied by λ.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The decay probability given is 32% in 100 minutes. So that's the probability that it decays within the first 100 minutes. But since 50 minutes have passed, the probability it hasn't decayed is 68% (since 100 minutes: 32% decay, 68% not). Given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what is the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, no. Because
