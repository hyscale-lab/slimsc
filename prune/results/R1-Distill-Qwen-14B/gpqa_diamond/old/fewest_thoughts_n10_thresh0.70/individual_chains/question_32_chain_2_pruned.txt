Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, which I think means it's lithium-6, since lithium typically has 3 protons and 3 neutrons makes it Li-6. 

Hmm, I remember that for particles moving at relativistic speeds, we need to use the theory of relativity, specifically the energy-momentum relation. The problem is asking for the total energy of the nucleus. 

First, I should figure out the rest mass of the lithium nucleus. Lithium-6 has an atomic number of 3. The mass number is 6, so it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and same for a neutron. So each proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for each neutron. 

Wait, but maybe I should be precise. The exact mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². I think that's right. But wait, when you combine nucleons into a nucleus, there's a mass defect due to binding energy. But since this is a nucleus, perhaps I should use the mass of the entire nucleus, not individual protons and neutrons. 

Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to use the sum of the individual masses, which might be an approximation. I'm a bit confused here. Wait, the problem probably expects me to use the rest mass of the lithium nucleus. So I should probably calculate that. 

How do I find the rest mass of Li-6? The atomic weight is about 6.016 g/mol, but I need the mass in MeV/c². Alternatively, maybe I can look up the exact mass. Oh wait, but in a problem like this, perhaps they want me to use the mass as the sum of the protons and neutrons. Let me check: 3 protons at 938 MeV each and 3 neutrons at 939 MeV each. 

So that's 3*(
