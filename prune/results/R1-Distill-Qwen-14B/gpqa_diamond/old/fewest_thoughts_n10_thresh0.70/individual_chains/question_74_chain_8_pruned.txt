Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but let me try to think it through. So the question is about the probability of a single atom decaying after some time has already passed. Hmm, right, radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and it doesn't depend on how old it is.

Wait, the question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So in 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance the atom will decay. Oh wait, but wait, I recall that decay probabilities are often modeled with an exponential decay law. So the general formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

But wait, the problem mentions that the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So that must mean that the probability of decay in that time is 32%, which is 0.32. So the probability that the atom has decayed by time t is given by 1 - e^(-λ t). Oh, because e^(-λ t) is the probability that it hasn't decayed yet.

Wait, let me think. The decay constant λ is related to the half-life. The half-life T_1/2 is the time it takes for half the atoms to decay. And λ is ln(2)/T_1/2. But I'm not sure if I need to find λ here.

Alternatively, since we know the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32, maybe I can find λ directly from that.

So, the probability of decay in time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t). So when t is 100 minutes, P(100)=0.32. So plugging in: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let me rearrange that equation:

e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - (ln(0.68)) / 100.

Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.5) is about -0.693, and 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, so ln(0.68) would be a less negative number. Let me approximate ln(0.68). Let's see, e^(-0.4) is about 0.6703, which is pretty close to 0.68. Oh wait, e^(-0.4005) is approximately 0.68, so ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005.
