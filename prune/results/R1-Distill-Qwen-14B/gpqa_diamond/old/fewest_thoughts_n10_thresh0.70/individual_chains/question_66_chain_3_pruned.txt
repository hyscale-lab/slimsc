Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible interactions that could be added to the Standard Model, respecting certain symmetries.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. I think Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. So if a theory respects Poincare, it must also respect Lorentz. But SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's generally built with a cutoff scale where these symmetries are still approximately valid. So operators must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, but wait, the SM itself doesn't have some symmetries necessarily? Or does it?

Wait, the SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all the operators must be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

Poincare symmetry (2) is the combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. But wait, in effective theories, you might have operators with higher derivatives, which could complicate translation invariance. Or is that not the case? No, wait, SMEFT includes operators of various orders in derivatives and fields, but translation symmetry is part of Poincare. Since SMEFT is a Lorent
