Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity, right. I remember that's when you look for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. So, the star moves a little towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift. 

The question says we have two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the stars are identical in mass, and the planets are similar, but their Doppler shifts are different.

Planet #1's spectral line shifts by 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's by 7. Wait, so why would the shift be different? I think the Doppler shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. But since both are in circular orbits, maybe the inclination isn't varying much. Oh wait, but the problem says the shifts are periodic, so maybe they have the same inclination? Or perhaps the mass of the planet is the same? Wait, the question says both have masses similar to Neptune, so their masses should be about the same. So the difference in Doppler shift must come from other factors.

Wait, the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. So, the bigger the shift, the higher the star's velocity. So the star's velocity is higher for Planet #2. But how does that relate to the planet's orbital period?

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by a formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the distance between them, and the orbital period. The formula is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*) )) ) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (P * (2π))^(1/3) )) 

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the formula as K = ( (G * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (2π)^(1/3) ) * (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(something). Wait, maybe I should look for a different approach.

I think the key is that both stars have the same mass (like our Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like). So the only varying factors would be the orbital period and the semi-major axis.

Wait, the Doppler shift (K) is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (P)^( -1/3 ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) )) ) * sin i. But since the star's mass M_* is same for both, and M_p is same (since both are Neptune-like), and assuming the inclination angle i is the same (since the shifts are periodic, so i is close to 90 degrees for both), then K should be proportional to (1/M_*) * (P)^(-1/3) * (M_p) * ... Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Another approach. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ]^(1/1) / ( (P * (2π) )^(1/3) ) ) * sin i )

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

K = (v) = [ ( (G * M_p^3 ) / (M_*^2 + M_* M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (sin i) ) / ( P * (2π)^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe a better way is to consider the formula as:

K = ( (G * (M_p) )^(1/3) * sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (2π P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps the exact formula is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) / (2π^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. Let me try to find the relationship between K and the orbital period.

The formula I recall is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of Kepler's third law. The orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the masses.

Kepler's third law: (P^2) / (a^3) = (4π²)/(G(M_* + M_p)) )

Since M_* is much larger than M_p (since M_p is Neptune-like, M_* is Sun-like), M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So,

P² ≈ (4π² a³)/( G M_* )

So, a³ ≈ ( G M_* P² )/(4π² )

But how does that relate to the Doppler shift K?

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (P)^( -1/3 )

Since M_p << M_*, we can approximate (M_* + M_p) ≈ M_*.

So,

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * (P)^( -1/3 )

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Given that both planets have same M_p, and same M_*, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1) ^ (1/3 )

Wait, no, because K1 is proportional to 1 / P1^(1/3), K2 proportional to 1 / P2^(1/3).

So, K1 = (constant) / P1^(1/3 )
K2 = (constant) / P2^(1/3 )

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, let me check:

K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Divide K1 by K2: K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 =5/7.

5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Take both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1 

So, P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

So, P2 = P1 * (125/343) ≈ 0.364 * P1

Which means that the period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's orbital period compared to planet #1.

Wait, no. The question says, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So, if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So, the period of planet #2 is shorter, meaning it's about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period. So, the question is asking, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, that would be P2 / P1 = 0.364, approximately 0.36 times. So, planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter.

But wait, looking back, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, higher K means shorter period. Since planet #2 has a higher K (7 >5), it must have a shorter period.

So the ratio of P2 to P1 is (5/7)^3.

Wait, let me compute that.

5/7 is approximately 0.714. 0.714 cubed is around 0.364.

So, the ratio P2/P1 is about 0.364, so planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Well, it's shorter, so it's not longer. The answer would be less than 1.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which is the P2/P1 ratio. So, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period, which is about 0.36 times. So, the answer would be A.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So to find P2/P1, which is 0.36. So, it's about 0.36 times as long, meaning it's shorter. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1, so it's not longer. So the correct answer is that planet #2's period is about 0.36 times longer than planet #1? No, wait, that's not right because 0.36 is less than one. So, it's 0.36 times as long, which is the same as 36% the length. So, the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, which is shorter, not longer.

Wait, but the question is "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So, if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, so it's shorter. So, it's not longer. So, the answer would be 0.36 times, but that indicates it's shorter. So the question is asking, P2 is longer than P1 by what factor? But since it's shorter, the factor is less than 1, which is option A.

But wait, let me think again. Let me make sure I have the ratio correct.

K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1=5, K2=7.

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Cubing both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

(5/7)^3 is 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 = 0.364 * P1.

So, the period of planet #2 is 0.364 times that of planet #1, i.e., it's shorter. So, it's not longer. So the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter, but the question is phrased as "how many times longer is P2 than P1?" So, the answer would be that it's shorter, but the options are all positive numbers. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times as long, meaning it's not longer but shorter. So the correct answer is A) ~0.36.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \), assuming the star's mass \( M_* \) and planet mass \( M_p \) are constant. Mathematically, \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \).

For Planet #1 and Planet #2, the Doppler shifts are \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), respectively. Since \( K_1 / K_2 = (P_2 / P_1)^{1/3} \), we can solve for the ratio of orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{P_2}{P_1}^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}.
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, \( P_2 / P_1 \approx 0.364 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
