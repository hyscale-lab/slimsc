Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Let's see if I can break it down.

The setup is that there are three genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants for each, and double mutants. The resistance levels are given for each of these mutants. The question is about figuring out the relationships between these genes, like whether they're transcription factors, epistatic, or something else.

First, I remember that epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So if gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the phenotype of B depends on the presence of A. Like, if a plant has a mutation in gene A, then the effect of gene B's mutation (or wild type) doesn't matter anymore.

Also, transcription factors are proteins that help turn on other genes. So if a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes it regulates might not be expressed.

Looking at the data:

Wild-type resistance is 100%. The single mutants:
- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type)
- g2: 0% (totally resistant)
- g3: 50% (half as resistant)

Double mutants:
- g1g2: 0%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%

Hmm. So the most severe phenotype is in the g2 single mutant and the double mutants involving g2. Let me think about these results.

In the single mutants, knocking out G2 makes the plants completely susceptible (0%). That suggests that G2 is critical for resistance. Maybe it's a transcription factor because if it's not working, the downstream genes aren't expressed, leading to no resistance.

Now, the double mutants can help us understand the relationships. Let's look at g2g3: 0%. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 0%, same as when only G2 is knocked out. Wait, but when only G3 is knocked out, resistance is 50%. So why is g2g3 the same as g2? Maybe because G2 is upstream and its knockout already causes the maximum susceptibility, so adding another mutation (G3) doesn't make it worse. That suggests that G3 acts downstream of G2. Because if G2 is a transcription factor for G3, then without G2, G3 isn't expressed, so knocking out G3 doesn't change anything.

Similarly, the g1g2 double mutant is 0% resistance. The g1 single mutant has 75% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than the g1 single mutant (75%). That suggests that G1's function is additive or that G2's function is separate from G1, but when both are gone, the susceptibility is worse. Wait, but why is that?

Alternatively, maybe when you have both G1 and G2 knocked out, the effect is more severe than either alone. So if G2 is a transcription factor for G1, then knocking out G2 would also prevent G1 from being expressed. But in the single mutant g1, the resistance is 75%, so in that case, G2 is probably still active. Wait, but the g2 mutant has 0% resistance, which is worse than g1.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G2 are both transcription factors acting in the same pathway. Let me think again.

Looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% â†’ which is the same as g2 (0%). So if G2 is upstream, when G2 is knocked out, G1 might not be expressed (if G2 activates G1). But in the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance, which is higher than g2 (0%), so
