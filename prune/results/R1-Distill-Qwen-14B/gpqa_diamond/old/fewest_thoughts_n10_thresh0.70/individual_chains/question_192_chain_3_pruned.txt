Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me think about it. I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. Let me try to break this down.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity with radius r, and the center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So the conductor is bigger, and the cavity is off-center. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

Wait, so point P is outside the conductor because L is greater than R. Also, l and L are both larger than R, so P is definitely outside. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the distance from the conductor's center is L. The angle between l and s is theta, which I think relates to the positions of P relative to the cavity and the conductor.

I remember that in electrostatics, the charges in a conductor redistribute themselves. Since the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must induce an opposite charge. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so the induced charges on the inner surface would be -q to cancel the field inside the conductor material. Then, because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, because the total charge is the sum of inner and outer.

Wait, but the conductor is initially uncharged. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to shield the conductor's material from the electric field. Then, the outer surface must have +q so that the total charge remains zero (since the initial conductor was uncharged). Wait, no, wait. The conductor's initial charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface has +q.

But wait, so the outer surface's charge is +q. So
