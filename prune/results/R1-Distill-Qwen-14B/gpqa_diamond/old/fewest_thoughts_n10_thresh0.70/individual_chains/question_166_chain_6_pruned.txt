Alright, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the Standard Model extension and calculating the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson through radiative corrections. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down.

So, the question provides a Lagrangian with various terms. Let me parse what's going on here. The Lagrangian has terms for the singlet fermions NR, a scalar doublet S, and a singlet scalar φ. The terms include kinetic terms for NR and φ, a covariant derivative squared term for S, some interaction terms involving φ and the singlet fermions, and a potential V(φ, S, H). Oh wait, H isn't mentioned in the fields above, but maybe it's part of the potential.

The fields have specific transformations. The NR are singlets, so they don't transform under the gauge groups. The S is a scalar doublet, so it's in the 2 of SU(2), and φ is a singlet. The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are given as ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², where ⟨φ⟩ is x and ⟨h⟩ is v. Wait, wait, but in the fields, S is a doublet, so maybe the H comes from S? Or perhaps H is another scalar in the model. Hmm, maybe S is part of the Higgs field, and φ is another scalar. The potential V probably includes terms that lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking, like a Mexican hat potential for S, perhaps.

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons arise when a symmetry is broken but not completely, so they have a mass that's small compared to the symmetry breaking scale. In the Standard Model, the Higgs mechanism gives the Higgs boson as a Goldstone boson, but it's 'eaten' by the gauge bosons. But in extensions, sometimes there can be multiple Higgs fields, leading to multiple Goldstone bosons or pseudo-Goldstone bosons.

Wait, the Lagrangian has a term -y_i/2 φ N̄_iR^c N
