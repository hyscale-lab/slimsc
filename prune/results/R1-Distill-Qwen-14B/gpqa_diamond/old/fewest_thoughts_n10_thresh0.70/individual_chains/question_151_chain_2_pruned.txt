Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting zero. 

Alright, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, right? So I should probably check if this vector is normalized. Let me calculate the magnitude squared. 

The vector is [-1, 2, 1]. So the squares are 1, 4, 1. Adding them gives 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state isn't normalized yet. I'll need to normalize it when I compute probabilities because probabilities depend on the inner products.

So the observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down P as given. The first row is [0, 1/√2, 0], the second row is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], and the third row is [0, 1/√2, 0]. So P looks like this:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Now, to find the probability of getting a measurement of 0 when we measure P, I need to figure out the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then find the projection of
