Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, mainly the star's temperature and the distance of the planet from the star. Oh right, the formula is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula. Let me think. The equilibrium temperature formula is given by T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2). Yeah, that's right. Because the star's light spreads out over the area of the planet's disk, and the planet radiates as a blackbody, so the flux it receives is proportional to (R_star/a)^2. But the planet's cross-section is Ï€R_p^2, but since we're considering equilibrium, the planet's radius doesn't matter here because it's the same for both planets, and when calculating the ratio, it might cancel out. Or wait, no, the formula doesn't involve the planet's radius. Right, because the planet's own size affects more things like transit depth, but not the equilibrium temperature. So the equilibrium temperature only depends on the star's temperature, the star's radius, and the planet's distance.

But wait, the problem gives both planets the same albedo. Oh, albedo is the reflectivity, which affects the absorbed energy. But since both have the same albedo, it cancels out when taking the ratio of their temperatures. So I don't have to worry about that.

So the main task is to find the ratio T1/T2 where T is equilibrium temperature.

To find T1 and T2, I need their orbital distances a1 and a2. But how do I find a1 and a2 from the given data?

The problem states that both planets are detected using transit and RV methods. Using RV, the Doppler shift gives the mass and the distance. The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which relates to the planet's mass and its distance.

Wait, the RV
