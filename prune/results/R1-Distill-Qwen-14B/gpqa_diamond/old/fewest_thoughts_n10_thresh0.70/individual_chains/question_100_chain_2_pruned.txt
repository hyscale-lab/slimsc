Okay, I need to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's start by breaking down the reaction steps and identifying each compound. 

So, the first compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, that could be either propene or cyclopropane. But considering the next reaction, bromination in CCl4. Bromination of alkenes typically adds bromine across the double bond, so compound A is probably propene (propylene), which is an alkene. So A is CH2=CH2CH3? Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Right.

So when propene undergoes bromination in CCl4, it would undergo an addition reaction. The bromine (Br2) would add across the double bond. Since it's in CCl4, which is a non-polar solvent, it's likely a dibromide. Wait, propene has a single double bond. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So compound B is BrCH2CHBrCH3? Or wait, the structure depends on where the bromines add. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, so the molecule becomes BrCH2CH2CH2Br? Wait, no. Wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So adding Br would make Br add to C1 and C2, making CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When Br2 adds, each Br adds to each of the double-bond carbons. So the product would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? So 1,2-dibromopropane? Or is it 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, no, addition across the double bond leads to vicinal dihalide, so 1,2-dibromopropane.

So compound B is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give BrCH2CH2BrCH3? Hmm, no, wait, I think I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. Propene has three carbons: CH2-CH2-
