Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

So, the setup is that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. Heating them produced a mixture of gases. These gases were passed through several tubes. The first tube had anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, and its weight increased by 3.60 grams. The second tube had a Ca(OH)2 solution, and there was no change in weight. The third tube had red-hot copper, and it gained 0.80 grams, forming CuO. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is about finding the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, okay, so first, let's break down the problem. The heating of the salts produces gases, which react in different ways in the tubes. Let's think about each part.

The first tube is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a drying agent. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb moisture, so maybe the gas here is water vapor. Wait, but wait: Mg(ClO4)2 reacts with water. The formula for that reaction is Mg(ClO4)2 + H2O → Mg(ClO4)2·H2O, which is a hydrate. So when the gas passes through, the Mg(ClO4)2 gains mass because it's absorbing water. The mass gained is 3.60 grams, which would be the mass of the water absorbed.

So the mass of water is 3.60 grams. Let's calculate the moles of H2O. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 moles. So 0.2 moles of H2O were absorbed by tube 1.

Next, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change, which suggests that no gas reacted with it. If the gas was, say, CO2, then Ca(OH)2 would react, but since there's no change, maybe there's no CO2? Or perhaps the gas that did pass through didn't react. Wait, another possibility: if the gas was a neutral gas, like N2 or Ar, perhaps it just passed through without reacting. But I'm not sure yet.

The third tube is red-hot copper. The weight gain is 0.80 grams, and CuO is formed. So the reaction here is probably the gas reacting with copper. Let me think about what gases react with copper. Common gases that can react are H2S, maybe NH3, or possibly CO or something else. Wait, but in the presence of heat, perhaps it's something like H2 reacting. Let's think: when H2 reacts with Cu, it forms H2O, but that's under certain conditions. Alternatively, SO2 might react with copper, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the gas that passed into the third tube must have been something that reacts with copper to produce CuO. So maybe the gas is H2S? Because H2S can react with CuO to form CuS, but perhaps under heat, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, SO2 could react with copper, but I'm not exactly sure about that reaction's conditions.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction with copper. So, if the gas is H2S, then H2S + Cu → CuS + H2(g). Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the gas is water vapor? But water wouldn't react with copper unless it's superheated steam, but I'm not sure that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's H2 gas, which
