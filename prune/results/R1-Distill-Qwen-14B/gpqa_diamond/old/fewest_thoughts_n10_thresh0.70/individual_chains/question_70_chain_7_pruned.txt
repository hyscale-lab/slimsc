Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. So, the question is about a series of reactions, and we need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

First, I'll try to break down each reaction given.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. That's a lot of B, 8 eq. Maybe A is something that reacts in an 8:1 ratio with B. I'm thinking perhaps something like sulfur reacting with something else, but I'm not sure yet.

Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. That suggests perhaps a diatomic gas reacting with C. Maybe D is O2 or Cl2? Or perhaps another diatomic gas like F2?

Next, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C reacts with H2O, it produces A and two acids. Strong and weak acids, which could be something like H2SO4 and H2SO3 if A is sulfur, but I'm not certain yet.

Then, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Solvents like water, ethanol, etc. Wait, D reacts with B to form H, which is a solvent. So what gases D and B would combine in a 1:1 ratio to form a common solvent?

Let me think about possible reactions. Let's make some educated guesses.

Looking at the first reaction: A + 8 B → C.

If A is a metal, maybe, but more likely, perhaps a non-metal. Let me think of elements that form bright red products. For example, perhaps A is sulfur. Sulfur (S8?) reacting with something else. But wait, if A is solid, perhaps it's an elemental solid. So when B is a gas, maybe O2? But O2 is diatomic, and 8 equivalents would imply a stoichiometric ratio of 8.

Wait, sulfur (S8) reacting with O2 would produce SO3? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is something else.

Wait, let's think
