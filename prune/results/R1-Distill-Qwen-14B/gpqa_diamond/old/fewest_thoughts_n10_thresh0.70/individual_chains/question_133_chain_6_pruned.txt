Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water.

Hmm, I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The K_a values are given as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. These values will be important for determining the pH and the species present.

So both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O are phosphate salts. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which I think is H2PO4^- when dissolved. Na2HPO4 is sodium dihydrogen phosphate, which would provide HPO4^2- ions. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate, so when dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, let's clarify. The salts:

- KH2PO4: when dissolved, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
- Na2HPO4·2H2O: dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2(HPO4)).

So the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Depending on the pH of the solution, these ions can interconvert. The presence of both might set up a buffer solution.

Since both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, the buffer will be between their respective K_a values. Let me think: the H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, so the relevant K_a here is Ka2,
