Okay, so I have this physics problem about light passing through a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question is: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab?

The options are A, B, C, D, which are different formulas.

Alright, so I remember that when dealing with light in a medium, the speed of light changes. The index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (c) to the speed in the medium (v). So v = c/n. Since c is given as 1 here, the speed in the glass is 1/n. But wait, that's the speed when the medium is stationary. What if the medium itself is moving?

I think this is a case where I need to use the concept of relative velocity. But how exactly? I'm a bit confused about whether to apply Galilean transformations or maybe consider relativistic effects. Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify, but since the velocity v is probably much smaller than c (because n is just a refractive index, like maybe 1.5 or so), maybe we can use non-relativistic, or Galilean addition of velocities.

Wait, but wait. Light in a medium... Hmm. When the medium is moving, how does that affect the speed of light measured in the lab frame?

I remember that in a medium, the speed of light is v = c/n. But when the medium is moving, the observed speed might not just be a simple addition because light's speed is tricky. I think in the frame where the glass is moving, the speed of light inside it is still v=c/n. But from the lab frame, which sees the glass moving, how does that change the observed speed?

Wait, maybe I should model this using reference frames. Let's say the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_glass = 1/n. But because the glass is moving, we need to transform the velocity of the light
