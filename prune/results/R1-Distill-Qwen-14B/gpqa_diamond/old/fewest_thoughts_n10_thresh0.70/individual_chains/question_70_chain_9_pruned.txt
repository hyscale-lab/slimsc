Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question involves a series of chemical reactions and then determining the molecular symmetry group of a product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules, so I'll need to figure out what E looks like.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C also reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

I think I can work backwards from these reactions to identify the substances involved.

First, let's think about reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. Since F is a strong acid and G is weak, what acids are these? Strong acids like H2SO4, HCl, HNO3. Weak acids could be something like H3PO4 or maybe even something like acetic acid. But given that F and G are two different acids, perhaps they are sulfuric and another, or maybe phosphoric and another. Wait, but let's think about the reaction—it's a decomposition reaction. So maybe C is a salt that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids.

If C is a salt of a diacid, like (HA)(HB), but then when it reacts with water, it produces F and G as the two acids. Wait, F is strong and G is weak. So maybe C is something like NaHSO4. Hmm, but when NaHSO4 reacts with water, it would just give H2SO4 and NaOH? Wait, but that might not produce two different acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfite or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate. Let me think. Let me try to think about reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. So A is a solid, B is gas. Maybe B is a halogen, like Cl2. Because 8 equivalents—could be a diatomic gas, so 8 moles would be 4 diatomic molecules. Wait, but 8 equivalents of Cl2 would be 8 moles, which would be 4 moles of Cl2 (since each molecule is diatomic). That might fit. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 or something else.

Wait, reaction 4: D + B → H, which is a solvent. So D and B in 1:1 ratio form H. Solvents are like water, ethanol, etc. So if B is, say, Cl2, D could be something that reacts with Cl2 to form a solvent. Wait, what reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio to form a common solvent. Maybe D is H2O? Because H2O + Cl2 (under certain conditions) can form HClO and HCl, but that's a bit more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps D is something else. Wait, maybe D is H2S since H2S + Cl2 can react,
