Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ℏ/2. Oh wait, and I'm given the components of the operator P in terms of their matrices. Hmm.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, so it must have components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ℏ/2. Let me write down each component:

P_x is (ℏ/2) times the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ℏ/2.
P_y is (ℏ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix scaled.
P_z is (ℏ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], the Pauli Z matrix scaled.

Wait, right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So each of these components is (ℏ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix.

The operator we need is P acting along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz). Since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. And since it's arbitrary, nx and nz can vary as long as they satisfy nx² + nz² = 1. But wait, the direction could be any direction in the x-z plane, so perhaps the eigenvector depends on some angle θ and φ? Or maybe θ is the angle from the z-axis, and φ is the angle in the x-z plane... Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, the operator P along direction n is P · n̂, right? Because for a vector operator, the component along a direction is the dot product of the operator and the unit vector in that direction. So for a unit vector n̂ = (nx, 0, nz), the operator P_n is nx P_x + nz P_z.

So P_n = (nx P_x) + (nz P_z). Because n is in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

But wait, the eigenvalue we're looking for is +ℏ/2. So we need to find the eigenvector of P_n corresponding to eigenvalue +ℏ/2.

But wait, P_n is given by nx P_x + nz P_z. Since P_x and P_z are 2x2 matrices, when we multiply by nx and nz respectively, they become scaled matrices. Then, sum them to get P_n, and find its eigenvectors.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstates of S·n̂ are the spin-up and spin-down states along n̂. So the spin-up state has eigenvalue +ℏ/2, and the spin-down has -ℏ/2.

So perhaps the normalized eigenvector for eigenvalue +ℏ/2 is the spin-up state along the direction n. How do we represent that?

In the standard basis, spin-up along z is (1, 0), and spin-up along x is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but for an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, which is a combination of x and z, the spin-up state would be a superposition of the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction.

Wait, perhaps we can represent the state as a vector (a, b), and it must satisfy the eigenvalue equation P_n |ψ> = (ℏ/2) |ψ>.

So let's write P_n as:

P_n = nx (ℏ/2) [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + nz (ℏ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So that's:

= (ℏ/2) [ nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

= (ℏ/2) [ [ nz, nx ], [nx, -nz ] ]

Because multiplying nx by the X matrix gives [[0, nx], [nx, 0]], and adding nz times the Z matrix [[nz, 0], [0, -nz]].

So P_n is:

(ℏ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

So, the matrix is (ℏ/2) times:

[[nz, nx],
 [nx, -nz]]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ℏ/2) |ψ>.

Let me write |ψ> as (a, b)^T.

So, substituting into the equation:

(ℏ/2) [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] [a; b] = (ℏ/2) [a'; b']

Wait, no— the right-hand side is (ℏ/2) times the vector (a, b). So, the equation becomes:

(ℏ/2) [nz a + nx b, nx a - nz b]^T = (ℏ/2) [a; b]

We can divide both sides by (ℏ/2), so:

[nz a + nx b, nx a - nz b]^T = [a; b]

Which gives two equations:

1. nz a + nx b = a
2. nx a - nz b = b

Rearranging these.

Equation 1: (nz - 1) a + nx b = 0

Equation 2: nx a + (-nz - 1) b = 0

Wait, no. Let's do it step by step.

Equation 1: nz a + nx b = a → (nz - 1) a + nx b = 0

Equation 2: nx a - nz b = b → nx a - (nz + 1) b = 0

So, the system of equations is:

(nz - 1) a + nx b = 0  → Equation (A)
nx a - (nz + 1) b = 0 → Equation (B)

We can write this as a homogeneous system. The determinant of the coefficients should be zero for non-trivial solutions.

The coefficient matrix is:

[ (nz - 1), nx ]
[ nx, -(nz +1) ]

The determinant is (nz -1)(-(nz +1)) - (nx)^2 = ?

Let me compute:

= -(nz^2 + nz - nz -1) - (nx)^2
= -(nz^2 -1) - nx^2
= -nz^2 +1 - nx^2

But since n is a unit vector in x-z plane, nx^2 + nz^2 = 1. So, substituting:

= -nz^2 +1 - (1 - nz^2) → because nx^2 = 1 - nz^2.

Wait, no. Because nx^2 + nz^2 =1 → 1 - (nz^2) = nx^2.

So, the determinant becomes:

-(nz^2) +1 - (1 - nz^2) → which is -(nz^2) +1 -1 + nz^2 → 0.

So, the determinant is zero, which is consistent for eigenvectors.

So, from equation (A) and (B), they are dependent. So, we can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's pick a ratio of a to b from equation (A):

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0 → (nz -1) a = -nx b → a = (-nx/(nz -1)) b

Hmm, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of direction. Let's think about the direction of n. Since n is in the x-z plane, let's parameterize it with an angle θ from the z-axis. So, n is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) in spherical coordinates. But wait, in the x-z plane, φ=0. Because in the x-z plane, the angle φ is zero, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps?

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The standard spherical coordinates have θ measured from the positive z-axis. So, if the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle φ is 0 or π, but for an arbitrary direction, but wait, the direction is in the x-z plane, so it can be any angle around the y-axis. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the angle θ in the x-z plane. Let me think: the direction n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ), but since in x-z, φ is 0? Or perhaps it's better to represent n as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should choose n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, when θ=0, n is along +z; θ=90 degrees, n is along +x.

So, then, nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ.

But wait, earlier I thought n is in the x-z plane, so perhaps n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) with θ ranging from 0 to π/2.

Wait, but the direction can be any direction in the x-z plane, including angles beyond 90 degrees, but perhaps θ is measured from the z-axis. So, n could be (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So, then, nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ.

So, substituting into the expressions for a and b.

From equation (A):

(nz - 1) a + nx b = 0 → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

Which gives:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ) ] b

Hmm, but denominator is (cosθ -1), which is negative when cosθ <1, which is for θ>0.

Wait, maybe I can write this as:

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Because (cosθ-1) = -(1 - cosθ), so [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ]

So, a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b.

Hmm, perhaps I can simplify this expression. The denominator (1 - cosθ) can be written as 2 sin²(theta/2), since 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2). And sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So:

a = [ (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) ] / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) b

The 2's cancel, and one sin(theta/2) cancels, leaving:

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b → cot(theta/2) b.

So, a = cot(theta/2) b.

Hmm, perhaps I can express the state vector |ψ> as (a, b) = (cot(theta/2) b, b ), or factor out b.

But let me express it as (a, 1), since I can set b=1 for simplicity, and then normalize later.

Wait, perhaps setting b=1, so a = cot(theta/2). Then the vector is (cot(theta/2), 1).

But I should check if this works in equation (B):

Equation (B) is nx a - (nz +1) b = 0.

Substituting nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ, and a = cot(theta/2), b=1:

sinθ * cot(theta/2) - (cosθ +1) * 1 = 0?

Hmm, let's compute.

First, cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2).

So, sinθ * [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] = ?

Wait, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So, sinθ * cot(theta/2) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] = 2 cos²(theta/2).

And (cosθ +1) = 2 cos²(theta/2), because 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2).

So, equation (B) becomes 2 cos²(theta/2) - 2 cos²(theta/2) = 0, which holds true. So the condition is satisfied.

Thus, the state vector is (a, 1) = (cot(theta/2), 1), but we need to normalize it.

Wait, so |ψ> = (cot(theta/2), 1 )^T. Let's compute the normalization factor.

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cot²(theta/2) + 1.

Hmm, cot²(theta/2) + 1 = csc²(theta/2) = 1/sin²(theta/2).

So, the normalization factor is sqrt(1/sin²(theta/2)) ) = 1/|sin(theta/2)|. Since theta is between 0 and pi, sin(theta/2) is positive, so it's 1/sin(theta/2).

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is ( cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ), because we multiply each component by the normalization factor.

Wait, no. To normalize, we have |ψ> = (a, b) / N, where N is the normalization factor sqrt(a² + b²).

Wait, in our case, |a|² + |b|² = cot²(theta/2) + 1 = csc²(theta/2) = 1/sin²(theta/2).

So, N = 1/sin(theta/2).

So, normalized |ψ> is (cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2)).

Simplify each component:

cot(theta/2) is [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)].

So, first component: [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

Second component: 1 * sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), and that's one of the choices.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Hmm, but wait, I have to consider the possibility of a phase factor. Because in quantum mechanics, global phase doesn't matter, but the eigenvector can have any phase. The options might have a phase factor of e^{i phi}, but in my calculation, I ended up with real components. But wait, in the given components of P_y, there are imaginary terms. So perhaps the eigenvector might have a complex component.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me think again. The operator P includes P_y, which in matrix form has imaginary numbers. So when finding eigenvectors, the components could be complex.

Wait a minute, in the eigenvector I found, all components are real. But wait, perhaps I should re-examine the calculation.

Wait, the initial problem states that the direction n is in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector's components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which are real. So that's option C.

But let me check the options again.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cosθ, e^{i phi} sinθ), which could represent a general direction in spherical coordinates but perhaps without the 1/2 angles.

Wait, but perhaps the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)), but in this problem, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so the second component is real, leading to option C.

But let me think again. Wait, perhaps the direction n is given in terms of an angle theta from the z-axis, and phi around the z-axis, but since n lies in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so the state should be real.

So, the eigenvectors would be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking back at the options, option C is exactly that. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check with another approach. Another way to find the eigenvectors is to note that the operator P_n is a spin-1/2 operator along an arbitrary direction. The eigenvalues are ±ℏ/2, and the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction. The spin-up state can be written as (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2))^T, where theta is the polar angle and phi the azimuthal angle. But since our direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so the state becomes (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))^T, which is option C.

Alternatively, sometimes the spin-up state is written as (e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2), e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2))^T, but if phi is zero, then it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))^T.

So, the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as $\hbar/2$ times a 2x2 matrix. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n}$
The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting the given components of $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
and using $n_x = \sin\theta$, $n_z = \cos\theta$, we get:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left(\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n}\right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
Substituting $\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n}$:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
Dividing through by $\hbar/2$ and rearranging:
\[
\begin{cases}
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0 \\
\sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0
\end{cases}
\]
From the first equation:
\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]
Using the trigonometric identities $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:
\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
The normalization factor is:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1} = \sqrt{\csc^2(\theta/2)} = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta/2)}
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ represents a general spherical coordinate system but does not match the derived eigenvector for the x-z plane.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ does not match the derived eigenvector.

### Final Answer
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

Answer: C
