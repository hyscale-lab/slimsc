Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I remember that qPCR is used to quantify the amount of DNA or RNA by amplifying it. The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. 

The efficiency was 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect—each cycle doubles the DNA. The R2 is 1, so the data fits perfectly, and the slope is -3.3. Wait, what's the typical slope value? Oh right, the slope is usually around -3.3 for a 100% efficient reaction. Because the formula is slope = -3.3219 / efficiency, I think. So with 100% efficiency (or 1), the slope should be -3.3219, so -3.3 is close enough.

Looking at the data:

At 100000 copies, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average would be around 34.2. 

10000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Average about 30.9.

1000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9 → 27.6.

100: 24, 24.3, 24.6 → 24.3.

10: 20.7, 21, 21.3 → 21.0.

Wait, so each ten-fold dilution is giving a Ct change of about 3.3 cycles. Because 34.2 (100,000) to 30.9 (10,000) is a difference of about 3.3. Then 30.9 to 27.6 is another 3.3. Same for 27.6 to 24.3, and 24.3 to 21.0. Each ten-fold dilution drops the Ct by 3.3. So that matches the slope.

But wait, the question is about the discrepancies in the results. Looking at the options, the question is asking why there are discrepancies. Wait, but in the data, each replicate's Ct values are within 0.3 of each other. Like 33.9, 34.2, 34.5—that's a max difference of 0.6. So the standard deviation within each dilution is low. So the technical replicates are consistent.

So why is this a problem? The question says, which option explains the discrepancies. Wait, but the efficiency is 100%, R2 is 1, so the curve is perfect. So maybe the issue is that the Ct values don't correlate with the amount properly.

Wait, let's look at the options.

Option A: qPCR cannot be used for quantification. That's not true because he's using it correctly with a standard curve.

Option B:
