Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions. The options are A to D.

Wait, what's a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? Oh right, I think EDTA is a chelating agent. So the complex is formed when Ca^2+ binds with EDTA^4- ions. The formula for the complex would be something like CaY^2-, where Y is the EDTA part.

The formation constant, or Kf, is given. I remember that Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction is something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The problem says it's a 0.02 M solution of this complex. So the concentration of CaY^2- is 0.02 M. But I need to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions in solution.

Wait, but the complex is dissociating into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-? So the dissociation reaction would be CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-.

The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. But wait, for the dissociation, the equilibrium constant K_d (dissociation) would be 1/Kf. Because Kf is formation, so the reverse reaction (dissociation) has K = 1/(Kf). So K_d = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11 approximately.

Wait, let me think again. The formation reaction is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2- with Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

If the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, and assuming that the dissoci
