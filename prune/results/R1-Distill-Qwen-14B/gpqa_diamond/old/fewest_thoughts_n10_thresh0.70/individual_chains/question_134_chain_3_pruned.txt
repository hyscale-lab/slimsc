Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and bases are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change for this neutralization reaction. The options are given in kcal and kJ, so I should keep track of the units throughout.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but since these are not all monoprotic, I need to adjust for that.

Let me break it down into the reactions of each acid and base.

Wait, but wait. When you mix an acid and a base, they undergo a neutralization reaction. The general form is acid + base â†’ salt + water. But here, we have two acids and one base. Wait, no, wait: wait, HCl is an acid, H2SO4 is an acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So when they're mixed, the acids will react with the base.

But wait, since there are three solutions, perhaps I should consider each acid reacting with the base? Or maybe first find out
