Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific value. Alright, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by operators, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of those operators. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is related to the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue.

The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, wait—no, hold on. Wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, which are column vectors, and they must be normalized. So I need to check if this state is normalized or not. Oh, right, the state vector must have a norm of 1. So I should compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components.

So the state vector is ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let's compute the norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, that's 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So this vector isn't normalized. Hmm, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the state must be a unit vector. So maybe I should normalize it first, because the probabilities depend on the inner product, which requires the state to be normalized.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of measuring a certain observable (P) to yield 0. So regardless of the state being normalized, when we calculate the probabilities, the sum should add up to 1, I think. Hmm, but perhaps I should normalize the state.

Wait, the initial state is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. So for the probability calculation, I need to compute the expectation value, or perhaps find the components of the state in the eigenbasis of P. 

The observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:

P = 
[ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
  [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
  [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]

Hmm, so P is a 3x3 matrix. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P because the possible outcomes of
