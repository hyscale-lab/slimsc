Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me see what it's asking.

The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of the sigma vector and the n vector. And sigma is the Pauli spin matrices, which I remember are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Oh, right, so H = ε σ · n, where n is a unit vector. So σ · n would be like σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z, right?

Wait, the question is asking for the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian. I remember that for Pauli matrices, when you have something like σ · n, it's a matrix that has eigenvalues +1 and -1 because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have trace zero, so the determinant is -1, and the product of eigenvalues is -1. But wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. So if we have σ · n, which is a linear combination, does that change the eigenvalues?

Oh, wait, no. Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, each σ_i has eigenvalues ±1. When you take a linear combination like a·σ + b·σ etc., the eigenvalues become the combination of the coefficients. Let me think. Suppose you have a vector (a, b, c) dotted with the Pauli vector. So H = aσ_x + bσ_y + cσ_z. The eigenvalues would be sqrt(a² + b² + c²) times ±1. Because the square of H would be (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)I, since σ_i squared are identity matrices. So, H squared is (a² + b² + c²) I, so the eigenvalues of H must be the square root of that times plus or minus 1. But wait, the square of H is (σ · n)^2 times ε², right?

Wait, in this problem, H is ε times (σ · n). Since n is a unit vector, σ · n is a unit vector in the direction of n. So σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because when you have σ · n, it's a spin operator in the direction of n, and its eigenvalues are the spin components. So the eigenvalues are ±1 multiplied by ε.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Let's
