Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a series of chemical reactions, and based on that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are various symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

First, I'll try to outline the reactions and the substances involved. Let me break down each part.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, the reaction is A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(s). Since it's a solid product, C is probably a compound formed by A and B.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C(s) + 2 D(g) → E(s or gas? It's not specified, but since E is hazardous, maybe a gas or a solid. But the exact state might not matter for the symmetry group.)

Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C(s) + H2O → A(s) + F + G. Since F is strong and G is weak, maybe F is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) and G is HNO2 (nitrous acid) or something similar. Alternatively, F could be HCl, but that's a strong acid, and G could be something else.

Reaction 4: Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D + B → H, which is a solvent. H is likely a common solvent, so possible options are something like H2O, but wait, D and B are gases reacting. Or maybe H is something like HCl or another gas, but no, H is a solvent, so more likely a liquid. Oh, wait, if B is a gas like Cl2, and D is something else, but let me think.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 because in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 equivalents of B. A solid reacting with a lot of Cl2 to form C. Bright red product C could be something like CuCl2, but wait, that's not red. Oh, wait, maybe it's a transition metal compound. Maybe C is something like FeCl3, but that's not red either. Alternatively, perhaps it's a compound of a transition metal that forms a bright red solid when in a certain oxidation state.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the reactions. The first reaction is A + 8B → C. That suggests a high number of equivalents, so perhaps B is Cl2, and A is a metal. For example, suppose A is copper. Copper reacts with Cl2 in certain conditions. But wait, 8 equivalents is a lot. Alternatively, maybe A is sodium, but sodium metal reacting with Cl2 would form NaCl, but that's a 1:1 ratio, not 8:1.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a complex ion. Let me think about what gives a bright red product. Aluminum chloride is white, copper chloride is blue. Maybe it's iron(III) chloride, but that
