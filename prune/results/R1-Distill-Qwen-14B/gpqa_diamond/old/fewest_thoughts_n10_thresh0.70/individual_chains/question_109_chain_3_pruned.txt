Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (like protons or neutrons) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The initial state is 1S0, and the final NN state has T=0. We need to determine which partial wave is not permitted, given the options.

Hmm, okay, let me break this down. First, the initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 would imply that the spin S is 0 (since 2*0 +1 =1), orbital angular momentum L is 0 (since it's S, which is spherically symmetric), and J is 0 as well. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X. So the final state is the NN system plus the emitted particle X. But the problem says the final NN state (so without considering the emitted particle) has T=0. Wait, but the emitted particle X must carry away some quantum numbers. So the problem is about the possible transitions that are allowed based on conservation laws, specifically angular momentum and parity.

The key points are:

1. Conservation of angular momentum: The total angular momentum before and after should be the same. But wait, the particle X is emitted, so the initial state's angular momentum is carried by the final state's angular momentum plus the angular momentum of X. Wait, but the problem is whether the partial wave is permitted. Partial wave refers to the orbital angular momentum L of the emitted particle X in the decay process. So the orbital angular momentum part of X is l, and the emitted particle's state would have angular momentum l.

Wait, maybe I should model it as the initial state having certain quantum numbers, and the final state (the NN system) plus the emitted particle X, which has its own quantum numbers. Since they are emitted, the total angular momentum and parity must be conserved.

But considering that, the initial NN state is in 1S0. So its quantum numbers are S=0, L=0, J=0. When they emit a particle X, the process would be something like NN â†’ NN' + X, but perhaps in this case, the NN system is the same except for the emitted particle, so the NN state's quantum numbers change.

Wait, maybe it's more straightforward: the initial state is 1S0, so S=0, L=0, J=0. The final state of the NN system is T=0. So what about the other quantum numbers?

Wait, the problem states that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is the spin (which is the total spin of the NN system
