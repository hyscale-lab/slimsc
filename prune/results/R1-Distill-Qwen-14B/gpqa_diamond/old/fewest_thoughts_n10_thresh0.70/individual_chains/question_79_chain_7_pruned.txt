Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that compound X, which is C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they provided the 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the product. The task is to identify what compound X was from the given options.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to figure out what reaction is happening here. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. I remember that this is a strong, bulky base. Common reactions with such bases include elimination reactions. Oh wait, another possibility is that it's a catalyst for some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's used in a ring-opening reaction? Or perhaps it's part of a solvolysis process?

Wait, another thought. Oh, right! 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is often used in the formation of enamines or in the treatment of epoxides. Wait, no, I think more likely it's used in the elimination to form alkenes or in the epoxide ring-opening. Alternatively, I've heard about the use of such bases in the formation of oxaziridines or other heterocycles, but not sure.

Wait, the product's NMR data is given. So perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide, but since the solvent is nonpolar and the conditions are high temperature, maybe it's an elimination reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed rearrangement?

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O. Let's think about the molecular formula. The molecular formula of the product isn't given, but the starting material after reaction would have the same molecular formula if it's a rearrangement or an elimination (like opening an epoxide and reforming it).

Wait, another angle: looking at the options, all of them are oxirane derivatives. Oxirane is another name for epoxide. So the products are all epoxides. And the reaction is with a base. Hmm. So perhaps the reaction is an epoxide ring-opening, but under basic conditions.

Wait, but wait—if the starting material is an epoxide (since all options are epoxides), what reaction would occur when treated with a strong base like 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Perhaps it's a ring-opening, but under basic conditions, epoxides can undergo nucleophilic attack. But wait, the solvent is nonpolar, so maybe it's more of an elimination. Or perhaps the base is used for deprotonation, leading to some rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening followed by a ring-closing, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the base is abstracting a proton adjacent to the epoxide, leading to a conjugate base, which could then rearrange or eliminate. Or maybe the reaction is a solvolysis, but the solvent is nonpolar, so probably SN2 is less likely. Maybe it's a thermal elimination.

Wait, but the product after reaction has an NMR spectrum. Let's look at the NMR data provided for the product to figure out its structure.

Looking at the 1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): So a singlet integrating for 3H, likely a methyl group attached to something that doesn't have neighboring hydrogens. Maybe a methyl ketone or attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen. Wait, but in the options, the substituents on the epoxide are various: options A has a 4-methylstyryl group, options B a 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl group, and so on.

Wait, looking at the product's 1H NMR:
- 3H singlet at 2.28 and 2.31. Two singlets. So two different methyl groups. So perhaps two CH3 groups attached to different environments. So maybe one is attached to an oxygen (like an ether) and another is attached to something else, but both are not split because they are in symmetrical environments or not near any other Hs.

Looking at the 13C NMR:
- 21.3 and 28.4: these are both quaternary carbons (s for singlet, so no adjacent Hs). So probably two methyl groups attached to something like an oxygen or a carbon that doesn't have Hs attached. Maybe one is CH3-O and another is CH3 attached to a double bond or something else.

Now, looking at the aromatic protons:

In 1H NMR:
- 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

That's four aromatic protons in a pattern that's a bit symmetric. Let's see: the integration is 1, 2, 1, 2. Hmm, that's a total of 6 H, which suggests perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents that cause this splitting.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows four peaks. Let me think: for example, a para-substituted benzene might have two doublets each integrating for 2H. But here, the integration is 1
