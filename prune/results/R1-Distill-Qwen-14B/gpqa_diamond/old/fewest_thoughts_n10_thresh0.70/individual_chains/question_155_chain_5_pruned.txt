Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I'll need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, the problem says the state is given by the column vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the state is |ψ> = [-1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2]. 

But let me make sure. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the basis is aligned with P_z's eigenstates. That's important because when I calculate the expectation values, the matrix elements are in this basis.

So, first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩. That's the expectation value of P_z in the state |ψ>. To find this, I can calculate ψ† P_z ψ. Similarly, ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ† P_z² ψ. Then I can plug these into the uncertainty formula.

Let's write down the matrix for P_z. The given matrix is:

P_z = [[ħ, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, -ħ]]

So, diagonal matrix with ħ, 0, -ħ on the diagonal.

Now, the state vector ψ is [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]^T.

Wait, let me double-check the state components. The first entry is -1/2, second is 1/sqrt(2), third is -1/2. So ψ = [a, b, c]^T where a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = -1/2.

So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ψ† P_z ψ.

Since P_z is diagonal, the product P_z ψ is just scaling each component by the diagonal elements.

So P_z ψ = [ ħ*(-1/2), 0*(1/sqrt(2)), (-ħ)*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Then, ψ† P_z ψ is the dot product of ψ and P_z ψ. So ψ has components a, b, c. So:

⟨P_z⟩ = a*(-ħ a/2) + b*(0) + c*(ħ c/2) 

Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Because ψ is a column vector, ψ† is a row vector [a*, b*, c*]. Then, P_z ψ is the matrix product, which is [ a* ħ a, b* 0 b
