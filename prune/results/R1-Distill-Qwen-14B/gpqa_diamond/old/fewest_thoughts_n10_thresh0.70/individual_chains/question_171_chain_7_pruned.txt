Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about electrophilic substitution reactions. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves six different aromatic compounds undergoing an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine. Each forms only one monobromo derivative. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, so the order is from the lowest para yield to the highest.

The compounds given are numbered 1 to 6. Let me write them down:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl phenyl ester, maybe phenyl acetate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethy benzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, wait. Electrophilic substitution on each of these. So each has a substituent on the benzene ring. The substituent directs the incoming electrophile (bromine here) to certain positions, either ortho, meta, or para, depending on the substituent's nature.

I remember that substituents can be activating or deactivating. Activating groups make the ring more reactive, deactivating do the opposite. Also, activating groups are typically electron-donating, while deactivating are electron-withdrawing.

So, for each substituent, I should determine whether it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.

Let me list each substituent and their directing effects:

1) CH3 (toluene): -Methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. Because it donates electrons via the inductive effect, making the ring more reactive towards electrophiles.

2) COOEt (ethyl ester): The ester group is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing substituent. Wait, wait, esters are meta directors? Or para? Wait, no. Wait, esters are electron-withdrawing via the inductive effect but can be ortho/para directors because of resonance? Or wait, no. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh, right, the ester group is an electron-withdrawing group via the inductive effect, but it's an ortho/para director. Because, for example, in the case of acetophenone, which has a ketone group, the substituent is deactivating (since the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing) but still ortho/para directing. Wait, no, acetophenone is meta directing. Wait, no, acetophenone is a nitro group? No, acetophenone is a ketone substituent. Let me correct that. The ketone group is deactivating (since it's electron-withdrawing) and meta-directing. Wait, wait, no, I think I messed that up.

Wait, wait. Let me think about substituents:

- Strong activating groups (like -O- (as in methoxy
