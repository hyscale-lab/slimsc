Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions typically involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base, and it's often around -57 kJ per mole of H+ or OH- ions involved.

Wait, but let's think about the problem here. We've got three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Mixing them together... Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, maybe I should first figure out what reactions are happening here. 

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is also a strong acid. But wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic, so in solution, it donates two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2, on the other hand, is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 unit gives two OH- ions.

So when you mix these together, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. But wait, I should check if there are enough H+ and OH- ions to react completely.

Let me calculate the moles of H+ and OH- from each solution.

Starting with HCl: Volume is 500 mL (0.5 L) and concentration is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one H+. So HCl contributes 0.1 mol H+.

Next, H2SO4: Volume is 300 mL (0.3 L), concentration 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole gives two H+. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Now, Ba(OH)2: Volume is 200 mL (0.2 L), concentration 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, but wait. When you mix all three, the total H+ and OH- will combine. So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the reaction between H+ and OH- will be neutralized. Let's see which is in excess. OH- is 0.2 mol, H+ is 0.28. So H+ is in excess by 0.08 mol. So all OH- will react, and 0.08 mol H+ will remain.

But wait, the neutralization reaction here is H+ + OH- → H2O. Each such reaction releases a certain amount of heat. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting. But wait, I'm not sure if the value is per mole of H+ or per mole of the acid. I think it's per mole of H+ ion.

So the moles of H+ reacting with OH- are 0.2 mol. So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. But wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Oh, I remember that 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So maybe I should convert the result into kcal or keep it in kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, let's see. Wait, 0.2 *57 is 11.4 kJ, but since it's negative, it's -11.4 kJ. Let me check if the calculation is correct.

Wait, another thought: when mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2, maybe the H2SO4 is reacting with Ba(OH)2. Because sometimes, when you mix multiple acids and bases, the stronger reactions might take priority. But in neutralization, all H+ should react with OH- regardless of the source. So perhaps my initial approach is correct.

But wait, let's double-check the stoichiometry. HCl provides 0.1 mol H+. H2SO4 provides 0.18 mol H+. Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 mol OH-. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

So the moles reacting are the minimum of H+ and OH-. Here, OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and 0.08 moles of H+ will remain. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. But wait, the options don't have that in kJ. Let me look again: option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the total number of moles of H+ and OH- involved. Another possibility is that the reaction might form more than just water. For example, when H2SO4 (which is diprotic) reacts with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, the reaction would produce BaSO4 precipitate and water. So perhaps I should break down the reactions.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which typically refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is given per mole of H+ or OH-.

But maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is limiting.

H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 mol * 2 = 0.36 mol? Wait no, wait. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong earlier. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 H+. So 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Wait, earlier I think I did that correctly. So 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles, each gives 2 OH-. So 0.2 moles OH-.

So OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the reaction is 0.2 moles of H+ + 0.2 moles OH- → 0.2 moles H2O.

Each mole releases 57 kJ (approx) as heat, so 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal → about -11.5 kJ (since 2.72 *4.184 ≈11.4), because 2.72 *4=10.88, 0.72 *4=2.88 → total ~13.76? Wait wait, wait, no. Let me compute 2.72 kcal to kJ.

1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 2.72 kcal = 2.72 *4.184 ≈ 11.42 kJ. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.42 kJ.

But wait, the question is, what is the correct unit? The options have both kcal and kJ. So perhaps the answer is in kcal.

Wait, but the calculation gives us -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ.

But another option is B: -11.42 kcal, which would be way larger in kJ. So which is correct?

Ah, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the neutralization is considered per mole of acid or base. But the standard enthalpy is per mole of H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, which is a specific neutralization, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should write all the reactions.

First, HCl and H2SO4 are acids, Ba(OH)2 is a base. So when mixed, the H+ from all acids will react with OH- from the base.

So the total H+ is 0.28 mol, and OH- is 0.2 mol. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases 57 kJ per mole.

So the reaction is 0.2 moles H+ + 0.2 moles OH- → 0.2 H2O, releasing 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching, but perhaps I should check if the assumption about the enthalpy per mole is correct.

Wait, some sources give the enthalpy of neutralization as -57 kJ per mole of H+ (for strong acids and strong bases). So if I have 0.2 moles reacting, that's 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ, so -11.4 kJ. So in the options, the only one close is option B: -11.42 kcal, but wait, no, that's way larger. Because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. Because 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72.

So the correct answer in kJ is -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, there's no option with that. Let's see the options again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal → this is about -11.4 kJ.

B) -11.42 kcal → that's about -47.8 kJ.

C) -3.80 kcal → about -15.8 kJ.

D) -16.0 kJ.

So, the calculation gives -11.4 kJ, which is the same as option A (-2.72 kcal). So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but why would the answer be in kcal? I'm a bit confused because the question is in mL and M, but the options mix units.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to calculate using the formula q = nΔH, using the moles of H+ or OH-.

Wait, but I'm confident that the correct value is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal. So option A is the correct answer. Alternatively, if the options have a typo, but in the given options, option A is -2.72 kcal which is approx -11.4 kJ.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions involved:

1. **H⁺ ions from HCl**:  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **H⁺ ions from H₂SO₄**:  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   As H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, it contributes \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

3. **OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, so it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

4. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻**:  
   The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \).  
   Total \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and total \( \text{OH}^- = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since \( \text{OH}^- \) is the limiting reagent, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) will react with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \), releasing heat.

5. **Enthalpy change**:  
   The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) or \( \text{OH}^- \).  
   For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \), the enthalpy change is:  
   \[
   q = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
   \]

6. **Conversion to kcal**:  
   Since \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \),  
   \[
   -11.4 \, \text{kJ} = \frac{-11.4}{4.184} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

7. **Matching with options**:  
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value.  
   - Option B (\( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \)) is incorrect as it corresponds to \( -47.8 \, \text{kJ} \), which is much larger than the calculated value.  
   - Option C (\( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \)) is incorrect as it corresponds to \( -15.8 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   - Option D (\( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \)) is incorrect as it does not match the calculated value of \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A**. 

Answer: A
