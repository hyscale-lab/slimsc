Okay, so I have this physics problem about the annihilation of high-energy gamma rays with the CMB photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. The question is about the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process, meaning that the gamma-rays can't exist beyond a certain time because they annihilate into electrons and positrons.

The reaction given is gamma-gamma → e+ e-. So, a high-energy gamma (let's call it gamma1) interacts with a CMB photon (gamma2) to produce an electron-positron pair. The average energy of the CMB photons is given as 10^-3 eV. 

I think I need to find the energy of the gamma-ray where the mean free path becomes too short, meaning the gamma cannot travel far without annihilating. So, the lifetime would be limited by the time it takes for such interactions to occur.

Wait, the mean free time tau is the average time between interactions. The lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited if tau is much smaller than the age of the universe or the time we're considering. So, the process would cause the gamma-rays to annihilate quickly, limiting their lifetime beyond which they can't exist.

I remember that the cross-section for this process (gamma + photon → e+ e-) increases with the energy of the gamma-photon. The cross-section probably depends on the energy in a certain way, maybe like sigma ~ E^2 or something, but I'm not sure. Wait, I think the cross-section for gamma-gamma annihilation into electron-positron pairs has a certain dependence on the energy. Let me recall: the cross-section might go as sigma proportional to (E_cm)^2 / E^2, where E_cm is the center-of-mass energy. Or perhaps it's sigma ~ (E^2)/(m_e^2), where m_e is the electron mass.

Wait, the cross-section for pair production when a gamma interacts with another photon. I think the threshold condition for pair production is that the product of the two photon energies must be at least equal to (2 m_e c^2)^2, because you need enough energy to create the rest mass of the electron and positron. So, if E1 and E2 are the energies of the two photons, then E1 * E2 ≈ (2 m_e c^2)^2 /4, because for threshold, both photons are at rest in the center of mass frame. Wait, no, the exact condition is that the sum of their energies in the center of mass frame should be at least 2 m_e c^2 each, but I think it's more accurate to consider the invariant s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2.

Assuming that the CMB photon has energy E2 = 1e-3 eV, and the gamma-ray photon has energy E1 = E. So, the invariant s is s = (E + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since the photons are traveling in opposite directions (since they're annihilating into a pair), their momenta are in opposite directions. So
