Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, the question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubit space. The matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states.

Wait, so first, what's the general form of a density matrix for a qubit? I think a qubit's density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The state |0><0| would be a diagonal matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 1 at (2,2) and 0 elsewhere.

So if I add |0><0| and |1><1|, I get a matrix that has 1s on both diagonal elements, and 0s elsewhere. Then, multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So the density matrix ρ is:

ρ = [[1/2, 0],
     [0, 1/2]]

Right, that's a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal. Now, I remember that this is a maximally mixed state. But how does that translate to its geometrical position?

I think the Bloch sphere representation is involved here. The Bloch sphere is a geometric way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix can be represented as a vector r on the Bloch sphere.

The general form of the density matrix for a qubit can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector. So expanding this, each component of r corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, another thought: For a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written as:
ρ = (I + x X + y Y + z Z)/2,
where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices, and x, y, z are the components of the vector r.

So to find r, I need to express the given ρ in terms of the identity and the Pauli matrices.

Looking at the given ρ: it's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute each term.

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, so the given density matrix is I/2. Hmm, that makes sense because I is the identity matrix, so when you multiply by 1/2, you get the maximally mixed state.

So, putting that into the general form:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2 = (I)/2 + (r·σ)/2.

But our ρ is (I)/2. That implies that (
