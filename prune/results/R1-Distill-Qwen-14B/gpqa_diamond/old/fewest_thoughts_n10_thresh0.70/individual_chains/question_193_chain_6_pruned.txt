Okay, so I have this question about astronomy and how the number of stars varies with distance. Hmm, let me think. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) in arcseconds equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is distance.

The problem states that the number of stars (let's call it N) varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, it would be N ~ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 1/(1/r)^5 is the same as (r/1)^5, so that's r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Wait, but does that mean the number per unit distance? Or the total number?

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." Oh, okay, so it's the number per unit distance. So we need to find the rate of change of N with respect to r, or maybe the number in a thin shell between r and r+dr.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this in terms of volume. The number of stars should be related to the volume of a spherical shell, right? The volume of a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume. But wait, in this case, the given relation is N varies as 1/plx^5, which is r^5.

Wait, maybe the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. The statement says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. That would imply N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, 1/(plx)^5 = r^5. So N = k * r^5, where k is a constant. But wait, that can
