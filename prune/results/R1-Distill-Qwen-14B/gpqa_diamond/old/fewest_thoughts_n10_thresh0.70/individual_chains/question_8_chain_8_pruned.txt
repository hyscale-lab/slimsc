Okay, so I have this genetics problem about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let me try to wrap my head around it.

The setup is that we're working with white lupine and looking at three genes: G1, G2, G3. They were found in a high-throughput experiment, and they're candidate genes for anthracnose resistance. We made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3), and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). We tested their resistance and got some percentages. The control is 100% resistance, so lower numbers mean more susceptibility.

The question is about figuring out the genetic interactions based on the resistance levels. Also, we know at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.

Let me list the results again to make it clear:

- g1: 75% → So the mutant has 75% resistance. Not super susceptible, but less than wild type.
- g2: 0% → This plant is completely susceptible. So without G2, they can't resist the pathogen at all.
- g3: 50% → Half the resistance. So when G3 is knocked out, resistance is halved.
- g1g3: 10% → Very low resistance. That's a big drop from each single mutant.
- g2g3: 0% → Same as g2. So when both g2 and g3 are knocked out, it's the same as g2 alone.
- g1g2: 0% → Also, when both g1 and g2 are out, it's 0% resistance.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about what these results mean. Let me think about each mutant.

Starting with g2: 0% resistance. That suggests that G2 is essential for resistance. So whatever G2 does, it's critical. Maybe it's a transcription factor that activates other genes needed for resistance.

What about the double mutants? The g1g2 double mutant is 0% resistance. Since g2 alone is already 0%, adding another mutation (g1) doesn't change the outcome. That implies that the function of G1 is downstream of G2, or maybe G2 is upstream of G1. Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then without G2, G1 wouldn't be expressed either. So why would g1 have 75% resistance? Because maybe G1 is involved in another pathway or maybe G1 is part of a redundant system.

Wait, let's think in terms of epistasis. Epistasis is when one gene's effect masks another's. If gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the phenotype of gene B's mutant is the same as gene A's mutant. So in this case, if G2 is epistatic over G1, then the double mutant g1g2 would have the same phenotype as the more severe mutant, which is g2 (0%). Which is exactly what we see.

So, G2 is epistatic over G1. That would mean G2 is upstream of G1. Because if G2 is not working, then G1's function is irrelevant—maybe because G2 is necessary for G1's expression or function.

Wait, but let me check the other double mutants. The g1g3 mutant is 10% resistance. That's worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both are knocked out, it's more susceptible than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. When both are out, their combined effect is additive, leading to a more severe phenotype. That's called redundant gene function—each can compensate for the other.

Alternatively, if they were in the same pathway, their double mutant would be the same as the more severe single mutant. For example, if G3 is downstream of G1, then knocking out both would have
