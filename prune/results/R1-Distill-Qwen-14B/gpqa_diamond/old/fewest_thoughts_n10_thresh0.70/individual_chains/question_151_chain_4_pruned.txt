Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the observable is represented by a matrix operator, and the state of the system is given as a column vector. I think the process involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator, and then projecting the state onto those eigenvectors to find probabilities.

Wait, wait. The observable is matrix P. The state is a column vector, let's call it |ψ⟩. The question asks for the probability of getting a certain measurement outcome, which is 0 here. So I think I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of matrix P because the probability is the square of the amplitude of that eigenvector in the state |ψ⟩.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down to get a better look.

P is:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, to find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

So let me set up the matrix (P - λI). Each diagonal element will be (original diagonal element - λ). The matrix becomes:

Row 1: -λ, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, -λ

Calculating the determinant of this matrix. Hmm, determinant for a 3x3 can get a bit messy, but let's proceed.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ something ] 

Wait, I think I should expand along the first row since the third element is zero, which might make it easier.

So expansion:

-λ * determinant of the submatrix:
| -λ   1/√2 |
|1/√2  -λ   |

Minus (1/√2) times the determinant of the submatrix:
|1/√2  1/√2|
|0      -λ  |

Plus 0 times something, which is zero.

So let's compute each part.

First term: -λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] = -λ ( λ² - (1/2) )

Second term: - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] = - (1/√2) [ (-λ / sqrt(2)) ] = - (1/√2) * (-λ / sqrt(2)) = (λ)/2.

So overall, determinant is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2 ) +
