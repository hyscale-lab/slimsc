Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromo group, position 5 has a nitro group. And there's a ketone group (ethan-1-one) attached to the benzene. Wait, no, waitâ€”ethan-1-one would be a ketone, right? So the benzene is connected to a carbonyl group, making it a phenyl ketone. So the structure would be a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and a ketone group (like an acetyl group) attached to the benzene at the 1 position.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- attached to the benzene. So the benzene ring has the ketone group as a substituent. So, the ketone is on the benzene ring as a substituent. So the benzene has a ketone, a Br, and a nitro group in positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone.

Wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let's think. The ketone is at position 1. Then, positions 3 and 5 would be meta to each other, relative to the ketone. So the substituents would be in the meta positions relative to the ketone.

Wait, no, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are at the meta positions relative to each other. Let me think. Benzene is a six-membered ring. So if the ketone is at position 1, then position 3 is two carbons away, and position 5 is four away, but in a ring, they're meta to each other. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone substituent. So the benzene ring has a ketone (O=C-CH3) at position 1, a Br at position 3
