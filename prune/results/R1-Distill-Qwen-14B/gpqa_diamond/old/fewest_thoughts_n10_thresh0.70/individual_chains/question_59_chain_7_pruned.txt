Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should figure out the moles of each acid and base involved because that will help me see if there's excess acid or base after they react.

Alright, let's list out the given information:

- CH3COOH (acetic acid): 500 mL of 0.1 M
- HCl: 400 mL of 0.2 M
- Ba(OH)2: 300 mL of 0.3 M

I think I should calculate the moles of each substance. Moles are calculated by Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters.

So for CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.
For HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.
For Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH⁻. So the OH- concentration is double. So moles of OH- would be 0.09 mol * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, I need to figure out the reaction between the acids and the base. The acids will donate H+ and the base will donate OH-. So the H+ from both acids will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

First, let's calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But wait, in a mixture with a strong base, maybe it's better to first account for the strong acid reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider all the H+ first.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. But when mixed with a strong base, I think the strong base will first neutralize the strong acid, and then any remaining will react with the weak acid.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction. The H+ from both acids (HCl is strong, so all H+ is available; CH3COOH will only donate some H+ depending on the situation) will react with the OH-.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.

First, calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. Wait, HCl is 0.08 moles of H+. CH3COOH is 0.05 moles, but since it's a weak acid, not all will dissociate. Hmm, but in the presence of a strong base, maybe the OH- reacts with the H+ from HCl first, then with the CH3COOH.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the net H+ or OH- after all reactions.

Wait, maybe the approach is: first, the strong acid HCl will donate all its H+ (0.08 moles) and the weak acid CH3COOH will donate its H+ (but wait, it's a weak acid, so perhaps the initial contribution is negligible, but when mixed with a base, it might dissociate more. Hmm, this is getting complicated.)

Wait, but perhaps it's better to consider all the H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of moles of H+ and OH-.

HCl gives 0.08 moles of H+.
CH3COOH gives 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. But since it's a weak acid, it won't give all of its H+ unless it's dissociated. But when you add a base, the OH- will react with H+ from both the strong and weak acids.

Wait, perhaps the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, then any remaining OH- will neutralize CH3COOH.

Let's calculate that.

Total OH- = 0.18 moles.

Total H+ from HCl = 0.08.

So OH- will react with H+ from HCl.

Moles of OH-
