Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about barley and some mutants. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question says that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then look for changes in the gene sequence to eliminate the compound.

They sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I think that would mean disrupting the gene's function, probably through a premature stop codon or a significant alteration in the protein structure.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change. I'll have to compare their sequences to the intact gene.

The intact gene's first part is:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact, let's see where it differs. Let's break it down.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, looking at the first few bases. The original sequence after ATG (start codon) is TTC, then TAC, etc. Let me count each triplet.

Original first few codons:
ATG TTC TCG... Hmm wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write out the original and mutant sequences in triplets.

Original:
ATG TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant1:
ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, no, I think I need to line them up correctly. Let me write the sequences:

Original:
5' ATG TTC TCG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT 3'

Mutant1:
5' ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC 3'

Wait, actually, looking at the first few nucleotides. The original has TTC in positions 4-6, and the next triplet is TCG (positions 7-9). So, the original is ATG TTC TCG...

In Mutant1, the sequence after ATG is TTC TAC. So, positions 4-6 are TTC, same as original. Then positions 7-9: TAC instead
