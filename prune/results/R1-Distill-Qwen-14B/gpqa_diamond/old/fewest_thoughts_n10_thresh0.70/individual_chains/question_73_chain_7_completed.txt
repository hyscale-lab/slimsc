Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with relativity, especially at speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics. I need to use the equations from Einstein's theory of relativity.

The two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, the question is asking about their relative speed and the total energy. Right, so for the relative speed, I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. And for the total energy, I should calculate the relativistic energies of each and sum them up.

Let me start with the relative speed. So, the astronauts are moving in the same direction. The formula for the relative velocity (u') when two objects are moving at u and v relative to a common frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Or is it (v - u)? Wait, no, because if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference. Let me think: if object A is moving at u and object B at v, then from A's frame, B's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). Wait, no, the formula is (v - u) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). Or maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, the actual formula is: if frame S' is moving at speed v relative to S, then in S, an object moving at speed u' in S' would have speed u in S as u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/(c²)). Oh wait, that's the Lorentz transformation for velocity. But here, I need the relative speed between the two astronauts. So, perhaps I should consider the frame of one astronaut and calculate the speed of the other in that frame.

So let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c. The other astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's B's speed? Using the velocity addition formula: u' = (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/(c²)). Wait, no, actually, the formula is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). Because in S, the speed of the object is u, and S' is moving at speed v relative to S. So in S', the speed is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So in this case, astronaut A is in S' which is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame S. Astronaut B is moving at u = 0.5c in S. So from A's frame, B's speed u' is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.5c -0.6c = -0.1c. Wait, that's negative, which would mean that in A's frame, B is moving backwards? No, wait, because both are moving in the positive x direction, but since B's speed is slower than A's, from A's perspective, B is moving backward. So u' is negative, which means relative speed is 0.1c in the opposite direction. But the question is about the relative speed magnitude, or the speed in the same frame. Wait, the question says "relative speed"—so does it matter about direction? Probably just the magnitude, so 0.1c.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B and C have 0.1c and 0.14c as their v_rel. Hmm. Wait, maybe I did something wrong. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, the two are moving in the same direction, so if A is moving faster than B, then in A's frame, B is moving at a speed of (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) which is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c*0.6c)/(c²)) = (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²)) = (-0.1c)/(1 -0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approx -0.142857c. So the magnitude is 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. Oh, so I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, I think I confused the formula. Let me write it correctly. The formula for u' (B's speed in A's frame) is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). So u is the speed of B in lab frame, which is 0.5c. v is the speed of A (which is the frame) in lab frame, 0.6c. So u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

So numerator: 0.5c -0.6c = -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1-0.3=0.7. So u' = (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.142857c. So the relative speed is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the options with 0.14c are C and D.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. So options C and D. Now, I need to compute the total energy of the system. So each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is gamma*m*c^2. So I need to calculate gamma for each, multiply by their masses, then sum.

So for astronaut A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

v =0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 =0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8=1.25.

So energy for A: 1.25 * 2m * c^2 = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. v=0.5c. v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.866 ≈1.1547.

So energy for B: 1.1547 *3m *c^2 ≈3.4641 m c².

So total energy E = 2.5 +3.4641≈5.9641 m c², which is approximately 5.96 mc^2.

Looking at the options, option C has v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D has same v_rel but E=5 mc², which is lower. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations for the energies.

For A: gamma = 1.25, mass 2m. 1.25 * 2 =2.5, so E=2.5 mc².

For B: 0.5c. gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) =1/sqrt(0.75)= approx 1.1547. 3m *1.1547=3*1.1547≈3.464. So E=3.464 mc².

Total E: 2.5 +3.464=5.964 mc². So yes, that's 5.96, so option C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using relativistic equations.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, astronaut A moves at \(u = 0.6c\) and astronaut B moves at \(v = 0.5c\) in the same direction. Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

1. **Numerator**: \(0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c\)
2. **Denominator**: \(1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates that B is moving backward relative to A, but the magnitude of the relative speed is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For astronaut A:
- Mass: \(2m\)
- Speed: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_A = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2\)

#### For astronaut B:
- Mass: \(3m\)
- Speed: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_B = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 = 5.964mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: C**
