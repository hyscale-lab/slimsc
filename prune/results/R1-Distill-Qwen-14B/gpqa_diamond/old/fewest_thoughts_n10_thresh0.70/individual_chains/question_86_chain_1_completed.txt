Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions on two unknown compounds, A and B. Each was treated with different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. I need to find out which starting materials A and B correspond to which options provided.

Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but they're used under different conditions. Wait, BH3 typically needs a catalyst or some condition to be effective. Oh right, BH3Â·THF (tetrahydrofuran) is a common source, and it's used in hydroboration reactions. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent, often used for ketones to form alcohols.

Wait, but wait. Both reactions here are producing a ketone, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Oh wait no, the product is an alcohol? Or no. Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic hemiacetal or something else? No, wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would have the ketone at position 2. So the structure is a cyclic ether with a ketone group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a cyclic ketone. Or maybe it's a reduction of an ester or something else. Wait, maybe the starting materials are esters, and the reducing agents are converting them into alcohols, which then form the cyclic hemiacetal or something.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols, right? Or maybe it's a ketone reduction. Wait, the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So that's not directly formed from a ketone reduction. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters. Let me think. Suppose compound A is an ester, maybe a cyclic ester, and when treated with LiBH4, it's reduced. But LiBH4 usually doesn't reduce esters directly to alcohols. Wait, maybe it's a ketone ester or something else.

Wait, another approach: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structure would have an oxygen in a six-membered ring, with a ketone (O) at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. So the ring is like O at position 1, then positions 2,3,4,5,6. So the 2 position is a ketone, 4 is ethyl.

Wait, but how do you get that from the starting materials? Maybe the starting compounds are diethyl ketones or something else that can cyclize upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters, amides, ketones, etc. BH3 is a milder reducing agent, perhaps used in different contexts.

Wait, but in the product, both reactions are producing a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting materials are epoxides or something else that when reduced form a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ethers that upon reduction form a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are ketals or acetals.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting materials are ketones attached to an ether ring, and the reduction somehow breaks the ring. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reduction opens the epoxide. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are esters of some sort. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options, the starting materials are (S) or (R) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Oh, wait, 5-oxo-pentanoic acid. So the structure would be:

Pentanoic acid: CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents. So 3-ethyl would be on the third carbon, and 5-oxo would mean a ketone at the fifth position? Wait, wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the carbons are 1 (COOH), 2, 3,4,5 (the COOH is on carbon 1, maybe? Or is it carbon 5? Wait, no. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, so the chain is five carbons, with COOH on the first carbon.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, so the carbonyl is at the end, carbon 1. So 5-oxo would imply a ketone on carbon 5. Wait, but that's impossible because carbon 5 is the methyl group. Or wait, maybe the structure is written as 5-oxo in a five-carbon chain. Wait, no, in pentanoic acid, the chain is five carbons: the first is COOH, then four more. So 5-oxo would be the terminal carbon? But that would be a COOH, not a ketone. Hmm, perhaps the structure is different.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the pentanoic acid would have a substituent on the third carbon (ethyl), an isobutoxy group on the fifth, and a ketone (oxo) on the fifth. Wait, but that can't be because the fifth carbon is the COOH group.

Wait, maybe it's 3-ethyl, 5-isobutoxy, and 5-oxo on a pentanoic acid. So the structure would be:

COOH-(CH2)n-CH(O-isobutyl)-CO-CH2CH2CH3?

Wait, maybe I should think of it as:

The molecule is pentanoic acid, so the main chain is five carbons: COOH at one end. The substituents are on the third and fifth carbons.

Wait, the formula would be:

COOH-CH2-C(O-isobutyl)(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2- ?

Wait, perhaps it's:

O

|
O=C-O-CH(CH2CH3)2?

Wait, no, maybe the structure is:

The acid is pentanoic acid, so the chain is:

CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH.

But with substituents on carbons 3 and 5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

On carbon 3, an ethyl group.

On carbon 5, an isobutoxy group and a ketone.

Wait, but carbon 5 would be the COOH in pentanoic acid. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a five-membered chain, with substituents on the 3rd and 5th carbons, and the fifth carbon is the carbonyl group. Ah! Maybe it's a pentanoate ester or something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2-C(O-isobutyl)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, that would make the chain: COOH is at position 5 (if it's pentanoic). So positions are 1 (COOH), 2, 3,4,5 (the fifth is the methyl end? That doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

CH2CH2CH(O-isobutyl)COOH, with an ethyl branch on the third carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the reaction.

The product is (R) or (S) 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. Wait, no, pyran is a six-membered ring, so the product must come from a five-carbon chain plus the oxygen forming the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative that can cyclize upon reduction. For example, if the starting material is an ester (like a lactone), then reducing conditions could open it.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester, which upon reduction gives a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an ester that upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols. So if the starting material is an ester, like an acyloxy group attached to another part, LiBH4 would reduce the ester to a CH2OH group.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone. For example, if A and B are esters, and upon reduction, the ester is converted into a diol, which then forms the pyranone upon elimination.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry of the products.

The product from A is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and from B it's (S). So the configuration depends on the starting material's configuration.

Assuming that the reduction leads to the formation of the alcohol, which then cyclizes, the configuration at the stereogenic center would depend on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center that is retained or inverted during the reaction.

Wait, the reaction is a reduction of a ketone to an alcohol. But LiBH4 would typically reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol without changing the configuration, because it's a ketone and the addition is not stereoselective. Wait, no, ketones are not chiral, so the product from a racemic ketone would be a racemic mixture. But in this case, the product is a single enantiomer.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal? Or a cyclic ketone with a substituent. Let me sketch the structure of the product.

Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one: the ring is six-membered, with oxygen at position 1. The ketone is at position 2. So the structure is O (position 1), then positions 2 (C=O), 3 (CH2), 4 (CH2CH2CH2CH3? Because it's 4-ethyl). So the ring would have substituents.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed from a cyclic hemiacetal. Wait, no, it's a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone, not a hemiacetal.

So perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals, which upon reduction release a carbonyl group, which then rearranges.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals (like in a ketal form) and upon treatment with a reducing agent, they break down to form a carbonyl.

Wait, if the starting material is a cyclic ketal, then treatment with a reducing agent would break the ketal and form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. If the starting material is a ketal, perhaps the LiBH4 would not react. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an acetal ester.

Alternatively, let's think about the starting material being an ester of a diol.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl ester, which under certain conditions can form a cyclic ether.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, but that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are Î±-ketoglutarate derivatives. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are Î²-keto esters. When reduced, they form secondary alcohols, which then undergo cyclization.

Wait, but how would a Î²-keto ester reduce? Let's think. A Î²-keto ester would have the structure RCOCOR'. Reduction with LiBH4 would typically reduce the carbonyl groups. Wait, but in Î²-keto esters, the two carbonyls are adjacent. Reduction would probably reduce the Î²-keto group to a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the stereochemistry.

The product is a single enantiomer, either R or S. So the starting material must have the correct configuration to form that.

Assuming that the configuration of the starting material is retained during the reaction, then the configuration of the product would be determined by the starting material.

But how?

Wait, in the reaction, if the starting material is a ketone, the reduction would not create any new stereocenters because the ketone is planar. So if the starting material is a ketone, the product would be a racemic mixture, which isn't the case here. So the starting material can't be a ketone.

Ah! So perhaps the starting material has a chiral center that is adjacent to an ester or another group that, upon reduction, forms the alcohol with the same configuration.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is an ester with a chiral center, the reduction of the ester to an alcohol would retain the configuration of that center.

Wait, but LiBH4 reduces esters to alcohols, but doesn't typically change the configuration of adjacent chiral centers. Or does it?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an acyloxy group attached to a chiral center. So when the ester is reduced to an alcohol, the configuration of the chiral center remains the same.

So, if A is R configuration, the product would be R, and same for S.

So in the products, the alcohol would be formed with the same configuration as the starting material.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed from an intramolecular cyclization after reduction.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material is a Î²-keto ester. Structure would be:

R-CO-CO-O-R'

When reduced, the Î²-keto ester becomes R-CH(OH)-CH2-O-R', but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic Î²-keto ester, which when reduced opens up to form an alcohol that can cyclize.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a Î²-keto acid, which upon reduction becomes a diol, which then forms the cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So maybe after reduction, the molecule forms a five-membered ring with a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a Î²-keto ester, and upon reduction, it forms an enol ether, which cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate reduction, like a Michael addition. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the reagents. The two reagents are LiBH4 and BH3. But LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Wait, no, BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, not as a reducing agent. Wait, maybe the question refers to BH3 in a different context. Oh, wait, LiAlH4 is a strong reducing agent, LiBH4 is a milder one. BH3 is usually a Lewis acid used in hydroboration, but sometimes it can be used in reductions.

Wait, perhaps in this case, LiBH4 is used to reduce an ester to an alcohol, and BH3 is used in a different context, maybe a conjugate reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps LiBH4 is used to reduce a ketone to an alcohol, but that wouldn't explain the product being a cyclic ketone.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are all (S) or (R) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the starting materials have a ketone group at C5, an isobutoxy group at C5, and an ethyl group at C3. Also, the acid is pentanoic, so the COOH is at C1.

So the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - C(O-isobutyl)(CH2CH2CH3) - CH2 - CH2 - ?

Wait, but that can't be right because the chain is five carbons. Let me count.

1: COOH

2: CH2

3: C with ethyl (CH2CH2CH3) and isobutoxy and a ketone?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(=O-O-CH(CH2CH3)2)(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2- ?

Wait, that would be a six-carbon chain, but the name says pentanoic acid. So maybe it's:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-CH(CH2CH3)2)-CH2- ?

But that's five carbons in total.

So, the structure is:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) (ethyl group)

Position 4: CH2

Position 5: C(O-O-isobutyl) (the oxo group and the isobutoxy)

Wait, so it's a five-carbon chain, with substituents. So the molecule is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-CH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, but the fifth carbon is the last one, and it's a carbonyl group with an isobutoxy attached. Hmm, that's a bit complicated.

Now, when this compound is treated with a reducing agent, perhaps the ester group (O-isobutyl) is reduced.

Wait, but O-isobutyl is an ether group. LiBH4 doesn't typically reduce ethers. Wait, unless it's an epoxide, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl group (the ketone at position 5) is being reduced. So the 5-oxo group is a ketone, which upon reduction would become a secondary alcohol.

So, in reaction A, when compound A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, the ketone is reduced to an alcohol. Similarly for B, treated with BH3 and H+.

Wait, but both reagents are reducing agents, but perhaps they have different selectivities. Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce ketones, while BH3 is typically used for hydroboration, but perhaps in this case, it's used as a reducing agent.

Wait, but if both agents are used to reduce the ketone, the product would be secondary alcohols. But the product in the question is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed through an intramolecular cyclization after reduction.

Let me think: if the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and the 5-oxo group is reduced to a CHOH group, then the structure after reduction would be a secondary alcohol on carbon 5.

So the structure after reduction would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH(OH)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the isobutoxy group is an ester, which upon reduction becomes an alcohol. Wait, but LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols.

Wait, the starting material is 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the 5-oxo is a ketone, and the 5-isobutoxy is an ether. Hmm, perhaps the ether is actually an ester. Wait, no, isobutoxy is O-CH2CH(CH3)2, which is an ether.

Wait, but if the starting material is an ester, like O-CO-O-isobutyl, then LiBH4 would reduce the ester to an alcohol. But in this case, the substituent is an ether, not an ester.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material has a structure where the 5-oxo group is a carbonyl connected to an oxygen. So, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), which upon reduction would break the ring and form an alcohol.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the product structure again.

Product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

The structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen at one position. The ketone is at position 2. So the ring is:

O at position 1.

Position 2: C=O.

Positions 3,4,5,6: CH2 groups, except position 4 has an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed from cyclization of a diol. If the starting material is a diol, upon treatment with acid, it would cyclize to form a cyclic ether.

But how does the diol form from the starting material?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a Î²-keto ester, and upon reduction, it becomes a diol. Then, in acidic conditions, the diol cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which has a ketone. So perhaps after forming the diol, an elimination occurs to form the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the diol undergoes an acid-catalyzed cyclization to form a cyclic ether, and then undergoes oxidation to form the ketone. But that doesn't fit with the reagents used.

Alternatively, maybe the diol is formed, and under the reaction conditions, it undergoes an intramolecular hemiacetal formation.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, not an alcohol.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the stereochemistry.

The product has either R or S configuration at position 4. The starting material options have either R or S configuration at position 3 (since they're 3-ethyl compounds).

Wait, but how would the configuration at position 3 relate to the configuration at position 4 in the product?

Wait, perhaps the configuration is retained during the reaction. So if the starting material is R, the product is R, and same for S.

So, looking at the options:

Option D says A is R and B is S.

So, reaction A: R starting material â R product.

Reaction B: S starting material â S product.

But the products are (R) and (S) respectively for A and B.

Wait, but in the question, reaction A gives (R) product, reaction B gives (S) product.

So if the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration, then A must be R, and B must be S.

Looking at the options, option D is A: R, B: S.

Yes, that makes sense.

Wait, so the answer is D.

Wait, but why? Because when A is R, the product is R; when B is S, the product is S. So the reagents used (LiBH4 and BH3) must be affecting the reaction in a way that preserves the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ketone reduction where the configuration of the starting material is transferred to the product.

Wait, but in ketone reductions, the product is a racemic mixture if the ketone is planar. So perhaps the starting material is a chiral Î²-keto ester, and the reduction leads to a diastereomeric product.

Wait, perhaps the reduction of a Î²-keto ester creates a new chiral center. So the starting material's configuration would influence the product's configuration.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident, but based on the options and the reasoning that the product's configuration depends on the starting material's configuration, the correct option is D: A is R, B is S.


The question involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, and the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with either (R) or (S) configuration.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product is a six-membered cyclic ketone (pyranone) with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. This suggests that the starting material undergoes reduction and cyclization to form the product.

2. **Reagents**: 
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols.
   - **BH3**: Typically used in hydroboration reactions, but in this context, it likely reduces ketones as well.

3. **Starting Material**: The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has:
   - A ketone group at position 5.
   - An ethyl group at position 3.
   - An isobutoxy group at position 5.
   - A carboxylic acid group at position 1.

4. **Reaction Mechanism**:
   - Reduction of the ketone at position 5 by LiBH4 or BH3 produces a secondary alcohol.
   - The alcohol then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone structure.

5. **Stereochemistry**:
   - The starting material has a chiral center at position 3 (due to the ethyl group).
   - The configuration of this chiral center determines the configuration of the product. If the starting material is (R), the product will also be (R), and if the starting material is (S), the product will be (S).

6. **Matching Products to Starting Materials**:
   - For reaction A, the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Therefore, the starting material must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.
   - For reaction B, the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Therefore, the starting material must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

7. **Correct Option**:
   - Option D specifies that A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which matches the stereochemical relationship between the starting materials and the products.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Answer: D
