Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the setup is: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of the photons.

Hmm, right. So first, I need to remember what happens when an electron and positron annihilate. They produce gamma-ray photons, typically. But in this case, it's two photons. I think that's the typical caseâ€”pair annihilation produces two photons because of conservation laws.

Wait, so the key here must be conservation of momentum and energy. Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their momenta will add vectorially. Then, the photons must carry off the combined momentum in the right directions.

Wait, but in this case, both particles are moving along the same horizontal axis, so their momenta are along the same line. But the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. So that must form some angle between them.

Wait, but the problem says that both photons have the same energy. So their energies are equal. Since energy of a photon is related to its frequency and wavelength, and also direction, but
