Okay, so I've got this physics problem about annihilation, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of A⁺ and two of A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, which probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Wait, but the question gives the mass of A as 300 MeV. Hmm, but the initial particles are proton and antiproton. I remember that the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², right? So, each proton and antiproton has a rest mass of 938 MeV, but the product is four A particles each of 300 MeV. Wait, that's 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, but the initial is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. Oh wait, but wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the total initial energy is just a bit more than their rest masses?

Wait, but the initial particles are p and p̄. The rest mass of each is about 938 MeV, so their combined rest mass is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. The products are four A particles, each 300 MeV, so total rest mass is 1200 MeV. But wait, the initial energy is more than the rest mass of the products, so that's possible because energy is conserved, including kinetic.

But the question is asking about the velocity of particle A. Oh, but wait: in the process, the products are four A particles, but they are probably all moving in some way. How do I find their velocity?

Wait, but the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe we can approximate that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass. So, let's consider the initial energy as the sum of the rest energies. Wait, but the proton is probably at rest? Or are both moving? Hmm, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps the proton is at rest. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, but the problem states "the antiproton is slowly moving". So, perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some small velocity, but we can neglect its kinetic energy because it's slow.

Wait, no. Another approach: when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they usually produce other particle-antiparticle pairs. But in this case, it's producing four particles: two A+ and two A-. So, the products are four particles. So, perhaps the initial system's energy and momentum must equal the final system's.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I can approximate its momentum as much less than its rest mass times c. So, perhaps the initial momentum is mainly from the antiproton, which is small. So maybe the total initial momentum is approximately zero? Or wait, no: the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving, so the initial momentum is that of the antiproton. But if it's moving slowly, maybe its momentum is much smaller than its rest mass. So, the initial momentum is not zero, but perhaps the final particles' momenta can be approximated in a certain way.

Alternatively, since the initial kinetic energy is low, maybe the annihilation occurs in the rest frame of the antiproton? Or perhaps not. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me try to outline the approach:

1. Calculate the total initial energy and momentum.
2. After annihilation, the system consists of four particles: two A+ and two A-.
3. Assuming that the particles are moving together in some symmetric way, perhaps in pairs or all moving in the same direction. Alternatively, perhaps they're produced at rest, but that can't be because the initial momentum is non-zero if the antiproton is moving.

Wait, but if the initial system has some momentum, the final system must have the same. So, the four A particles must have a total momentum equal to the initial momentum of the antiproton (since the proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero). But if the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum p is much less than its rest mass m, so p ≈ gamma m v, but since v is small, maybe p is about m v, but v is low. Hmm, perhaps we can approximate the initial momentum as much less than the rest mass terms.

Wait, but since the initial rest mass energy is 2 * 938 MeV, but the final rest mass is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So the initial rest mass energy is higher than the final. Hmm, but the initial particles are moving, so the total energy is higher than the sum of rest masses.

Wait, but perhaps the initial system is such that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity. So the initial energy is the sum of rest energy of the proton plus the total energy of the moving antiproton. The rest energy of the proton is 938 MeV, and the antiproton's total energy is gamma * m_p c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So v is much less than c, so gamma is approximately 1 + (1/2) v²/c². So the kinetic energy is approximately (1/2) m_p v², which is small compared to the rest energy.

But how does that help? Maybe we can consider that the total initial energy is approximately 2 * m_p c², because the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible?

Wait, but the initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton's energy is gamma m_p c². Since it's moving slowly, gamma is close to 1, so the total initial energy is approximately m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c².

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, but I don't know if it's moving so slowly that gamma can be taken as 1. If v is very small, gamma is about 1 + (v²)/(2c²), but then the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m_p c² ≈ (v²/(2c²)) m_p c² = (1/2) m_p v². But if the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps its momentum can be approximated as p ≈ m_p v, and v is small.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, but given that the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial system's momentum is dominated by the antiproton, so the center-of-momentum frame is moving with some small velocity.

Alternatively, since the problem gives the mass of A as 300 MeV, perhaps the process is such that each A is moving, and we can find their velocity based on energy and momentum conservation.

Wait, let's think about energy and momentum.

Let me denote:

Initial particles: proton (p) and antiproton (p̄).

Proton is at rest, so its momentum is 0, energy is m_p c².

Antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its momentum is p = gamma m_p v.

Its energy is E = gamma m_p c².

So the total initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

The products are two A⁺ and two A⁻.

Assuming that the four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, but that's probably an oversimplification. Alternatively, perhaps they are all moving in pairs. But this could get complicated.

But maybe the problem is symmetric, so the four A particles are moving in pairs, perhaps two going in the same direction and the other two oppositely, but it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps all four are moving together with the same velocity, which would make the problem symmetric.

Wait, if all four A particles are moving with the same velocity u, then their momentum would be 4 * gamma_A m_A u, where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for velocity u. Similarly, their energy would be 4 * gamma_A m_A c².

Then, conservation of energy and momentum gives:

E_initial = 4 gamma_A m_A c²

p_initial = 4 gamma_A m_A u

Hmm, because all four are moving in the same direction, so their momenta add up. But I'm not sure if that's realistic because in reality, the products would likely have a variety of velocities, but perhaps the problem simplifies it.

Alternatively, perhaps the four A particles are all moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, each with velocity u. But that's a big assumption, but let's try.

So,

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c²

p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p

Where gamma_p is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton's velocity v_p.

On the final side,

E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c²

p_final = 4 gamma_A m_A u

So, equating energy and momentum:

m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c²

gamma_p m_p v_p = 4 gamma_A m_A u

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Because the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can approximate gamma_p ≈ 1. So, E_initial ≈ (m_p + m_p) c² = 2 m_p c²

p_initial ≈ m_p v_p

So,

2 m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c² → 2 m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A → gamma_A = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) )= (m_p)/(2 m_A).

Given that m_p is about 938 MeV/c², and m_A is 300 MeV/c², let's compute gamma_A.

m_p = 938 MeV/c²

m_A = 300 MeV/c²

So, gamma_A = (938) / (2 * 300) = 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633.

So gamma_A is approximately 1.5633.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - u²/c²), so:

gamma_A = 1.5633 → 1/sqrt(1 - (u²/c²)) ) = 1.5633 → sqrt(1 - (u²/c²)) = 1/1.5633 ≈ 0.6409 → 1 - (u²/c²) = (0.6409)^2 ≈ 0.4108 → u²/c² = 1 - 0.4108 = 0.5892 → u = c * sqrt(0.5892) ≈ c * 0.767.

Wait, but that's about 0.767 c. Hmm, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute 938 divided by (2*300):

2*300 =600 → 938/600 = 1.563333... Correct.

So sqrt(1 - u²/c²) = 1/(1.563333) → Let me compute 1/1.563333:

1.563333 is approximately 1.5633, so 1 divided by that is approximately 0.6409.

So 1 - u²/c² = (0.6409)^2. Let me compute that accurately.

0.6409 squared: 0.6409 * 0.6409.

0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36; 0.04 * 0.6=0.024; 0.0009 * 0.6=0.00054; etc. Alternatively, perhaps 0.64^2 is 0.4096. Then 0.6409 is slightly higher. Let's compute 0.6409 * 0.6409.

= (0.6 + 0.0409)^2

= 0.6² + 2 *0.6 *0.0409 + (0.0409)^2

= 0.36 + 0.04908 + 0.001672

= 0.36 + 0.04908 = 0.40908 + 0.001672 = 0.410752.

So 1 - u²/c² = 0.410752 → u²/c² = 1 - 0.410752 = 0.589248 → u = c * sqrt(0.589248).

Compute sqrt(0.589248). Let's see, 0.77^2 is 0.5929, which is a bit higher than 0.5892. So 0.77² = 0.5929; 0.76^2 = 0.5776.

So 0.5892 is between 0.76² and 0.77². Let me compute 0.767²:

0.767^2 = (0.7 + 0.067)^2 = 0.49 + 2*0.7*0.067 + 0.067² = 0.49 + 0.0938 + 0.004489 = 0.49 + 0.0938 = 0.5838 + 0.004489= 0.5883.

Still under 0.5892.

0.768^2: (0.767 + 0.001)^2 = 0.5883 + 2*0.767*0.001 + (0.001)^2 = approx 0.5883 + 0.001534 + 0.000001 = 0.589835.

Which is a bit over 0.5892. So the sqrt(0.5892) is approximately 0.7675 or so. So u ≈ 0.7675 c, which is approximately 0.77c.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.77c, option D is 0.86c, etc.

So the calculation gives about 0.77c, which would correspond to option A.

But wait, did I make an assumption that all four particles are moving in the same direction? Because in reality, the products would probably have a distribution of velocities, but the problem might be simplifying it.

But wait, another thought: when the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum is small, so the products are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton's momentum, each with the same velocity u. If that's the case, then the approach I took is correct.

But let me think about the initial momentum. The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p << c, so gamma_p ≈1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v_p.

The final momentum is p_final = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

Setting them equal: m_p v_p = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

But from the energy equation, I found gamma_A = m_p/(2 m_A). So substituting into the momentum equation:

m_p v_p = 4 (m_p/(2 m_A)) m_A u → m_p v_p = 4 (m_p/2) u → m_p v_p = 2 m_p u → v_p = 2 u.

Wait, but earlier I found u ≈ 0.767 c, so v_p would be 2 * 0.767 c = 1.534 c, which is impossible because nothing can go faster than c. So that's a problem. So my assumption must be wrong.

Hmm, where did I go wrong? Maybe the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction with the same velocity is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approximation that gamma_p is 1 is not valid.

Wait, perhaps I should not have approximated gamma_p as 1 because even a small v_p could lead to a significant momentum when multiplied by the rest mass. Let's try to approach this without making that approximation.

Let me denote the initial energy as:

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p.

The final energy is E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

The final momentum is p_final = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

Conservation of energy and momentum:

1. m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

2. gamma_p m_p v_p = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

We can write gamma_p = 1/sqrt(1 - (v_p²/c²)).

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p is much less than c, so gamma_p ≈ 1 + (1/2)(v_p²/c²).

Wait, but perhaps even a small v_p could have a significant effect when multiplied by m_p. Let me think.

From equation 1:

m_p (1 + gamma_p) = 4 gamma_A m_A.

Let me write gamma_A in terms of gamma_p and v_p.

From equation 2:

gamma_p v_p = (4 gamma_A m_A u) / m_p.

Hmm, maybe we can express u in terms of v_p and gamma_p.

Alternatively, perhaps we can solve for gamma_A from equation 1 and substitute into equation 2.

From equation 1:

gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma_p) ] / (4 m_A )

Substituting into equation 2:

gamma_p m_p v_p = 4 * [ m_p (1 + gamma_p) / (4 m_A) ] * m_A u.

Wait, because equation 2 is:

gamma_p m_p v_p = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

Substituting gamma_A from equation 1:

gamma_p m_p v_p =4 * [ m_p (1 + gamma_p)/(4 m_A) ) ] * m_A u.

The 4 and m_A cancel out, so:

gamma_p m_p v_p = m_p (1 + gamma_p) u.

Divide both sides by m_p:

gamma_p v_p = (1 + gamma_p) u.

So,

u = gamma_p v_p / (1 + gamma_p )

Hmm, perhaps we can relate u and v_p.

But without knowing v_p, this is tricky. Let me think about the energy equation again.

Gamma_p is approximately 1 + (v_p²)/(2 c²), since v_p is small. So,

gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v_p²)/(2 c²).

So, substituting gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v_p²)/(2 c²), equation 1 becomes:

gamma_A ≈ [ m_p (1 + (1 + (v_p²)/(2 c²)) ) ] / (4 m_A )

Which simplifies to:

gamma_A ≈ [ m_p (2 + (v_p²)/(2 c²) )) ] / (4 m_A )

= [ m_p * 2 (1 + (v_p²)/(4 c²) ) ] / (4 m_A )

= [ m_p (1 + (v_p²)/(4 c²) ) ] / (2 m_A )

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p²/(4 c²) is very small, so we can approximate it as:

gamma_A ≈ m_p/(2 m_A )

Which brings us back to the earlier result of gamma_A ≈ 1.5633.

Which gives u ≈ 0.767 c, but then the momentum equation gives v_p = 2 u, which is impossible.

So perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the four A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta cancel out, but that seems unlikely because the initial momentum is non-zero.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the system is such that the two A+ and two A- are each moving in opposite directions, so that their momenta cancel pairwise. But that would require that each A+ and A- have opposite velocities, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the two A+ particles are moving in one direction and the two A- in the opposite direction, but with the same speed. That way, their momenta would add vectorially.

But if the problem states that the process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-, then perhaps the A+ and A- are each moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton's motion and each other, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the A+ and A- are each moving in the same direction, so their momenta add. But that brings us back to the earlier problem where v_p would be twice u, which is impossible.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Maybe the problem is not considering all four particles moving, but perhaps each pair is moving together, so the four particles are moving as two pairs, each with the same velocity. But that complicates the momentum calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is such that the four particles are all at rest, but that's impossible because the initial momentum is non-zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is symmetric, so that the four particles are moving in two opposite directions, with each pair having the same velocity but opposite directions. Let's say two A+ are moving in the +x direction and two A- in the -x direction, each with velocity u. Then, the total momentum would be 2 gamma_A m_A u (from +x) minus 2 gamma_A m_A u (from -x), which would cancel out. But that can't be right because the initial momentum is not zero.

Wait, but the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p. So, if the final momentum is zero, that would contradict momentum conservation. So that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps the approach is to consider that the system's center of momentum frame is where the total momentum is zero. But the initial frame has momentum from the antiproton, so perhaps the problem is best approached in the center of momentum frame.

Wait, the center of momentum (COM) frame is where the total momentum is zero. Let me calculate the total energy and momentum in the lab frame (where proton is at rest) and then find the velocity of the COM frame.

In the lab frame, initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p.

Total energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p).

The velocity of the COM frame is given by (p_initial c²) / E_initial.

So,

beta_com = (p_initial c²) / E_initial

= (gamma_p m_p v_p c²) / [ m_p c² (1 + gamma_p) ) ]

= (gamma_p v_p) / (1 + gamma_p )

= [ (v_p) / sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²) ) ] / (1 + [v_p / sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²) ] )

Hmm, but this could get complicated. Alternatively, since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p is small compared to c, so gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v_p²)/(2 c²).

So,

beta_com ≈ [ (v_p) / (1) ) * (1 + (v_p²)/(2 c²)) ] / [ 1 + (1 + (v_p²)/(2 c²)) ]

But since v_p is small, terms like v_p²/c² are negligible, so,

beta_com ≈ (v_p) / (2) → v_com ≈ v_p / 2.

But I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total energy and momentum and then find the velocity of the COM frame.

Wait, another thought: in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero, so the total energy is the sum of the rest energies. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity of the COM frame is v_com = (p_initial c²) / E_initial.

So,

p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p.

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p).

So,

v_com = [ gamma_p m_p v_p c² ] / [ m_p c² (1 + gamma_p) ) ].

= [ gamma_p v_p ] / (1 + gamma_p )

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma_p is about 1.

So,

v_com ≈ v_p / 2.

In the COM frame, the total energy is E_initial / gamma_com, where gamma_com is 1/sqrt(1 - (v_com)^2/c^2).

But I'm not sure if this approach is leading me anywhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the problem in the COM frame. In that frame, the initial momentum is zero, so the total energy is just the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton, which is 2 m_p c^2.

After annihilation, the four A particles must also have zero total momentum in this frame. So each A particle must have equal and opposite momenta. But since there are four particles, perhaps two move in one direction and two in the opposite direction, each with the same speed but opposite directions.

Wait, no, because each A+ and A- would have opposite charges, but same mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the four A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta cancel out. For example, two A particles move in +x and two in -x, each with the same speed u.

In that case, the total momentum in the COM frame would be zero, as needed.

But then I need to calculate the energy in the COM frame.

Wait, the total energy in the COM frame would be the sum of the energies of the four A particles. Each has energy gamma_A m_A c², so four of them would have 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So,

4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c².

Because in the COM frame, the initial energy is 2 m_p c².

Wait, but that can't be right because 4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² → gamma_A = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A ) = m_p/(2 m_A ) = 938/(2*300)= 938/600≈1.5633, same as before.

So gamma_A is approx 1.5633, leading to u ≈ 0.767 c, which is option A.

But wait, in the COM frame, the particles are moving in such a way that their momenta cancel, but their energies add up to the total energy in that frame.

So, perhaps the velocity of each A particle in the COM frame is 0.767 c.

But the question is asking for the velocity of particle A in the lab frame, where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly.

Hmm, so perhaps I need to find the velocity of A in the lab frame, which is the velocity in the COM frame plus the velocity of the COM frame relative to the lab.

Wait, using the velocity addition formula.

So, let me denote:

u' is the velocity of the A particle in the COM frame (0.767 c in some direction, say +x).

v_com is the velocity of the COM frame relative to the lab frame (which is in +x direction, since the antiproton is moving in +x).

So, the velocity of the A in the lab frame is u = (u' + v_com) / (1 + (u' v_com)/(c²)).

But from earlier, v_com is approximately v_p / 2. But I'm not sure how to proceed without knowing v_p.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity of the COM frame is (p_initial c²) / E_initial.

p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p.

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p).

So,

v_com = (gamma_p m_p v_p c² ) / ( m_p c² (1 + gamma_p) ) )

= (gamma_p v_p ) / (1 + gamma_p )

Again, since v_p is small, gamma_p ≈ 1.

So,

v_com ≈ v_p / 2.

But without knowing v_p, I can't find the exact value. However, in the COM frame, the velocity of A is u' = 0.767 c.

But I'm stuck because I don't know v_p. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect, and I should instead model the system such that the particles are moving in opposite directions but with the same speed, leading to cancellation of momentum.

Wait, but in that case, the total momentum would be zero, which would only be possible if the initial system's momentum is zero, but it's not because the antiproton is moving.

Hmm, perhaps I should instead consider that each pair of A particles is moving in opposite directions with velocities u and -u, but that would require that each pair's momentum cancels, but then the total momentum would be zero, which can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is such that two A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, and the other two are at rest. But that seems unlikely because momentum would then be carried by only two of them.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the magnitude of the velocity, and we can ignore direction. So, perhaps the A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, each with velocity u. Then, the momentum would be 4 gamma_A m_A u.

But earlier, that leads to v_p = 2u, which is impossible, so perhaps that approach is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial momentum is small, which suggests that the particles A are moving at velocities not too close to c. But the calculation gives about 0.77 c, which is option A.

But earlier, when I considered the COM frame, I found that gamma_A is about 1.5633, leading to u ≈ 0.77 c. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 0.77c.

Wait, but let me check if the velocity in the lab frame would be higher or lower than in the COM frame.

If the COM frame is moving at velocity v_com ≈ v_p/2, which is much less than c, then the velocity of each A in the lab frame would be approximately u' + v_com, but since u' is about 0.77c, adding a small v_com would make it a little higher, but perhaps not enough to reach 0.86c. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the initial particles' rest masses are higher than the products', so some energy is released, leading to higher velocities.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The problem asks for the velocity of particle A. The options are given, so perhaps I can compute gamma_A and then find the velocity for each option.

Option A: 0.77c → gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.77)^2) → 0.77^2 = 0.5929 → 1-0.5929=0.4071 → sqrt(0.4071)=0.638 → gamma_A=1/0.638≈1.568.

Which is close to the earlier calculation of 1.5633.

So, that makes sense.

But earlier, when I tried to plug into the momentum equation, it didn't work, but perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect, and the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the velocity comes out to option C) 0.91c. Let me see. For 0.91c,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.91)^2) → 0.91^2=0.8281 → 1-0.8281=0.1719 → sqrt≈0.4147 → gamma≈2.41.

But earlier, gamma_A was calculated as about 1.5633, so option C gives a higher gamma, which would not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic Doppler effect or other relativistic considerations, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So, the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c².

The products are four A particles, each with rest mass 300 MeV, so 4*300=1200 MeV. But 2 m_p c² is about 2*938=1876 MeV. So the initial energy is higher than the rest mass of the products. So, the products must have kinetic energy.

But how to relate this to their velocity.

Wait, the invariant mass squared (s) is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

In the initial frame, E_initial is 2 m_p c² (approximate because the antiproton is moving slowly, so gamma_p≈1), so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

p_initial ≈ m_p v_p (since gamma_p≈1).

So,

s = (2 m_p c²)^2 - (m_p v_p c )^2.

= 4 m_p² c^4 - m_p² v_p² c².

Divide both terms by c^4,

s/c^4 = 4 m_p² - m_p² (v_p^2/c^2).

= m_p² [4 - v_p^2/c^2 ].

Now, the invariant mass squared must also be equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products, but wait, no. The invariant mass is the same in all frames; it's the square of the total energy in the COM frame divided by c².

Wait, in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero, so s = (E_COM)^2.

E_COM is the total rest energy plus any kinetic energy, but perhaps it's equal to 2 m_p c², because in the COM frame, the initial particles' energies add up, but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, in the COM frame, E_COM is the sum of the energies of the initial particles in that frame.

But perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Maybe I should accept that the correct answer is based on the earlier calculation of gamma_A ≈1.5633, leading to u ≈0.77c, which is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \), where the antiproton is moving slowly. The goal is to determine the velocity of particle \( A \).

### Key Information:
1. The rest mass energy of the proton (and antiproton) is \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \).
2. The rest mass energy of particle \( A \) is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).
3. The antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy, and we approximate its Lorentz factor \( \gamma_p \approx 1 \).

### Energy and Momentum Conservation:
- **Initial Energy**: The total initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, \( \gamma_p \approx 1 \), so:
  \[
  E_{\text{initial}} \approx m_p c^2 + m_p c^2 = 2 m_p c^2 = 2(938 \, \text{MeV}) = 1876 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]

- **Final Energy**: The total energy of the four \( A \)-particles is:
  \[
  E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2,
  \]
  where \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor for the velocity \( u \) of the \( A \)-particles.

Equating initial and final energies:
\[
2 m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2.
\]

Simplify to solve for \( \gamma_A \):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{2 m_p}{4 m_A} = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}.
\]

Substitute \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{938}{2(300)} = \frac{938}{600} \approx 1.5633.
\]

### Relating \( \gamma_A \) to Velocity \( u \):
The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by:
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}.
\]

Rearranging for \( u \):
\[
\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma_A}, \quad 1 - u^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}, \quad u^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}.
\]

Substitute \( \gamma_A \approx 1.5633 \):
\[
u^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}.
\]

First, calculate \( (1.5633)^2 \):
\[
(1.5633)^2 \approx 2.445.
\]

Then:
\[
u^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{2.445} \approx 1 - 0.409 \approx 0.591.
\]

Finally:
\[
u = c \sqrt{0.591} \approx c(0.767).
\]

### Conclusion:
The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
