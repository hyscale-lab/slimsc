Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to remember what I can.

The question is about finding the net potential energy when a charge q is placed a certain distance from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I think I remember that potential energy in such systems involves considering the work done to assemble the charges.

Wait, the setup is a conducting sphere, right? So, a conducting sphere has some important properties. Conductors allow charges to move freely, so if it's grounded, any excess charge would flow away. But wait, no, in this case, the sphere is grounded, so if it's initially neutral, maybe the presence of q induces some charges on it.

Wait, but since it's a conductor, the charges on it will reside on the surface. And when you place a charge near a conducting sphere, it induces charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges might be different. Oh right, when the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can flow to or from the ground, which is at zero potential.

So, when a charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere will get an induced charge. Let me think about that. The charge q will induce an opposite charge on the near side of the sphere and a same charge on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can adjust. Wait, but wait, no. Because any induced charge would cause the sphere's potential to change, but since it's grounded, the sphere's potential is the same as the ground
