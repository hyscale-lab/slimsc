Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Also, we can approximate tanθ as θ because the angles are small.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it. Let's break it down. First, when you have a light passing through an aperture, the diffraction pattern depends on the shape of the aperture. For a single slit, I remember that the minima occur at angles where d sinθ = mλ/2, where d is the slit width, and m is an integer. But this isn't a single slit; it's a polygon with N sides.

Wait, but when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. Oh, so the problem must be about a circular aperture. That's a relief because I'm more familiar with the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture.

In the case of a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is called the Airy disk. The first minima in the Airy disk occur at an angle θ given by approximately 1.22λ/(π a), right? Because the formula for the minima is a sinθ = mλ, where m is 1 for the first minimum. Wait, no, for a single slit it's a sinθ = mλ, but for a circular aperture, it's a bit different. Oh, right, the first dark ring (minimum) in the Airy pattern occurs at θ where a sinθ = 1.22λ. So the angle θ is roughly 1.22λ/(a), assuming sinθ ≈ θ because θ is small.

But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, in a single slit, the first minimum is at m=1, the next at m=2, etc. So the angular separation would be (2λ/a) - (λ/a) = λ/a. But that's for a single slit. But this is a circular aperture.

Wait, I'm getting confused. For a circular aperture, the central maximum is surrounded by rings of minima and
