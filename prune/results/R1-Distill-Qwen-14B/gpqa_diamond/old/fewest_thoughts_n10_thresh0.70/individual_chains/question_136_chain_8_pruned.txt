Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on vector fields and their integrals, but I'll think it through.

The question says that there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R.

Hmm, right. The divergence of a vector field. I remember that divergence measures the magnitude of a vector field's source or sink at a given point. The divergence theorem also comes to mind, which relates the flux through a surface to the divergence in the volume inside. But wait, the question is about the volume integral of the divergence itself, not the flux. But maybe the divergence theorem can still help here.

Wait, the divergence theorem says that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface enclosing that volume. Oh wait, but in this case, the problem is directly asking for the volume integral of the divergence. So I can compute that either by calculating the divergence and then integrating, or maybe using the divergence theorem.

But let me first figure out what the divergence of f is. Since f is a radial vector field with magnitude 1/r², in spherical coordinates, the vector field f(r) can be written as (1/r²) r_hat. So in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field is a bit different than in Cartesian. Let me recall the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates.

Divergence in spherical coordinates (r, theta, phi) for a vector field A is (1/(r²)) [d(r² A_r) / dr + (1/sin theta) d(A_phi sin theta)/d theta + (1/(sin theta d phi)) dA_theta/d phi]. But wait, in this case, the vector field only has a radial component, so A_theta and A_phi are zero. So the divergence simplifies a lot.

So, divergence of f = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r). Since A_r is 1
