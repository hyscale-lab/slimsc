Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products are formed when this compound is treated with Grubbs catalyst, and we're excluding ethene from the count. Let me think through this step by step.

First, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions, right? Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. It can either be ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis. Wait, but in this case, since we're dealing with an alkene, it's probably ring-closing because the molecule has the right structure for that.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. The pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₃)CH₂. Wait, no. Let me count again. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? No wait, pent is five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But when it's 3-methyl, the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the pent chain has five carbons, with a double bond starting at C1 (so between C1-C2), and a methyl branch on C3.

So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, wait, no, let's get the numbering right. For pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is:

1      2       3        4        5
CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, wait. No, wait, the formula for pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But when it's 3-methyl, the third carbon (the one after the double bond) has a methyl group. So it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that would be six
