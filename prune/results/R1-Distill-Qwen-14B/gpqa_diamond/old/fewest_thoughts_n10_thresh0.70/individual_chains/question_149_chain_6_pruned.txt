Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read the problem again and think it through step by step.

So, the scenario is that we have a small peptidic compound synthesized chemically. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly like what's expected except for two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. But since the integrals are roughly equal, together they make sense for one proton. So, the NMR is showing two peaks where there should be one. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. So, it's not that each peak is split by another proton; it's something else.

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature, there are two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule. So, the mass is the same, but there are two peaks eluting at different times. But wait, why would the mass be the same but have two peaks? Maybe it's a diastereomer or something else.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Hmm, a precursor would have a lower mass than the product. Since the mass in LC-MS is the same, this seems unlikely. Unless the precursor somehow got into the compound and is not eluting with the product. But the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass, so probably not the answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images, so they have the same mass and same physical properties except for their interactions with chiral environments. In LC-MS, would they elute at different times? LC retention times can be affected by the environment, so if the column is chiral, enantiomers would separate. But if the column isn't chiral, they might co-elute. But the problem states the LC-MS shows two peaks, implying the column is chiral. But wait, the question says both have the same mass. Enantiomers would have same mass. So, possible. But what about the NMR? If the compound is a racemic mixture, then in the NMR, the alpha proton would have two peaks due to the two enantiomers. But wait, in a racemic mixture, wouldn't the NMR for a chiral center show a singlet if the protons are equivalent? Or perhaps an AB system? I'm a bit confused here.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not too familiar with this term. Maybe it refers to a situation where two different coupling partners are present? Or perhaps a situation where the coupling leads to two peaks because of different coupling constants. Wait, but the problem says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so the two peaks aren't from splitting. So if double coupling isn't spin-spin, maybe it's something else. Wait, maybe it's about the formation of two different diastereomers during the coupling, leading to a different environment for the alpha proton. Hmm, not sure.

Option D: M
