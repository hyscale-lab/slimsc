Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying an unknown white solid using spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one matches the given data.

Alright, let's break down the data step by step. 

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at m/z 158, which is 32% of the base peak. Hmm, the molecular ion is the highest peak, right? So the molecular weight is 156. The other peak is two units higher, so that might mean something about the structure. Maybe an isotope? Or perhaps a fragment with a chlorine or another element.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500 and 2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Since we're dealing with a solid, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, which has a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300. But wait, the peak is broad from 3500-2700, which is a wider range. Could it be an alcohol? Or maybe an acidic proton like a phenol or a carboxylic acid?

Then there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids typically have a peak around 1700 cm^-1. But wait, the peak is at 1720, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's an ester or a carbonyl group without strong hydrogen bonding, like a ketone or aldehyde? But wait, a carboxylic acid would have a lower wavenumber due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid chloride, which has a higher wavenumber around 1800. Hmm, but 1720 is still lower than that. Or perhaps it's an ester or amide. Alternatively, maybe a ketone? But if it's an aromatic ring involved, maybe a benzaldehyde?

Looking at the 1H NMR data next. The peaks are at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.72 (d, 2H).

The peak at 11.0 ppm is a singlet integrating for one proton. That's a high chemical shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton (around 9-10 ppm) or a carboxylic acid proton (which is usually broad, but in some cases like if it's a strong acid, maybe it's sharp). Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have O-H stretches that are broad, which we have in the IR data. However, the NMR peak is a singlet at 11 ppm, which is more likely to be a carboxylic acid proton. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10.5 ppm. But 11 seems a bit high, maybe if it's
