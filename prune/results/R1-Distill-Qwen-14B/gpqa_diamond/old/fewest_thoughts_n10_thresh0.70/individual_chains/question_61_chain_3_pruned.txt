Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with benzene undergoing a series of reactions, and eventually forms a final product, which is one of the four options given. I'll need to figure out each step to determine what the final product looks like.

So, step one: benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitrating benzene typically involves a nitrating mixture, which is HNO3 and H2SO4. Benzene reacts with this under certain conditions to form nitrobenzene. Wait, but wait. Nitration of benzene adds a nitro group. Where does it add? Benzene is symmetric, so the nitro group can go in any position, but actually, the nitration tends to add in a meta-directing position. Wait no, nitro is a meta director, but the initial substitution is ortho, meta, para. Wait, no, benzene in nitration gives nitrobenzene, which is a single product because the ring is symmetric. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, which is a nitrating agent. So the product is nitrobenzene. Correct.

Then, product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Iron is a catalyst for bromination. But wait, nitro
