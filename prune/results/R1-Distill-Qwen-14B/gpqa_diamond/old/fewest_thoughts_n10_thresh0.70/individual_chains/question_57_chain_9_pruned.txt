Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that phase shifts are involved in scattering amplitudes. The question gives me phase shifts for different l values, right?

Wait, the given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And we're told to ignore the rest, so I guess higher l values beyond 4 aren't considered here.

The question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is calculated using the partial waves, each involving the phase shifts. 

So the general formula for the scattering amplitude f(k,θ) is a sum over l of (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (sin δ_l) (something with the Legendre polynomial... wait, no, more precisely, the formula is:

f(k,θ) = 4π ∑ [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ] [ (sin(θ/2))^l / ( (2k)^{l} ) ] ... wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the exact expression. Alternatively, maybe it's f = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] (P_l(cosθ)) / (2ik) ?

Wait, no, another approach. The scattering amplitude f is given by the sum over l of (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] (something with Legendre polynomials or spherical harmonics). But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, the problem states that we're to calculate the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0°, right? Because the incident beam is coming along the direction where θ=0. So the angle is 0, which might simplify things.

So when θ is 0°, the cosine of theta is 1. So the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because P_l(1)=1 for any l. So the expression for f(k,θ=0) would be sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ (e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l) ] * (something) ... Hmm,
