Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it carefully again.

So, the setup is about two planets orbiting a star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. The orbital period of the first planet is 3 days. 

The question is about finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet. This second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. Both planets have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane. The key is that both transit and occultation events must occur.

Hmm. So wait, what do I know about transits and occultations? I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked (but we can't see Earth's light, but for exoplanets this is about the planet being eclipsed by the starâ€”so maybe it's when the planet goes behind the star, so its reflected light or emitted light is blocked). 

Wait, but for a transit to happen, the planet must pass directly in front of the star. The impact parameter is the measure of how close the planet's path comes to the center of the star. If the impact parameter is zero, the planet transits exactly in front of the center. If it's greater than zero, the transit path is offset.

But wait, for a transit to occur, the planet must pass in front of the star. For an occultation, the planet must pass behind the star. So, for both events to happen, the planet's orbit must be such that the star is in the same line of sight relative to Earth during both events. 

Wait, but how does the orbital period of the second planet relate to the first? They have to be in a configuration where their orbital periods are such that they can both transit and occult. Or maybe it's about the timing of their transits and occultations.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another thought comes to mind
