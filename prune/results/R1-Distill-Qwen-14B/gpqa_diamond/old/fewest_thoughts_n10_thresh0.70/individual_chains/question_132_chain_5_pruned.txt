Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying two aromatic compounds from their NMR spectra when they're mixed in a 1:1 ratio. The molecular formula for both is C10H14, which suggests they're probably tetramethylbenzenes or something similar.

The NMR data given has two main parts. First, the aromatic region: two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Then, in the aliphatic region, there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm, with a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, let's start by thinking about the aromatic part. Two singlets at 6.7 ppm. Wait, aromatic protons typically show up between 6.5 and 8.5 ppm. Singlets mean no neighboring Hs, so the aromatic protons in each compound must be equivalent and not adjacent to any other Hs. 

Since each compound is a tetramethylbenzene, each has four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring. The substitution pattern on the ring will determine how the protons look in the NMR.

Wait, but wait. If it's a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, each with their own NMR signals. But the question says that the spectrum shows two signals (singlets) in a 1:1 ratio. Oh, no, wait, noâ€”actually, the mixture is 1:1, but the aromatic region has two singlets each at around 6.7, with a 1:1 ratio. Wait, no, the question says, "two signals at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio." So each singlet is integrating for one equivalent of each compound? Or perhaps each singlet comes from one of the compounds.

Wait, perhaps each compound contributes one singlet in the aromatic region. So each compound must have only one type of aromatic proton, which is a singlet. That would mean each compound has equivalent aromatic protons, and any substituents are arranged symmetrically so that all aromatic Hs are equivalent. 

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Let me think. For a benzene ring with substituents, if all the remaining protons are equivalent,
