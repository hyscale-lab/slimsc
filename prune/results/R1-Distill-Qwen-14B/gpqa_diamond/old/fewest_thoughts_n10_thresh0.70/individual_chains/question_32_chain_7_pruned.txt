Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. It's about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I think Li is lithium. Let me think, lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Lithium-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons is 6 nucleons.

Wait, but the question is about the energy of the collider. I remember that in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy including rest mass. I'm a bit confused about that. Oh, but wait, I think for heavy ions, the energy is given as the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or is it the kinetic energy? Hmm, I should clarify that.

The problem asks for the energy of the RHIC so that the nucleus X's speed is 0.96c. So I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus. Because in colliders, the energy is typically the total energy (gamma times m c squared), not just the kinetic part. Or wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. In accelerators, the energy often refers to the kinetic energy, but for colliders, sometimes it's the total energy. Or maybe it's the same for both particles, since they are moving in opposite directions. Hmm, but I think in the context of RHIC, it's the total energy because they're dealing with heavy ions, and the rest mass is a significant part of the energy.

So first, I need to find the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. Lithium has atomic number 3, so Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is roughly the same, about 940 MeV/c²? Wait, but I think protons and neutrons have slightly different masses. Wait, actually, the proton mass is about 938.272 MeV/c², neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². But for this problem, maybe I can approximate them. Or perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the deuteron or something else. Wait, no. Let's think. The nucleus is Li-6. So the mass would be approximately the sum of the individual nucleons. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me calculate that. 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = let's see. 3*(938.272) is 2814.816 MeV, and 3*(939.565) is 2818.695 MeV. Adding those together gives 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.6335 GeV. But wait, no. Because when you combine nucleons into a nucleus, you have a mass defect due to binding energy. So the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons. However, I don't have the exact binding energy for Li-6. Hmm, this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, okay, I think the mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.013 atomic mass units (u). Let me confirm that. I remember that the mass of a
