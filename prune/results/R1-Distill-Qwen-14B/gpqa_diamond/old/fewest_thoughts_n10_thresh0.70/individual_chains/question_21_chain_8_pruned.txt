Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about isomers, specifically focusing on tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember from my notes that isomers can be constitutional or stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different structures, while stereoisomers are about the arrangement in space, like cis-trans or optical isomers.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I'm a bit fuzzy on tautomerism, but I think it's when a proton moves from one atom to another, leading to the same functional groups shifting. Like in ketones and aldehydes, or maybe in enols and keto forms.

Benzoquinone—wait, benzoquinone is a quinone, right? So it has two ketone groups. Quinones are aromatic, so the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So it's O=C6H4=O, but actually, I think it's more like a benzene ring where two adjacent carbons have double bonds to oxygen, making it a di-ketone. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up benzoquinone and something else. Oh, right, benzoquinone can have two ketone groups on adjacent carbons, that's para-benzoquinone, or perhaps ortho, but I'm not sure. Either way, it's a cyclic structure with two ketone groups.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione—so that's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Wait, three ketone groups would be at positions 1,3,5. So they are all alternate positions. So each of those carbons is a carbonyl group. That's a pretty symmetrical molecule, maybe.

Tautomerism would require the possibility of moving a hydrogen from one part of the molecule to another, like in a keto-enol tautomerism. For that, the molecule needs to have adjacent H and O groups. Let's think. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the carbonyl groups is at a position where the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups. So, each of those carbonyls is attached to a CH2, which is connected to another carbonyl. So, each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. Hmm, so maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2-... wait, no, that's not right. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three keto groups at every other carbon, making it a 6-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds? Or maybe all single bonds with three carbonyls attached. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it mentally. So, the cyclohexane ring has six carbons. Positions 1,3,5 are the carbonyl carbons, each with a double bond to O. So the structure would be:

O=C-C-O-C-C
