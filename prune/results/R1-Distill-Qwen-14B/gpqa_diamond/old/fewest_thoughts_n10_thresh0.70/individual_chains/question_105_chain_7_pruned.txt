Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about stars with spots and exoplanets. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So the question is about comparing the brightness variation caused by a star with spots to that caused by an exoplanet. I need to find the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star's radius to produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Alright, let me read the problem again. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The spots cause periodic brightness variations as the star rotates, similar to an exoplanet. The question is, what exoplanet radius would cause the same change in brightness as the spots do.

Wait, so the problem is about photometric variations. When a star has spots, as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing dips in brightness. Similarly, when a planet transits a star, it blocks some light, causing a dip. But in this case, the star's own spots are causing a dip, and we want to find what planet size would cause a dip of the same amplitude as the spots.

But wait, the star's spots are cooler, so when they face us, they make the star appear dimmer. So the amplitude of the dip depends on how much less bright those spots are compared to the rest of the star. So I think I need to compute the fractional change in brightness for both cases (spot and planet) and set them equal, then solve for the planet's radius.

Let me think about the star with spots first. The star's radius Rstar is the same as the Sun's, R_sun. The dark spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the filling factor is 20%. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, right? So the total area covered by spots on the entire star would be 0.2 (20%) multiplied by the area of one hemisphere. Wait, because the spots are on one hemisphere only.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4
