Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a reaction involving a specific compound reacting with hydrogen bromide, and then the products are identified using TLC.

The compound given is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me draw that structure in my mind. So, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a butenyl group. Specifically, it's a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. Breaking that down: butene is four carbons. The double bond is between C3 and C4. The substituents are two methyl groups on C2. So, the structure would be: 

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. The substituents are on carbon 2. So, carbon 1 is the one attached to the oxygen. So the structure would be:

O

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, wait. Let me count the carbons. But-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait no, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, no. Let me get this correctly. The butenyl group is four carbons. The numbering starts from the end attached to oxygen. So, position 1 is the oxygen's carbon, 2 is the next, 3 and 4 are the following. So the structure is:

O

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)₂-CH₂?

Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, that can't be because that would make it but-1-ene or but-2-ene. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused. Let me write it down.

But-3-en-1-yl: the structure is CH₂-CH₂-
