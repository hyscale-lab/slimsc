Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

Alright, let's read the problem again to make sure I get all the details. 

So, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak). Additionally, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Hmm, I need to figure out what all these substances could be. Let's start from the reactions and see if I can figure out the possible compounds.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C. Solid A reacting with gas B. Wait, 8 equivalents—so maybe a ratio of 1:8? I'm thinking perhaps something like sulfur reacting with something else, but I'm not sure yet.

Second reaction: C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. Hmm, I remember that some elements form hazardous compounds. Maybe C is something like sulfur trioxide (SO3), which can react further. But wait, what about D?

Third reaction: C reacts with water to give A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, when C reacts with water, it breaks down into A and two acids. The strong acid could be H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), and the weak acid perhaps H2S (but that's a gas). Alternatively, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is HCOOH (formic acid), but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let's think again. When a compound reacts with water to produce two acids, maybe it's something like a sulfite or sulfate. Wait, if C is SO3, then reacting with water would produce H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), but that's a strong acid. But the problem says two different acids, one strong and one weak. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is something else. Let me think about another possibility. What if C is Na2O? Wait, no, because when Na2O reacts with water, it gives NaOH, which is a strong base, not acids. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. Let's consider the reaction where D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, etc. But wait, D and B reacting 1:1. For example, if B is Cl2 and D is H2O, maybe? No, but that doesn't form a solvent. Wait, another thought: if B is Cl2 and D is NaOH, but that would not fit a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, maybe B is H2O and D is something else. Alternatively, perhaps D is HCl, and B is NaOH. Then, H would be NaCl and water, but that's a solution, not a pure solvent. 

Wait, perhaps B is H2O and D is something else. Let me think about the first reaction again: A + 8 B → C. If B is H2O, then 8 H2O reacting with A. What solid reacts with 8 H2O to form a product? Maybe a metal oxide. For example, NaO2 reacts with water? No, wait, perhaps a metal reacting with H2O. Wait, maybe solid A is sodium oxide (Na2O), and B is water (H2O). But the reaction would be Na2O + H2O → 2 NaOH. But that's only 1 H2O per Na2O, not 8. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Wait, maybe A is sulfur (elemental S), and B is oxygen (O2). S + O2 → SOx. But how many equivalents? If it's 8, then perhaps forming SO4^2-? Wait, but how would that work. S (solid) reacting with O2 (gas) to form SO3? But SO3 is a gas, right? Oh, but the product C is bright red. Hmm, SO3 is a colorless gas. Wait, what's bright red? Maybe sulfur trioxide isn't it. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like Fe2O3·nH2O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. Let's consider the second reaction: C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous chemicals? Maybe something like sarin gas, but that's probably too specific. Alternatively, perhaps E is something like phosgene (COCl2), which is toxic. Or maybe something like chlorine trifluoride, which is highly reactive and dangerous. Hmm, but how would that form from C and D?

Wait, maybe E is something like ClF3, but I'm not certain. Let me think differently. Let's go back to the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). If F is strong and G is weak, perhaps F is H2SO4 and G is H2S? But wait, H2S is a gas, not an acid in solution. Alternatively, maybe F is HNO3 (strong) and G is H2CO3 (carbonic acid, weak). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite. Wait, but sulfites reacting with water give H2SO3 and maybe something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the first reaction again. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). What solid reacts with 8 equivalents of a gas to form a bright red product? Oh, wait, maybe A is iron (Fe), and B is sulfur vapor (S8?), but that would form FeS or FeS2. But FeS is black, not red. Hmm. Or perhaps Fe reacts with S to form FeS, which is black, but maybe in another form it's red. Not sure.

Another thought: Maybe A is sodium (Na), B is Cl2. 8 Cl2? That would form NaCl. But that's white, not red. Hmm.

Wait, bright red product. Could C be something like mercury(II) oxide, HgO, which is red? But how would that form from a reaction with 8 equivalents of a gas?

Alternatively, maybe C is a vanadium compound. Vanadium(V) oxide is a red solid. How would that form? Vanadium metal reacting with oxygen. So, V + O2 → V2O5. But the stoichiometry would be V + (5/4) O2 → V2O5. So, each V gives 2.5 O2 per V. Not sure if that matches the 8 equivalents.

Wait, maybe the bright red product is Fe2O3·nH2O, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's something like PbCrO4, which is yellow. Not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe A is NaOH, B is HCl, but that would form NaCl and water. But that doesn't fit. Or A is Na2O and B is H2O, forming NaOH. But again, not matching the 8 equivalents.

Wait, another approach: Let's think of the overall reactions.

C is formed from A and B, then C reacts with D to form E. And C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, when C is hydrolyzed, it gives back A, a strong acid, and a weak acid.

So, if C is something like a sulfate ester or something that upon hydrolysis produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite, which on hydrolysis gives sulfurous acid (weak) and maybe another acid. Not sure.

Wait, another idea: Suppose C is a chlorate or something similar. Let's think, for example, C is ClO3^- or something. But not quite.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate compound. Wait, when nitrates decompose, they can form various products, but not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction where D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, D + B → H, 1:1. H is a solvent, so it's probably something like H2O, ethanol, etc. But D and B are gases. Oh, wait, maybe D is H2O and B is NH3. Then, H would be NH4OH ( ammonium hydroxide), but that's not a pure solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is H2O and D is NH3. Then, H would be NH4OH, but that's more of a solution than a pure solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is CH3CH2OH (ethanol). But D and B would need to react in a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl gas (HCl is a gas at certain conditions). Then, NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: B is Cl2 and D is H2O. But they don't react in a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, B is O2 and D is H2. They could react to form H2O, but H2O is a solvent. So, O2 + 2H2 → 2 H2O. That's a 1:2 ratio, but the problem states 1:1. So maybe that's not it.

Hmm, getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible symmetry groups for E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, D2v.

Symmetry groups are determined by the molecule's symmetry. For example, CO2 is D∞h, SO2 is D2h, etc. Extremely hazardous product E could be something like phosgene (COCl2), which has a trigonal planar structure, so its symmetry group is D∞h. Alternatively, if E is something else, like a molecule with a different structure.

Wait, what if E is something like ClF3? ClF3 has a trigonal pyramidal structure, which would have C3v symmetry, but that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: E is O=CCl2 (phosgene). Phosgene has the structure O=C(Cl)2, which is a trigonal planar molecule. The symmetry group for phosgene is D∞h because it has a center of inversion and a C∞ axis. Alternatively, if it has a C2 axis, but I'm not certain.

Wait, D∞h symmetry implies infinite symmetry along an axis, so maybe E is a molecule with a linear structure, like O=C=O (CO2), which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But CO2 isn't extremely hazardous, though. Phosgene, on the other hand, is. So if E is phosgene, its structure is O=C(Cl)2, which is planar, making it trigonal planar with D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is something like SO2, which has D2h symmetry. Hmm, but the options include D4h, D∞h, etc.

Wait, let me think about the reactions again. If C reacts with 2 D to form E. Suppose C is SO3, D is Cl2. So, SO3 + 2 Cl2 → E. What would that produce? Maybe SOCl2, but that would require less Cl2. Alternatively, perhaps forming something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the third reaction, C + H2O → A + F + G. If F is a strong acid and G a weak acid, perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfate. For instance, if C is Na2SO3 (sodium sulfite), then hydrolysis would give NaOH (strong base, not acid), which doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe C is something like (NH4)2SO4, which upon hydrolysis gives NH4OH (weak acid) and H2SO4 (strong acid). Wait, but (NH4)2SO4 is white, not bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is CaSO4·2H2O (which is white, I think), but not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate, like Ca(NO3)2. But upon hydrolysis, it would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and maybe another acid. Not sure.

Another thought: Maybe C is a chlorate, like KClO3. Hydrolysis might not produce two acids. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about a metal oxide reacting with another gas. Let's think about the first reaction, A + 8 B → C. If B is O2, and A is Fe, then Fe + O2 → Fe3O4 perhaps. But Fe3O4 is black, not red.

Wait, bright red solid. Maybe C is mercuric oxide, HgO, which is red. How would that form? Hg metal (A) reacts with O2 (B). Hg + O2 → HgO. The stoichiometry here is 2 Hg + O2 → 2 HgO. So, 1 O2 per 2 Hg. So, if A is Hg (1 mole), B is O2 (0.5 moles), but in the problem, it's 8 equivalents of B. That would be 8 moles of O2 per mole of Hg. That seems a lot. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is a peroxide, like Na2O2. But reacting with what gas? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium trioxide (CrO3) is dark red. How would that form? Cr metal (A) reacting with O2 (B). Cr + O2 → CrO3. Let's see stoichiometry: 4 Cr + 3 O2 → 2 CrO3. So, 3 equivalents of O2 per Cr. But the problem states 8 equivalents. So, that's more O2 per Cr. So, perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps A is V (vanadium), and B is O2. Vanadium reacts with O2 to form V2O5. The reaction is 2 V + 5 O2 → 2 V2O5. So, for each mole of V, 5/2 moles of O2 are used. So, that's 2.5 equivalents. The problem says 8 equivalents, so this might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible E and its symmetry. The options are symmetry groups of E.

Option B is D4h, which is a high symmetry group, often seen in molecules like methane (but it's tetrahedral, so Td symmetry), or maybe in some trigonal planar compounds. Wait, D4h is a point group that includes a four-fold rotation axis, horizontal mirror planes, etc. Alternatively, molecules like SO2 have D2h symmetry, which is not one of the options. Wait, no, the options include D4h and D∞h.

Wait, D∞h is the symmetry of a linear molecule like CO2 (O=C=O), which is linear. So if E has a linear structure, like O=C=O, then its symmetry group is D∞h.

But if E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), which is planar, then it's D∞h as well because it has a center of inversion and a C∞ axis. So phosgene would have D∞h symmetry.

So, if E is phosgene, then the symmetry is D∞h, which is option C.

But wait, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. How would that form from C and D?

Let me think: C reacts with 2 D → E (phosgene). So, what's D in this case? If E is O=C(Cl)2, then D would be Cl2. Because O=C(Cl)2 can be formed from something with O and Cl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is CO (carbon monoxide), and D is Cl2. Then, CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 (phosgene), but that's not a balanced equation. Let's check: CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe another reaction.

Wait, maybe C is Cl2O. Cl2O is dichlorine monoxide. Then, reacting with Cl2 would form something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps C is SO3, and D is Cl2. Then, SO3 + 2 Cl2 → SOCl2 + ClO2? Not sure about the products. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming SOCl2, but the reaction would be different.

Alternatively, maybe C is CO2 and D is Cl2. But that doesn't make phosgene.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting off track. Let's think about product E again. If E is phosgene, then its structure is planar with D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, another extremely hazardous product could be sarin gas, which has a structure with a chiral center, but its symmetry is lower, maybe C2v.

Wait, sarin is (OP(O)(CH2CH2O)3) something? No, sarin is a nerve agent with a structure that's not linear. Its symmetry group is probably low, like C2v.

Wait, but the options include D4h and D∞h. So, perhaps E is a linear molecule like phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), which has D∞h symmetry.

So, the answer would be option C) D∞h.

But wait, let me make sure. How is E formed?

If E is phosgene, then C would have to be something that when reacted with Cl2 gives phosgene. Alternatively, perhaps C is COCl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else. Let's think if C is a chlorinated compound.

Wait, another angle: Reaction of C with water gives two acids. Suppose C is CCl2O. Then, hydrolysis would give HCl (strong acid) and H2O (which is neutral, not an acid). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, C is CaCl2O. Hydrolysis would give HCl and CaO, but again, not matching two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. But carbonate plus water would give H2CO3 (weak acid) and the metal hydroxide, which is a base, not an acid.

Hmm, perhaps C is a sulfate. For instance, if C is CaSO4, then hydrolysis wouldn't produce two acids. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: If C is a nitride, like BN, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. If C is CS2, then hydrolysis would produce H2S (weak acid) and another acid. Wait, CS2 + H2O → H2S + H2SO3? Not sure about the stoichiometry.

But wait, the reaction of C with water gives A plus two acids. So, A must be a solid that's a product of that hydrolysis. If C is something like (RO)2S, then hydrolysis would produce H2S and ROH, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe C is a selenide or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should move on to the structure of E and its symmetry. If E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), then the symmetry group is D∞h. So the correct option would be C) D∞h.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on the given reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like mercury(II) oxide (HgO) or vanadium(V) oxide (V2O5). However, these do not align perfectly with the stoichiometry or subsequent reactions.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. This suggests E could be a highly reactive or toxic compound, such as phosgene (COCl2), which is planar and has a trigonal structure.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This implies C is likely a compound that hydrolyzes to yield acids, such as a sulfite or chlorinated compound. For example, if C were phosgene (COCl2), hydrolysis would yield HCl (strong acid) and H2CO3 (weak acid).

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests D and B could be gases like Cl2 and H2O, respectively, forming a solvent such as HCl or NH4OH. However, this does not directly affect the determination of E's symmetry.

5. **Symmetry of E**: If E is phosgene (COCl2), it has a planar trigonal structure with a linear arrangement of atoms. This corresponds to the molecular symmetry group **D∞h**, which includes a center of inversion and a C∞ axis.

Given the analysis, the most consistent interpretation is that E is phosgene (COCl2), which has **D∞h** symmetry.

Answer: C
