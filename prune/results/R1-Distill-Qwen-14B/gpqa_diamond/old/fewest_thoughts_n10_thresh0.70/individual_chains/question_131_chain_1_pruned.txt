Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's read through the question again and see what I can figure out.

The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. It undergoes dehydration to form an anhydride. The anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Hmm, 7 ppm is usually where aromatic protons show up, but wait, this is an anhydride. Oh, wait, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride, like a cyclic structure. Alternatively, maybe it's an acyclic anhydride but with something else causing that peak. Alternatively, perhaps the protons are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Wait, in the case of an anhydride, the carbonyl is adjacent to an oxygen. Could the peak at 7 ppm be some kind of conjugated system or maybe an exocyclic double bond?

Looking at the 13C NMR: two peaks, 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Carbonyl carbons are usually around 170-220 ppm. 165 could be a carbonyl (maybe a ketone or an anhydride). 137 ppm is more like a sp2 carbon, perhaps adjacent to the carbonyl. So maybe the anhydride has a structure where the carbonyl is at 165, and the double bond carbons (sp
