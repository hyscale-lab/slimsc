Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, it's about electrons and positrons colliding and producing photons. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact details.

So, the problem states: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, both annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is, what's the angle between these two photons?

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma for the electron is 4, and for the positron, it's 2. So I need to find their velocities or energies to use in the conservation laws.

I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum here. Since the system is isolated, the total energy and momentum before collision should equal the total after.

First, let's consider the rest masses. Electron and positron have the same mass, right? The rest mass energy is mc². For electron, mc² is about 0.511 MeV. But since they have different gamma factors, their total energies will be different.

Electron's total energy: E_e = gamma_e * m c² = 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV.
Positron's total energy: E_p = gamma_p * m c² = 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV.

So the total energy before collision is 2.044 + 1.022 = 3.066 MeV.

Momentum: For each particle, momentum p = gamma * m v. But since v is a significant fraction of c, I should use the relativistic momentum formula, which is p = gamma m v. Alternatively, another formula is p = (gamma m c²) / c² * v. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute using p = gamma m v, but I need to find v in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, another approach: since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), I can find v for each particle. Let me compute that.

For the electron with gamma_e =4:
1/(gamma_e²) = 1 - (v_e²)/(c²)
1/16 = 1 - (v_e²/c²)
v_e²/c² = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16 → v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c * (sqrt(15)/4) ≈ 0.9682 c.

Similarly, for the positron with gamma_p=2:
1/(4) = 1 - (v_p²/c²)
v_p²/c² = 3/4 → v_p = c * sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866 c.

Wait, but their directions are opposite. The electron is moving from left to right, and the positron from right to left. So their velocities are in opposite directions. For momentum, the electron's momentum is positive (say along +x), and the positron's is negative (along -x), but wait, wait—no. Wait, the positron is moving from the right, so if the electron is moving to the right (from left), the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, maybe I should assign directions. Let me set the coordinate system: positive x to the right. Electron is moving from left to right, so velocity v_e is positive. Positron is moving from right to left, so velocity is negative.

So the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 * m_e * v_e. Wait, but wait, in
