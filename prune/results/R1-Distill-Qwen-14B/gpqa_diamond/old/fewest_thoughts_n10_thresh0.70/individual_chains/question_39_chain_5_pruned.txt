Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle in a tube (x-axis direction). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A to D, with some numbers. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over that region.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Hmm, that looks a bit odd. Wait, is the wave function a complex number? Because it has an 'i' term. So the wave function ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh, wait, actually, the way it's written might be a bit ambiguous. Because sometimes, the real and imaginary parts are separated. So maybe ψ(x) is a complex function where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Or perhaps it's a different structure. Wait, perhaps it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by something else. Let me read the question again.

The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh, I think that's [a/(sqrt(1+x))] minus (0.5)i. So it's a complex number: the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-0.5)i.

Wait, but usually, the wave function is a complex function, but for the probability, we take the modulus squared, which is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So the probability density is |ψ(x)|²
