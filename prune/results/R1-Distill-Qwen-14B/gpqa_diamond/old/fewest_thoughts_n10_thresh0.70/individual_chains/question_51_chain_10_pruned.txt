Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in such systems often involves the interaction between charges. But let's think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem says a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. I'm supposed to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are given, so I'll need to figure out the formula.

First, I recall that when a conducting sphere is grounded, it allows charges to move freely on its surface and can conduct electricity. But wait, when you place a charge near a grounded conductor, the conductor will have induced charges. Oh right, the method of images might come into play here. The idea is that the induced charges can be thought of as image charges that create the same electric field as the actual induced charges.

Wait, but what about the potential energy? I think the potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charges. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, but the charge q placed outside will induce charges on the sphere.

Wait, the conducting sphere being grounded means it's at zero potential. So any excess charges on it would adjust to maintain that. When you bring a charge q near the sphere, the sphere will induce opposite charges on its surface. But since it's grounded, the induced charges can leave, but wait, no, because the conductor is neutral to begin with, and the induced charges would cause a redistribution. Hmm, maybe I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait,
