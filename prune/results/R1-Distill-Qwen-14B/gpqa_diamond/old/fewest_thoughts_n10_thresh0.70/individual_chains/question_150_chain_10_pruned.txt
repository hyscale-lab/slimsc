Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question involves identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then determining the final product after a series of reactions. Hmm, I need to think this through step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (3 double bonds equivalent), a carbonyl group (1), and maybe a double bond or ring. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring, an ester, and a double bond. Or a benzene ring, a carbonyl, and a ring or double bond.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Or maybe it's another group. Could it be an aromatic proton in a different environment? Hmm, not sure yet.

6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's around where aromatic protons are. Similarly, 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. So this looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets could be two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted structure. Wait, but each doublet is 2H. If it's para substitution, each set would have two protons, maybe as a doublet. Like two substituents in para positions. Or maybe it's a part of another structure.

Then 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, broad singlet suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH group, but it's two protons. Wait, but
