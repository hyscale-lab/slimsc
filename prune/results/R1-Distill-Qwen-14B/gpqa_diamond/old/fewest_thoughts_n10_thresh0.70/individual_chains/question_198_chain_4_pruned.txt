Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. I remember that stability constants are involved in complex formation. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β1 is for the first complex, probably [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 would be [Co(SCN)₂]^2−, and so on up to β4, which is [Co(SCN)₄]^4−. Wait, but wait, what are the actual charges? Cobalt is Co²+, right. Each SCN⁻ is a -1 charge. So:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ would be Co²+ plus one SCN⁻: 2+ + (-1) = +1. So formula is [Co(SCN)]⁺.
- [Co(SCN)₂]^0: 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So neutral complex.
- [Co(SCN)₃]^−: 2+ +3*(-1) = -1.
- [Co(SCN)₄]^2−: 2+ +4*(-1)= -2.

But wait, the question mentions "dithiocyanato" complexes. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN⁻ ligands. So I think that refers to the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 complex, which is the second complex, β2=40.

Wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I remember that in cobalt complexes, the different colored complexes are due to different ligand field strengths. For example, [Co(SCN)]+ is pink, [Co(SCN)₂] is blue, [Co(SCN)₃]^3− is green, etc. So the blue one is [Co(SCN)₂]^0, which is the second complex with β2=40.

So I need to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] among all Co species.

The approach here is to calculate the fraction of each complex and then sum up the percentages. Since there are four complexes, each with their own formation constants, I need to calculate each one's concentration relative to the others.

But wait, the formation constants are given as β1, β2, etc. Let me recall that the formation constant (β) for an n-th complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal ion and n ligands.

The general approach is to calculate the
