Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think this through.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. So, it's something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but wait, no, wait—no, because it has a cis-alkene. Oh right, so maybe it's more like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH isn't right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, a cis-alkene would be like a double bond with the two substituents on the same side. So, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH no, wait, but that's a single bond. Wait, no, it's a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOH? Wait, no, that would make the double bond in the middle. Wait, but wait, for a cis-alkene, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond would be on the same side. So maybe it's a four-carbon chain with two COOH groups at each end and a double bond in the middle. So HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH? No, that can't be because that would be a five-carbon chain, right? Wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH but that's a single bond. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, no, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So perhaps it's something like HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH. Wait, that would have four carbons between the two COOH groups, but the double bond is in the middle. So, when this is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride by losing water. So, the reaction would form an anhydride from the two carboxylic acid groups.

Wait, but the product is an anhydride. When you dehydrate a dicarboxylic acid, you lose water and form an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride would typically have the two carboxylic acid groups connected by an oxygen bridge.

Wait, the anhydride has a single peak in its 1H NMR at 7 ppm. 7 ppm is upfield for protons; maybe it's an aromatic proton? Or, wait, 7 ppm for alkenes? No, alkenes are usually around 5 ppm. Hmm. Wait, what else is around 7 ppm? Maybe an amine proton? But the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid, so probably not. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system with an electron-withdrawing group, like an anhydride. Wait, but in an anhydride, the oxygen is around 170 ppm in the carbonyl. But wait, the 13C NMR shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Oh, 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to a double bond, maybe a vinyl carbon. 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl carbon. So perhaps the anhydride has a double bond.

Wait, wait, the dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. So when it dehydrates, maybe the double bond is retained, perhaps forming a cyclic anhydride. Wait, but dehydration of a diacid with a double bond could form a cyclic anhydride. For example, if the cis-alkene is in the middle, when the two COOH groups lose a water each, perhaps the structure becomes a cyclic anhydride with a double bond. So, maybe it's a six-membered ring, like for maleic anhydride. Wait, maleic anhydride is based on a cis-dicarboxylic acid. So maleic anhydride has a structure where the two carbonyls are connected in a ring with a double bond.

Wait, so the anhydride in this problem has a single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR. Maleic anhydride, for instance, has two sets of equivalent protons, but perhaps in this case, the anhydride is symmetric in some way, leading to a single proton peak. Alternatively, maybe there's a single type of proton. But wait, in maleic anhydride, the protons are on the same side because of the cis arrangement, and they're equivalent, so they give a singlet. So maybe in this anhydride, the two protons are equivalent and hence give a single peak. That would make sense with a single peak at 7 ppm.

So the structure of the anhydride is something like a bicyclic structure, but more likely a six-membered ring. Hmm.

Then, the anhydride is reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Wait, that's a diene. So the reaction is probably a Diels-Alder reaction. The anhydride is likely the dienophile here.

So, the dienophile is the anhydride, and the diene is the cyclopentadiene.

So when they react, they form a Diels-Alder adduct. The product would be a six-membered ring with substituents from the diene and the dienophile.

But the problem states that two products are formed: a major and a minor. So perhaps the reaction can proceed through different transition states, leading to different stereoisomers.

Wait, but the diene is tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let me draw that. So the cyclopentadiene has the structure where positions 1,2,3,4 are all methyl groups. So it's a cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups. Wait, no, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl would mean that each of those positions has a methyl group. So the structure is cyclopentene with four methyl substituents at positions 1,2,3,4. Hmm, perhaps it's a conjugated diene with substituents in a way that makes it a good diene for Diels-Alder.

Wait, but the dienophile is an anhydride, which is a good dienophile. So the Diels-Alder reaction would form a six-membered ring with substituents from both reactants.

So the product would have the substituents from the diene (which is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl) and the dienophile (the anhydride). So the major and minor products probably differ in the stereochemistry of the adduct.

Wait, but the question is about the NOESY NMR spectra of the products. The major product has a cross-peak, and the minor doesn't. NOESY detects through-space proximity of protons. So in the major product, certain protons are close to each other, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum.

The question is, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

Looking at the options, they all describe different proton signals.

So first, let me think about the Diels-Alder adduct structure. When the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene) reacts with the anhydride, the adduct will have two ester groups (from the anhydride) attached to the six-membered ring, and four methyl groups from the diene.

Wait, but the anhydride is a cyclic anhydride, perhaps similar to maleic anhydride. So when it reacts as a dienophile, the two carbonyl groups would form two ester groups in the Diels-Alder product.

So the product would have a six-membered ring with two ester substituents and four methyl groups attached.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, so when it undergoes Diels-Alder, the substituents (methyl groups) would end up in specific positions on the six-membered ring.

The Diels-Alder reaction typically forms two new sigma bonds, and the endo rule suggests that the more substituted positions are favored, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, the major and minor products likely result from different diastereomers or perhaps from different regiochemistry, but more likely from stereochemistry in the transition state.

Wait, but the NOESY cross-peak implies that certain protons are close in space. So perhaps in the major product, the methyl groups are positioned in a way that some are near each other, leading to a cross-peak.

Looking at the options, the options describe different types of proton environments.

Option A: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. So 6H singlet would likely be from equivalent methyl groups, maybe attached to the same carbon. The 1H doublet would be from a proton attached to a neighboring carbon, perhaps.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. Hmm, 6H singlet might be from two equivalent methyl groups (each with 3H) but wait, 6H would be two methyl groups each with three H. Wait, but a singlet for 6H would mean all are equivalent, perhaps from two identical methyl groups on adjacent carbons. The 2H singlet could be from a CH2 group, perhaps next to an oxygen, like an ester group.

Option C: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. So perhaps two sets of equivalent methyl groups. Maybe the methyl groups from the diene, in two different environments.

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. So a doublet for one proton, maybe from a CH group, and a singlet for a CH2 group.

But wait, our product after Diels-Alder would have more complexity. Let's think about the structure.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. When it reacts with the dienophile (anhydride), the Diels-Alder adduct would have substituents from the diene and the dienophile.

The diene has four methyl groups, so in the adduct, those four methyl groups would be attached to the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, but the diene is cyclopentadiene, so when it reacts, it forms a six-membered ring. The substituents (methyl groups) would end up in positions 1,2,3,4 on the cyclopentadiene, which, after the reaction, would correspond to positions on the cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps the adduct would have two ester groups (from the dienophile) attached at positions 5 and 6, and four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the adduct would have the substituents from the diene on the same face, leading to different stereochemistry.

But the NOESY is about the spatial proximity of protons. So, in the major product, certain protons that are adjacent in space would show a cross-peak.

Wait, perhaps the product has a bridged bicyclic structure? No, probably not, because Diels-Alder typically forms a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic anhydride like maleic anhydride, which upon Diels-Alder reaction would form a six-membered ring with two ester groups.

Wait, the product would have two ester groups (from the anhydride) and four methyl groups (from the diene) arranged in a specific way.

Wait, in the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state is usually favored, but I'm not sure if that affects the NOESY here.

So, if the major product has a certain configuration where some methyl groups are close to each other, that would cause a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Looking at the options, let's think about the possible signals.

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm. That's likely from two methyl groups (each 3H) in a symmetric environment. The doublet at 1.5 ppm would be a proton adjacent to these methyls.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm, which could be two methyl groups, and a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm, perhaps from an OCH2 group. But wait, the product has two ester groups, so maybe an OCH2 isn't present. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of the ring.

Option C: Two singlets at 1 ppm and 1.7 ppm, each 6H. That would be two sets of two methyl groups each, maybe in different environments.

Option D: Doublet and a singlet, possibly from a CH and a CH2 group.

Wait, in the Diels-Alder product, the ring would have four methyl groups from the diene and two ester groups. The four methyl groups would be on four adjacent carbons of the six-membered ring.

So, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene ring with four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4, and two ester groups at positions 5 and 6.

Wait, but the positions would be such that the substituents are on adjacent carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the ester groups are at positions 5 and 6, which are across from each other.

But let's think about the environment of the protons.

In the major product, perhaps two of the methyl groups are close together in space, leading their protons to be near each other, hence a cross-peak in the NOESY.

If the four methyl groups are at positions 1,2,3,4 on the cyclohexene ring, then adjacent ones (like 1 and 2) would be next to each other. So the methyl groups at positions 1 and 2 might be in close proximity, leading to a cross-peak between their protons.

But wait, the options don't directly describe this. Let's see.

Option A is a 6H singlet at 1 ppm and a 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm. Well, a 6H singlet would be two methyl groups (3H each) that are equivalent. So perhaps the two methyl groups at positions 1 and 2 are equivalent, which would be possible if the ring is symmetric.

Wait, but if the product is symmetric, perhaps the substituents are arranged so that some of the methyl groups are equivalent.

Alternatively, the 6H singlet might represent two methyl groups that are adjacent. Wait, but in a Diels-Alder adduct, the substituents from the diene are in a certain arrangement. For example, if the diene is tetramethyl, then in the adduct, the substituents would be on the same face of the ring, perhaps leading to a boat-like structure or a chair conformation where some methyl groups are close.

Wait, but in the Diels-Alder product, the four methyl groups would be on the same face of the ring, as the diene is conjugated and the reaction is suprafacial. So in the cyclohexene ring, the four methyl groups would be on the same face, perhaps leading to a boat conformation.

In that case, the methyl groups at positions 1 and 2 would be adjacent on the same face, making their protons near each other. So their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak in NOESY.

But looking at the options, which option connects two protons that are close in space?

Option A: 6H singlet (maybe two methyl groups) and a 1H doublet (a single proton). So if the 6H is two equivalent methyl groups, and the 1H is a proton adjacent to them, then they would be near each other.

But wait, in the Diels-Alder product, each methyl group is attached to a carbon adjacent to another methyl. So perhaps the 1H is a proton attached to a carbon between two methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the two methyl groups are on the same carbon. No, that's not possible. Each methyl is on a separate carbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR signals.

In the 1H NMR of the major product, which has a cross-peak, the cross-peak connects two signals.

The signals could be, for example, two methyl groups that are close in space, but that would require a cross-peak between them. Alternatively, a methyl group and an adjacent proton.

Looking at the options, option A has a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet. So maybe the 6H is two methyl groups attached to a carbon, but that's not possible. Alternatively, the 6H could be two equivalent methyl groups, perhaps on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but if they're on adjacent carbons, their protons might not be close enough to cause a cross-peak. Alternatively, maybe a geminal group, but that would be the same carbon, which would cause splitting, not a separate peak.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about what a Diels-Alder adduct would look like. Let me imagine the structure.

The dienophile is the anhydride. So, when it reacts with the diene, the two carbonyl groups from the anhydride become two ester groups in the adduct. The diene contributes four methyl groups.

So, the product is a six-membered ring with four methyl groups (from the diene) and two ester groups (from the dienophile) attached.

Now, in the Diels-Alder adduct, the positions of the substituents are such that the diene's substituents (methyl groups) are on the same face as the dienophile's substituents (the ester groups).

So, in the cyclohexene ring, the substituents (methyl groups) are in a transannular arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the product has a chair conformation. In that case, axial and equatorial positions are possible. If the methyl groups are equatorial, they would be farther apart, but if axial, perhaps some are closer.

But the presence of a cross-peak in the NOESY suggests that the protons are in close proximity, which would happen if they are on adjacent carbons and in a similar spatial arrangement.

Wait, but the 6H singlet in option A would imply that all six protons are equivalent. That would only happen if the two methyl groups are in equivalent environments, perhaps due to symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: the anhydride is symmetric, so the Diels-Alder adduct would have certain symmetry as well. For example, if the adduct is symmetric across a plane, then certain protons would be equivalent.

Alternatively, if the product has a plane of symmetry, the methyl groups on either side would be equivalent, leading to a singlet.

Hmm. So, perhaps the 6H singlet comes from two methyl groups that are equivalent due to the symmetry of the molecule.

If that's the case, the two methyl groups would be in identical environments, making their protons equivalent. Then, the 1H doublet would be a proton adjacent to one of these methyl groups.

So, in the NOESY, the cross-peak would connect the 6H singlet (two methyl groups) to the 1H doublet (a proton next to them).

But wait, a singlet integrating 6H would mean either two separate groups each with 3H, but as a singlet. So, for example, two methyl groups (each 3H) in identical environments. So, perhaps they're on adjacent carbons but in a symmetric arrangement.

Wait, but the product is a cyclohexene, so perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that two methyl groups are adjacent and equivalent due to the symmetry of the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the 6H is from a single methyl group split into multiple environments, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the 6H is from two sets of three equivalent protons each. No, that wouldn't make sense either.

Alternatively, maybe the 6H is from a single methyl group, but that's not possible because a methyl group has three protons.

Wait, perhaps the 6H is from two methyl groups that are in equivalent environments, such as being across a plane of symmetry.

So, if the molecule is symmetric, two methyl groups would be equivalent, each contributing 3H, so the singlet would integrate to 6H.

In that case, the 6H singlet would be from two methyl groups, each with 3H, which are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.

The 1H doublet would be a proton that's next to one of these methyl groups.

So, in the NOESY, the cross-peak would be between this proton and one of the methyl protons.

Wait, but the options A and C involve 6H singlets. Option A also has a 1H doublet, and option C has another 6H singlet.

Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck on the specifics. Maybe I should consider the NOESY implications. The cross-peak in the major product implies that two protons are near each other in space.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the four methyl groups are on adjacent carbons. So, perhaps two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons, but in the major product, the conformation brings the protons of these methyl groups close to each other.

Wait, but in a ring structure, if the methyl groups are on adjacent carbons, their protons might be close, but in a chair conformation, axial and equatorial positions could affect this.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-peak connects a methyl group's protons to a proton on another substituent, like an ester group.

Wait, the ester groups would have oxygen and carbonyl groups, but their protons would be near the ring.

Let me think about the other part of the question: the 13C NMR of the anhydride. It has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The 137 ppm is likely a carbon adjacent to a double bond, as vinyl carbons are around 120-140 ppm. 165 ppm is a carbonyl carbon, probably from the anhydride.

So the anhydride has a double bond, which would make it a good dienophile.

Back to the products. The products after Diels-Alder have the formula C13H16O3. Let me check the molecular formula.

The dienophile is the anhydride. Let's see: a dicarboxylic acid, say HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH, when dehydrated, becomes a cyclic anhydride. Each COOH group contributes (CO)O, so the anhydride would have formula, say, (CO)2O plus the rest from the alkene.

Wait, but perhaps the specific formula isn't as important here.

So the product after Diels-Alder has C13H16O3. The dienophile (anhydride) would contribute certain carbons, and the diene contributes others.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. Its formula is C9H12. Because the cyclopentadiene has five carbons, and four methyl groups (each CH3) adds four carbons, so 5 +4 =9 carbons. Hydrogens: cyclopentadiene has 8 H (since each double bond in a diene has 4 H in the ring). Each methyl adds 3 H, four methyls add 12 H. So total H is 8 + 12 =20? No, wait, the diene structure is cyclopentadiene, which is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Wait, no, cyclopentadiene is more accurately a five-membered ring with two double bonds? No, wait, cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene. So the structure is cyclopentane with two double bonds as a conjugated diene. So the formula would be C5H6 for cyclopentadiene. But wait, when it's 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, each methyl adds a CH3 group. So four methyl groups would add 4*(CH3) =4C and 12H. So the formula of the diene would be C5+4=9 C and H: 6 (from C5H6) + 12 (from CH3 groups)=18 H. So the diene is C9H18? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, cyclopentadiene is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each has 3H): 4 * 3 =12. So total H is 6 + 12 =18. So the diene is C9H18. The anhydride, if it's derived from a four-carbon diacid, would be (HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH) losing two H2O to form an anhydride. The formula of the diacid would be C4H6O4. Losing two H2O (which is H4O2), the anhydride would be C4H4O3.

So the dienophile is C4H4O3, the diene is C9H18. So the product would be C4+9=13 C, H:4 (from dienophile) +18 (diene) - 4 (from removing two H2O molecules in Diels-Alder) → 4+18-4=18 H? Wait, no, the Diels-Alder adds four H (each diene has four H in the conjugated diene). Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The Diels-Alder reaction is [4+2] cycloaddition, so in terms of H, the diene (4 π electrons, 4 H) and the dienophile (2 π electrons, 2 H) combine to form a six-membered ring with eight H (from the diene and dienophile). Wait, perhaps the exact H count is getting complicated, but the product's formula is given as C13H16O3.

So the product has 13 C, 16 H, and 3 O. Which fits with the dienophile (4 C, O3) and diene (9 C, H18) minus 4 H (since two H2O are released? Wait, no, in Diels-Alder, the reaction is [4+2], so perhaps four H from the diene and two from the dienophile? Wait, not sure. But the product's formula is given, so perhaps I don't need to dwell on that.

So, back to the NMR. The major product has a cross-peak in the NOESY. So, which two protons are close?

Option A: 6H singlet and 1H doublet. So, maybe the 6H is two methyl groups, and the 1H is a proton adjacent to them.

If the 6H comes from two methyl groups that are adjacent and equivalent, then their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

But why would the 1H be a doublet? Because it's adjacent to a CH group with two protons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 6H is from two methyl groups that are across from each other on the ring, but because of the symmetry, they are equivalent. Then, a proton that's adjacent to one of them would have a doublet due to coupling with a neighboring proton.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: the NOESY cross-peak in the major product is between which two protons? Let's think about the possible diastereomers.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state is favored, leading to the substituents being on the same face. So, the four methyl groups would be on the same face of the ring. Thus, any protons on these methyl groups that are on the same face would be close in space.

So, for example, if two methyl groups are adjacent and both on the same face, their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

So, in the 1H NMR, the two methyl groups would show up as a singlet (if equivalent) and the adjacent proton would be a doublet (coupled with another proton).

Looking at option A: 6H singlet and 1H doublet. So perhaps the 6H is two methyl groups, and the 1H is a proton on the adjacent carbon.

But wait, adjacent methyl groups would have their protons close, leading to a cross-peak between the 6H and the 1H.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H is from two methyl groups that are not adjacent but are on the same face, making their protons close in space.

Wait, but in a six-membered ring, if two methyl groups are across from each other, their protons would be far apart. So, perhaps the 6H comes from two methyl groups that are adjacent and equivalent.

So, the 1H doublet would be a proton on the same carbon as one of the methyl groups, but wait, that can't be because each methyl is on a separate carbon.

Wait, perhaps the 1H is on a neighboring carbon, making it adjacent. So, the 1H is a proton on a carbon next to a methyl group.

So, the cross-peak would be between the 6H singlet (two methyl groups) and a proton next to them.

In the NMR, the 6H singlet is at ~1 ppm, which is typical for methyl groups attached to carbons, perhaps in an alkyl environment.

The 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm would be a proton adjacent to the methyl groups, perhaps a CH2 group.

Wait, but if it's a doublet, it's coupling with another proton. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH group with two neighboring H.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from two methyl groups that are para to each other on the ring and thus are equivalent. The 1H doublet could be from an axial proton near one of the methyl groups.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, the question specifies that the cross-peak is present in the major product but not the minor. So, the major product likely has a certain conformation where the protons are closer, and the minor product doesn't.

In the Diels-Alder reaction, the endo rule says that the more substituted (or bulky) groups are placed inside the transition state, leading to a specific stereochemistry in the product. The endo transition state is more favorable, so the major product would have the substituents (like the ester groups) on the same face as the methyl groups.

This leads to the substituents being on the same face, so in the product, the ester groups and methyl groups are on the same face of the ring. This would lead to certain spatial arrangements between the protons.

So, in the major product, certain methyl groups and other protons would be close in space, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Looking at the options, the one that connects a 6H singlet (two equivalent methyl groups) and a 1H doublet (a proton next to them) would make sense.

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.

Alternatively, maybe the 6H is from a single methyl group split into multiple environments, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another possibility: the anhydride is maleic anhydride. When it reacts with a diene, the product would have the two ester groups on adjacent carbons. The Diels-Alder adduct would have two ester groups and four methyl groups.

In that case, the ester groups would be on carbons adjacent to each other, and the methyl groups would be on the other four carbons.

So, if the four methyl groups are on the same face, the two methyl groups on carbons 1 and 2 would be adjacent, and their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

In the 1H NMR, the two methyl groups (each 3H) would be a singlet if they're equivalent. Wait, but they're on adjacent carbons, so unless the molecule is symmetric, they wouldn't be equivalent. So, perhaps each methyl group is a singlet, but together, their integrals might add up, but that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the ring, making the two methyl groups equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H comes from two methyl groups that are across from each other but due to symmetry are equivalent.

Hmm.

Alternatively, if the product is a bicyclic structure, but I think that's not the case here.

Wait, going back to the options. The cross-peak is between two resonances in the 1H NMR. So, the question is, in the major product, which two signals (each from a set of protons) are close enough to show a cross-peak.

Option B is 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm might be from an OCH2 group. But the product has ester groups, not OCH2. So perhaps this is not the case.

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. So, a doublet and a singlet. Perhaps the 2H is from a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ester.

But wait, the product has two ester groups. So, maybe the 2H is from an OCH2 group, but that's not part of the product. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 group in the ring.

Alternatively, the 2H could be from a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an oxygen, like an ester.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the 1H doublet in option A is at ~1.5 ppm, which is upfield for a CH proton. Maybe it's attached to an electronegative atom, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, it's a proton on a carbon next to an oxygen, leading to deshielding.

Alternatively, the 1H is a bridgehead proton or something similar.

I think I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the possible structures.

The product is a Diels-Alder adduct with four methyl groups and two ester groups. The ester groups are at positions 5 and 6 (assuming the ring is numbered such that the diene contributes positions 1-4).

In the major product, due to the endo rule, the ester groups are on the same face as the methyl groups.

So, in the chair conformation, the methyl groups are equatorial, and the ester groups are axial. Wait, but no, that depends on the substituents' size.

Alternatively, the ester groups are axial, and the methyl groups are equatorial.

But regardless, in the major product, the methyl groups are on the same face as each other.

So, any two methyl groups adjacent on the same face would have their protons close, leading to a cross-peak in NOESY.

So, for example, the methyl groups on positions 1 and 2 would be adjacent and on the same face. So their protons would be close.

In the 1H NMR, the two methyl groups (each 3H) would be a singlet if they're equivalent. But in reality, they're on adjacent carbons, so unless the ring has a plane of symmetry, they wouldn't be equivalent. So, perhaps each is a singlet, but that doesn't combine into a 6H singlet.

Wait, but if the ring has a plane of symmetry, perhaps the methyl groups on positions 1 and 2 are mirrored, making them equivalent. So their protons would be equivalent, leading to a 6H singlet.

In that case, the 6H singlet would be from these two methyl groups. Then, a proton adjacent to them (say, on position 3) would be a doublet, perhaps.

But I'm not certain about that.

Looking back at the options, I think option A is the most plausible. So, the cross-peak is between a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet.

So, the answer would be option A.


The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to form a cyclic anhydride. This anhydride is then subjected to a Diels-Alder reaction with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, yielding two products (a major and a minor product) with the molecular formula C13H16O3. The major product exhibits a cross-peak in its 2D NOESY NMR spectrum, while the minor product does not. The task is to determine which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Anhydride**:  
   The dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene dehydrates to form a cyclic anhydride. The 1H NMR spectrum of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR spectrum shows peaks at 137 ppm (likely a vinyl carbon) and 165 ppm (likely a carbonyl carbon). This suggests the anhydride is likely a six-membered cyclic structure, such as maleic anhydride, with a double bond retained.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**:  
   The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene as the diene. The reaction forms a six-membered ring in the major product, with four methyl groups contributed by the diene and two ester groups contributed by the anhydride. The major product is favored due to the endo rule, where substituents (methyl groups and ester groups) are on the same face of the ring.

3. **NOESY Cross-Peak in the Major Product**:  
   The cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum indicates through-space proximity of two protons. In the major product, the four methyl groups are positioned on the same face of the ring due to the endo stereochemistry. This spatial arrangement brings certain protons into close proximity, leading to the cross-peak.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.  
     The 6H singlet likely corresponds to two equivalent methyl groups, while the 1H doublet corresponds to a proton adjacent to one of these methyl groups. This arrangement is consistent with the spatial proximity of protons in the major product due to the endo stereochemistry.  
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.  
     The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could correspond to an OCH2 group, but the product does not contain such a group. This option is unlikely.  
   - **Option C**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.  
     This would imply two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups, but the major product does not have such symmetry. This option is unlikely.  
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.  
     The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could correspond to a CH2 group, but the major product does not have such a group in a position that would explain the cross-peak. This option is unlikely.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation for the cross-peak in the major product is between a 6H singlet (two equivalent methyl groups) and a 1H doublet (a proton adjacent to one of these methyl groups). This corresponds to **Option A**.
