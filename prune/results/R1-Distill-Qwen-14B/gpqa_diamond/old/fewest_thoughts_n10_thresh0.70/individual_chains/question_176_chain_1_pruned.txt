Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think it through. Alright, the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. The system's state is given as a column matrix, and we have the matrices for P and Q. The task is to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's start from the basics. So, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator. And the probability of each outcome depends on the eigenvectors.

First, let's parse the given information. The system's state at time t is a column vector: (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, but usually quantum states are normalized, right? So I should check if this vector is normalized. The norm would be the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. 1+4+1 =6, so the norm is sqrt(6). So to normalize it, the state vector would be 1/sqrt(6) times each component. So the actual state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T. I need to remember that for calculations.

Next, the operator P has a matrix with first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, I should look for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. But wait, since we're measuring P first, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities depend on the projection of the state onto those eigenvectors.

Similarly, Q's matrix is diagonal: first row (1,0,0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-1). So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1. Oh, because it's diagonal, the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. So the eigenvector for eigenvalue
