Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are then passed through several tubes, and some weights are recorded. The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are given as A) 13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I'll try to parse the problem carefully.

The setup involves heating two salts, A and B. The fact that it's equimolar and the total mass is 7.20g suggests that the moles of each salt are the same. Let me note that down.

Then, the gases produced are passed through three tubes: Mg(ClO4)2 (tube 1), Ca(OH)2 solution (tube 2), and red-hot copper (tube 3). The results are:

- Tube 1 gained 3.60g.
- Tube 3 gained 0.80g (CuO formed).
- Tube 2's weight didn't change.
- The remaining gas is 2.24 liters at standard temp and pressure (STP).

Wait, so the gases are passed through these tubes in order. Let me think about what each tube does.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can trap moisture. So, maybe it's absorbing water? Or perhaps it's reacting with certain gases. Alternatively, Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb water vapor, turning into Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O. So, if the gas has water vapor, it would be absorbed here. The weight increase of 3.60g would be the mass of the absorbed water. Or wait, no. Wait, Mg(ClO4)2 reacts with water to form Mg(ClO4)2·8H2O? Or does it just absorb the water of crystallization? Hmm, maybe the Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, so when it comes into contact with water, it may form hydrates. Alternatively, perhaps it's in the presence of moisture that the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it as water vapor. So, if the gas has H2O, the Mg(ClO4)2 would trap it, increasing the tube's weight by the mass of water.

So, the 3.60g increase in tube 1 is the mass of H2O from the gases. So, the gas mixture contains H2O, which is captured here.

Next, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. So, if the gas mixture contains CO2, it would react with the Ca(OH)2 solution, forming CaCO3 and water. So, the weight of tube 2 wouldn't change because CO2 is being absorbed. But the problem states that the weight didn't change
