Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking about the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point r and time t. The charge q is moving with a trajectory s(t), and we're interested in the fields at a time t where t is greater than tr, the time when the field was generated. Oh right, tr is the earlier time when the charge was at the position that created the field we're observing now.

So, the setup involves retarded time. Because the electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, the fields at point r and time t depend on the position and velocity of the charge at an earlier time tr, which is such that the light would take (r - s(tr)) distance to reach r. But maybe I don't need to get into that detail here.

Wait, the problem gives me some vectors. Vector d is the vector from the field generating point (where the charge was at time tr) to the observation point r. So d is r minus s(tr), I think. And the velocity v is the velocity of the charge at time tr.

The options are four possible sets of expressions for V and A. Let me recall the expressions for the potentials in the context of a moving charge.

From what I remember, the scalar potential V due to a charge q is similar to the static case, but with a correction due to the motion. The static scalar potential is q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, you have to consider the retarded time. But wait, in the options, some have terms with c and v and d.

The vector potential A is another matter. For a charge at rest, A is zero if it's static because the current is zero. But when the charge is moving, it produces a current, so A would be non-zero.

Wait, the general expressions for potentials in electrodynamics are:

The scalar potential V is given by the retarded potential formula. For a charge moving with velocity v, the scalar potential is (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/(r') ] where r' is the distance from the charge's position at tr to r. But r' is equal to d (

Okay, so I've got this question about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a given point and time. The setup involves a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r.

Wait, so d is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to r. And tr is earlier than time t we're considering. So the charge was at position s(tr) at time tr, and we're looking at the fields at time t, which is after that.

I remember that potentials in electromagnetism are calculated based on the retarded time concept because the effects travel at the speed of light. Oh yeah, because information can't travel faster than light, so the fields at a later time depend on where the charge was some time ago.

So, for a moving charge, the potentials are given by retarded expressions. The scalar potential V is typically due to the charge, and the vector potential A is due to its motion.

Wait, the scalar potential V for a static charge would be (q)/(4πε₀ r), right? But when the charge is moving, maybe there's a correction because of the motion. Or perhaps it's the same because the scalar potential is from the charge itself.

But wait, when charges move, they produce both electric and magnetic fields. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field. Or is it the other way around? I think the electric field E is the gradient of V plus the time derivative of A. And the magnetic field B is the curl of A.

So, for a stationary charge, V is (q)/(4πε₀ r) and A is zero because there's no current. But when the charge is moving, A becomes non-zero.

The question is about the potentials at time t, for t > tr. So, the charge has moved, but we're considering the fields due to the charge's position and velocity at time tr.

I think the expressions for V and A when the charge is moving are more complicated because of the retarded time. Let me try to recall the formula.
