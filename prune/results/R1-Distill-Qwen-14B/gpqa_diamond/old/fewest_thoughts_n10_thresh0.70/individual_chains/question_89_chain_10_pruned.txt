Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me go through it slowly because I'm still a bit new to these concepts.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break down each step and see what's happening.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's pretty rigid. The dibromine groups are on adjacent carbons, maybe? Or maybe not adjacent. The structure of adamantane is a bit unclear to me, but I think it's a cage-like structure with multiple rings. Anyway, moving on.

Step one: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and since it's heated, this likely leads to an elimination reaction. When two bromine atoms are present on adjacent carbons (vicinal dihalides), treatment with a strong base like KOH typically causes dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene via the E2 mechanism. So I think the product here would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The IR spectrum shows a strong peak around 1720 cm⁻¹, which is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O). Hmm, that's interesting. Oh wait, maybe it's not elimination but some kind of substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a Dieckmann elimination? No, that's for esters. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a diene, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. Wait, could this be a case where two bromides are eliminated and a ketone is formed? Or perhaps an oxidation?

Wait, no, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Oh, wait, maybe it's more about the structure. Adamantane has four equivalent bridges. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two non-adjacent bridgeheads. So when heated with KOH, perhaps the bromides undergo elimination, forming a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are usually not possible due to Bredt's rule, which says that double bonds are not allowed at bridgehead positions because of the strain and unfavorable geometry. So that can't be right. So maybe instead, the reaction is a substitution, but with two bromides, perhaps it's a double substitution.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think about the IR. The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is probably a ketone. So maybe the product is a diketone, but that would require oxidation. Or maybe it's an epoxide? No, the IR for an epoxide would show a peak around 1200-1300 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned here.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe KOH is causing an elimination to form a carbonyl group. Oh, wait, when vicinal dihalides undergo dehydrohalogenation, they form alkenes. If the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, removing them would form a double bond. But in this case, the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's an oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or another kind of elimination that forms a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is dehydrohalogenated to form a ketone via a different pathway.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is 1,3-dibromo-1-adamantane. So if KOH is used, it might lead to a substitution. Wait, but with two leaving groups, perhaps a double elimination. If both Br atoms are on the same carbon, but that doesn't seem to make sense for 1,3 positions. Alternatively, maybe each
