Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is an emission line in the ultraviolet spectrum of hydrogen. It's the transition from the first excited state (n=2) to the ground state (n=1), and its wavelength is about 121.6 nanometers, which is the same as 1216 Angstroms. Right, because 1 nanometer is 10 Angstroms.

Now, when a quasar's light passes through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs some of that light. The absorption line observed would be at the rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms, but if the cloud is moving away from us (or if the universe is expanding so that the cloud is at a higher redshift), that wavelength will be stretched, moving into longer wavelengthsâ€”redshifted.

Wait, but the question is about detecting these clouds using optical ground-based telescopes. So, optical telescopes operate in the visible spectrum, right? Visible light ranges from about 400 to 700 nanometers, or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So if the Lyman alpha absorption is happening at 1216 Angstroms, but we can only detect it if it's shifted into the optical range.

Wait, no. Wait a second. If the quasar emits light that passes through a neutral hydrogen cloud, the cloud absorbs light at the quasar's rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms. But because the cloud is at a certain redshift, the observed wavelength would be longer. So, to be detected in optical (which is longer than 400 nm or 4000 Angstroms), the observed Lyman alpha line must be in the optical range.

So, the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms in its own
