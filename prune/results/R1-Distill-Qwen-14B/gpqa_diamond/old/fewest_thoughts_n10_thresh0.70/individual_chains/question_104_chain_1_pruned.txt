Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. 

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with masses similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The key data points are the periodic shifts in their spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The size of the shift depends on the mass of the planet and its orbital period, I think. But I'm not exactly sure about the formula.

Wait, the RV method relates to the semi-amplitude of the velocity, K. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (some factors). But since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, M_p is negligible, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, both stars are similar to the Sun, so M_star is the same for both. So the denominator will have M_star^(1/3) and P^(1/3).

So for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3)) )^(some power). Wait, let me think. The formula for K is ( (2πG) / (c) ) * ( M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

I remember that the formula is K = ( (27 * pi) / (2 * c ) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but I might be overcomplicating. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (Neptune), sin i is about 1 because we're assuming edge-on orbits (since otherwise, we wouldn't detect them with RV). So, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. Let me look for the correct formula.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1
