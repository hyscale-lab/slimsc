Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think it through. Alright, let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, there's this uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. I need to find the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both l and L are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity, I think that would induce some charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, right, when a charge is inside a conductor's cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor was initially neutral, the outer surface must then have an equal positive charge, right?

Wait, no, wait. The conductor itself is neutral. When you put a positive charge +q inside the cavity, it will induce a -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor's total charge was zero, the outer surface must have a +q charge to balance it out. So the conductor's outer surface has +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field there should be due to the charges on the conductor. But wait, how does the charge distribution affect the field outside?

I remember Gauss's Law here. For a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the enclosed charge would be the sum of the charges on the conductor. Oh wait, the conductor is neutral, right? No, wait, the conductor had an induced +q on its outer surface. So the total charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface outside would be +q.

Wait, no. Wait a second. The conductor itself is neutral. Wait, the initial conductor is neutral. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, so the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's initial charge was zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q. So the total charge on the outer surface is +q.

So when considering a point outside the conductor (which is at a distance L from the center, larger than R), the electric field would depend on the total charge outside the Gaussian surface, which is +q.

But wait, the Gaussian surface is a sphere centered where? Probably centered at the conductor's center. So the Gaussian surface would enclose the conductor, which has a net charge of +q (from the outer surface). So the electric field outside the conductor at a distance L would be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center.

Wait, but the charge is on the outer surface of the conductor. So for points outside, the field is as if the charge were a point charge at the center. So the field E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². That would be option B.

Wait, but wait a moment. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. But the cavity's center is offset by s from the conductor's center. And the point P's distance from the cavity's center is l, with an angle theta between l and s. So does that affect anything?

Hmm. Oh, because the charge is inside the cavity, but the conductor's outer surface charge is spread uniformly? Or is it not? Wait, in a conductor, charges on the outer surface would distribute themselves based on the external fields. But the cavity's charge is inside, so the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q.

Wait, but in the case of a conductor with a cavity, the field inside the conductor is zero. So any charges on the inner surface would adjust to shield the conductor's interior. But for the outer surface, the field outside would depend only on the total charge on the outer surface.

Wait, but if the conductor is a sphere, then the outer surface charge will distribute uniformly, right? So the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge of the conductor, not on where the cavity is placed.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor's shape isn't a perfect sphere because the cavity is off-center. So perhaps the outer surface isn't uniform. But wait, no, the conductor is a spherical conductor. Oh, wait, the conductor itself is a sphere of radius R, but the cavity is a smaller sphere inside it, not at the center. So the conductor's inner surface is a sphere of radius r_cavity, but offset from the conductor's center.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The conductor is a sphere, but the cavity is a smaller sphere not at the center. So the setup isn't symmetric. But wait, no, the conductor is a solid sphere with a cavity. The cavity is a sphere, but its center is at a distance s from the conductor's center.

Wait, but in that case, the inner surface of the conductor would not be a perfect sphere. Instead, it would be a spherical shell, but what shape would it take? Hmm, maybe it's a shell but with a dip or something because the cavity is off-center.

Wait, but wait. The conductor is a sphere, so the inner surface must be a sphere as well. Oh, but wait, if the cavity is a sphere centered at a point s away from the conductor's center, the inner surface of the conductor would be a sphere of radius R, but the cavity is a smaller sphere of radius r. Wait, no, that's not possible. Because the cavity is a sphere of radius r, and it's centered s away from the conductor's center. So the distance from the conductor's center to the cavity's center is s, and the radius of the cavity is r, so the cavity's surface is at a distance s + r from the conductor's center in some direction, and s - r in others. But wait, wait, no, the cavity must entirely be inside the conductor. So s plus r must be less than R.

Wait, but the problem states that the radius of the cavity is r, and r < R. So s is the distance between the centers, which could be anything as long as the cavity is entirely within the conductor. So if s + r < R, then the cavity won't touch the conductor's outer surface.

But what about the inner surface of the conductor? Since the cavity is not at the center, the inner surface would have a dip or a bulge? Hmm, I'm not sure. But for the purposes of the electric field outside the conductor, perhaps the position of the cavity doesn't matter because the outer surface charge distribution is spherically symmetric.

Wait, but if the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R, wouldn't the charges distribute uniformly regardless of the cavity's position? Because the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface must have a symmetric charge distribution. Because any external fields would cause the charges to arrange themselves uniformly, but in this case, there's no external field except the induced charges.

Wait, but no, the conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium, so the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the charges on the inner surface would arrange themselves to cancel the field due to the charge inside the cavity. But the outer surface would have a uniform distribution because the conductor is a sphere.

Wait, but the conductor's inner surface is not a sphere because the cavity is not at the center. So how does that affect the outer surface? Hmm, maybe the outer surface charge is still uniformly distributed because the conductor is a sphere.

Wait, but if the inner surface is a spherical shell, but with a cavity off-center, then the inner surface charge would not be uniform. But the outer surface would still have to be uniform if it's a conducting sphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the inner surface's charge distribution doesn't affect the outer surface's symmetry. Because the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, so the charge on it must distribute uniformly, regardless of the inner cavity's position.

So, if the outer surface has a uniform charge distribution, then the electric field outside the conductor would be as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

So, the point P is outside the conductor, so the field there is given by E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That's option B.

Wait, but the options given are A, B, C, D. Let me check.

Option B says E is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Hmm, but wait, could there be any other factors? Like the position of the cavity affecting the field? But the point P is outside the conductor, so the field should depend only on the total charge outside the conductor. Which is +q.

Wait, but the point P is outside, so the conductor's charge is +q, so the field should be that of a point charge at the center of the conductor. So yes, E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

So the answer would be option B.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the cavity's position affects the field. But no, because the conductor's outer surface's charge distribution is uniform and the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center.

Wait, but why are the other options there? Let's look at the options.

Option A: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / (l - s cosθ)^2.

Hmm, perhaps if the field is considered as due to the charge in the cavity, but the point is outside, but I don't think that's correct because the conductor's outer surface is shielding the interior. No, the conductor's presence would mean that the field outside is as if the charge was at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait. The point P is outside the conductor, so the field there is due to the conductor's charge. The conductor's charge is +q, so the field is as if a point charge q is at the center.

Wait, but the point P's distance from the center is L, so E is proportional to 1/L².

So the correct answer is B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially neutral. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the system.

2. **Gaussian Surface**: For a point $P$ outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface centered at the conductor's center. The Gaussian surface encloses the entire conductor, including the $+q$ charge on its outer surface.

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: According to Gauss's Law, the electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge of the conductor and the distance from the center. The field is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Thus, the electric field at point $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

4. **Irrelevance of Cavity Position**: The position of the cavity (including its center at a distance $s$ from the conductor's center and the angle $\theta$) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the outer surface of the conductor ensures a uniform distribution of its total charge, shielding the interior from external influences.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression $\frac{1}{(l - s \cos\theta)^2}$ does not apply here, as the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge and the distance $L$.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The field outside the conductor is consistent with the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression $\frac{1}{(l + s \cos\theta)^2}$ is unrelated to the field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the form $\frac{q}{l^2}$ is correct for a point charge, it does not account for the total charge of the conductor or the distance $L$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
