Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that pericyclic reactions involve concerted movements of electrons, like in electrocyclic or sigmatropic shifts. Sigmatropic rearrangements involve the movement of a sigma bond along with the realignment of pi bonds, right?

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different starting materials and reagents. I'll need to figure out each one step by step.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. The product is A. So, what kind of reaction is this? Well, the mention of H+ and heat makes me think of acid-catalyzed conditions. But considering the starting materials, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups on the amine. Wait, but I think Dimethoxyethanamine is more like a propyl amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon.

Wait, but 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Oh wait, no, ethane has two carbons. So it's CH2(NH2)(OCH3)2? No, wait: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CHNH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Wait, no, because ethan-1-amine is CH2CH2NH2? No, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be replacing two H's on the first carbon. So structure would be CH2(NH2)(OCH3)2? That's possible.

But then, the other reagent is but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2CHCH2OH where the OH is on the second carbon and double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol: The structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, but but has four carbons. So numbering from left to right: 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C3 and C4, and the OH on C2. Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, the double bond is between C2 and C3. Wait, but for but-3-en-2-ol, the double bond starts at C3? So for butenol, the structure would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3 with a double bond between C3 and C4? That would make it CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3, but with a double bond, so it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, that can't be because but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, maybe it
