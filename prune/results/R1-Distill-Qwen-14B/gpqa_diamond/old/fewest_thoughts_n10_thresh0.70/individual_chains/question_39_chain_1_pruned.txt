Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and when they measured the particles, they only found them between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside of this region, right? Or wait, no, the wave function doesn't have to be zero, but the probability of finding the particle is zero outside that region.

Hmm, I remember that the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the probability of finding the particle in a small region dx is |ψ(x)|² dx. So for the regions x<1 and x>3, the probability should be zero. That implies that |ψ(x)|² is zero in those regions, which would mean ψ(x) is zero there.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. If this is zero for x<1 and x>3, then that function must be zero in those regions. Let's see. So for x<1, sqrt(1+x) is sqrt(something less than 2). The denominator can't be zero because 1+x is positive. So the only way the wave function is zero is if both terms are zero. But 0.5i is a constant. So (a/sqrt(1+x)) must equal 0.5i, and the other term is -0.5i. So the sum would be zero only if (a/sqrt(...)) equals 0.5i. But wait, that's impossible because a is a real number, right? Because in wave functions, the coefficients are usually real unless it's a complex wave. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait: the wave function can have complex coefficients, but in this case, the problem seems to present the wave function as a complex function. Hmm.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So this is a complex number. The modulus squared would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0
