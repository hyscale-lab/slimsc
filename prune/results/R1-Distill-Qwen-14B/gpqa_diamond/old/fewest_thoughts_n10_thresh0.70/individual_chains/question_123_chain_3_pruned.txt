Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see.

The question says that the ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames. That probably means we can use special relativity here, since in inertial frames, the laws of physics are the same and there's no acceleration involved. Right, inertial frames don't accelerate relative to each other, so no worries about changing velocities or anything like that.

From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's a pretty high speedâ€”like a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me think about the speed of light, which is about 300,000 km/s. Oh wait, 60,000 km/s is 20% of the speed of light. So relativistic effects might come into play here. But wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so that simplifies things.

The question is asking, what distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, time is measured differently in each frame. Oh right, time dilation comes into play in special relativity. So the time experienced in one frame is different from another when they're moving relative to each other.

Wait, so the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. But we need to find out how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame during that time. Then, we can calculate the distance the ejecta has traveled in the galaxy's frame by multiplying the galaxy's frame time by the speed.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the distance in the ejecta's frame and then adjust for length contraction or something. Hmm, not sure yet. Let's think about the frames.

In the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. In the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at the same speed, 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but the problem is about how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So I need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame.
