Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various distances in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

Right, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula I think is something like distance = velocity * lifetime. But wait, how do I get the lifetime from the given data?

Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, but wait, actually it's τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the energy width, which relates to the uncertainty in energy, and τ is the uncertainty in time (the lifetime). So the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ.

So first, I need to find the lifetime τ. Then, find the velocity v of the meson, multiply them together to get the decay length.

But wait, how do I calculate the velocity? The meson is produced with a certain energy, E_X. The energy is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So, perhaps I can calculate the relativistic gamma factor, γ = E / m, which would give me the Lorentz factor. Then, from γ, I can find the velocity v.

Okay, let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the Lorentz factor γ = E_X / m_X. Since E_X is 8 GeV and m_X is 1.2 GeV, γ is 8 / 1.2. Let me compute that: 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

2. From γ, find the velocity v. The relation is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Solving for v: v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

Wait, let me verify that. Yes, because γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/γ → 1 - v²/c² = 1/γ² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/γ² → v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

So γ is about 6.6667. Let's compute 1/γ²: 1/( (20/3)^2 ) = 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775). Let me approximate that. I know sqrt(0.96) is about 0.98, sqrt(0.9801) is 0.99. Hmm, 0.9775 is between 0.98 and 0.99. Let me calculate it more accurately. Let's compute 0.9775^0.5.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 1 - 1/(6.6667)^2 = 1 - 1/(44.4444) ≈ 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. Let me check: 0.9887^2 is about 0.9775. Yes, because (0.9887)^2 ≈ (0.98)^2 + (0.0087)^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 → 0.9604 + 0.00007569 + 0.01717 → ~0.9777, which is close enough. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

So v is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light. But since we'll be using natural units or SI units, perhaps we can just keep it as a fraction of c for now.

3. Next, compute the lifetime τ. Since Γ is given in MeV, I need to convert that to GeV for consistency. Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

Wait, but the lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. So I need to compute this. But wait, let's make sure about the units. ħ (reduced Planck constant) has units of GeV·s. Because Planck constant h is 6.5823e-25 GeV·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-24 GeV·s. Wait, no, wait. Let's think about units.

Wait, I think ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Because h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J. So h in GeV·s is h = 6.626e-34 J·s / 1.602e-10 J/GeV ≈ 4.135e-24 GeV·s. Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582e-
