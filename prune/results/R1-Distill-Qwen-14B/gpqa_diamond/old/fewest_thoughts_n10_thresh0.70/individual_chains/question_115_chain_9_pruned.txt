Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, let me recap the problem. An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Wait, so the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left? Or wait, no. Wait, the electron is moving from the left, so it's moving to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so it's moving to the left. So they're moving towards each other along the same horizontal axis.

When they collide, they annihilate into two photons. So the setup is that both particles are moving along the x-axis, opposite directions, each with their own Lorentz factors. The annihilate into two photons with the same energy, and each photon is moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. Wait, so both photons are moving to the right? No, wait, no. Upper-right and lower-right would imply they're moving in the positive x and positive y directions. Or wait, upper-right would be northeast, lower-right would be southeast. So both photons are moving to the right? Or perhaps each photon is moving in
