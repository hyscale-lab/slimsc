Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativistic energy, which I remember is a bit tricky. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, so I need to figure out the energy given the speed.

First, let me break down what I know. Lithium usually has 3 protons because its atomic number is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6. 

I think the key here is to calculate the relativistic energy of the nucleus. I remember that the relativistic energy formula is E = γmc². But wait, what's γ? Oh right, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So the speed given is 0.96c. I need to compute γ for v = 0.96c. Let me calculate that. 

v = 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So γ is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714… Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 1 divided by 0.28. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 *3.5 is 0.98, 3.5714 times 0.28 is 1. So yes, γ ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, but for precise calculations, maybe I should be more accurate. Because the problem says the precision is at 1e-4, so I need to compute γ with high precision.

Let me compute 1 - (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is:

0.96 * 0.96: 96 *96 is 9216, so 0.96^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(784e-4) = 28e-2 = 0.28. So sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So γ is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So γ ≈ 3.57142857. 

Now, the next part is the mass of the nucleus. Since it's Li-6, I need its mass. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017 atomic mass units (u). Let me confirm that. Wait, I think the exact value might be needed. Alternatively, I can use the formula where the rest mass is calculated based on the number of protons and neutrons, but maybe it's easier to look up the approximate mass.

Wait, I don't have the exact value here, but I can proceed.
