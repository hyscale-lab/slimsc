Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a stereocenter or some kind of asymmetric structure. Let me think through each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure here is a butene with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Chlorine is on carbon 1, and a methyl on carbon 2. The configuration is Z, which is about the arrangement of substituents around the double bond. But for optical activity, we need a chiral center. Let me draw the structure. Carbon 1 is double-bonded to C2. Chlorine is attached to C1, and since it's 1-chloro, the substituents on C1 are Cl, the double bond, and two other groups. Wait, but the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2=CH(CH2CH3), but 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure is Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl on the first carbon, and a methyl on the second. So the structure is Cl–C(CH2CH3)=CH2?

Wait, wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the molecule is Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. Wait no, the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon, so CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between 1 and 2. So it's Cl–C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think again: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, but that's maybe not right. Alternatively, 2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2=C(CH
