Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. The question is about how many of the listed stars can be detected with ESPRESSO when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, given a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

Wait, when they say detectable, they mean the S/N is at least 10. That's a key point. So, I need to figure out for each star whether their expected S/N in 1 hour meets or exceeds 10.

I remember that the S/N for a star observed with a spectrograph depends on several factors: the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the telescope and instrument's efficiency, and the noise sources like background or readout. But since the question provides a specific setup, I guess I can model this with some formula.

The formula for signal-to-noise ratio in a spectrograph is something like S/N = (flux) / (noise). The flux depends on the star's brightness and the telescope's collecting area. The noise usually scales with the square root of the flux, so S/N is proportional to sqrt(flux * exposure time). Wait, but more accurately, for a star, the S/N per pixel can be calculated based on the photon flux and the instrument's efficiency, read noise, and dark current.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to use the concept of the limiting magnitude. ESPRESSO's capabilities are known, so maybe I can find the faintest magnitude it can detect with S/N 10 in a certain exposure time.

Wait, I should look up ESPRESSO's characteristics. Oh wait, the link is given, but in the real scenario, I can't click it. So from what I remember, ESPRESSO is an extremely high-resolution spectrograph on the VLT. It's designed for precise radial velocity measurements, so it's very sensitive.

ESPRESSO has a resolving power R of about 140,000, which affects the spectral resolving element and thus the number of pixels per resolution element, which in turn affects the S/N per pixel.
