Okay, so I have this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but let's try to think this through.

The question says we have an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates with a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis.

The maximum power is A. We need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees, and the possible form of f.

Wait, I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is a function of the angle theta. The power radiated per unit solid angle (like the intensity) depends on the angle. For an oscillating dipole, the intensity varies as (1/(lambda^4)) multiplied by sin^2(theta) or something like that.

Wait, another thought: the power radiated by a dipole varies with the cube of the amplitude and inversely with the square of the distance. But the question is about the intensity, which is power per unit solid angle. So, I think the intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta) or maybe (1 + cos^2(theta)). Let me think. Oh yeah, for a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is given by (sin(theta))^2, or is it (1 + cos^2(theta))? Hmm, I think it's (1 + cos^2(theta)), but wait, no, no, wait. No, for a dipole, the radiation pattern is symmetric around the axis, so maximum at theta=90 degrees. So the maximum intensity is when theta is 90 degrees. Because sin(theta) is 1 there. Wait no, wait: the intensity for a dipole varies as sin^2(theta). Because when theta is 0, the intensity is zero, and it
