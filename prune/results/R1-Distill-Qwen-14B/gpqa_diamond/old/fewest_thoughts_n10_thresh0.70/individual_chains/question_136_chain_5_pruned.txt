Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Alright, I need to find the integral of ∇·f over the volume of the sphere.

First, I remember that the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary. So, ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dS, where n is the outward normal vector. That might be useful here.

But wait, the vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and it's only radial. So in spherical coordinates, f(r) points radially outward and its components are zero in the angular directions (theta and phi). That simplifies things a bit because in spherical coordinates, the divergence formula for a vector field with only the radial component (f_r) is something I should recall.

The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with components (f_r, f_θ, f_φ) is (1/r²) ∂(r² f_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(f_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂f_φ/∂φ. But since f_θ and f_phi are zero, those terms drop out. So the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) ∂(r² f_r)/∂r.

Given that f(r) = 1/r² in the radial direction, so f_r = 1/r², and f_θ = f_phi = 0.

Plugging into the divergence formula: ∇·f = (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let me compute that. The r² multiplied by 1/r² is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = 0? Wait, that would mean the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin.

But wait, that's a problem. If the divergence is zero, then the volume integral would be zero. But wait, the field f(r)
