Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction and the resulting NMR spectra. 

Alright, let's start by understanding the reaction setup. Compound X is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Von Braun degradation, but wait, no, wait. Oh right, it's also known as DBU, which stands for 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene? No, wait, wait. No, DBU is 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. Hmm, but the compound here is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh right, that's a different base. Or wait, maybe it's used in epoxide ring-opening reactions? Or perhaps in some elimination reactions. Oh, right, sometimes it's used as a strong, non-nucleophilic base. But wait, in the context of epoxides, maybe it's an acid catalyst? Or maybe it's involved in some kind of ring-opening. Wait, no, DBU is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, often used in elimination reactions. So perhaps the reaction is an elimination.

Wait, but the product's NMR is provided, so maybe the reaction is an epoxidation or an epoxide formation. Wait, no. The reaction uses 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane; maybe it's a base that abstracts protons, causing an elimination to form an epoxide? Or perhaps it's part of an epoxidation process. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. Let's look at the 1H and 13C NMR data. Maybe from the NMR, I can figure out the structure of the product, and then work backward to find out what the starting compound X would be.

Looking at the 1H NMR
