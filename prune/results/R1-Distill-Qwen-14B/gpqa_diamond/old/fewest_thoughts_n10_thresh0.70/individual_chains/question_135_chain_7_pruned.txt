Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction between fields. So here, the boson X is interacting with fermions, right?

The mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find out which fermions it can decay into. Kinematically allowed decays would depend on the mass of the boson compared to the fermion masses. Because for a decay to happen, the boson's mass must be at least twice the mass of the fermion it's decaying into, right? Because each fermion would need enough energy to be created.

Wait, so the decay products would be a fermion-antifermion pair. So for each possible fermion f, the mass of X must be greater than or equal to 2 times the mass of f. So I need to list all fermions where 2m_f <= 6 GeV.

But wait, what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me recall:

Electron (e-): about 0.0005 GeV. Super light.
Muon (μ-): around 0.1 GeV.
Tau (τ-): about 1.78 GeV.
Quarks: up (u), down (d) are light, but their masses are tricky because they're part of hadrons. But for this problem, I think we're considering their current masses. The up and down quarks have masses around a few MeV, so about 0.003 GeV each. Strange (s) quark is heavier, maybe around 100 MeV, so 0.1 GeV. Charm (c) quark is about 1.27 GeV. Bottom (b) is around 4.1-4.7 GeV. Top (t) is super heavy, about 1
