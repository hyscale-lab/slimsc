Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me think through it carefully.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. So, no oxygen or other gases in the air are involved. Heating the salts caused them to decompose or react, forming a mixture of gases. These gases were passed through several tubes without cooling.

The tubes are filled with:
1. Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (Tube №1)
2. Ca(OH)2 solution (Tube №2)
3. Red-hot copper (Tube №3)

The results are:
- Tube 1 gained 3.60 g.
- Tube 3 gained 0.80 g, forming CuO.
- Tube 2's weight didn't change.
- After all that, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. Let's try to figure out what's happening here.

First, I think Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, so it might absorb water. But since it's anhydrous, maybe it absorbs water from the gas mixture. So, if the gas mixture has water vapor, Mg(ClO4)2 would react to form Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, increasing the tube's weight by the mass of water absorbed.

But wait, the gas passed through tube 1. So if the gas has H2O, the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, and the tube's weight would increase by the mass of water. So the 3.60 g gained is likely the mass of H2O in the gas mixture.

Next, the gas then goes through Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight of tube 2 didn't change. Ca(OH)2 solution would react with CO2, producing CaCO3 and water. If the weight didn't change, it suggests that no CO2 was present in the gas. Because if CO2 was present, it would have been absorbed, and the tube would have gained mass. Alternatively, maybe all the CO2 was already absorbed, but that's not the case since the first tube's weight increased. Wait, the tube 2's weight didn't change, so perhaps CO2 wasn't present in the gas mixture. Or maybe it was, but the solution couldn't absorb any more? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is something else that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2. Wait, what else reacts with Ca(OH)2 solution? CO2, maybe NH3, but NH3 is a base and would react, producing NH4OH. But in this case, the solution's weight didn't change, which suggests that no gas was absorbed. So if the gas had CO2, the solution would gain weight. Since it didn't, perhaps there's no CO2 in the gas.

Then, the gas goes through red-hot copper. Copper at high temperatures reacts with certain gases. For example, SO2 reacts with copper at high temperatures to form CuS. Alternatively, CO might react with copper, but I'm not sure. Wait, CO would react with hot copper(II) oxide, but in this case, the copper is red-hot, so maybe it's acting as a reducing agent. Alternatively, H2 could react, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is a mixture that includes H2O, but that was already absorbed in the first tube. Wait, but the water was absorbed in Mg(ClO4)2.

Wait, the third tube is red-hot copper. So if the gas contains a substance that reacts with copper, like CO, then Cu would react, producing CuO and CO2 or something like that. The tube gained 0.80 g, which is the mass of the CuO formed. Let's think: if the gas has CO, then 2Cu +
