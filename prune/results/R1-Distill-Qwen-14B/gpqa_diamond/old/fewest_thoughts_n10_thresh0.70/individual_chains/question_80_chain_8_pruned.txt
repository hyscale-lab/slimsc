Okay, so I've got this problem here where an algorithm takes a DNA sequence as input and gives a numerical output. Two examples are provided:

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

And I need to find the output for ACAGTGACC. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I should figure out what the algorithm is doing. Since it's working on DNA sequences, which are made up of the bases A, T, C, G, the output is likely some numerical value derived from these bases. Maybe each base is converted to a number, and then some operation is performed on them.

Looking at the first example: AGG. Let's break that down. Each nucleotide is A, G, G. So what numbers do A, T, C, G correspond to? Well, their positions in the alphabet are A=1, T=20, C=3, G=7. Wait, no, wait. Or maybe their ASCII values? Let me think. The ASCII value for 'A' is 65, 'T' is 84, 'C' is 67, 'G' is 71. But let's test that with the first example.

AGG: A is 65, G is 71, G is 71. If we sum these, 65+71+71= 207. But the output is 115, which is about half of that. Hmm, maybe it's not a sum. Alternatively, maybe each base is being treated as a single digit in a base-4 numbering system? Or perhaps each base is converted to a number and multiplied together? Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the product of the individual values. Let's see. AGG is A=65, G=71, G=71. 65 * 71 *71 = 65 * 5041 = 327665. That's way too big, so that can't be right.

Wait, maybe each base is being converted to 0,1,2,3? Like A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. Let's try that. AGG would be 0,3,3. And how do those numbers combine to 1
