Okay, so I've got this chemistry question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the main focus is on tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, right, I remember that tautomerism has to do with the shifting of hydrogen atoms and electrons, leading to different structures, like in keto-enol tautomerism. And optical isomerism refers to compounds that are mirror images of each other, making them non-superimposable, which happens when there's a chiral center.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me break them down.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism. 

Wait, what do I know about these compounds? Benzoquinone is a quinone, right? Quinones typically have two ketone groups. I think benzoquinone is something like a benzene ring with two ketone groups in the para positions. So, the structure would be O=C-C6H4-C=O. But wait, wait, no, wait. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. And I think quinones can undergo tautomerism, but wait, do they?

Wait, actually, no. Tautomerism usually involves
