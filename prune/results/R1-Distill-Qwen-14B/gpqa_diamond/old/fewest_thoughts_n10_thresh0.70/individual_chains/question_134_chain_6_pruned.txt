Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says we're mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy change, right?

Wait, I remember that neutralization reactions are exothermic, so the enthalpy should be negative, which matches the options. But wait, what's the exact process here?

First, I think I need to figure out the moles of each acid and base. Because when they react, they'll neutralize each other.

Let me list out the reactants:

HCl: a strong acid. Each mole gives one H+ ion.
H2SO4: a strong acid too, but it's diprotic, so each mole gives two H+ ions.
Ba(OH)2: a strong base. Each mole gives two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH-.

So, the acids are HCl and H2SO4, and the base is Ba(OH)2. When they mix, they'll undergo a neutralization reaction, producing water and possibly some salt.

Wait, but wait... how do the moles of H+ and OH- compare? Because the acid and base will react in a certain ratio.

Let me calculate the moles for each solution.

Starting with HCl:
Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles of HCl = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles.

Each HCl gives 1 H+, so total H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Now H2SO4:
Molarity 0.3 M, volume 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, the total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Adding them together, total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2:
Molarity 0.5 M, volume 200 mL = 0.2 L.
Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2.

Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so OH- moles = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So now, comparing H+ and OH-:
Total H+ = 0.28 moles,
Total OH- = 0.2 moles.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So, the OH- will neutralize H+.

But wait, which one
