Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question says an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured the observable many times on identical systems. So, for spin, the expectation value of S_y would involve the state vector and the Pauli matrices, right?

Wait, the state is given as (3i, 4). I think this is a two-component spinor. So the state vector χ is [3i, 4]^T. Spin states for electrons are two-dimensional because they have spin-1/2.

The spin operator along the y-axis is given by S_y, which is (ħ/2) times the Pauli sigma_y matrix. Oh right, the sigma matrix for y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The expectation value <S_y> is calculated as χ† S_y χ. That's the bra-ket notation, so I need to compute the conjugate transpose of χ, multiply by S_y, and then multiply by χ.

Let me write down the steps.

First, write χ as a column vector:
χ = [3i
