Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and gas molecules in the vacuum chamber. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

So, Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope that's using a very high accelerating voltage—1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to remove as much gas as possible because gas molecules can interfere with the electron beam, right? Even with all that pumping, some gas particles are still present, and the mass spectrometer detected them.

Mike measured the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. I remember that the mean free path depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. Oh wait, the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d²*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. So lower pressure would mean a longer mean free path because P is in the denominator.

But then, when Mike turned on the electron beam, he noticed that the mean free path changed. It went from λ1 to λ2. The question is asking what we can conclude about λ2 compared to λ1. The options are about whether λ2 is bigger, smaller, equal, or in some range.

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Because when the beam is off, it's just the gas molecules moving around. But when the beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. I think that the electrons would cause the gas molecules to scatter more. Oh right, electron scattering by gas molecules would increase the rate at which the gas molecules collide with each other or with the chamber walls. So more collisions would mean that the mean free path decreases, right?

Because the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure (P). But wait, when the beam is on, the pressure isn't really changing in the sense of gas density because the pumps are working, but the electrons are adding energy. Wait, maybe the pressure isn't changing, but the effective scattering is. Oh, but wait, the mean free path is determined by the number density
