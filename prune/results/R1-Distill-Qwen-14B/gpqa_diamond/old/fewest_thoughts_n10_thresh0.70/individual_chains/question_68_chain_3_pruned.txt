Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times S_z. The particle's magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Alright, so I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their spin described by the Pauli matrices. The spin magnetic moment is proportional to the spin operator, which in this case is gamma times S_z. The initial magnetic field is along Z, so the particle is in an eigenstate of S_z. When the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian might change, right? But wait, the magnetic field being off probably means that the Hamiltonian changes from being proportional to S_z to something else. Oh wait, the field is turned off and then another is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.

Wait, but the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the magnetic energy is -mu·B. So initially, when B is along Z, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_z. After the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y.

So the system was initially in an eigenstate of S_z. When the Hamiltonian changes to S_y, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. Therefore, the system will evolve in time, and observable quantities like the expectation value of S_z will oscillate.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the expectation value <S_z>. I remember that for a two-level system, the expectation value oscillates with the Rabi frequency. But wait, what's the Rabi frequency in terms of the parameters here?

The Rabi frequency omega is given by sqrt( (E2 - E1)/ℏ ) where E1 and E2 are the eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian. But wait, in this case, the system starts in an eigenstate of S_z. Let me think about the states.

The initial state is |+z> because the magnetic moment is aligned with the initial B field along Z. When the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y, the system is now in a state that's a superposition of the eigenstates of S_y, which are |+y> and |-y>.

So the initial state can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution would cause these amplitudes to oscillate, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

Wait, but the initial state is |+z> after the field is changed to Y, the Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S_y. So H is proportional to S_y.

The energy eigenstates of H are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues ± (gamma B (ℏ/2)) ), because S_y has eigenvalues ±ℏ/2. Wait, but S is in units of ℏ/2 for spin 1/2. So S_y |+y> = (ℏ/2) |+y> and similarly for |-
