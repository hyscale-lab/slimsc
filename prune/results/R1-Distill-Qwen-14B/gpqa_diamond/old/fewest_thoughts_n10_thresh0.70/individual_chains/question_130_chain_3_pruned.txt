Okay, so I have this question about quasars and neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I remember that when a quasar's light passes through a cloud of hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs certain wavelengths. The Lyman alpha line is one of them, right? Oh wait, the Lyman alpha wavelength is around 1216 Angstroms. That's in the ultraviolet range, I think.

The question is about the redshift. Redshift tells us how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. So, if the quasar's light is redshifted, the Lyman alpha absorption line would also be shifted. But wait, ground-based optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because our atmosphere blocks it. So, the absorbed light needs to shift into the optical range for us to detect it.

So, the Lyman alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms. For ground-based telescopes to see it, it must be redshifted into the visible spectrum. Let me think about the range of optical telescopes. Visible light is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms. So the absorbed wavelength needs to be within this range.

The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. So, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) must be ≥ 4000 Angstroms because anything below that is UV and not visible from the ground. So, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z). 

Let me plug in the numbers. λ_rest is 1216 Angstroms. We want λ_obs ≥ 4000 Angstroms.

So, 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z). Let's solve for z.

Divide both sides by 1216: 4000 /1216 = 1 + z. Let's compute that. 4000 divided by 1216. Hmm, 1216 *3 is 3648, which is less than 4000. 1216 *3.298... Wait, let me compute it. 4000 /1216 ≈ 3.293. So 3.293 = 1 + z. Therefore, z ≈ 2.
