Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

Alright, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find the expectation value of P_z squared and the expectation value of P_z, then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, but wait. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Does that mean that the expectation values of P_x are just the eigenvalue? Well, if the state is an eigenstate of P_x, then yes, ⟨P_x⟩ is just the eigenvalue. But what about ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩? I'll need to calculate those.

Let me look at the given information. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, these basis vectors are |+z⟩, |0z⟩, and |-z⟩, I suppose. 

Wait, no, wait. Usually, for spin-1 particles, the eigenstates of P_z would have eigenvalues ℏ, 0, and -ℏ. So the basis states are |1⟩, |0⟩, |-1⟩, perhaps. But in any case, the state is given in this basis, so the components of the vector correspond to the probabilities in this basis.

Hmm, so the state vector ψ is ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 )^T. But wait, I should check if this vector is normalized. Let me calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components. 

The first component is (-1/2), squared is 1/4. The second is (1/√2) squared is 1/2. The third is (-1/2) squared, another 1/4. So total is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1.
