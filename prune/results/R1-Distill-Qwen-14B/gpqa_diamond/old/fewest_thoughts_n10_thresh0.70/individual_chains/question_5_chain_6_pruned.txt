Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. They've given me the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to possible states with definite eigenvalues. So, P is an operator, which is a vector operator made up of P_x, P_y, and P_z components.

Wait, each component is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let's write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So each of these is 2x2 matrices. Since they're components of a vector operator, the total operator P along a direction n would be the sum of each component multiplied by their respective direction cosines. So if n is a direction in the x-z plane, its direction can be represented by an angle θ from the z-axis, right? Because the x-z plane implies that the projection on the y-axis is zero. So n would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), or wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction vector n is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So n is along the x and z directions. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in the x-z plane, the angle φ is zero, so the direction is θ from the z-axis towards x.

So the operator P along direction n is given by P · n̂, which is the sum of P_x * (n_x) + P_y * (n_y) + P_z * (n_z). But since n_y is zero, because it's in the x-z plane, the P_y term drops out. So P = P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ.

Wait, let me confirm that. If n is in the x-z plane, then its direction is such that n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, no, I think that's not correct. Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So for a point in the x-z plane, φ (azimuthal angle) is zero or π. So the components are (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is measured from the z-axis.

So, the operator P along n is P_n = P_x * (n_x) + P_z * (n_z).
