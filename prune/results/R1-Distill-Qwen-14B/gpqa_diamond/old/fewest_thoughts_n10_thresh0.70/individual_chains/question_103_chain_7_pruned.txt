Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky. But let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me draw its structure mentally. It's a ketone, so a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a benzene ring. The substituents on the benzene are bromine and nitro groups. From the name, the numbering is such that the bromo is at position 3 and nitro at position 5 relative to the ketone. So the ketone is at position 1, which is the same as being directly attached to the ring.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the main chain is ethanone. The substituent is the phenyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the phenyl is at position 1 of the ketone. So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and the ketone group is directly attached to the benzene.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone (at position 1?), Br at position 3, and nitro at position 5. Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so the numbering can be a bit confusing. Let me think: the main substituent is the ketone, so that's position 1. Then, the other groups are at positions 3 and 5.

So, the benzene ring looks like this: the ketone is in position 1, Br in 3, and NO2 in 5. So the substituents are meta to each other across from the ketone.

Now, the question is about starting from benzene and choosing the correct sequence of reactions to achieve this compound. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions.

I remember that when you have multiple substituents on a benzene ring, the order of substitution is crucial because each substituent directs the next incoming group. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the directing effects of the existing groups.

So, benzene starts as a plain ring. Let's think about each step
