Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me break it down.

First, the IR data. The peaks are in the ranges: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. I remember that IR peaks can tell us about functional groups. The 3400-2500 range is usually due to O-H or N-H stretching. But wait, the broadness might matter. A broad peak around 3400 suggests an O-H group, like in a carboxylic acid. But wait, there's also the 1720 cm-1 peak, which is a strong absorption, likely a carbonyl group. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H and a carbonyl. The 1720 is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl for a carboxylic acid, which is around 1700 maybe? Or wait, maybe it's 1720 for something else. Oh, esters have carbonyls around 1730-1750. But wait, sometimes they can be lower. Hmm.

The other peaks: 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those might be C=C stretching in aromatic rings. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring. So putting this together, perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. So maybe a benzoic acid derivative or something like that.

Now looking at the NMR. The 1H NMR is given as:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)
8.0 ppm (d, 2H)
7.2 ppm (d, 2H)
2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The first peak at 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which usually indicates an O-H proton, like in a carboxylic acid. That makes sense with the IR data, which suggests a carbonyl and O-H. So this compound probably has a carboxylic acid group.

The aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These are typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each integrating for 2H, which fits a substituent on the para position, like in benzoic acid. So the aromatic ring is probably para-substituted.
