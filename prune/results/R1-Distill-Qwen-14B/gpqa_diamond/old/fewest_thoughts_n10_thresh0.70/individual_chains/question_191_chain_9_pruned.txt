Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see what each part does and how the reactions proceed.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I should probably sketch this structure to visualize it better. So, cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(CH2)-, but wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2? No, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2- attached via the central carbon? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the formula is C3H5. The structure is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a vinyl group attached to a CH2. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between C1 and C2, but the substituent is on C2? So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane at the middle carbon (position 5). So, the substituent is actually isopropenyl? Like, CH2-C(CH2-? Wait, maybe I should think of it as (CH2CH
