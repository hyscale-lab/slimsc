Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain value for an observable. Alright, let's break it down.

So, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors, and they should be normalized, right? Because probabilities must add up to 1. So I need to check if this vector is normalized.

The vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me calculate its norm squared. That would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2. So 1 + 4 + 1 equals 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which means the state is not normalized. So I guess I need to normalize it before proceeding, or else the probabilities might not make sense.

Wait, but maybe the given state is already normalized? Let me compute the sum again. Oh wait, (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. So 1+4+1=6. Yep, definitely not normalized. So the state vector has a length of sqrt(6), so to get the unit vector, I should divide each component by sqrt(6). But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about normalization. Hmm, maybe I should proceed as if the state is given as it is and see if that affects the calculation.

Wait, no. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized for probabilities to sum to 1. So perhaps the given state is actually not the actual state but just a vector, and we should treat it as the state vector without normalization. Or maybe the question expects me to use it as is.

Wait, but for the observable P, the probability is calculated based on the projection of the state onto the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue we're measuring. So perhaps the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the matrix P is diagonal, but looking at its structure, it's not diagonal. Let me look at matrix P again.

P has first row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Second row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Third row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Hmm, so it's a symmetric matrix, which is good because observables should be Hermitian. Let me think about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

But wait, calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors for this matrix might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation. The matrix P is a 3x3 matrix.

Let me write P as:

[ 0          1/sqrt(2)     0        ]
[1/sqrt(2)    0          1/sqrt(2)]
[ 0         1/sqrt(2)     0        ]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (P - λ I), where I is the identity matrix.

So, matrix (P - λ I) is:

[ -λ       1/sqrt(2)      0        ]
[1/sqrt(2)  -λ          1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0        1/sqrt(2)    -λ       ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(0) ) ] + 0 [ something ]

Wait, that's the expansion along the first row.

So,

= -λ [ λ^2 - (1/2) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-λ * 1/sqrt(2)) - 0 ] + 0.

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2)) ] 
- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ] (since the third term is zero because it's multiplied by zero)

So, compute each component:

First term: -λ [ λ^2 - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-λ) / sqrt(2) ] 
= - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ -λ / sqrt(2) ]
= - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) 
= (λ) / 2

Third term: 0.

So, putting it all together:

Determinant = -λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 

So, set determinant to zero for eigenvalues:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = 0

Factor out λ:

λ [ - (λ² - 1/2) + 1/2 ] = 0

Wait, let me re-express:

-λ^3 + (λ)(1/2) + λ/2 = 0

Wait, let me compute term by term:

-λ^3 + (λ)(1/2) + (λ/2) = 0

Wait, wait,

Wait, expanding the first term: -λ (λ² - 1/2) is -λ^3 + (λ)(1/2)

Then the second term is + λ/2.

So combining:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ = 0.

So equation is:

-λ³ + λ = 0 → λ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0

So solutions are λ=0 and -λ² +1=0 → λ²=1 → λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues of P are λ = 0, 1, -1.

Wait, but wait a second. Because I have three eigenvalues, so they should be 0, 1, and -1? Let me check.

Yes, because the equation is λ ( -λ² +1 )=0 → λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are -1, 0, +1.

But the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So I need to find the eigenvector(s) corresponding to λ=0 and find the projection of the state onto that eigenspace.

Wait, but how many eigenvectors correspond to λ=0? Because the matrix is 3x3, and the algebraic multiplicity is one (since it's a triple equation with one solution at zero), but the geometric multiplicity could be higher.

Wait, let me find the eigenspace for λ=0.

We need to solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v =0.

So P is the matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

So the system is:

0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → v2 =0.

(1/sqrt(2))v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v1 = -v3.

0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → v2=0.

So from the first equation, v2=0.

From the third equation, same as first, so v2=0.

From second equation, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) → v1 (1, 0, -1).

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).

Wait, so the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1).

So the eigenstate for λ=0 is a vector in that direction.

So the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but earlier I realized that this vector isn't normalized. Let me think about whether I need to normalize it.

Wait, the state vector is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So the state is |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. The norm squared is 6 as I computed. So |ψ> has a norm of sqrt(6), so the actual state vector is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1; 2; 1], but perhaps I should proceed with the given vector and then compute probabilities accordingly, perhaps the probabilities would take into account the squared magnitude regardless.

Wait, but no, when calculating probabilities, we need the state to be normalized because probability is the square of the amplitude, and the state vector must have a norm of 1. So maybe I should normalize the state vector before proceeding.

Wait, but the problem didn't specify normalization, so perhaps the given vector is already normalized. Hmm, no, because the sum of squares is 6, so it's not. So perhaps I should consider that the state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1; 2; 1], and then compute the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the given vector is not normalized, but the observable's eigenvectors are orthonormal, so perhaps the probability is calculated without normalization. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let's think in terms of the formula. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenspace.

So for λ=0, the eigenspace is spanned by (1, 0, -1). So the projection of |ψ> onto this eigenspace is the inner product of |ψ> and the eigenvector normalized.

Wait, but wait, the eigenvector (1,0,-1) is not normalized itself. Its norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the unit eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the probability is |<eigenvector | ψ>|².

But wait, the state |ψ> is given as [-1;2;1], but it's not normalized. So perhaps I should compute <eigenvector | ψ> divided by the norm of ψ.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The probability is |<eigenstate | ψ>|² divided by <ψ|ψ>, because the state |ψ> isn't normalized. Because, in general, for a state |ψ> with norm ||ψ||, the probability is (|<eigenstate |ψ>|²) / ||ψ||².

So let me compute <eigenstate | ψ> where eigenstate is (1, 0, -1) divided by sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, no. The eigenstate (1,0,-1) is just the basis vector for the eigenspace. The unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.

Which is (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, that's the inner product. Then the probability is | -sqrt(2) |² divided by the norm squared of |ψ>.

Because |ψ> is not normalized, right?

Wait, the norm squared is 6. So, the probability is ( (|<eigenstate | ψ>|)^2 ) / (||ψ||^2 )

So |<eigenstate | ψ>|^2 is ( ( (-1/sqrt(2))*(-1) ) + (0*2) + ( (-1/sqrt(2))*1 ) ) squared.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it again.

Wait, the eigenstate is (1, 0, -1), but normalized as (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Compute the inner product:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

So the absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))² = 2.

Then, the probability is 2 divided by (6) because the norm squared of |ψ> is 6.

So 2/6 = 1/3.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option C is 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps I don't need to normalize the state because the observable's eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis. Wait, no, because the state's norm affects the probability.

Wait, but if the state |ψ> is not normalized, then the probabilities would not sum to 1. So perhaps the correct approach is to normalize |ψ> first.

So let's consider |ψ> as (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1].

Then, the inner product with the eigenstate (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( (-1/sqrt(2)) ) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ (-2) / (sqrt(12)) ) ]

sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so this becomes (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/3), so the probability is 1/3.

So the answer is C) 1/3.


To calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0, we proceed as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **State Vector**: The state of the system is given as \( \psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). This vector is not normalized, as its norm squared is \( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 6 \). The normalized state is therefore \( \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

2. **Observable Matrix**: The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:
   \[
   P = \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Eigenvalues of \( P \)**: Solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \), the eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be \( \lambda = -1, 0, +1 \).

4. **Eigenspace for \( \lambda = 0 \)**: The eigenvectors corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) satisfy \( P \psi = 0 \). Solving this, the eigenspace is spanned by the vector \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). The normalized eigenvector is:
   \[
   \phi_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Probability Calculation**: The probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \( \psi_{\text{norm}} \) onto \( \phi_0 \). The projection is:
   \[
   \langle \phi_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   Compute the inner product:
   \[
   \langle \phi_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \left( (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \cdot (-2) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
   \]
   The absolute value squared is:
   \[
   \left| \langle \phi_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle \right|^2 = \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
