Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH of a solution. Hmm, let's see what the problem says. Alright, it's a mixture of three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First off, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider neutralization reactions. Since acetic acid is a weak acid and HCl is a strong acid, while Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, the reaction will probably involve the H+ ions from the acids and the OH- ions from the base.

Wait, but how do I handle all these components together? Maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- in the mixture. Because in the end, if there's excess H+ or OH-, that will determine the pH.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each component.

Starting with CH3COOH (acetic acid). It's 500 mL of 0.1 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely, but I think for the purpose of neutralization, I can consider the H+ it contributes as 0.05 moles? Hmm, wait, no. Because in solution, it doesn't fully ionize, so the actual H+ from acetic acid is less. But when mixed with a strong base, maybe it'll get neutralized?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to think of the strong acids and bases first, because they completely dissociate. So HCl is a strong acid, so all its H+ will be available. Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, so all OH- will be available.

So let's calculate the moles:

For HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L, 0.2 M. So 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl. Since HCl → H+ + Cl⁻, that gives 0.08 moles of H+.

For Ba(OH)₂: Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. The volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L, concentration 0.3 M. So moles Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Thus, moles OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the acetic acid: as a weak acid, it will contribute some H+ but since we're mixing with a strong base, perhaps the H+ from the strong acid (H
