Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The compound is an unknown organic compound, and the options are between Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. I remember that these are all esters, so their structures are related to acetic acid derivatives with propenyl or butenyl groups.

The NMR data provided is:
7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
2.1 ppm (3H, s)
1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Hmm, so I need to figure out which structure fits this data. Let me think about what each of the options looks like.

First, I should recall the structures. The propenyl group would be CH2=CHCH2- or maybe CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- or similar. Wait, but the substituents matter for the stereochemistry.

Wait, the options are about whether the substituents on the double bond are cis or trans. So for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH3COOCH2CH=CH2. But wait, no, actually, wait. Let me think. Acetate ester is OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Propenyl acetate would be OAc-O-CH2CH2CH2, but that seems not right because the double bond is in the propenyl. So more accurately, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Or wait, maybe it's CH3CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond. Wait, no. The propenyl group is CH2=CH-CH2, so the structure would be CH3COOCH2CH=CH2? Or is it CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? No, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2, so the ester would be CH3COO-CH2CH=CH2. Wait, but that doesn't make
