Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that in such experiments, electrons scatter off a target, and their phase shifts can tell us something about the scattering amplitude.

The question gives me the phase shifts δ0 to δ4 as 90, 67, 55, 30, and 13 degrees respectively. Oh wait, and I'm supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4. So I don't have to worry about higher terms.

The main goal is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I think the scattering amplitude is represented by this f(θ, k'), right? And for elastic scattering, the imaginary part is related to the phase shifts.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude f can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts δ. The formula is something like f = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (e^(2iδ_l) -1 ) * Pl(cosθ) ], where Pl is the Legendre polynomial and the sum is over all the angular momentum states l.

But wait, since this is for the scattering along the beam direction, which is θ = 0 degrees. So cosθ would be 1. Hmm, and since we're looking for the imaginary part, perhaps this simplifies the calculation.

Let me think about the expression. So f is given by (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum over l of (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * Pl(1). Because when θ=0, cos
