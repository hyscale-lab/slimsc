Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star with certain parameters. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesnâ€™t have spots compared to when it does. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember something about the Saha equation, which relates the ionization states of atoms in a stellar atmosphere. Oh wait, but this is about two energy levels of the same element, not ionization. So maybe it's more about the Boltzmann equation?

The Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The ratio of populations (n_i) between two energy levels is given by (g_i/g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(k*T)), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E_i and E_j are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So the spots are making the star appear cooler. But wait, when the spots are present, 40% of the surface is cooler. But the question is about the ratio in the photosphere when the star has spots. Wait, no, the question says that when the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere's average temperature is lower.

So, the problem is comparing two scenarios: star without spots (T1 =6000 K) and star with 40% spots (T2=5500 K). They are looking at the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels, and this ratio decreases when the spots are present.

Wait, so normally, when the temperature is higher (6000 K), the ratio is higher, but when the temperature is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower. So the ratio is inversely related to temperature? Or wait, because the equation depends on the exponential of energy divided by temperature.

Wait, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), assuming E2 is higher than E1. If E2 > E1, then as temperature increases, the exponential increases, so n1/n2 increases. So higher T would lead to a higher ratio.

But wait, in the problem, when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K), so the ratio should be lower than when the Teff was 6000 K. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher. So the ratio is inversely proportional to the temperature? Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, the problem is about the ratio of Ti in two levels. Let's think about their energies. Let's say level 1 is lower than level 2. So the energy difference is delta E = E2 - E1. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-delta E/(k T)). So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-delta E/(k T)).

Wait no, correct equation. The number of atoms in level i is n_i = n_j * (g_i/g_j) * exp( (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ). So, if E_j > E_i, then (E_j - E_i)/(k T) is
