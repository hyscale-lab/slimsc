Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electromagnetic potentials, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about a point charge q moving with a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at some earlier time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at time tr is v. We need to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, where t is greater than tr.

Hmm, I remember that potentials in electromagnetism are usually related to the charge and current distributions. Since the charge is moving, it's a dynamic situation, so we're dealing with the potentials due to a moving charge.

Wait, I think the scalar potential V is typically given by a Coulomb-like term, and the vector potential A involves the velocity of the charge. But I need to recall the exact forms.

Oh right! The scalar potential V due to a charge is usually (q/(4πε₀ r)), where r is the distance from the charge to the point of observation. But wait, in this case, the charge is moving, so maybe there's a time delay factor. Because the fields propagate at the speed of light, the potentials would depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time.

The vector potential A is related to the current, right? Since the charge is moving, there's a current, and A is proportional to the velocity of the charge. Oh wait, the formula I remember is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² r), but I'm not sure if that's exactly right.

Wait, let me think about the retarded potentials. Because when you have moving charges, the potentials depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time, called the retarded time. So the potentials are functions of the charge's position and velocity at time t_r, which is the time when the field was generated (so t_r is less than t).

So for scalar potential V, the expression would involve the charge q, and the distance between the charge's position at t_r and the observation point r. But I'm not exactly sure about the denominator. Let me think: the denominator is like (distance * c) minus some dot product. Oh wait, I think the denominator is (d c - d · v), where d is the vector from the charge's position at t_r to r. So d is r - r', where r' is the position of the charge at t_r.

Wait, the standard expression for the scalar potential when using retarded times is something like V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(d - (v·d̂)/c)], where d is the distance between the charge and the point. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v·d), or similar.

Hmm, let's get the exact expressions. The scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / ( |d| c - (d · v)/c ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the denominator is (d c - v·d). Let me think: d is the vector from the charge's position at t_r to r, so the denominator would be (d c - v·d), which is same as c |d| - v·d. Wait, but d · v is v times the component of d in the direction of v. Hmm.

Wait, let's make this precise. The scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / (d c - v·d) ].

Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, the denominator is (d c - v·d), but d is the vector from the charge's position at t_r to r. So the denominator is d c minus the dot product of d and v.

Wait, another way: the denominator is (r - r')·c - v · (r - r'), where r' is the position of the charge at t_r. So r - r' is d.

Wait, I think the correct expression is:

V(r, t) = (q c)/(4π ε₀) * [ 1 / ( (d c)^2 - (v · d)^2 )^{1/2} ) ] ?

Wait, no, maybe it's simpler. Let me think about the Lorentz gauge. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/(r - (v t)/c) ) ] ?

No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, another approach: the vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) times something. Hmm.

Wait, I remember Maxwell's equations when there's a moving charge. The potentials are generally expressed in terms of the charge's past position and velocity.

Wait, perhaps the scalar potential V is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| c - (d · v)/c ) ]

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, the denominator is (d c - v·d) as a scalar, so when you write it as (d c - v·d), that's the same as c |d| - v·d because d is a vector.

Wait, let's think of the denominator as (d c - v·d), which would be c*d (since d is a vector) minus v·d. Wait, but if d is a vector, then c*d is not a scalar. Hmm, perhaps it's (c |d| - v · d), which is a scalar.

Wait, so the denominator is (c |d| - v · d). So V would be (q c)/(4π ε₀ (c |d| - v · d)).

Wait, but considering that d is the vector from the charge's position at t_r to r, then |d| is the distance between the observation point and the charge at t_r. But since the charge is moving, the actual distance at time t would be different, but in the potentials, it's the past position that matters because the fields propagate at the speed of light.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C and D have denominators with terms like (d c - d·v). Let me check the options again.

Option C: V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v)), A = (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - d · v)).

Option D: V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c + d · v)), and A has (μ qc v)/(4π (d c + d · v)).

Hmm, so the denominator for V is (d c ± d·v). So which sign is correct?

Wait, I think the denominator should involve (c |d| - v·d). Because the charge's velocity contributes to a sort of time delay; as the charge moves, the point where the field is generated is moving, so the effective distance is adjusted.

Wait, I think the denominator in the potentials is (c t - |r - r'|), but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: the expression for the scalar potential at a point r and time t due to a charge at position r' and velocity v at time t_r (where t_r = t - |r - r'|/c) is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |r - r'| c - v · (r - r') ) ]

Wait, because the term |r - r'| is the distance, and v · (r - r') is the component of the velocity in the direction from the charge to the observation point multiplied by the distance. So the denominator becomes (distance * c) minus (v * distance * cosθ), where θ is the angle between v and the direction from charge to r. So that would be (distance) * (c - v cosθ), which for small v/c would make sense.

So the denominator is (d c - v · d). So V would be (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(d c - v · d)] multiplied by c? Or is there a c in the numerator?

Wait, let's think about units. The scalar potential has units of volts. The denominator is in meters (distance) multiplied by (m/s) (c) which gives m²/s. Wait, no, because d is a vector, so the denominator is a scalar term. Let me compute the units.

In option C, V is (q c) / (epsilon_0 (d c - d · v)).

The units of the denominator: [d c] is (m)(m/s) = m²/s. [d · v] is (m)(m/s) = m²/s. So denominator is m²/s. So V has units (C) * (m/s) / (F m²/s) ) ?

Wait, [q] is Coulombs. [epsilon_0] has units F/m. So [epsilon_0 * (m²/s)] = (F/m) * m²/s = F m/s. Then [V] is (C * m/s)/(F m/s) ) → C/(F). Since F is Coulombs per volt, C/(F) = V. So units work out.

Wait, but I think the scalar potential for a static charge is (q)/(4πε₀ r), which has units of volts. So if in the moving case we have an extra factor of c in the denominator, perhaps that's the case.

Wait, but in option C, V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v)), which would have units of (C * m/s) / ( (m) (m/s) - m*(m/s) ) → denominator is m²/s. So the whole thing is (C m/s) / ( (m^2/s) ), which is (C)/(m), but that's not correct because volts are (J/C), and J is N·m, which is (C·V·m), so V has units N·m/C = (kg·m²/s²)/C. Hmm, perhaps my unit analysis isn't helping me much here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the vector potential. Vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) times something. Wait, because the vector potential is related to the current, and the current for a moving charge is q v.

So the vector potential due to a charge moving with velocity v would be A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² r), but again, considering the retarded time, perhaps it's (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² (d c - v·d)).

Looking at the options:

Option C: A = (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d · v)).

Wait, so for A, it's (mu_0 q c v) divided by (4 pi (d c - d·v)).

Let me compute the units for A. mu_0 has units H/m (henrys per meter), which is (kg·m/(s²·A²)). q is Coulombs (C = A·s). v is m/s. So numerator is (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * (A·s) * (m/s) * c (m/s) → let's see:

mu_0: kg·m/(s²·A²)
q: A·s
v: m/s
c: m/s

Multiply them all together: kg·m/(s²·A²) * A·s * m/s * m/s → kg·m²/(s³·A).

Denominator: (d c - d·v) → (m)(m/s) → m²/s, but wait, d is a vector, so it's a scalar when multiplied by c and subtracted. So denominator has units m²/s.

So overall, A's units: [numerator]/[denominator] → (kg·m²/(s³·A)) / (m²/s) ) → kg/(s²·A).

But what's the unit of vector potential A? It should be Tesla·m² (since B is Tesla, and A relates to B via B = ∇×A, but that's not directly helpful). Alternatively, ampere per meter? Wait, no, A is in units of Tesla·m², but let me think again.

Wait, the ampere is defined in terms of force on a wire, but perhaps the units of A? Let me compute. A is in terms of Tesla·m². Wait, but that's the same as (kg/(s²·A)) * m²? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the formula.

Wait, in the standard expression, the vector potential for a charge at rest is zero. When the charge moves, it creates a current, and hence a vector potential. The vector potential for a steady current is (mu_0 I)/(4 pi r), where I is current. For a point charge, the current is I = q v / (4 pi r²) ? Or more accurately, the current element is J = q v delta^3(r - r'), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the vector potential due to a moving charge should be A = (mu_0 q v)/(4 pi c² r). But in the case of retarded potentials, it's A = (mu_0 q v)/(4 pi c² (d c - v·d)).

Looking at the options, option C has A as (mu_0 q c v)/(4 pi (d c - d·v)).

Wait, comparing that to the expression I just thought of, my expression has (mu_0 q v)/(4 pi c² (d c - d·v)), but option C has (mu_0 q c v)/(4 pi (d c - d·v)). So there's an extra c in the numerator.

So why the discrepancy? Did I miss a factor of c somewhere?

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - d · v) and the A is (mu_0 q v)/(4 pi (d c - d·v)) multiplied by (c²) somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for A in terms of the current.

The vector potential due to a current element I dℓ is A = (mu_0 I)/(4 pi) * (dℓ × r̂)/r², but for a point charge, the current is J = rho v, where rho is charge density. But for a point charge, it's a delta function.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to recall that the potentials satisfy Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to both electric and magnetic fields.

Wait, the electric field E is given by -∇V - ∂A/∂t. So for a moving charge, E has contributions from V and from the time derivative of A.

But perhaps that's getting too deep into the problem. Let's go back to the options.

Option C has:

V = (q c) / (4 pi epsilon_0 (d c - d · v)),

A = (mu_0 q c v) / (4 pi (d c - d · v)).

Option D has plus signs in the denominator.

So which sign is correct?

Earlier, I thought the denominator should be (d c - d · v), so that would point towards option C.

But why the factor of c in the numerator for V and A in option C?

Wait, let's see. The standard expression for scalar potential V is (q)/(4 pi epsilon_0 r), where r is the distance. When the charge is moving, the denominator becomes (r c - v · r̂ r), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: When you have retarded potentials, the potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time t_r. The scalar potential is (q/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * [1/(r - (v t)/c)] evaluated at t_r.

Wait, the denominator would be r - (v (t - t_r)/c), since t_r is the time when the charge's state is considered. But r is the vector from the charge's position at t_r to the observation point.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think of the expression for the scalar potential when considering retarded times. The scalar potential V is (q/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * [1/(r - (v (t - t_r)/c)))], but since r is from the charge's position at t_r, perhaps this simplifies.

Alternatively, I think the correct expression for the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * [1/(r - (v t)/c)] evaluated at the retarded time.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for the general form of the potentials.

Upon some more thought, I remember that the scalar potential due to a moving charge can be written as:

V(r, t) = (q/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * [1/(|r - r_0(t_r)| c - (v · (r - r_0(t_r)) )) ],

where r_0(t_r) is the position of the charge at time t_r, and v is its velocity at that time.

In this case, since d is defined as (r - r_0(t_r)), the denominator becomes (|d| c - (v · d)).

So putting it all together, V becomes (q/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * 1/(d c - v · d).

Wait, but in option C, V is (q c)/(4 pi epsilon_0 (d c - v · d)). So that's an extra factor of c in the numerator compared to what I thought.

Hmm, that might be a problem. Because the standard scalar potential is (q/(4 pi epsilon_0 r)), but here, if we include a factor of c, it might be incorrect.

Wait, but when considering the time it takes for the potential to travel, perhaps there's a factor of c involved. Or perhaps I'm missing something in the units.

Wait, let me think about the units again.

In option C, V = (q c) / [4 pi epsilon_0 (d c - d · v)].

The denominator has units of (m * m/s) → m²/s.

So numerator is (C * m/s), denominator is (m²/s). So V has units of (C * m/s) / (m²/s) ) = C/(m).

But volts are (J/C) = (N·m)/C. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps option C is wrong in terms of units.

Wait, but the standard V has units (C/(4 pi epsilon_0 r)) → (C)/( (C²/(N·m²)) * m )) → (N·m²/C) * 1/C → N·m²/(C²) )? I think I'm getting stuck on unit analysis here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the correct expression for the scalar potential is without the factor of c in the numerator, but option C has it. So maybe option C is incorrect, and the correct answer is not among the options.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option B is V = (q)/(4 pi epsilon_0 r), which is the static case. But in reality, when the charge is moving, the scalar potential isn't just the static potential. So option B may not be correct because it doesn't account for the movement.

Wait, but the question states that t > t_r, so the charge's movement affects the potentials. So options A and B are probably wrong because they don't consider the motion.

Wait, option A says A is v squared over c squared times V. That seems odd. Why would A depend on v squared? I thought A depends linearly on v, so option B and C or D.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the vector potential formula again.

In the case of a steady current, the vector potential is A = (mu_0 I)/(4 pi r) * something. For a moving charge, the current is I = q v. So perhaps substituting I = q v, the vector potential A would be proportional to (mu_0 q v)/(4 pi r).

But in terms of the retarded time, r becomes (d c - v · d), so denominator is (d c - v · d). So A should be (mu_0 q v)/(4 pi (d c - v · d)).

Looking at the options, option C has A = (mu_0 q c v)/(4 pi (d c - d · v)).

Wait, so why an extra c in the numerator? That would make the units different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about the correct expression.

The potentials for a moving charge are given by the Liénard potentials. The scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4 pi epsilon_0)) [ 1/(r - (v t)/c) ] evaluated at the retarded time.

But the retarded time t_r is such that t = t_r + |r - r_0(t_r)| / c.

Hmm, maybe that's getting too involved. Alternatively, I think the correct expressions involve denominators like (d c - v · d), but I'm not certain about the factors.

Wait, another approach: consider the case where the charge is moving with velocity v, and d is along the direction of v. So d · v = v d. Then denominator becomes (d c - v d) = d (c - v). If v is much less than c, then denominator is approximately d c.

So V would be (q c)/(4 pi epsilon_0 d c) ) = q/(4 pi epsilon_0 d ), which matches the static case. So the expression in option C for V becomes q/(4 pi epsilon_0 d ), which is correct in the static limit.

Similarly, for A in option C, if d is along v, then numerator is mu_0 q c v d (since v is along d, so v = (v d)/d), and denominator is d (c - v). So A becomes [mu_0 q c v d ] / [4 pi d (c - v) d ] ) = [mu_0 q c v]/(4 pi d (c - v) )).

Wait, but when v << c, this approximates to (mu_0 q v)/(4 pi d c ), which would be the expected result for a steady current.

So this seems to make sense.

Therefore, option C seems to be the correct expressions for V and A, considering the factor of c and the denominator involving (d c - d · v).


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \), we consider the retarded potentials. The scalar potential \( V \) is influenced by the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time \( t_r \), while the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is related to the current due to the moving charge.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{1}{d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}},
     \]
     where \( d = |\vec{d}| \) is the distance between the observation point \( \vec{r} \) and the charge's position at \( t_r \), and \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the charge at \( t_r \). This accounts for the time delay in the propagation of the potential.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and is given by:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4 \pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]
     This expression arises from the current due to the moving charge and the retarded time effects.

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is inconsistent with the expected linear dependence on \( \vec{v} \). This option is incorrect.
   - **Option B:** The scalar potential \( V \) is given as the static Coulomb potential \( \frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} \), but it does not account for the motion of the charge, which is required for retarded potentials. This option is incorrect.
   - **Option C:** Both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) have the correct forms, with the denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) properly accounting for the retarded time effects. The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) also includes the correct dependence on \( \vec{v} \) and the factor \( \mu_0 \). This option is consistent with the theory of retarded potentials.
   - **Option D:** The denominator in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) has a plus sign (\( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \)), which is incorrect. The correct denominator involves \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \). This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**, as they accurately reflect the retarded potentials for a moving charge.

**Answer: C**
