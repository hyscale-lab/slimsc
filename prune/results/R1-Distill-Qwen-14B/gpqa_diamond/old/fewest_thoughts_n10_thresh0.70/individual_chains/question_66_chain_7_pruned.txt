Okay, so I have this physics question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible interactions that can occur at some high energy scale, beyond the Standard Model. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension-6 operators being the most common ones people talk about.

The question is asking which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely one. Because the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is just adding higher-dimensional operators that still respect Lorentz symmetry. So all the terms in SMEFT should be Lorentz scalars. So option 1 must be right.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, but Poincare symmetry is a bigger symmetry that includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. But in the SMEFT, when you write down the Lagrangian, it's usually assumed to respect Poincare symmetry because the SM does. So operators must be Poincare invariant. So option 2 (Poincare) is also a symmetry that must be respected. So the operators in SMEFT have to be both Lorentz and Poincare invariant. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

What about CP and CPT? I remember that the SM is CP symmetric, except for certain interactions. Wait, no, the SM is actually not CP symmetric in some cases, like in the CKM matrix leading to CP violation. So the SM doesn't respect CP symmetry globally. So SMEFT operators would have to respect the same symmetries as the SM? Or do they not necessarily?

Wait, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. So it must respect the same symmetries as the SM because the SM is the theory at lower energies. So if the SM has CP violation, then SMEFT would include operators that also have CP violation. But wait, the question is about symmetries that all operators must respect. So maybe the operators shouldn't break symmetries that are present in the SM. Or perhaps it's the opposite.

Wait, another approach. SMEFT is about modifying the SM via higher-dimension terms. So the SM's symmetries are
