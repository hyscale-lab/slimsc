Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.

The question is: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, first, I need to make sure I understand the structure of the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, wait. Oh, wait, wait. Wait, benzene rings with substituents are named with numbers. So 1-bromo implies the bromine is at position 1. But then what's the 2-d? Oh, wait, maybe it's a typo or misinterpretation. Oh wait, wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? Wait, no, 2-d might be a substituent. Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Because sometimes 'd' is used as a shorthand for a substituent, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. So the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1 and two methyl groups at position
