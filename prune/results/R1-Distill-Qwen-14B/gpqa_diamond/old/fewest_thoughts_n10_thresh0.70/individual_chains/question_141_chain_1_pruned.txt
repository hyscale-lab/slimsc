Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about what happens when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, I think I might have misread that. Let me check. Oh, wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, no, 1-bromo is the substituent. Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps the 'd' stands for something else. Maybe it's a typo. Oh wait, sometimes 'd' is used to denote the dibrominated benzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Wait, the name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because sometimes, the numbering can get a bit tricky. Let me think: benzene rings with substituents. So, for example, 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene would have a bromine at position 1, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. So the structure would be a benzene ring with Br at position 1 (let's say the top position), and methyl groups at positions 2 (to the right) and 4 (to the left). So it's a para arrangement for the methyl groups relative to each
