Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about reacting a disubstituted epoxide with an organocuprate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that when saturated epoxides react with organocuprates, the alkyl group from the reagent (Me2CuLi) is added to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Also, in disubstituted epoxides, there's an inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. 

The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. I think I should draw the structure to visualize it. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane... let me see. The numbering is such that the bridgeheads are at positions 1 and 6. So, the structure is a norbornane derivative with an oxygen at position 7 (the epoxide oxygen). 

So, the structure should be a bicyclic system where the epoxide is between carbons 6 and 7, but wait, the numbering is a bit tricky. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has two bridgeheads: one at C1 and another at C6. The substituents are at 1R, 3R, 4R, and 6S. So, the epoxide is between C6 and C7, I think. Wait, maybe it's between C1 and another carbon? Wait, no, the 7-oxa means the oxygen is at position 7, but in bicyclo systems, the numbering might be different. Hmm, perhaps the epoxide is between C1 and C2? Or maybe C6 and C7?

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the structure as a norbornene oxide, but saturated. So, the epoxide is in a bicyclo structure, making it a strained ring. The substituents are all on the bridgehead carbons. So, the epoxide is between C1 and C2? Or maybe C6 and another carbon. Hmm, perhaps I should look up the structure of 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Oh wait, in a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, there are two bridgeheads: one with a four-membered bridge, another with a one-membered (which is a bridge of just a single bond). So, structure-wise, the molecule has a bridged bicyclo system with the oxygen in one of the bridges.

Wait, maybe the epoxide is between C1 and C2, making the two carbons adjacent each have substituents. So, in this molecule, the epoxide is between C1 and another carbon, say C7, but the exact structure might be a bit complex.

But perhaps I don't need the exact structure but should think about the reactivity. The starting material is a disubstituted epoxide, meaning each of the two carbons in the epoxide has two substituents. So, when Me2CuLi (which is
