Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see if I can work through this.

So the question says the ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames. That probably means we can use classical mechanics here, not relativity, because their speeds are probably not close to the speed of light. Wait, the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Oh wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. Hmm, that's not too close, but maybe it's enough to consider time dilation. Oh wait, but the options don't seem to account for that, so maybe the problem expects a simple approach without relativity.

Wait, the problem says: from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, no, wait. If in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, then in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy. Because in different frames, velocities can be opposite. So for example, if I'm on a train moving towards you at 60 km/h,
