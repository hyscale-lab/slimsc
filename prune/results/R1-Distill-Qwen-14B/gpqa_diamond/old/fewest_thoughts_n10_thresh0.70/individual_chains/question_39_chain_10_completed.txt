Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let me read through it again.

So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, but when they measured the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. And the question is asking for the value of 'a'.

Wait, I remember that the wave function describes the probability amplitude of a particle being in a certain state. To find the probability of the particle being in a region, you integrate the absolute square of the wave function over that region.

Since the wave function is given, I need to normalize it such that the total probability is 1. But wait, the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should equal 1.

Wait, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - (0.5)i.

The absolute square is ψ*ψ, which is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because when you multiply the complex conjugate by ψ, the imaginary parts will add. Oh wait, wait, no, wait a minute. Let me think. If ψ = A + B i, then ψ* is A - B i. So ψ*ψ is (A^2 + B^2).

So in this case, A is a / sqrt(1+x), and B is -0.5. So ψ*ψ is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25).

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx should equal 1.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because in that case, the total probability would be the sum of two integrals: the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx plus the integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

But wait, that would be a² * integral(1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3, plus 0.25*(3-1).

Wait, let me compute each part. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So from 1 to3:

Integral 1 to 3 of 1/(1+x) dx = ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the sum is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, but that would mean a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 is about 0.7213. Then a is the square root of that, which is about 0.8493, or approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I set up the problem correctly. Because in the wave function, the term is subtracted 0.5i. But when you take the absolute square, it's the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts, regardless of their signs. So the 0.5i part contributes (0.5)^2, which is 0.25. So yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3. Because the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So for x <1, 1+x is less than 2, but wait, x can be any value, but in the problem, measurements found particles only between 1 and 3. So I think the wave function is zero outside of x=1 to x=3. Wait, but the given wave function isn't zero. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the wave function is not zero elsewhere. But according to the problem statement, the wave function is given as this expression in the part of space where the particle can exist. Oh, wait the problem says: "the wave function ... can be described as" that expression "in a part of space where it can exist". So that suggests that the wave function is zero outside that region.

Wait, but the way it's written is confusing. Let me read the problem again.

"We know from theoretical modeling that the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as: (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i; where i is the square root of -1, and sqrt() is square root. When measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3 (only in between x=1 and x=3)."

Ah, so the wave function is non-zero only in x between 1 and 3. So outside that region, the wave function is zero. Therefore, the wave function is actually a piecewise function: it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, and zero otherwise.

So, the normalization condition is the integral from 1 to3 of |ψ(x)|² dx =1.

Which is exactly what I did earlier. So the setup is correct.

So, the integral is (a²) * ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So, a²= (0.5)/ln(2) ≈ 0.5/0.6931≈0.7213 → a≈0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So the answer is B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function, which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 1 \, dx = 1
\]

The first integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2) \approx 0.6931
\]

The second integral evaluates to:

\[
0.25 \int_1^3 1 \, dx = 0.25 \times (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Substituting these results back, the equation becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
