Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let's think through this.

The question says that there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They've been discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant for this particular calculation. Maybe it's just context.

The given data includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and we need to find the ratio of their orbital periods, specifically Planet3's period compared to Planet1's.

Alright, so let's list out the given ratios:

- Temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2 (T1/T2) ≈1.4
- Temperature ratio Planet2 to Planet3 (T2/T3) ≈2.3
- Mass ratio Planet1 to Planet2 (M1/M2) ≈1.15
- Mass ratio Planet2 to Planet3 (M2/M3) ≈1.35
- Albedo for all is 0.3, same as Earth.

We need to find (P3/P1), the ratio of orbital periods.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since albedo is the same for all planets here, I can ignore that part in the ratios.

So, taking the ratio of temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2: T1/T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 ) * (L / L )^(1/4) ... Wait, wait, no. Let me get the formula right.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). So if I take the ratio T1/T2, it would be [ ( (1 - a) / D1² ) / ( (1 - a) / D2² ) ]^(1/4). Oh, wait, the same (1 - a) cancels out. So T1/T2 = (D2² / D1² )^(1/4) = ( (D2/D1)^2 )^(1/4) ) = (D2/D1)^(1/2).

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( D2/D1 ). Therefore, D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2.

Wait, given that T1 is about 1.4 times T2, so T1/T2 ≈1.4. So D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 ≈1.96. So D2 is about 1.96 times D1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because T1 is 1.4 times T2, so if I rearrange the formula:

T1 = T2 * 1.4.

But T1 is the equilibrium temperature of Planet1, which depends on D1. So, T1 is proportional to (1/D1)^0.5. So, (T1)/(T2) = sqrt( (D2)/(D1) )

So, (T1/T2)^2 = D2/D1.

So D2 = D1 * (T1/T2)^2.

So D2 = D1 * (1.4)^2 ≈ D1 * 1.96.

So Planet2 is about 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet1.

Similarly, for the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3: T2/T3 ≈2.3. So, D3 = D2 * (T2/T3)^2.

Wait, same approach: T2/T3
