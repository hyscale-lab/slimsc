Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that when a particle decays, the distance it travels before decaying depends on its lifetime, speed, and energy. Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But in our lab frame, it's moving, so we have to consider time dilation.

The problem says X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what's the formula here? I think it's about the mean decay length. The decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. L is approximately equal to βγcτ₀, where β is v/c and γ is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution. So to detect at least 30% of the decays, the detector's resolution (like the smallest distance it can measure) must be less than the mean decay length multiplied by 30%, because otherwise, some decays would be too close to detect. Or maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, not too sure, but I'll think about it.

First, let's compute βγ. Since the particle is moving with a certain energy, we can find its velocity. The energy E of the particle is given as 27 GeV, and its rest mass is 3.41 GeV. So the total energy is E = γmc². Wait, but I'm working in GeV, so perhaps it's better to compute γ as E/(mc²). Oh yeah, because E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). But since units are in GeV, and c is in m/s, perhaps the units will work out when we compute everything.

Wait, actually, maybe we can compute βγ using the relation E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Let me see. The energy E is 27
