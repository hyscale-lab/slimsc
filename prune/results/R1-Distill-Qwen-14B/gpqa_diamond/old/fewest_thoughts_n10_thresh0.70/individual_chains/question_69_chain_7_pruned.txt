Okay, I've got this physics problem about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, so the question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. 

First, I remember that when a particle decays, the particles produced move away from each other, and the distance they travel depends on their speed and the time they have. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when observed in the lab frame, time dilation comes into play because the particle is moving at a high speed. So the lifetime we observe is longer than the proper lifetime by a factor of gamma (Lorentz factor).

Gamma is given by gamma = E / m, right? Because energy E of a particle is gamma times m c squared, but since we're working in units where c=1, E = gamma m. So gamma would be E divided by m. Let me compute that. The energy is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87. 3.41 * 7.9 is approximately 27. So gamma is around 7.92 (because 3.41 *7.92 ≈ 27). So gamma is about 7.92.

Now, the lifetime tau observed in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0. So tau = 7.92 * 8e-16 seconds. Let me compute that. 7.92 * 8 is 63.36, so 63.36e-16 seconds. Wait, no, 8e-16 * 7.92 is 63.36e-16 s, which is 6.336e-15 seconds. Right, because 63.36 is 6.336 times 10, so 1e-15.

Next, the particles Y+ and Z- will move away from each other. The distance each travels before decaying is v * tau. But wait, no, the total distance between them would be something else. Wait, the decay products move in opposite directions, so the distance between their vertices would be 2v tau, assuming they have the same velocity. Alternatively, perhaps it's v multiplied by the lifetime, but since both are moving away, the total path is 2v tau. Hmm, but maybe the actual formula is based on the speed of the decay products.

Wait, but wait, the decay products are Y+ and Z-. I think their velocities are the same as the original particle X^0, assuming the decay is at rest or something. Wait, no, because in reality, the decay products can have various velocities, but perhaps in this problem, we can consider that they move with the same velocity v. So the distance between the two decay points would be 2v tau (since each moves a distance v tau in opposite directions).

Wait, no, more accurately, the proper lifetime is tau_0, so the observed lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0. During this time, each decay product travels a distance v tau. So the separation is 2 v tau, because they're moving in opposite directions. So the separation s is 2 v tau.

But wait, another approach: the average speed v can be found from the velocity in terms of gamma. Since gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²), but perhaps it's easier to find beta, which is v/c. 

Beta is v divided by c. Since gamma is E/(m c²), and E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈7.92 as before. Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)), but wait, wait, the relationship is beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)}. Let me compute that.

Gamma squared is approximately (7.92)^2 ≈ 62.72. So 1/gamma squared is about 1/62.72 ≈ 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595 is 0.98405. The square root of that is approximately 0.992. So beta is about 0.992c. 

So velocity v is 0.992c. So v is approximately 0.992 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Now, tau is gamma tau_0, which we found to be approximately 6.336e-15 seconds.

So the distance each decay product travels is v * tau. So that's 2.976e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s. Let me calculate that:

2.976e8 * 6.336e-15 = (2.976 *6.336) * 1e-7.

Calculating 2.976 *6.336: Let's approximate. 3 *6=18. So maybe around 18.8? Let me compute more accurately. 2.976 times 6.336:

2.976 *6 = 17.856.
2.976 *0.336 = approximately 0.999 (because 2.976 *0.3 is 0.8928, 2.976 *0.036≈0.107, total ~1.0). So 17.856 + 1.0=18.856. So 18.856e-7 meters is 1.8856e-6 meters. So each particle travels about 1.8856e-6 meters. Since they move in opposite directions, the total separation is twice that, so about 3.771e-6 meters.

Wait, but wait, in terms of the decay length, I think the average distance between the decay vertex and the original vertex is v * tau. Because the original particle is moving, but in this case, the decay products are Y and Z, so perhaps the separation is 2v tau, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's the average path length of one of the decay products. Hmm.

Wait, the problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the minimum distance between the decay products is when the paths are just resolvable. So the minimum distance would be the average length times 30%.

Wait, no, wait. The resolution is the smallest distance the detector can distinguish. So if the decay length is L, and the detector's resolution is delta, then to observe the decay, the separation must be larger than delta. So the fraction of decays where the separation is greater than delta is what we're after.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that to observe the decay, the distance between the two points where Y and Z are created must be greater than the resolution. So the minimum resolution is the value such that 30% of the decays have a separation greater than this value.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe it's asking for the minimum resolution such that the average path length is at least 30% longer than the resolution. Or perhaps it's considering that the minimum detectable distance is the distance traveled multiplied by some factor.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is looking for the minimum distance that
