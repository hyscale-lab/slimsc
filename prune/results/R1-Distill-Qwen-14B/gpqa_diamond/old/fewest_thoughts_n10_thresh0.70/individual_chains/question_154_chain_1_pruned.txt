Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Hmm, I remember that in these cases, looking at the different spectroscopic data points is key.

First, let me read through the given data again. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity, and there's another peak at m/z 158, 32% intensity. That suggests maybe some kind of isotope or adduct, perhaps. Oh wait, molecular ions can sometimes have isotopic peaks. Chlorine has a significant natural abundance isotope, Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if the molecular formula includes chlorine, the molecular ion would have two peaks: one at Cl-35 and another at Cl-37. The ratio would be roughly 75:25, but wait, the given peaks are 156 and 158, which are 2 units apart. So 156 is the base peak (M), and 158 is M+2. That makes sense because Cl has a mass number increase of 2 (35 vs 37). So the molecular formula probably contains one Cl atom.

Wait, but the molecular weight is 156, so adding a Cl (about 35) would make the molecular formula something like C8H5ClO2? Let me think. Let's see: 156 minus 35 is 121. 121 for the rest. Hmm, wait, wait. Another approach: molecular formula calculation. Let's think about the possible options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Its formula would be C7H6ClO2. Let's calculate its molecular weight: C is 12*7=84, H 6=6, Cl 35, O 2*16=32. Total is 84 +6 +35 +32 = 157. But the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, that's a problem. So this can't be right. Unless I miscalculated. Let me double-check. 7 carbons: 84, 6 H: 6, Cl:35, O:32. 84+6=90, +35=125, +32=157. So M is 157, but our molecular ion is at 156. So option A is probably not correct.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H6ClO2. Wait, same as option A? Let me see. Benzoic acid is C6H5COOH, which is C7H6O2. So when you substitute with Cl in the para position, it becomes C7H5ClO2? Wait, wait: wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. So 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: 7*12=84
