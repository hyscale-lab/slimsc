Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The question is about comparing the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The problem states that the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. B is 1 Tesla, which is a pretty strong magnetic field, but for some contexts, like in atoms, maybe it's not too big. The question also mentions small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, m is the magnetic quantum number, right? And since m is small, that probably refers to the state having m values close to zero, like in states with low angular momentum.

So the main point is to compare two terms: the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Zeeman effect term) and the transition energy Î”E of the hydrogen atom. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I recognize as the wavelength for the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line. That transition is between n=2 and n=1, or maybe n=3 to n=2. Wait, let me get that right. The Balmer-alpha line is from n=3 to n=2, and that has a wavelength around 656 nm, which is 0.656 micrometers. Oh wait, wait, the given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is about 486 nm. Oh
