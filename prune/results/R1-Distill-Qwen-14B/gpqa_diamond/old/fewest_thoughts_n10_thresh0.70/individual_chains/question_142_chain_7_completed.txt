Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives me the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So this matrix must be a mixed state since it's a convex combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Wait, what's the geometrical position in qubit space? Oh right, I think each qubit state can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere. For pure states, the Bloch vector has a length of 1, but for mixed states, the length is less than 1.

Let me recall how the density matrix relates to the Bloch vector. The density matrix for a single qubit can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, I is the identity matrix, and r is the Bloch vector (a 3D vector). So if I can express the given ρ in that form, I can find r.

The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = I/2.

Now, let's write ρ in terms of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]], and I is the identity matrix. So the identity matrix is (σx^2 + σy^2 + σz^2 + I)/something? Wait, no. The identity matrix here would be the sum of the squares of the Pauli matrices divided by 2. Oh, because (σx² + σy² + σz²) = 2I. So I = (σx² + σy² + σz²)/2, but not sure if that's helpful right now.

Wait, the general form is ρ = (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2. So if I have ρ = I/2, then setting r_x, r_y, r_z to zero would make sense. Because I/2 is (I + 0)/2.

So that would make the Bloch vector r = (0, 0, 0). Because r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero. But wait, what does that correspond to? Oh, right, the completely mixed state. Because a pure state would have r on the surface of the Bloch sphere (length 1), but a maximally mixed state would be at the origin, which is the completely disordered state.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.

Wait, let me double-check. The density matrix ρ being I/2 is the maximally mixed state. So in the Bloch sphere representation, it's at the center, which is the origin. Yep, that makes sense.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix for a single qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices and \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given density matrix, it is evident that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), as there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices. This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented as the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position in qubit space is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state, not the mixed state.  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1):** Incorrect, as this is a pure state along the \(z\)-axis.  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0):** Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1):** Incorrect, as this is not a valid state in the Bloch sphere.  

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
