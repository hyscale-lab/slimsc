Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the energy spectrum of a particle in a given potential. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, so it's a two-dimensional problem. I remember that in two dimensions, the potential might be separable into radial and angular parts, which could help in solving the Schrödinger equation.

Let me think about the form of the potential. The first term is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. The harmonic oscillator in two dimensions would have energy levels proportional to n_x and n_y, where n_x and n_y are quantum numbers. The standard energy for a 2D harmonic oscillator is E = (n_x + n_y + 1)ℏω, where ω is sqrt(k/m). But wait, here the potential is a bit more complicated because of the second term involving cos²θ.

So the second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me see, in polar coordinates, cos²θ can be expressed using the double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Wait, let me compute that. (3/2)k r² times (1/2)(1 + cos2θ) would be (3/4) k r² (1 + cos2θ). So overall, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) is 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, another way to write this is V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² [1 + (3/5) cos2θ ].

Wait, but maybe it's better to see it as a sum of a radial term and an angular term
