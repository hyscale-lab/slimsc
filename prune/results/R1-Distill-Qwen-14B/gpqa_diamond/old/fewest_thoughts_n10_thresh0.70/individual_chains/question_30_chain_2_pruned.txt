Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I remember from chemistry that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits light of a different color. Oh wait, it's something about complementary colors maybe?

The question says the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. Wait, I think energy and wavelength are related. Oh right, the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light, and λ the wavelength.

So to find the wavelength emitted, I can rearrange that formula. Let me plug in the numbers. H is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, c is 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. The energy given is 2.3393 eV. Oh wait, I need to convert eV to joules because the units have to match. Since 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 J, so 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 3.747e-19 J.

So E = 3.747e-19 J. Now, λ = hc/E. Let me compute that. Plugging the numbers: (6.626e-34 * 3.00e8) / 3.747e-19.

Let's calculate the numerator first: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 3.747e-19 J. So 1.9878e-25 /3.747e-19 = approximately 5.305e-7 meters. Oh wait, meters to nanometers, since 1e-9 meters is a nanometer. So 5.305e-7 meters is 530.5 nm. That's in the blue-green range? Wait, visible light colors... Wait I think the visible spectrum is roughly 400-700 nm. So 530 nm is green, right? Because red is around 650-700, orange 590-620, yellow 570-590, green
