Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is among the four options given. Let me take it step by step.

First, let me recall what each of these compounds looks like. The options are Cis and Trans versions of propenyl acetate and butenyl acetate. Acetate esters generally have an acetate group (OAc) attached to a propenyl or butenyl group. The structures will differ in whether the double bond is in the cis or trans configuration.

So, the NMR data provided is:
- 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm, 1H, doublet of quartets (dq)
- 2.1 ppm, 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet

Let me break down each part.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm is likely the methyl group of the acetate. Because in acetates, the methyl is usually around 2 ppm and appears as a singlet since it's attached to an electronegative oxygen and the other two H are equivalent, but wait, acetate's methyl is usually more around 1.9 to 2.1, so that fits. So that's the OAc group.

Now, the quartet at 1.6 ppm, 3H as a doublet. Doublet with 3H suggests it's attached to a CH2 group. Wait, but 3H as a doubletâ€”like a CH2CH3 maybe? Or perhaps a CH group attached to another CH2. Hmm.

Wait, actually, looking at the options, the propenyl and butenyl groups would have different structures. Let me think about the possible structures.

For propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2CH2-OAc (but more accurately, it's CH2CH2 but as an ester). Wait, propenyl is CH2CHCH2-? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, but the double bond placement matters. For propenyl, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, making it CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Now, the substitu
