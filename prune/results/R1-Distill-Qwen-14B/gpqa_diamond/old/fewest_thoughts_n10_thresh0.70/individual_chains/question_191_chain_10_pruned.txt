Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll try to think it through.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, I should probably draw that structure to visualize. So, cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. The 3 position has a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH. The 5 position has prop-1-en-2-yl, which is like an allyl group attached with the double bond next to the cyclohexane. So, it's CH2-C double bond CH2? Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2CH2CH2 but with the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2CH2CH3, but with the double bond at 1, so it's CH2=CHCH2- but attached where? Oh wait, the substituent is at position 5 of the cyclohexane. So the group is CH2-C(CH2)- something? No, I think prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2CH2 but with the double bond from C1 to C2. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2- but attached via the middle carbon. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl would have the structure CH2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between C1 and C2, so it's CH2=CHCH2-, but attached at the C2. So the group is CH2CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons. Alternatively, the structure would be CH2=C-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the structure as a cyclohexanone ring with a ketone at position 1. Then, at position 3, there's a CH2OH group. At position 5, there's a CH2-CH2-CH2 group with a double bond
