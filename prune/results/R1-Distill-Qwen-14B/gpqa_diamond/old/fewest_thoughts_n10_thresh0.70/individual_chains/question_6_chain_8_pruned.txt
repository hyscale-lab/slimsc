Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm... I remember that when dealing with potentials in quantum mechanics, especially in two dimensions, it's often useful to switch to polar coordinates because the potential might have some angular symmetry or dependence we can exploit.

So the potential here is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me try to simplify this expression. I can factor out the (1/2)k r² term.

Wait, 1/2 kr² plus 3/2 kr² cos²θ. So that's V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, alternatively, maybe I can write this as a sum of terms that depend on r² and cos²θ.

I think the potential can be rewritten to see if it's separable or if it resembles a known form. Let me think: 1 + 3 cos²θ equals 1 + 3 (1 + cos 2θ)/2, using the double-angle identity. Wait, because cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that:

1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3*(1 + cos 2θ)/2 = 1 + (3/2) + (3/2) cos 2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos 2θ.

So the potential becomes V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² [5/2 + (3/2) cos 2θ] = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos 2θ.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this helps yet. Alternatively, maybe I can think about the potential in terms of effective potentials or harmonic oscillator potentials.

Wait, another approach: in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a particle in 2D is H = (p_r²)/(2m) +
