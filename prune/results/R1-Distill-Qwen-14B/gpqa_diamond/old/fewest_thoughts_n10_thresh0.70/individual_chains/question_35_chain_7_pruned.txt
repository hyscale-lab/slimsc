Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, the matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

And c is h/(4π), so A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. I remember that the intrinsic angular momentum operators (like S) for spin-1/2 particles are often represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, S is actually the Pauli sigma_y matrix scaled by something.

Let me think, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The σ_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly what S is. So S is the sigma_y matrix, and A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Wait, but wait: sometimes the Pauli matrices are written with a factor of ħ/2. So S = (ħ/2) σ_y? No, wait: the problem says A_y is c times S, where c = h/(4π). Hmm.

Wait, no. Let's see: the intrinsic angular momentum operator for spin-1/2 particles is typically S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the Pauli vector. So in this case, S is (ħ/2) σ_y? Or maybe I'm getting confused. Because the problem says S is a 2x2 matrix with the given entries, so that's exactly σ_y. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Wait, but let me compute the dimensions. Planck's constant h has units of J·s. Angular momentum has units of J·s, so that makes sense. The operator A_y is (h/(4π)) times a matrix. So the eigenvalues of A_y are (h/(4π)) times the eigen
