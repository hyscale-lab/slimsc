Okay, I'm trying to tackle this neutrino flux problem. Let me think through it step by step. So, the question is about the Sun's neutrino production when the pp-III branch stops suddenly. I remember that the pp chain is responsible for a significant amount of the Sun's energy, and it's composed of several branches. The pp-III branch must be a specific part of that chain.

Wait, so the problem says that all other reactions remain as they were. So, only the pp-III branch stops. I think the pp chain is the proton-proton chain, which converts hydrogen into helium. The main branches are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each branch produces neutrinos, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics of each branch.

I remember that the pp chain's branches produce different types of neutrinos. The pp-I branch produces electron neutrinos (ν_e) via the process where two protons fuse, one emitting a positron and a neutrino. The pp-II branch might involve boron-8 decay, which also emits ν_e. But I'm a bit fuzzy on pp-III. Wait, maybe the pp-III branch involves heavier elements or another fusion pathway? Or perhaps it's a part of the CNO cycle? No, wait, CNO is a different process altogether.

Wait, another thought: in the Sun, the dominant neutrinos come from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I branch. The pp-II branch produces a different isotope, maybe beryllium involved? I think the pp-III branch might produce higher-energy neutrinos. Oh, right! The pp-III branch involves the production of beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to form boron-8, which decays into two alpha particles and emits a neutrino. So that would be part of the main chain.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of those neutrinos from that branch would stop. But the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands. So the flux would depend on which neutrino energies are affected.

Wait, the neutrinos from the pp chain are mostly ν_e, but the pp-III branch might produce a certain energy range. Let me think about the energies. The decay of boron-8 produces a neutrino with a higher energy than the
