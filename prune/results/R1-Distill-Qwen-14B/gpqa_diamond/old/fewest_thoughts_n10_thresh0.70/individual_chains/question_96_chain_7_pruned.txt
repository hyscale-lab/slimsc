Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, which is related to their area. I think the formula is something like S = A/(4 l_p²) * k_B, where A is the area, l_p is the Planck length, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, the question gives me the angular size of the event horizon, theta, and the distance d. So I probably need to find the radius of the event horizon first. Oh right, the event horizon radius R is given by the Schwarzschild radius formula: R = 2GM/c². But since I don't have M (the mass), maybe I can find R using the angular size.

Angular size theta is approximately equal to R/d when R is much smaller than d, which it is here because d is 1e10 parsecs. So R ≈ theta * d. But wait, theta is in degrees, and I need to convert it to radians for the formula to work properly. Because when using small angles in radians, theta ≈ opposite/adjacent, which is R/d.

So let's convert theta = 1e-17 degrees to radians. There are pi radians in 180 degrees, so theta_radians = theta_deg * (pi / 180). Let me calculate that.

Theta_radians = 1e-17 * (pi / 180) ≈ (3.1416 / 180) * 1e-17 ≈ roughly 1.745e-19 radians. Wait, 180 is about 1.745e2 radians. Wait no, 1 degree is about 0.01745 radians. So 1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Yeah, that's right.

Now, R = theta * d. But wait, d is given in parsecs. I remember that 1 parsec is approximately 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = theta_radians * d = 1.745e
