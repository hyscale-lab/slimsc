Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but let me think.

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I don't think the masses matter directly for the abundance ratios—maybe it's just extra info. 

The question gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method. Let's list out what's given:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

I think I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, which is [n(Si)_1 / n(Si)_2] or maybe the other way around? Wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms", so probably n(Si1)/n(Si2). But I should double-check that.

Wait, the question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So it's Star_1 divided by Star_2. So I need [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], but wait, no—wait, the ratio is (Si in Star1) / (Si in Star2).

But how do I compute that? Let me think about the abundance ratios given.

First, let me parse the given data. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

Wait, no, the definition is [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the star's
