Okay, I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I remember that in QFT, each term in the Lagrangian must have the same mass dimension because the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (since the action is dimensionless). So, I think I should calculate the mass dimension of each part of the term.

Let me recall the mass dimensions of the fields. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2 because in 4 spacetime dimensions, the action term ∫ψ̄ iγ^μ D_μ ψ d^4x has to be dimensionless. So each ψ contributes 3/2. Then, the field strength tensor F has a mass dimension of 2 because F is like ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, and since A is a vector field (dimension 1), each derivative adds 1, so F has dimension 2.

Now, what about σ_{μν}? It's an antisymmetric combination of gamma matrices. Each γ matrix is dimensionless because they're just matrices, so σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So putting that together, the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have the dimensions of (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Because σ is dimensionless, it doesn't add anything.

So the term ψ̄ σ ψ F would be the product of (3) from the ψ terms and (2) from F, giving 5. But wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the term is a product of ψ̄ σ ψ and F. Each is a separate factor. So the dimensions would be [ψ̄ σ ψ] * [F]. But wait, no, in the Langragian, each term is a product of fields and coupling constants. So the term is (κ) multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ multiplied by F.

Wait, no, the way the Lagrangian is written, it's a product of ψ̄, σ, ψ, and F. So the dimensions of the entire term would be [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 0, because the Lagrangian must be dimensionless.

Wait, no, wait. Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4 in 4D spacetime because the integral ∫ L d^4x must be dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian (each separate addition) must have mass dimension 4.

So the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F must have mass dimension 4.

So let's compute the mass dimension of each part:

- ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ is also 3/2. So ψ̄ * ψ is (3/2) * 2 = 3.

Wait no, ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, which has the same dimension as ψ. So ψ̄ has dimension 3/2. So ψ
