Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to walk through it. Let me see what the question says.

The scenario is about analyzing a small peptidic compound. The 1H NMR looks mostly correct except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, matching the expected molecule.

Hmm. The question is asking for the most likely explanation for these observations.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, if it's a precursor, the mass would be different. But the LC-MS shows the same mass, so A is probably not it. Because the precursor would have a higher mass.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in NMR, each enantiomer would give the same spectrum because they have the same environment for protons. Wait, but if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same peaks as a single enantiomer, so you wouldn't see extra peaks. Unless in the case of diastereomers or other things. Wait, but the question says the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So maybe if there are two diastereomers instead.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide formation. Wait, I'm not entirely sure what that means. Maybe it's some kind of coupling during synthesis leading to two different structures. Or perhaps it's something like a double bond where splitting occurs, but the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would differ. But in this case, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, but the integrals add up to 1H. Hmm. Wait, no, the integral is the same as expected. For diastereomers, like if you have two different compounds, each would have their own set of peaks. But in this case, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, suggesting maybe different environments. Or
