Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma for the electron is 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. So gamma for the positron is 2.

They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is, what's the angle between their directions?

Hmm, so first, I think about conservation laws here. Since the system is closed (electron + positron annihilate into photons), momentum and energy must be conserved.

But wait, the electron and positron are each other's antiparticles, right? So when they annihilate, they produce gamma rays (photons). But in this case, it's two photons. So the process is electron + positron â†’ photon + photon.

I remember that in such annihilation processes, the total momentum and energy of the system before collision must equal the total after. Since photons carry momentum and energy, but no mass.

So, I need to calculate the initial momentum of the system (electron + positron) and then find the photons' directions and energies to satisfy conservation.
