Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is about. 

The question says I have an unknown organic compound, and it's one of four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The 1H NMR data is provided, and I need to determine which one it is based on that data.

Hmm, let me first recall what each of these compounds looks like. Acetate esters are generally in the form R-OAc, where R is the substituent. So propenyl and butenyl are different in the chain length.

Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (but wait, wait, no, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-, but since it's an ester, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc. Wait no, wait, I think I got that wrong. No, wait, propenyl is either CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond elsewhere. No, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but for the ester, that would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2? Or wait, but propenyl has three carbons. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond.

Wait, maybe I should write out the structures of each option. Let's see:

Cis-propenyl acetate would have the ester group connected to a propenyl group which is in the cis configuration. Wait, but propenyl has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc, but wait, no, the propenyl group is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond, but in the case of propenyl, it's CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, no, wait. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, but in the ester, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. But wait, the ester is OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl group. Alternatively, propenyl
