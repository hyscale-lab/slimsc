Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable with it when used with an 8m VLT telescope. Hmm, I remember that detectability depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The required S/N is at least 10.

First, I should probably figure out what factors influence the S/N. I think the S/N depends on the brightness of the star, which is determined by its magnitude and distance from us. The formula I recall is something like S/N proportional to the square root of the exposure time multiplied by the flux from the star. Oh wait, flux is inversely proportional to the square of the distance and depends on the star's luminosity.

Looking at the options, each star is at a different distance. The absolute magnitude is given as 15 for options c, d, e, f. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 parsecs. So the apparent magnitude would be different based on their actual distances.

Wait, the apparent magnitude formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. So for each star:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.7, but I'm not sure. So that's way brighter than the others.

b) Polaris: I think Polaris is also bright, maybe around magnitude 2 or so. Wait, I think it's about 2nd magnitude, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with another star.

c) Star at 10 pc: Wait, no, option c is a star with absolute V magnitude 15 and located at 10 pc. Since absolute magnitude is how it appears at 10 pc, so the apparent magnitude would be 15 + 5 log(10/10) = 15 + 0 = 15. So apparent mag is 15.

d) Same star but at 200 pc: Apparent mag m = 15 + 5 log(200/10) = 15 + 5 log(20) = 15 + 5*(1.301) ≈ 15 +6.505 = 21.505.

e) 5 pc: m =15 +5 log(5/10) =15 +5 log(0.5) =15 +5*(-0.301) =15 -1.505≈13.495.

f) 50 pc: m=15 +5*(log(50/10))=15 +5*log(5)=15+5*(0.69897)=15+3.49485≈18.49485.

So the apparent magnitudes are: a) very bright (maybe m around 0?), b) around 2, c) 15, e) ~13.5, f) ~18.5, d) ~
