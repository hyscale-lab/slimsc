Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to walk through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. So, the cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so, a CH2OH attached). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)-, but wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C(CH3)-, right? Because the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is at C2, which would be a methyl group. So the substituent is an allyl group attached at the middle carbon. So the 5 position has a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, the structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-C with a double bond. Wait no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2- with the double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl group: the structure is CH2-C=CH2? Or is it CH2=CH-CH2 with the substituent on the second carbon? No, wait. The ene is between C1 and C2. So the substituent is on C2. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2-, but that's prop-1-en-1-yl. Hmm, maybe I should look that up. Oh, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C(CH2)-something? No, maybe it's CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think. The double bond is from C1 to C2, so the substituent
