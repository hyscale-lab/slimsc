Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. It's a bit confusing, but I'll try to break it down. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But I'm not sure if the masses matter here. The problem gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width method. 

The given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. I'm a bit rusty on what these brackets mean. Oh right! The brackets denote logarithmic abundance ratios. Each [X/Y] is log10(N_X/N_Y) - log10(N_X/N_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of elements X to Y in the star compared to the Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, and similarly for Mg it's 7. So I think I can rearrange that to find the log ratios. Let me jot down the Sun's values.

For the Sun: 
log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) â‰ˆ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5. So nMg/nH is 10^(-5) = 1e-5.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, the notation is 12 + log10(nX/nH) = some value. So to get log10(nX/nH), I subtract 12. So for Fe, 7.5 -12 = -4.5, yeah that's correct. So the Sun's Fe/H is log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5, and Mg/H is log10(nMg/nH)=-5.

The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find (nSi_1 / nSi_2) or maybe (nSi_2 / nSi_1)? Wait, the question specifies Star_1 and Star_2, so I think it's (nSi_1 / nSi_2). Wait, no, the ratio is Star_1 over Star_2? Or Star_2 over Star_1? The question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think it's (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

Hmm. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find the abundances of silicon in each star relative to hydrogen, then compute their ratio.

Wait, but I don't have [Si/H] for each star. I have [Si/Fe] for Star_1 and
