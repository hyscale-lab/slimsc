Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, let's see. The spin state is given as (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's a vector, right? So it's a two-component spinor. 

The question is asking for the expectation value of S_y. I remember that the spin operator S is related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each of these is multiplied by ħ/2 for the spin-1/2 particles like electrons.

So the spin operator S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the sigma_y matrix. Let me write that down. The sigma_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right? So S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

The expectation value is calculated as the bra-ket product. So <S_y> = <ψ| S_y |ψ>. But wait, I need to express the state correctly. The given state is (3i, 4), which I think is a column vector. So ψ = [3i; 4], meaning the first component is 3i and the second is 4.

To compute the expectation value, I need to calculate ψ† S_y ψ. Wait, no, more accurately, the expectation value is ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ. Because ψ is a column vector, ψ† is a row vector, the conjugate transpose.

Let me write out the steps. First, let me compute S_y ψ. Then I can take ψ† multiplied by that result.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the components. So let's model this. Let me denote ψ as [a; b], where a=3i, b=4. Then S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So S_y ψ would be (ħ/2) * [0*(a) + (-i)*b, i*a + 0*b ].

Wait, no, matrix multiplication. The first component of S_y ψ is (0*a) + (-i)*b, multiplied by ħ/2. The second component is (i a) + 0*b, multiplied by ħ/2.

So S_y ψ = (ħ/2) * [ (-i)*b, i*a ]

Then, ψ† is [ a*, b* ] where a* is the complex conjugate of a, which is -3i, and b* is 4.

So ψ† S_y ψ is [ a*, b* ] multiplied by S_y ψ. 

Wait, let me think again. Maybe it's easier to compute ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ. So:

<S_y> = [a* b*] * (ħ/2) * sigma_y * [a; b]

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the matrix product first.

Let me compute sigma_y multiplied by the vector [a; b], which is sigma_y * [3i;4]. 

sigma_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]]. So when you multiply, the first component is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = -4i. The second component is (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i^2. Since i^2 is -1, that's 3*(-1) = -3.

So sigma_y * [3i;4] gives [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, multiply by ψ†, which is [3i*, 4*] = [-3i, 4].

So the dot product is (-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3).

Let me compute that term by term.

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i^2. i^2 is -1, so that's 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

But wait, I think I missed a factor. Because S_y is (ħ/2) times sigma_y. So the entire expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by the result from the matrix product.

So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) ? Let me check my calculation again.

Wait, sigma_y * [3i;4] gives [ (-i)*4, i*(3i) ].

Wait no, let's recalculate sigma_y * [3i;4].

The first component is sigma_y[1,1]*3i + sigma_y[1,2]*4.

Sigma_y[1,1] is 0, sigma_y[1,2] is -i.

So first component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component: sigma_y[2,1] *3i + sigma_y[2,2] *4. Sigma_y[2,1] is i, sigma_y[2,2] is 0.

So second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3. So yes, correct.

So sigma_y * [3i;4] is [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, ψ† is [ a*, b* ] = [ (3i)*, 4* ] → [ -3i, 4 ].

So the inner product is ( -3i )*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Let me compute each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

Total sum: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by this sum. So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

But looking at the options, option A is -12ħ/25, and option B is 12ħ/25. Hmm, that's not matching. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait a minute, perhaps I made
