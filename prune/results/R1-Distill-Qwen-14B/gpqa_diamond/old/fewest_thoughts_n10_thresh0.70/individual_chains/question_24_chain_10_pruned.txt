Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The problem starts with an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. These liquids can decolorize bromine water, which suggests they have unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or maybe some functional groups that can react with Br2. But wait, wait. Decolorizing bromine water is a common test for alkenes because they undergo addition reactions with Br2, right? So the mixture X probably contains alkenes or something similar.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) when heated, it undergoes a reaction to form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. But this time, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hmm, so whatever reaction happened, the products don't have the same functionality as the starting materials. Since Pt is a catalyst, I'm thinking maybe a hydrogenation reaction? But wait, the next part says that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives the same hydrocarbon Z.

Wait, let me think. The problem says that the treatment with Pt and heat caused a disproportionation. Oh, right, a disproportionation reaction is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So maybe one of the components in X is undergoing this?

Also, both X and Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, give Z. So Z is a hydrocarbon, probably an alkane since it's a product of hydrogenation. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So the molecular formula might be something like CxHy where (y/(12x+y)) * 100 =14.28. Let me calculate that.

Let me set up the equation:

Hydrogen mass fraction = (Hydrogen mass) / (Molar mass) = (y * 1) / (12x + y) ) = 0.1428.

So,

y / (12x + y) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

y = 0.1428 * (12x + y)

y = 1.7136x + 0.1428 y

Subtract 0.1428 y:

0.8572 y = 1.7136 x

Divide both sides by 0.8572:

y ≈ 2 x

So the ratio y/x is about 2:1. Let me think of possible hydrocarbons with H about 2x. So for example, ethane is C2H6, but wait, that has H/(12*2 +6) =6/30 = 20% which is higher than 14.28. Hmm.

Wait, maybe a larger molecule. Let me try C3H6. H is 6/(36+6)=6/42≈14.2857%. Oh! That's exactly the 14.28% given. So Z is propene? No, wait, propene is C3H6 but it's an alkene
