Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics because of the relativistic effects. Right, so I think I need to use Einstein's velocity addition formula for the relative speed part. And for the total energy, I'll have to calculate the relativistic energy for each astronaut and add them together.

Let me start by breaking down the problem. The two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when considering relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction, how do I calculate that? Oh right, in special relativity, the formula is a bit different than the classical approach.

The relative velocity formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c^2)). But wait, I think I mixed up the order. Since one is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c, which one is moving faster? Well, 0.6c is faster than 0.5c. So from the perspective of the astronaut moving at 0.6c, the other is moving at a relative speed. Alternatively, if we're looking for the speed of the second as seen from the first, we can plug in v1 =
