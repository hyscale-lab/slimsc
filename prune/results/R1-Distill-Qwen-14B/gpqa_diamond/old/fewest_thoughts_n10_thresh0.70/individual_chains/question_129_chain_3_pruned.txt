Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me read through the question carefully to understand what's going on.

The problem describes a series of reactions leading from compound A to E. I'm given four steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to give compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are some hints provided:

- Hint a: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, gives 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, right? So this suggests that A is an aldehyde or ketone that reacts via a Wittig reaction to form the given cyclopentane derivative.

- Hint b: The IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1. I remember that carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) show strong peaks around 1700 cm^-1. So A probably has a ketone or aldehyde group. But since in the next step it's reacting with HCN, maybe it's a ketone? Because HCN typically adds to ketones via nucleophilic addition, leading to cyanohydrins.

So, let me break it down step by step.

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B
If A is a ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with a hydroxyl group and a cyanide next to each other.

But wait, wait. Oh, HCN can also add to aldehydes. Wait, but for ketones, the addition would be a bit different. Let me think: when HCN adds to a ketone, it forms a cyanohydrin. So for example, cyclohexanone reacting with HCN would give cyclohexane cyanohydrin, which has an -OH and -CN group on adjacent carbons.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. So, B is a nitrile (from HCN addition?), wait no. Wait, in the cyanohydrin, the CN is part of a secondary alcohol. Hmm, no, wait: The cyanohydrin would have an -OH and -CN attached to the same carbon adjacent to the former carbonyl group. So when you reduce that, the -OH is probably converted into something else.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The cyanohydrin has an -OH and a -CN attached to a carbon adjacent to another. So, for example, if A is cyclohexanone, B would be 1-hydroxycyclohexyl cyanide? Not sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps in the cyanohydrin, the carbonyl becomes an alcohol and a cyanide on the same carbon. Wait, no, I think the mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen becomes an -O- which then attacks the incoming HCN. So the product would have an alcohol group and a nitrile group on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this out. Let's say A is a cyclohexanone. Reacting with HCN would give a cyanohydrin, which would have the structure where the carbonyl carbon (originally the ketone) becomes a secondary alcohol, and the adjacent carbon gets the CN group. So, for cyclohexanone, B would be 1-cyano-1-hydroxycyclohexane? Or maybe 1-cyano-2-hydroxycyclohexane? Wait, no, I think in the cyanohydrin, the cyanide and hydroxyl are on the same carbon as the former carbonyl. So for cyclohexanone, the B would have a structure where the carbonyl carbon becomes a CH(OH)CN group. So, for cyclohexanone, it would be 1-hydroxy-1-cyanocyclohexane.

Then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to an amine? Wait, no, wait. H2 with Pd typically reduces
