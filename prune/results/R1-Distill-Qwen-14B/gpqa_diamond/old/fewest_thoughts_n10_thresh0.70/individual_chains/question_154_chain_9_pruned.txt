Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the compound is based on the spectral data. Let's take it step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, that might indicate a molecular ion with some isotopic peaks. Chlorine has a significant isotopic abundance, right? So if the molecular formula includes Cl, that could explain the peaks at 156 and 158. Let's see, Cl has an atomic weight of about 35.5, and the major isotope is at 35 (about 75%) and 37 (about 25%). So if the molecule has one Cl atom, the molecular ion would have peaks at m/z 156 and 158. But wait, the molecular ion is at 156. Let me think, perhaps the molecular weight is 156, and Cl contributes 35.5, so the rest of the molecule would be about 120.5. Let me see, maybe the molecular formula is something like C8H5ClO2? Because 8 carbons would be 12*8=96, plus 5 H is 5, Cl is ~35.5, and O2 is 32. 96+5=101, +35.5=136.5, +32=168.5. Hmm, that's not adding up. Wait, maybe I should approach this differently.

Looking at the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests either O-H stretching (like a carboxylic acid or phenol) or maybe an alcohol. But the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is key. That peak is typically a carbonyl group. For carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700, but it can be a bit higher. Alternatively, esters or amides might have around 1720. Wait, but the broad peak in IR could indicate a carboxylic acid (which has a broad O-H stretch) or a phenol. Let's keep that in mind.

Now the 1H NMR: 

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). That's a very deshielded proton. In aromatic compounds, that could be a -OH proton from a phenol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acid protons usually appear around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. Wait, but in the NMR here, it's a singlet. For a carboxylic acid, the OH is usually a broad peak, but sometimes can be a singlet if there's no splitting. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the proton is at around 9-10, but maybe under certain conditions it shifts higher. But in this case, it's 11.0, which is more typical for a phenolic OH or a carboxylic acid.

- 8.02 ppm (d, 2H)
