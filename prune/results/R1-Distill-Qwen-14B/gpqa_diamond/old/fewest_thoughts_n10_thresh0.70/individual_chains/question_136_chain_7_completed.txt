Okay, so I've got this problem about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, let's see. The question says that there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that divergence of a vector field relates to sources or sinks. Oh right, Gauss's Law! But wait, Gauss's Law is for the divergence of the electric field, right? And when the field is radial and depends only on r, like 1/r², that's similar to the electric field of a point charge.

So the setup here seems analogous. The divergence of a vector field F is given by ∇·F, and in spherical coordinates, if the field only has a radial component and depends solely on r, the divergence simplifies. Let me recall the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. For a vector field A(r) with only the radial component, ∇·A = (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r). 

Ah, right! So here, A_r is 1/r². So plugging into the divergence formula: ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r²*(1/r²)). Let's compute that. r squared times 1 over r squared is r²*(1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0. 

Wait, that can't be right because if the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, then the integral over the volume would be zero unless there's a delta function at r=0. Oh wait, but this field is defined everywhere except the origin. So if the divergence is zero everywhere in the region, then the integral would be zero.

But wait, what if the field behaves like the electric field of a point charge? The divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0. For a point charge, the divergence would be zero everywhere except at the origin, where there's a delta function. So in that case, the integral of divergence over a volume enclosing the origin would be the charge enclosed, which is a constant (like 4π times the charge or something). 

Hmm, but in this problem, I don't know if the field has a delta function at the origin. The problem states that the field falls off as 1/r², which is similar to electric field of a charge, but the divergence for that would be proportional to a delta function. Wait, so if f(r) is 1/r², then ∇·f would be zero everywhere except at r=0. 

Wait, let me think again. Let's compute ∇·f correctly. 

f(r) is a radial vector field with magnitude 1/r². So in spherical coordinates, f = (1/r²) r̂. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component is given by:

∇·f = (1/(r²)) [d/dr (r² f_r)]

Since f_r = 1/r², so:

d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ] = d/dr [1] = 0

So ∇·f = 0. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where the function might not be differentiable. So if we integrate the divergence over a volume, would it be zero?

Wait, but for the case of the electric field, E = (k Q) r̂ / r², the divergence at any point except the origin is zero, but the integral over a sphere enclosing the origin is 4π times the charge (or something like that). So in that case, the integral is non-zero because of the delta function at the origin.

But in this problem, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence. So if the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, then the integral would be zero, because each infinitesimal volume element has zero divergence. But wait, in reality, when the field behaves like 1/r², it's more about the total charge enclosed. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the flux. The integral of the divergence of f over the volume is equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere (by the Divergence Theorem). So what is the flux of f through the surface of a sphere of radius R?

The flux Φ is the integral over the surface of f · dA. Since f is radial, f · dA is f(r) * dA, because the normal vector dA is radial. So f(r) is 1/r², and dA for a sphere is 4π r² dr? Wait, no, the surface area element for a sphere is r² sinθ dθ dφ, but when r is constant (since we're on a sphere of radius R), the integral becomes f(R) * surface area.

Wait, no. The integral is over the surface of the sphere. So dA is the area element on the sphere, which is R² sinθ dθ dφ. So the flux is ∫∫ f(R) * R² sinθ dθ dφ. But wait, f(R) is 1/R². So 1/R² times R² is 1. So the integral becomes ∫∫ (1) * sinθ dθ dφ. The integral over θ from 0 to π gives 2, and the integral over φ from 0 to 2π gives 2π. So 2 * 2π = 4π.

But wait, the flux Φ is equal to the integral of the divergence over the volume by the divergence theorem. So if the divergence in the volume is zero (except at origin), then the flux would be zero? But that can't be right because the flux through the sphere is 4π. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, so perhaps the divergence isn't zero everywhere. Where did I make a mistake? Let me re-calculate the divergence.

f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)).

Compute r² * (1/r²) = 1. Then d/dr of 1 = 0. So divergence is zero, so the integral of divergence over the volume is zero. But the flux is 4π. That suggests something is wrong because according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of divergence should equal the flux. So either I made a mistake in the divergence calculation, or perhaps the field isn't divergence-free.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. For the electric field, which has a similar form, E = kQ r̂ / r², the divergence is zero except at the origin, where it's a delta function. So the volume integral of the divergence over any volume enclosing the origin is 4πkQ, which is a constant. So in this problem, perhaps the divergence of f is zero everywhere except at the origin, leading the integral to be zero when the volume does not include the origin, and non-zero when it does. Wait, but in our case, the sphere is centered at the origin, so for R not zero, the origin is inside the sphere.

Wait, the problem says "the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin." So R is some positive number, so the sphere includes the origin. So the divergence is zero except at the origin, but the integral would include the divergence at the origin if it's a delta function.

But in our calculation, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. So how can the integral over the sphere not be zero?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the divergence is actually a delta function at the origin. So that ∇ · f = 4π δ³(r) or something like that. If that's the case, then the integral of ∇·f over the sphere of radius R would be 4π if R is greater than zero, which it is. But wait, in our problem, what is the field's divergence? Let me think.

Wait, in the case of the electric field, the divergence is (1/ε0) ρ, where ρ is the charge density. For a point charge, ρ is a delta function. So for our f(r), which is f(r) = 1/r² r̂, let's compute its divergence.

Wait, let's compute ∇·f again. f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So in spherical coordinates, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r) + ... (other terms if there were theta or phi components, which there aren't). So f_r = 1/r². So:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * 1/r²) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

So that makes me think that the divergence is zero. But then, what about the flux? If the divergence is zero, the flux through any closed surface not enclosing the origin would be zero. But if you enclose the origin, the flux is 4π. How does that work?

Hmm, perhaps for f(r) = 1/r² r̂, the divergence is zero except at r=0, but in the sense of distributions, the divergence includes a delta function at the origin. So the integral of ∇·f over a volume that includes the origin would be 4π times some constant. But in this problem, what is f(r)? Is it a Coulomb-like field?

Wait, perhaps in this problem, the divergence is zero. So the integral would be zero. But why does the flux come out as 4π then? That's a contradiction. Therefore, I must be making a mistake in one of the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the field isn't exactly like the electric field. Let me think. The electric field E is proportional to 1/r², and its divergence is a delta function. But in this problem, the field f(r) is given as 1/r², but maybe it's different.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the divergence correctly. The vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

In spherical coordinates, the divergence is:

∇·f = (1/r²) ∂(r² f_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(f_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂f_φ/∂φ.

Since f only has a radial component and is spherically symmetric, f_θ and f_φ are zero everywhere except perhaps at r=0. So their derivatives are zero. Hence, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² (1/r²)) = (1/r^2) d/dr (1) = 0.

So, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, but in the mathematical sense, the divergence is zero. So the volume integral should be zero. But wait, that contradicts the flux calculation.

Wait, but if the divergence is zero everywhere except at a single point (the origin), then integrating over a volume that includes the origin would involve the behavior at that point. But in the standard sense (without distributions), the integral would be zero because each point in the volume has zero divergence. However, in the distributional sense, the origin contributes a delta function, so the integral would be 4π. So which perspective is correct here?

Hmm, the problem states that the field is defined everywhere except maybe the origin? It doesn't specify, but the magnitude is 1/r², so at r=0, it's undefined. So when evaluating the integral, if the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, which is a point of measure zero, the integral would be zero. But that's only in the strict mathematical sense, not considering distributions.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem just gives f(r) and asks for the integral. So perhaps, since the divergence is zero everywhere inside the sphere (except origin, which is a point and doesn't contribute to the integral), the integral is zero.

Wait, but the flux calculation suggests 4π. So I'm stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, the divergence theorem says that the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral of the field over the surface. So for f(r) = 1/r² r̂, the flux through the sphere of radius R is:

Φ = ∫∫ f · dA = ∫∫ (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ = ∫∫ sinθ dθ dφ.

The integral of sinθ from 0 to π is 2. The integral of dφ from 0 to 2π is 2π. So 2 * 2π = 4π. So flux is 4π.

But according to the divergence, the volume integral of divergence is zero. But according to the divergence theorem, they should be equal. So that's impossible. So I must have made a mistake in calculating the divergence.

Wait, maybe I forgot a negative sign or something. Let me redo the divergence calculation.

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r) + ... 

f_r = 1/r².

So (1/r²) d/dr (r² * 1/r²) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Hmm, that's correct. So somehow, the divergence is zero, but the flux is 4π. That can't be. So maybe the field isn't divergence-free, and my calculation was wrong.

Wait another thought: Maybe the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, but that's only for r != 0. So what is the divergence at r=0?

Wait, perhaps the function isn't differentiable at r=0, so the divergence isn’t well-defined there. So in regions where r>0, the divergence is zero. Then, according to the divergence theorem, the flux through the surface of a sphere must be zero. But earlier, I found the flux to be 4π. So clearly, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the flux. Let me re-calculate the flux.

f(r) is (1/r²) r̂. So on the sphere of radius R, r = R. So f(R) is (1/R²) r̂. The surface element dA is R² sinθ dθ dφ r̂. So the dot product f · dA is (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ = sinθ dθ dφ.

So ∫∫ f · dA = ∫ (θ=0 to π) ∫ (φ=0 to 2π) sinθ dφ dθ.

The inner integral (over φ) is ∫0 to 2π dφ = 2π.

The outer integral (over θ) is ∫0 to π sinθ dθ = 2.

So 2 * 2π = 4π. So the flux is indeed 4π.

But according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux. So if the flux is 4π, the integral must be 4π. So why did I calculate the divergence as zero?

Ah, I think I realize now. The function f(r) = (1/r²) r̂ is not defined at r=0, so the divergence at r=0 is not zero. Instead, it's a delta function. So in reality, the divergence is ∇·f = 4π δ³(r). 

Wait, where did I get that from? Because the electric field's divergence is (1/ε0) ρ, and for a point charge, ρ is δ³(r), leading to ∇·E = (1/ε0) δ³(r). So for E = kQ r̂ / r², ∇·E = 4πk Q δ³(r). But in this problem, I don't know if there's a charge or not, but f(r) is given as 1/r².

So, perhaps, if f(r) is analogous to the electric field, then ∇·f = 4π δ³(r). So the integral of ∇·f over the volume of the sphere would be 4π, because the sphere includes the origin, and the integral of delta function over any volume containing origin is 1.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. The delta function is such that ∫ δ³(r) dV = 1. So if ∇·f = 4π δ³(r), then ∫ (∇·f) dV = 4π ∫ δ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π.

But in our case, the divergence was calculated to be zero for r≠0, but has a delta function at r=0. So the integral of the divergence is 4π.

Wait, so that's the answer. But wait, why is the divergence a delta function? Because the vector field f(r) = 1/r² r̂ behaves the same way as the electric field of a point charge, which has a delta function divergence at the origin.

Therefore, the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere of radius R (which includes the origin) is 4π. So the answer should be option A) 4π.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The problem says f(r) has non-zero component only along the radial direction and falls off as 1/r². So it's exactly like the electric field of a point charge, but without any mention of the source. So in that case, the divergence is a delta function, and the integral is 4π.

So the correct answer would be A) 4π.

But wait, let me look at the options. Option A is 4π, which matches the flux and the integral according to the divergence theorem.

So the answer is A) 4π.


To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) \) inside a sphere of radius \( R \), we start by analyzing the given field. The field is radial, has a magnitude \( f(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \), and is zero outside the radial direction in spherical coordinates. 

### Step 1: Compute the divergence of \( \mathbf{f}(r) \)
In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field with only a radial component \( f_r \) is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f_r \right).
\]

Here, \( f_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \). Substituting this into the formula:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the divergence \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) is zero everywhere except at the origin \( r = 0 \), where the field is singular. At the origin, the divergence behaves like a delta function \( \delta^3(r) \), as the field resembles the electric field of a point charge.

### Step 2: Integral of the divergence over the volume
The divergence theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the flux of the field through the surface enclosing the volume. For a sphere of radius \( R \), the flux of \( \mathbf{f}(r) \) is:

\[
\Phi = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\Phi = \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta = 2\pi \cdot 2 = 4\pi.
\]

Thus, the flux is \( 4\pi \). By the divergence theorem, the volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) over the sphere is equal to this flux. Since \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 4\pi \delta^3(r) \) at the origin, the integral over the volume of the sphere (which includes the origin) is:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = 4\pi.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A (4π):** Matches the computed flux and the volume integral of the divergence, considering the delta function at the origin.
- **Option B (1):** Incorrect, as the integral is not a dimensionless quantity with this value.
- **Option C (\( \frac{4}{3}\pi R \)):** Incorrect, as the integral does not depend on \( R \) in this form.
- **Option D (0):** Incorrect, as the divergence is not zero everywhere in the volume due to the delta function at the origin.

### Final Answer:
The volume integral of the divergence of \( \mathbf{f}(r) \) inside the sphere of radius \( R \) is \( 4\pi \).
