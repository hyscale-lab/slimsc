Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here. It's a bit complex, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about the extension of the Standard Model with certain fields and their interactions. The main focus is on finding the approximate mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections.

First, I need to understand the given Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is given as a subset containing several terms. Let me list those terms:

1. i\bar{N}_{R}\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}N_{R}: This looks like a kinetic term for the right-handed neutrinos N_R. Since N_R is a singlet fermion, it doesn't interact with the gauge fields, so this term is just their free Dirac term.

2. ½ (∂^μ φ)^2: This is the kinetic term for the scalar field φ. φ is a singlet, so it doesn't transform under the gauge group.

3. |D^μ S|^2: Here, S is a scalar doublet. The covariant derivative D^μ acts on it, so S is charged under the gauge symmetry. This term is the gauge kinetic term for S.

4. - (y_i / 2) φ \bar{N}_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c: Wait, this is an interaction term between the scalar φ and the fermions N_R. The term involves the charge conjugate, so N_iR is a right-handed neutrino, and when you take its charge conjugate, you get a left-handed anti-neutrino? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Oh wait, in the Standard Model, neutrinos are usually left-handed, but here N_R is a right-handed singlet, so the conjugate would be a left-handed singlet. So this term is coupling the scalar φ to the N_R particles. The y_i are Yukawa couplings.

5. -g_{iα} \bar{N}_{iR} L_α S: So here, L_α are lepton doublets (like the left-handed leptons in the Standard Model), S is a scalar doublet, and N_R is a singlet. So this term is an interaction between N_R, the lepton doublet, and the scalar S. The g_{iα} must be some coupling constants. This probably induces a Majorana mass term after S gets a VEV, but I'm not sure yet.

6. -V(φ, S, H): The potential involving the three scalar fields φ, S, and H. Hmm, but wait, in the question, it's given that <φ>^2 = x² + v², where <φ> is x and <h> is v. Oh, so H is another scalar field, maybe a doublet? Or perhaps H is part of S or φ? Wait, the fields given are singlet fermions N_iR ~ (1,1,0), scalar doublet S ~ (1,2,1), and singlet scalar φ ~ (1,1,0). So H must be another field, perhaps an SM Higgs? Because in the standard model, the Higgs is a doublet, but here S is already a doublet. Wait, maybe H is part of S or another field? Or perhaps the model includes H as another Higgs. Hmm, perhaps H is another scalar, but I'm not exactly sure.

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons arise when a symmetry is broken but not completely; the Goldstone theorem says that for a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, massless bosons appear, but if some of the symmetries are gauged, those Goldstone bosons are absorbed as gauge boson modes (like how the photon doesn't get a mass). The pseudo-Goldstone would come from the remaining unbroken symmetry that's not gauged. 

In the Standard Model, the Higgs field has a vacuum expectation value (VEV), v, and the Higgs field is a doublet. When it gets a VEV, three of its components are absorbed by the W and Z bosons, leaving one physical Higgs boson. But in this model, there are more scalars: φ and S are both present, as well as H. So the potential V(φ, S, H) must include terms that cause multiple fields to get VEVs, leading to multiple Higgs bosons.

The VEVs given are ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. Wait, in the problem statement, it says ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v²,
