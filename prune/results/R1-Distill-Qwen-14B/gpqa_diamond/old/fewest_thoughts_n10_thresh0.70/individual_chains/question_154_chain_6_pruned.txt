Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The chemist has provided Mass, IR, and 1H NMR data. The options given are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one it is based on the data.

Let me start by looking at each piece of data one by one and see what I can deduce.

First, the Mass Spectrometry data:

The molecular ion peak is at m/z = 156, and it's 100% abundance. There's another peak at m/z =158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, molecular ion peaks are usually the molecular weight. So the molecular formula should have a molecular weight of 156 g/mol. The other peak at 158 is likely a fragment or maybe a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has two common isotopes: Cl-35 and Cl-37, which have a ratio of about 3:1. So if the molecule has one Cl atom, then the molecular ion would have about 75% (3/4) of the peak at m/z 156 (assuming Cl-35) and 25% at 158 (Cl-37). But wait, the question says 100% for 156 and 32% for 158. That seems a bit off because the Cl isotope peaks should sum to about 100% of the molecular ion. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, the molecular ion is at 156, and then the next peak is 158. So perhaps the molecular ion is at 156, but there's an M+2 peak at 158, which makes sense if there's a Cl in the molecule. Because Cl typically shows up as M+2 peaks. So the molecular formula must include Cl. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:
A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight. C=12, H=1, Cl=35.5, O=16. So 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5, 2*16=32. Total: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. Well, close enough to 156.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A, same molecular weight.

C) Phenyl chloroformate: C6H5ClO2CO2H? Wait, wait, phenyl chloroformate is (ClO2COPh), so the formula is C6H5O2Cl. So, same as benzoic acid but replacing the hydroxyl with ClO2C? Wait, no, wait. Chloroformate would be Cl
