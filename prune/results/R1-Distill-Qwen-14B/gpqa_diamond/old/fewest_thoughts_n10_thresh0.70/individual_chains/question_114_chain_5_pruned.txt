Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction is with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and a reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably a nucleophilic addition. Oh right, the reaction of ketones with cyanide is typically done under specific conditions. So I think that the first reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by the cyanide group. But wait, waitâ€”no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when NaCN is added, it's a nucleophilic addition-elimination reaction, perhaps?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Typically, the addition of CN- to a ketone would form a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah! That's the reaction. So the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group on the same
