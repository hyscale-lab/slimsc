Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B based on the given options. The options give different structures for A and B, and I have to choose the correct pair.

First Reaction:
1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and then H+ to give product A.

Second Reaction:
(E)-pent-2-en-1-ol is reacted with acetyl bromide in the presence of a base, LDA, to give product B.

I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction.

1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom—in this case, the spiro atom is the one where the two rings meet. The structure probably has a five-membered and a seven-membered ring connected at one carbon. The compound also has a vinyl group, which is a CH₂CH₂ group attached to the spiro carbon.

The reagents are THF, KH, and H+. THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. Wait, but in some contexts, when H+ is present, maybe it's after deprotonation.

Wait, let me think. The reaction conditions are THF, KH, H+. So, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by some reaction. Alternatively, another possibility is that under basic conditions, the alcohol could undergo an elimination or some kind of ring-forming reaction.

But wait, the starting material is an alcohol with a spiro structure and a double bond. So, the first step is to determine what happens when this alcohol reacts under these conditions.

The spiro compound has a hydroxyl group (since it's a 1-ol), and the structure is a bicyclic system. When treated with a strong base like KH, it's likely to deprotonate the hydroxyl, forming an alkoxide.

But what happens after that? Maybe an elimination reaction. Alternatively, considering the presence of a vinyl group, perhaps a ring-opening or ring-forming via
