Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a small value of m (the orbital magnetic quantum number), with B being 1 Tesla. We need to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic coupling term) with the energy difference ΔE of the hydrogen atom when the wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers.

Wait, I remember that the paramagnetic effect comes from the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Oh wait, but m is the orbital quantum number here, not the spin. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Oh wait, for the orbital magnetic moment, the quantum number is l, but m here could be the z-component, so m can be -l, ..., +l. Oh, but the problem states small m, so maybe m is small, like close to zero.

But the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, only the z-component matters. So H = -μ_z B. And μ_z is (m) * μ_B, where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number? Wait, no, I think the orbital magnetic moment is μ = m * μ_B, but wait, no, the orbital part is μ_orbital = m * (eħ/(2m_e)) ) * something... Wait, maybe I'm mixing orbital and spin here.

Wait, the orbital magnetic moment is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (L_z / ħ), right? So L_z is ħ m, so μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (m). Hmm, so μ = (e m)/(2 m_e) ) * ħ? Or wait, maybe it's μ = m * (μ_B), where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Oh, because μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e c), but with c being the speed of light. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, I think the magnetic moment for the orbital part is μ = (μ_B) * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So H = -μ · B = - μ_B m B. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be - μ_B m B.

Wait, but wait, the problem says 'paramagnetic coupling term', which I think is the term due to the magnetic interaction. So that's correct.

Then the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two levels in hydrogen. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, which is a transition from n=2 to n=1? No, wait, H-alpha is n=3 to n=2. Because the Balmer series is transitions ending at n=2, so the first line is n=3→2 (wavelength about 656 nm), next is 4→2 (486 nm), which matches 0.4861 micrometers (since 1 micrometer is 1000 nm, so 0.4861 μm is 486 nm). Oh wait, no, 1 micrometer is 1000 nm, so 0.4861 μm is 486.1 nm. So that corresponds to the H-alpha line, which is n=3→n=2? Wait, no, H-alpha is n=2→n=1. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think: the Balmer series is for transitions to n=2. So H-alpha is n=3→2, which has a wavelength of about 656 nm. Then the next is n=4→2, which is about 486 nm (H-beta?), but I might be mixing up the letters. Well, regardless, the point is that the wavelength is about 486 nm, so the energy difference can be found using E = hc/λ.

So let's compute ΔE. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm or 486.1e-9 meters.

So ΔE = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s)/(486.1e-9 m) = Let me compute that.
