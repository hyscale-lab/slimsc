Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and their distances based on some observations. Hmm. Let me try to think through this.

The question says that when observing a quasar in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, there's a peak at 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that in the context of quasars, a peak in the near-infrared could be related to the Lyman-alpha emission line. Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is usually around 121 nm in the rest frame of the quasar. But when we observe it, due to the expansion of the universe, it's redshifted.

Wait a second, but the peak here is at 790 nm. Let me calculate the redshift. The observed wavelength is 790 nm, and the rest wavelength is 121 nm. So the redshift z would be (790 / 121) - 1. Let me compute that. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.5289. So 6.5289 minus 1 is about 5.5289. So z is approximately 5.5289. That's a high redshift, meaning the quasar is very far away.

Now, the question is about finding the comoving distance to the quasar. The comoving distance depends on the cosmological parameters. The universe is flat, with matter density Omega_m = 0.3, dark energy (Omega_lambda) = 0.7, and Hubble constant H
