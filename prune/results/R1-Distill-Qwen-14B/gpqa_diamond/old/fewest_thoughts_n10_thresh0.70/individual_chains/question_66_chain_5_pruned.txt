Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's used when we consider beyond the Standard Model physics, right? So operators in SMEFT are higher-dimensional terms added to the Standard Model Lagrangian.

The question is about which symmetries these operators must respect. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let me think about each of these.

First, Lorentz symmetry. Well, the Standard Model, and all its extensions like SMEFT, should respect Lorentz symmetry because that's a fundamental symmetry of spacetime. So any operator added must be a Lorentz scalar. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. So the Poincare group is made up of Lorentz transformations and translations. But in the SMEFT, do the operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? I think that the effective theory is still supposed to be Lorentz invariant, but operators are constructed as local terms. Since the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it should maintain the same symmetries as the Standard Model, which includes Poincare. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry (option 2). But wait, I'm a bit confused here. Because in SMEFT, the operators are constructed in a way that the theory remains renormalizable in some effective sense. So yes, they should respect Poincare.

Then CP symmetry. CP is charge conjugation plus parity. I know that the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry; for example, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT operators can violate CP. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if the SM already breaks CP, then SMEFT operators don't have to preserve it. So operators can violate CP. So CP symmetry (option 3) is not necessarily respected.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. CPT is charge, parity, and time reversal. I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because in any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, CPT is a symmetry. So operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (option
