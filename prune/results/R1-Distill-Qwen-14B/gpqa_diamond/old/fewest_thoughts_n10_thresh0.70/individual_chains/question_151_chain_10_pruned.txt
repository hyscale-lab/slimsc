Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3x1 vector, right? Let me write that down.

State vector, let's call it |Ïˆ> = [-1; 2; 1]. Wait, but wait, quantum states are usually represented as column vectors, and their components are complex numbers. But here, the components are real. Oh well, maybe that's fine.

The observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. The second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]. The third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So P looks like this:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, that's a 3x3 matrix. So it's Hermitian because all the elements are real, and it's symmetric. Observables are Hermitian, so that makes sense.

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0. So I think I need
