Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this ChIP-seq question. Let me think through this step by step. I remember that ChIP-seq is a method used to determine the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. So the process involves crosslinking proteins to DNA, fragmenting the DNA, using an antibody to pull down the protein of interest along with the attached DNA, and then sequencing those fragments to find where the protein binds.

The question says they used PFA-fixed samples with an antibody for IKAROS in human B cells. After sequencing, they got some peaks, but when they used PFA + DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. Hmm, I need to figure out where those peaks were originally found.

Wait, what's the difference between PFA and PFA+DSG fixation? I think PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a common fixative for crosslinking proteins and DNA. But DSG is dithiothreitol, right? Oh right, DSG is a reducing agent. So I remember that in some fixation protocols, especially for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), you might use a two-step crosslinking. The first step is formaldehyde (or PFA) to crosslink proteins to DNA. Then, DSG is used to break disulfide bonds, which are the strong bonds in proteins. So using DSG after PFA would help in crosslinking regions that are more tightly bound because it allows the formaldehyde to get into the regions that were previously blocked by disulfide bonds.

Wait, no, maybe I got that backwards. I think sometimes during fixation, proteins are crosslinked not only to DNA but also to each other. So after formaldehyde crosslinking, using DSG can help digest some of the protein-protein crosslinks, making it easier for the antibody to pull down the target protein along with the DNA. This would improve the efficiency of ChIP by breaking up protein complexes that are tightly bound, allowing more DNA-protein complexes to be captured.

So in the first case, they used only PFA, and in the second, they used PFA plus DSG. The peaks (binding sites) were present in the first case but disappeared in the second. So why would that happen?

If the ChIP peaks disappeared when DSG was added, perhaps the regions that were binding sites were more dependent on protein-protein interactions rather than direct protein-DNA binding
