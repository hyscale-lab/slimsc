Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when each of the six substances reacts with excess bromine. I need to arrange them in order of increasing para-isomer yield.

Let me think about each substituent. The substituents are:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl)
3) Cl (chlorine)
4) NO2 (nitro)
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Wait, but wait, wait. No, the substituents are attached to the benzene ring. So:

1) C6H5-CH3 is toluene, so methyl group attached.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 is ethyl carbonate attached? Or ester? Wait, COOEt is an ester group. So, that's an electron-withdrawing group.
3) C6H5-Cl is chlorobenzene, Cl is a leaving group. Wait, Cl is a substituent, it's a meta director, I think.
4) C6H5-NO2 is nitrobenzene. Nitro is a strong meta-directing group.
5) C6H5-C2H5 is ethylbenzene, so ethyl group attached.
6) C6H5-COOH is benzoic acid, which has a strong electron-withdrawing COOH group.

Wait, for each substituent, what's the directing effect and what's the activating or deactivating nature?

Methyl group (CH3): it's an activating group, ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, it would go to para and ortho positions. But since we're only considering mono-bromination, the product would have the Br either para or ortho. So the major product would be a mix, but because of steric hindrance, maybe para is more favored?

Wait, no, wait. The problem says only one monobromo derivative is formed, but that might mean each substituent directs to either ortho, meta, or para, but in some cases, the major product is
