Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're supposed to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, wait, I think I remember that in angular momentum coupling, the state is represented by |l1, l2, L, M>, where L is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and M is its z-component. So here, l1 is 1, l2 is 1, so each electron has a p orbital (since l=1 for p). The total L is 2, and M is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We need to find the probability that both measurements give -ħ.

Wait, each electron's orbital angular momentum is L1 and L2. The z-components are L1z and L2z. So, for a single electron in a p orbital, the possible eigenvalues are -ħ, 0, and +ħ. Because l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. But wait, wait, in the state |l1, l2, L, M>, each l1 and l2 is 1. So each electron has l=1.

The coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total angular momentum L is 2, which is the maximum possible (since 1+1=2). So the coupled state is the highest weight state for L=2, M=-1.

Wait, but when you have two p orbitals coupling to L=2, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. So what does that imply about the individual m values?

I think the coupled state can be written as a combination of the product states of the individual m1 and m2 states. Because the total M is m1 + m2. So M = -1 = m1 + m2.

But wait, each m can be -1, 0, +1 for each electron. So the possible pairs (m1, m2) that sum to M=-1 are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), (0
