Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They used the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. The question gives me some ratios about their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The main goal is to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. All planets have the same albedo, which is 0.3, like Earth's.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Temperature ratios:
  - Planet1 to Planet2 (T1/T2) ≈ 1.4
  - Planet2 to Planet3 (T2/T3) ≈ 2.3
- Mass ratios:
  - Planet1 to Planet2 (M1/M2) ≈ 1.15
  - Planet2 to Planet3 (M2/M3) ≈ 1.35
- Albedo (all same) = 0.3
- Find: Period3 / Period1 = ?

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula I recall is something like T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16πσd²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, and d is the distance. But wait, that's the effective temperature. Since all have the same albedo, maybe the ratio of temperatures relates to the square root of the inverse of their distances?

Alternatively, the formula for equilibrium temperature can be written as T ∝ sqrt(L/(d²)). Wait, but considering that, the ratio of temperatures squared would relate to the inverse of the distance squared. So (T1/T2)^2 = d2²/d1². Because if T1 = sqrt(L/(16πσ d1²)) * (1 - a), same for T2, then T1/T2 = sqrt( (d2²) / (d1²) ) * sqrt( (1 - a2)/(1 - a1) ), but since a is same, it's sqrt(d2/d1). So T1/T2 = d2/d1^(1/2). Wait, maybe I should think about it more carefully.

Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature formula is:

T = T_* * ( R_* / (2d) ) * ( (1 - a) / (1 + e) )^(1/2)

Assuming the orbit is circular (e=0), this simplifies to T = T_* * ( R_* / (2d) ) * sqrt( (1 - a) )

But since all planets are around the same star (I assume), T_* and R_* would be the same for all. So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d) * sqrt( (1 - a) ). Since a is same for all, T ∝ 1/sqrt(d).

Wait, let me clarify. Let me denote the star's effective temperature as T_s. Then the equilibrium temperature of a planet is T_p = T_s * ( R_s / (2d) )^(1/2) * sqrt( (1 - a) ). So yes, T_p is proportional to 1/sqrt(d). So if I have two planets, their temperatures ratio squared is inversely proportional to the ratio of their distances. So (T1 / T2)^2 = (d2 / d1), because T1 = T_s * (R_s/(2d1))^(1/2) * sqrt(1-a), same for T2.

Wait, no, because (T1 / T2)^2 = (d2)/(d1), because T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(d1), so T1^2 proportional to 1/d1. So (T1^2)/(T2^2) = (d
