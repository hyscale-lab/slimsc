Okay, so I have this problem here where an algorithm is converting DNA sequences into numbers, and I need to figure out what the sequence ACAGTGACC would output. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. Hmm, let's see how I can approach this.

First, I'll look at the examples to find a pattern. Let's take the first one: AGG becomes 115. AGG is a three-letter DNA sequence. DNA is made up of four nucleotides: A, T, C, G. Each has a specific weight, perhaps? Maybe each letter is assigned a numerical value, and the total is the sum.

Let's break down AGG. A is the first nucleotide, G is the fourth. Wait, if I assign A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4, then AGG would be 1 + 4 + 4 = 9. But 9 is nowhere near 115. That can't be right. Maybe they're using double the values or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide is weighted by its position. Like, maybe each position in the sequence has a multiplier. Let's think about the first example: AGG is 3 letters. If it's a 3-digit number, maybe each letter corresponds to a digit? But 115 is a three-digit number. Let me see: A=1, G=4, so 1,4,4 gives 144, which isn't 115. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is converted to a digit, and then the entire sequence is a number in another base. For example, AGG in base 10 would be 1,4,4, but that's 144 again. Not 115.

Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide is assigned a value, and the algorithm sums them with some positional weighting. Let's think of each position as exponents. Or maybe it's a base 5 number since there are four nucleotides, but maybe they're using 0 for one of them? Or perhaps each position is a digit in a different base.

Wait, the first example is 3 nucleotides giving a 3-digit number. Let's think of each nucleotide as a digit in base 10, but
