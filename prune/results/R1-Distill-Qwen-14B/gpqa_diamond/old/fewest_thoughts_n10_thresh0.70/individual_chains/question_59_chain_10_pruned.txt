Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, especially when multiple acids and bases are involved. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says we have three solutions mixed together: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide [Ba(OH)2]. I need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, right. So first, when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I should calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then see which one is in excess. The excess will determine whether the solution is acidic or basic, and I can find the pH from that.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and HCl is a strong acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So I need to consider their dissociation. Let's break it down.

First, let's find the moles for each component.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume 0.5 L. Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But since it's a weak acid, its contribution of H+ is less. Oh wait, but when mixed with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, maybe it will affect the neutralization. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. The base is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

So first, let's calculate the moles of H+ from the acids, and moles of OH- from the base.

HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates. So the moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so each mole contributes one mole of H+ (but not completely). But wait, when mixed with a strong base, the OH- from the base will react with the H+ from both acids. So perhaps I should think of all the H+ and OH- reacting together.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the total H+ and OH- contributions and see what's left after neutralization.

So let me compute the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 mol.
Moles of H+ from CH3COOH: 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 mol. But wait, since it's a weak acid, it doesn't release all the H+. Oh, but in the presence of a strong base, the OH
