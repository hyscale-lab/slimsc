Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes two reactions, then asks about the number of peaks observed in two types of HPLC chromatograms after combining the products. The options are A to D.

First, let me break down what each reaction does.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH, then acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent. LAH, which is LiAlH4, usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but wait. The starting material is a ketone—specifically, hexan-3-one. So that's a six-carbon chain with a ketone group on carbon 3. And there's a methoxy group on carbon 5.

So, when LAH is used, it should reduce the ketone. So the ketone (O) becomes an alcohol (OH). So (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one becomes (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration? So after reduction, does the configuration change? No, because the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol is a two-step process where the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen becomes an -OLi, which upon protonation gives the alcohol. Since the starting compound is a single enantiomer, the product after reduction should retain the stereochemistry? Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is a ketone, which is planar. So the reduction would result in a racemic mixture? Or does the starting material have a chiral center already?

Wait, let me look. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the molecule has a chiral center at the 3rd carbon? Because hexan-3-one is (CH₂)₂CO(CH₂)₂CH3, but in this case, there's a methoxy on carbon 5.

Wait, the structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would be: CH₂CH₂-CO-CH(CH₂OCH3)-CH2?

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it. Let me think: the chain is six carbons. Carbon 3 is the ketone. So positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So structure: CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH₂)₂CO(CH₂)₃CH3? So, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, the structure is:

CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-CH3, but with the fifth carbon (CH₂) having a methoxy group. Wait, no, because 5-methoxy would be the fifth carbon from the start. So the structure is:

CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is:

O
||
C
 |
CH2-CH2-C-O-R?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again.

Hexan-3-one is CH₂CH₂-CO-CH₂CH₂CH3. So positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. So, the 3rd carbon is the carbonyl.

In this case, the 5th carbon is substituted with a methoxy group. So, looking at the structure:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH2-OCH3?
Wait, no. Wait, perhaps it
