Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, the question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames, so I probably don't have to worry about acceleration or anything like that.

Wait, I remember something about time dilation from special relativity. Oh right, when two frames are moving relative to each other, time intervals can appear different. So the key here is that time experienced by the ejecta's frame (Δt') is different from what's observed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt), which is the frame we're interested in for the distance.

The problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that's the velocity between the two frames, right? So v is 60,000 km/s. But wait, since the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v as well. Because in the problem, the ejecta part is moving towards the center, so in Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s.

But I think the direction doesn't matter for the magnitude of the distance. So I'll just focus on the speed.

So, the time that passes in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds (Δt' = 50 s). I need to find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame, which would be v multiplied by the time in that frame (Δt), right? Because distance equals speed multiplied by time.

But wait, how do I relate Δt and Δt'? Oh right, using the Lorentz transformation. The relation between time intervals depends on the relative velocity.

The formula for time dilation is Δt = γ Δt', where γ is the Lorentz factor. And γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I'll need to compute γ first.

Wait, let me make sure the units are correct. The velocity is given in km/s. I know that the speed of light c is approximately 300,000 km/s. So v is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c. That's 20% of the
