Okay, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Let's start by recalling what SMEFT stands for. Oh right, it's the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. I remember that effective field theories are used when you have some high-energy physics that's too heavy to be seen at the current energy scales. So the SMEFT incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators that could be added to the Standard Model Lagrangian.

Now, the question is about which symmetries these operators must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. I'll tackle each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think that in any relativistic theory, like the Standard Model, the Lagrangian must be invariant under Lorentz transformations. Because the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model, all its operators should respect Lorentz symmetry. So operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant. That means they must form a Lorentz scalar. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Next up is Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So any operator in a Poincare-invariant theory must also be invariant under translations, meaning they must have the correct mass dimension to make the theory renormalizable, or at least power-counting renormalizable. But wait, SMEFT isn't a renormalizable theory; it's an effective theory with higher-dimensional operators. However, the SMEFT is still built upon the Standard Model, which is Poincare-invariant. So do the operators in SMEFT have to respect Poincare symmetry? I think so because the point is to maintain the same symmetry structure as the Standard Model. So option 2, Poincare symmetry, must be respected as well.

Hmm, but wait. Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. So if all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz scalars, they automatically respect Lorentz symmetry. But do they respect Poincare? Well, for a theory to be Poincare-invariant, the Lagrangian must be invariant under translations, which means the equations of motion are such that the stress-energy tensor is conserved. But in effective theories, especially non-renormalizable ones like SMEFT, the operators have higher dimensions, so I'm not sure. But I think that the operators in SMEFT are constructed such that the theory remains Poincare-invariant. Because if they weren't, the whole framework wouldn't make sense. So I think both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required.

Moving on to CP symmetry (option 3). CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric because of processes like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So if the SMEFT includes terms beyond the Standard Model, including possible sources of CP violation, then the operators don't necessarily have to preserve CP symmetry. Therefore, option 3, CP symmetry, isn't a must for all operators in SMEFT. Operators might violate CP, depending on what new physics is being considered.

Then, CPT symmetry (option 4). CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. I remember that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Because the theory's Lorentz symmetry implies the existence of a certain symmetry that combines C, P, and T. So if the SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry (which it must), then it must also respect CPT symmetry. So option 4, CPT symmetry, is a must.

Putting it all together, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, wait. But earlier I was considering whether Poincare is required. Let me think again. Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. SMEFT includes higher-dimension operators, but the theory still should be Poincare-invariant because it's an effective theory built on the SM which is Poincare-invariant. So yes, Poincare must be respected.

Wait, but wait another point. I'm a bit confused. Because SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it's still supposed to be Lorentz and Poincare symmetric, right? Because it's just adding higher-dimensional terms without breaking those symmetries. So all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. Also, since they respect Lorentz, they must respect CPT. So the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 1 and 2. That's Lorentz and Poincare.

Option C is 1,2,4. That's Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but the question is which must be respected by all operators. So the correct answer would include 1, 2, and 4. So the option is C.

Wait, but the original options are:

A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

So option C is 1,2,4.

But wait, earlier I thought Poincare is required because SMEFT is built on the SM, which is Poincare-invariant. So all operators should respect that. So yes, the correct answer should include 1,2,4. So the answer is option C.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic effective field theory, meaning all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This ensures the theory remains consistent with special relativity, and operators must form Lorentz scalars. Thus, Lorentz symmetry is a must.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translational invariance. Since SMEFT is built upon the Standard Model, which respects Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect this symmetry. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry is required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model already violates CP symmetry (e.g., through CP violation in the CKM matrix). SMEFT, as an effective theory, can include operators that respect or violate CP symmetry depending on the new physics considered. Thus, CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, CPT symmetry is a requirement.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is:

**C) 1,2,4**

Answer: C
