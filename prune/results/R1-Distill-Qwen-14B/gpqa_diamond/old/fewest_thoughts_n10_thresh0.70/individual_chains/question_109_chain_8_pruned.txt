Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We're supposed to find out which partial wave is not permitted, given the options.

Hmm, okay. So let's break this down step by step.

First, the initial state is 1S0. The notation 1S0 is given, which I think refers to the spin state. Wait, the problem statement says that the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). Oh, right, so the 1S0 state: the 1 comes from (2S+1) = 1, so S must be 0. So S=0. Then L is denoted by the S in the symbol, so L=0 (since S0 implies L=0?), wait, no. Wait, the term symbol is written as (2S+1)L J, so 1S0 must mean S=0, L=0, and J=0? Because 2*0+1=1, so term is 1S0, meaning S=0, L=0, J=0. Oh, right, I think J = L + S, so since L and S are both 0, J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0. Also, the parity of the initial state would be (-1)^L, which is (-1)^0 = +1.

When the two nucleons emit a particle X, the total system must conserve angular momentum and parity. Also, the Pauli statistics condition given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since the final T(NN) is 0, so 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. Which implies S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must sum to an odd number. So S and L must have opposite parity.

Wait, let me get this right. So S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So for the final state, the NN pair must have S and L such that S + L is odd. So either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.

The problem is about the partial waves of the emitted particle X. Partial wave refers to the orbital angular momentum state, so the lowercase letters like p, s, d, f correspond to L=1, 0, 2, 3, etc. So the emitted particle's angular momentum state affects the orbital angular momentum of the NN system.

Wait, so when the NN system emits X, which has orbital angular momentum l, the NN's orbital angular momentum L' must combine with l to give the initial L. But wait, the initial state has L=0, right? Because
