Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E. The given E is equal to (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²), which I think is the standard energy level formula for a single particle in a 1D infinite well.

Hmm, so I remember that for a single particle in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² E), where n is the principal quantum number. So for n=1, E1 = E; n=2, E2 = 4E; n=3, E3=9E; and so on.

But wait, in this case, there are four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system. So each particle has to have a unique quantum state.

In a 1D infinite potential well, the quantum numbers depend on the state, which is determined by the energy level n and the spin. But wait, spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states: up and down. So for each spatial state (n), there are two possible spin states.

So the first thing I need to figure out is how these four particles fill up the available quantum states. Let's start with the ground state.

The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration possible. Since the particles are fermions, each must occupy a unique quantum state. So let's think about how they can fill up the states.

Each spatial state n can hold two particles (with spin up and down). So the spatial states are filled in order of increasing n.

So for four particles, I need to see how they fill up the lowest available n's.

Let me list the possible states:

n=1: can hold 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: can hold 2 particles
n=3: can hold 2, but I might not need that here.

So with four particles:

- The first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins)
- The next two go into n=2 (each with opposite spins
