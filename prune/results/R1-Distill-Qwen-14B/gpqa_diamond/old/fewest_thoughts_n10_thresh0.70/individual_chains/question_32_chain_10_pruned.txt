Alright, I'm trying to figure out the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Okay, so nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So, the isotope would be Li-6 because Li typically has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, the mass number is 6, meaning the nucleus is a ^6Li nucleus.

Wait, the problem says it's Li with 3 neutrons, so yeah, that's ^6Li. So the mass of the nucleus would be important here. I remember that in particle physics, the energy calculations involve the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach.

The speed is 0.96c, which is pretty high, so relativistic effects are definitely in play. I think I need to use the relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a particle is given by gamma times its rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v = 0.96c. So v² is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so yeah, 1/0.28 is 3.57142857...

Wait, wait, no: the square root is 0.28? Hmm, wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, correct, but the square root of 0.0784 is 0.28? Because 0.28^2 = 0.0784. So yeah, the square root of 0.078
