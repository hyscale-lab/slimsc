Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with various pH values. Hmm, I think I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider neutralization reactions.

Wait, right. So, first, I should calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because when you mix them, some of them will react. Let's list out the components:

1. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid. It has a concentration of 0.1 M in 500 mL.
2. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid, 0.2 M in 400 mL.
3. Barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2) is a strong base, 0.3 M in 300 mL.

I think the first step is to find the moles for each. Moles = Molarity Ã— Volume (in liters).

Calculating each:

For CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.
HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.
Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

Wait a second, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, right? So the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the HCl is a strong acid, so it'll completely dissociate into H+ and Cl-. Moles of H+ from HCl is 0.08.

The acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But when I mix it with the strong base (Ba(OH)2), I think the H+ from acetic acid will react with OH- from the base.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because when you mix an acid and a base, they neutralize each other. So, the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So, the total H+ available is from HCl and CH3COOH. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't contribute as much H+ as a strong acid. But in the presence of a base, maybe it dissociates more?

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, let's find the total H+ and OH- contributions.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Total OH
