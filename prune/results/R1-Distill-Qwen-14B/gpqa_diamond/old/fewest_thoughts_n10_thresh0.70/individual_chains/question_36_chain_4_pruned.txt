Okay, so I have this question about absorption lines in the Milky Way. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question says that observations are being done at about 2.1 gigaparsecs away. That's a pretty large distance, so we're looking at structures that are really far away. The absorption line they detected has an energy equivalent of 3.9 micro electron volts. Wait, 3.9e-6 eV—that's a very small amount of energy.

I remember that in the interstellar medium (ISM), different regions have different temperatures and densities, which influence the energy of the emitted or absorbed photons. So the energy of the absorption line probably relates to the temperature of the medium.

Oh right! The energy of the photons absorbed is related to the thermal motion of the electrons in the gas. The formula I think is E = k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant. So higher temperature leads to higher energy photons.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the units right. The energy here is about 3.9 micro eV, which is 3.9e-6 eV. Let's convert that to Kelvin. Boltzmann's constant is 8.617e-5 eV per Kelvin. So if E = k*T, then T = E/(k).

So T = (3.9e-6 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ (3.9 / 86.17) K. Let me compute that. 3.9 divided by about 86.17 is roughly 0.0452 K. So about 0.045 K. That's really cold, just a few tenths of a Kelvin.

Wait, that's extremely cold. So the medium that's causing this absorption is at around 0.05 K. What part of the ISM is that? I remember that the ISM is divided into different regions based on temperature. The cold regions are around 10-100 K, but wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, the cold neutral medium (CNM) in the ISM is around 70-100 K, right? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, no, I think the cold molecular clouds are actually colder. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the interstellar medium is categorized into warm, hot, and cold components. The warm component, Warm Neutral Medium (WNM),
