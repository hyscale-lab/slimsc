Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR problem, and honestly, I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The 1H NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four possible pairs of compounds.

Wait, wait. The molecular formula is C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation for that. So, degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are zero. So, (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation. That's likely a benzene ring (which accounts for 3) and one double bond or a ring and a double bond. Wait, but since benzene is a ring with three double bonds, maybe it's just one ring and the rest is single bonds. So the two compounds are likely tetramethylbenzenes or something similar.

Looking at the options, all the compounds except option C are tetramethylbenzenes. Wait, option C includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which I don't think is a tetramethyl. Let me check each option:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl. Both have four methyl groups on benzene.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl and 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, diethyl would be two ethyl groups attached, but the molecular formula... wait, the compound is C10H14. Each diethyl group is C2H5. So benzene (C6H5) plus two ethyl groups: 6 + 2*2 =10 carbons. Each eth
