Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's read through it again. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, actually, that's a bit confusing because usually, quantum states are represented as column vectors with complex numbers and normalized. But here, the elements are -1, 2, and 1. Oh, maybe they're just real numbers, but I should check if they're normalized. Let me compute the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6), right? So the state vector is not normalized. But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are typically normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components is 1. So maybe I should normalize this state first. Or maybe the question assumes it's already normalized? Hmmm. Wait, the question doesn't mention normalization, but I think it's necessary. So perhaps the actual state is the given vector divided by sqrt(6). So the state vector is 1/sqrt(6) times the column vector (-1, 2, 1). I'll proceed with that assumption.

The system's state is |ψ> = [ [-1], [2], [1] ] / sqrt(6). 

Now, there are two observables, P and Q. The operator for P is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that down.

P = 
[ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ],
  [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
  [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ] ]

And the operator for Q is another 3x3 matrix:

Q = 
[ [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -1] ]

The question is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, the way measurements work is that when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the measurement of P will give an eigenvalue, and the state will collapse to the corresponding eigenvector. Then, the measurement of Q will be performed on this new state.

So the approach should be:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

2. Determine which eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue 0, because the measurement of P resulted in 0.

3. Then, express the initial state |ψ> in terms of the eigenbasis of P. The coefficient (amplitude) corresponding to the 0 eigenvalue will give the probability of measuring 0 for P.

4. Once the state collapses to that eigenvector, apply the measurement of Q to compute the probability of getting -1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the probabilities step by step.

Let me think step by step.

First, find the eigenstates of P.

The matrix P is symmetric, so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

But wait, what's the structure of P? Let me compute the eigenvalues. Hmm, perhaps there's a pattern. Let me see.

Looking at P:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, this looks like a symmetric matrix. Let me attempt to find the eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that P has a certain structure. Let me denote the basis vectors as |1>, |2>, |3>.

Looking at P, the (1,
