Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about stability constants and coordination complexes. Hmm, let's see what it's about. 

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the stability constants. I remember that the stability constant, β, is a measure of the extent to which a complex forms. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So each β corresponds to a different complex.

But wait, what complexes are we talking about here? I think for Co(II) and SCN-, the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^n-, where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached. So the stability constants β1, β2, β3, β4 probably correspond to the complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 SCN- ligands, respectively.

Wait, but I thought β usually refers to the formation of the complex step by step. Like, for each step, you have a β. So for the first ligand, β1 is the formation constant
