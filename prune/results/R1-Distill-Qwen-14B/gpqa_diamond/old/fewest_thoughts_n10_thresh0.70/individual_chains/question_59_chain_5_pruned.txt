Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the pH of a solution made by mixing some strong and weak acids and a strong base. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution that's made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂.

Wait, so I need to find the pH after all these are mixed together. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you need to consider if they neutralize each other. But since some are strong and some are weak, it's a bit more complicated.

First, let me list all the components:

1. CH3COOH: That's acetic acid, which is a weak acid. It doesn't dissociate completely.
2. HCl: That's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely.
3. Ba(OH)₂: That's barium hydroxide, a strong base. It will dissociate completely into Ba²+ and OH⁻ ions.

So the plan is probably to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- contributed by each component, then see which one is in excess. If there's excess OH-, the solution will be basic; if H+ is in excess, acidic. If they balance, pH is 7.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't contribute as much H+ as a strong acid. But HCl is strong, so it'll contribute a lot. Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, so OH- will come from that.

Let's calculate the moles for each.

First, for each solution, I need to calculate the moles by multiplying volume (in liters) by molarity.

1. Acetic acid (CH3COOH):
Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L
Molarity = 0.1 M
Moles = 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol.

Hmm, but that's the moles of acetic acid. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't release all of it as H+.

2. HCl:
Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L
Molarity = 0.2 M
Moles = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 mol.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl⁻. So 0.08 mol H+.

3. Ba(OH)₂:
It dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH⁻.

Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L
Molarity = 0.3 M
Moles Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol.

Each mole gives 2 moles OH⁻, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol OH⁻.

Wait, but when you mix them, the H+ and OH- will react. Let me think about the total solution's volume.

Wait, the solutions are all mixed together. So the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

But before that, let's calculate the total H+ and OH-.

Wait, but the strong acid and strong base will react. So H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)₂ will neutralize each other. But the acetic acid is a weak acid; perhaps some of it might be neutralized as well, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

So, the reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O.

The total H+ comes from HCl and any that
