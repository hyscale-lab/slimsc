Alright, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR can be tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

Okay, the question says that a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the formula C10H14. Their 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals (singlets) around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm (singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, I remember that aromatic protons in NMR typically show up between 6.5-8.5 ppm. Since these are singlets, that suggests that the aromatic protons are equivalent and not split into multiple peaks. So each compound must have a set of equivalent aromatic protons, perhaps in a symmetric structure.

The other signals are at 2.2 ppm, which is around where methyl groups (CH3) attached to something like a benzene ring or another CH2 group might show up. But wait, 2.2 is more typical for a CH3 adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like maybe in an isopropyl group or attached to a ring. Or perhaps it's a simple methyl group on a benzene ring where the deshielding isn't too strong.

But wait, the three signals at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. So that means these three signals are different from each other. Let me thinkâ€”maybe they're due to different types of methyl groups in each structure.

Let me look at the options and see the structures.

The options are:

A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene

Wait, each option is a pair of compounds. So each compound in the mixture is a tetramethylbenzene except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let me think about their structures.

First, let's consider all the options except C because option C has diethyl groups, which are -CH2CH2- attached. Those would likely show up as triplet or other splitting patterns, but the given NMR has singlets at 2.2 ppm. So if any of the compounds in the mixture have diethyl groups, those CH2 groups would split into multiplets, not singlets. So if option C is an option, maybe it's not the correct answer. Because if one compound is 1,4-diethylbenzene, the ethyl groups would produce more complex splitting. Let me think.

Wait, but the NMR shows three signals at 2.2 ppm, each a singlet. So if one of the compounds has diethyl
