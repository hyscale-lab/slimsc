Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there's a planet, let's call it Planet A, with a radius of 1 Earth radius. It's in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and the orbital period is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet, Planet B, with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have so that it exhibits both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in the same orbital plane, and their orbits are circular.

Hmm, okay. So, transit and occultation events happen when the planets pass in front of and behind the star (from our point of view), respectively. For both events to occur, their orbital periods must be such that their orbital velocities allow them to both transit and occult. 

I remember that for a planet to transit, it must pass directly in front of the star from our perspective. The impact parameter is the measure of how close the planet's path comes to the center of the star. A lower impact parameter means a closer approach to the center.

Wait, the impact parameter here is given as 0.2 for Planet A. But how does that help me? Maybe it's not directly needed for calculating the period, but it gives some information about the alignment of the two planets.

I think the key here is the concept of orbital period and how their orbital speeds relate. Since both planets are orbiting the same star, the more massive the star, the faster the planets must orbit to maintain their orbits. But wait, the star's mass isn't given here. Oh wait, the star's radius is given as 1.5 solar radii, but radius and mass aren't directly proportional. For main-sequence stars, a larger radius usually implies a higher mass, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Hmm, maybe I can assume the star is similar to the Sun? Or perhaps I need to take into account the star's mass via Kepler's laws.

Wait, the star's mass is probably necessary to calculate the orbital periods. But wait, the orbital period of Planet A is given as 3 days, so maybe I can find the star's mass relative to the Sun using Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law states that (P^2)/(a^3) = 4π²/(G(M+m)) ≈ (4π²)/(G M) since the planet's mass is negligible. But since we're dealing with units where the Sun is the reference, perhaps we can express it in terms of the Earth's orbit.

Alternatively, the formula for Kepler's third law in astronomical units (AU) and years is P² = a³/(M), where M is the mass of the star in solar masses. But wait, since we're dealing with days and Earth radii, maybe I should use SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the periods of the two planets using their orbital radii. Because both planets are orbiting the same star, their periods squared would be proportional to their semi-major axes cubed. Since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is just the radius.

So, P² ∝ a³/(M), but M is the same for both planets, so P² is proportional to a³.

Wait, but how do I find the semi-major axis (a) for each planet? For Planet A, I know the period is 3 days. So if I can find a in terms of the star's radius, perhaps that's the way to go.

Wait, but I don't have the semi-major axis for Planet A. Hmm. Maybe I can relate the transit impact parameter to the size of the planet's orbit.

The transit impact parameter (b) is defined as the distance from the center of the star to the closest point of the planet's path, divided by the star's radius. So, b = (distance from star's center to planet's path) / R_star.

Wait, the formula is: b = (d) / R_*, where d is the actual distance from the star's center to the planet's path. So, d = b * R_*.

But how does that relate to the semi-major axis (a) of the planet? Well, the planet's orbit is a circle of radius a, and the impact parameter is based on the chord of the orbit during transit. Wait, maybe it's more about the geometry of the transit.

Wait, the planet's path during transit is along a chord of its orbit. The impact parameter (b) is the perpendicular distance from the star's center to that chord. So, using some geometry, the relation between the semi-major axis (a), the
