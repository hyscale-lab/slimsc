Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a diatomic molecule, made of atoms X and Y, is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. Oh right, this is the non-rigid rotor model, which accounts for both rotational and vibrational energy states. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

The given data:
- Mass of X (Mx) is 20 amu.
- Mass of Y (My) is 2 amu.
- Bond length R is 2 angstroms.
- Angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

The options are four different momenta values.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in its ground state. To switch to the next lowest state, I think it's about absorbing a photon that provides the energy difference between the current state and the next possible state.

But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and consist of both rotational and vibrational parts. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But wait, the problem says 'next state with the lowest possible energy'
