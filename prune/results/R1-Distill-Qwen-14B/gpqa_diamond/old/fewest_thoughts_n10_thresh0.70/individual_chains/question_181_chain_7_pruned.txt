Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, the Sun's core is where fusion happens. The pp chain is the proton-proton chain, right? And the pp-III branch is a specific part of that. So, if the pp-III stops, what does that mean for the neutrinos?

I remember that the pp chain produces neutrinos, mainly electron neutrinos. The main branches are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each branch contributes to the total neutrino flux. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing a significant fraction of the neutrinos, especially at higher energies.

Neutrinos produced at different depths in the Sun have different energies. The pp-III reactions happen deeper in the core, so maybe the neutrinos they produce are higher energy? Or wait, no, the deeper you go, the higher the temperature, so maybe the neutrinos from pp-III are higher energy than those from the other branches.

If the pp-III branch stops, how does that affect the neutrino flux in different energy bands? The bands given are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, band 1 is lower energy, band 2 higher.

I think that the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are at higher energies. So, if pp-III stops, the flux in higher energy bands (like band 2) would drop more than the lower ones. But wait, band 1 is 700-800, which is lower than band 2, which is 800-900. So, if pp-III is the main source for higher energy neutrinos, then without it, the flux in band 2 (which is higher energy) would decrease more than band 1.

But wait, wait. I should think about how much each branch contributes to each band. Suppose the pp-III branch produces a lot of the higher energy neutrinos. So, if it stops, band 2 flux would drop a lot, while band 1's flux
