Okay, so I've got this IUPAC naming problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents. The substituents are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is like an aldehyde group attached to the ring), and a cyano group (CN). All three of these are meta to each other. That means each is separated by one carbon, right? Because meta substituents are on positions 1,3,5 or similar.

Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl group (OH) and a dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2). Wait, so the carboxylic acid is attached to the ring, and the OH and N(CH3)2 are on the adjacent carbons. That would be positions 2 and 4 if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Wait, the benzene ring is a six-membered ring. Let's number the positions starting from the carboxylic acid. Let's say the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, the meta positions would be 3 and 5. So the carbaldehyde and cyano are either at 3 and 5 or 5 and 3.

Wait, the question says all three are meta to each other. Wait, that's tricky. Three substituents, each meta. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is in position 1, the cyano in position 3, and the aldehyde in position 5? Or another arrangement.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. Let me visualize the benzene ring. Let's imagine position 1 is the carboxylic acid (COOH). Then, the meta positions would be 3 and 5. So, the carbaldehyde (CHO) and cyano (CN) are at positions 3 and 5. Alternatively, maybe it's another arrangement.

But wait, the question says "all meta to one another." So, each substituent is meta to the others. So, if one is at 1, the next would be at 3, and the third at 5. So, COOH at 1, CHO at 3, and CN at 5? Or another order.

Additionally, orth
