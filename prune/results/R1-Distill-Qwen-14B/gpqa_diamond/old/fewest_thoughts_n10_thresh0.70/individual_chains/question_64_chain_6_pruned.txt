Okay, let me try to work through this chemistry problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the problem is about an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, that weigh 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200Â°C without air. Then, the gases formed pass through several tubes with different reagents. 

The results are:
- Tube 1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60g.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) doesn't change.
- Tube 3 (red-hot copper) gains 0.80g, forming CuO.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, when salts A and B are heated, they decompose to form gases. These gases pass through three tubes. 

Tube 1 with Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent. When it absorbs water, it gains weight. So, maybe the gas is water vapor (H2O)? But Mg(ClO4)2 is used for drying because it can absorb water. So, if the weight increased by 3.60g, that might be the mass of H2O absorbed. 

Wait, but another possibility is that the gas is something else, like HCl, but Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's ClO3 or something else. Wait, no, perhaps it's moisture. So, if the gas is H2O, the Mg(ClO4)2 would react as a desiccant. So, let's tentatively say tube 1's gain is water.

So, 3.60g is the mass of H2O. Let me calculate moles of H2O. Molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.60g / 18g/mol = 0.2 mol.

So, if H2O is produced, that might suggest that salts A and B could be containing some hydroxide or something that decomposes into H2O. Alternatively, perhaps they are chlorides or nitrates that release H2O upon heating.

Next, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas doesn't react, it means the gas doesn't react with a strong base. So, the gas after tube 1 isn't acidic enough to react with Ca(OH)2. Or maybe it's an inert gas. But considering the context of decomposition products, it's probably a neutral gas. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a noble gas, but that's less likely. More probably, the gas is something like NH3, CO2, or maybe N2, O2, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but if the gas doesn't react with Ca(OH)2, then it isn't acidic. So, perhaps the gas is nitrogen or carbon monoxide? Hmm. Alternatively,
