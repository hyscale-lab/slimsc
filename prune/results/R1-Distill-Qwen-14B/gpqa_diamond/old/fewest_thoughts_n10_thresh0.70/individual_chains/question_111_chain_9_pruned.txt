Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem has two parts, Part A and Part B, and I need to find the major products for each. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with possible products for A and B. Let me tackle each part separately.

Starting with Part A: The reactant is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, and it's reacting with ethyl acrylate under the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this might be an example of an enolate formation and some kind of conjugate addition or maybe a Michael addition.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclohexanone with substituents. Let me draw the structure. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1. Positions 2 has an ethyl and a methyl (since it's 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl?), Wait, no. Wait, 2-ethyl would be an ethyl group on C2, and 2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl groups on C2 and C6. So C2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group attached. That would make the structure a bit crowded around C2.

Now, when t-BuOK is used, it's likely to deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. But wait, the ketone is at C1. So the alpha carbons are C2 and the cyclohexane positions adjacent to the ketone. But wait, in a cyclohexanone, the alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl, which would be C2 and C6. But in this case, C2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group, making it more substituted. Deprotonation would likely occur at the less hindered position because bulky bases prefer to abstract protons that are more accessible, following the bulky base effect (like in the formation of the more substituted enolate in the case of conjugate addition, but wait, here it's an enolate
