Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and photon momentum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon, causing it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh right, the molecule is modeled with the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. So I need to consider both rotational and vibrational energy transitions.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the absorbed photon. Photons carry momentum, and that's related to their energy. The momentum p of a photon is given by p = E/c, where E is the energy and c is the speed of light. So if I can find the energy of the photon, I can find the momentum.

Now, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. When it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state. But wait, what's the next state? Oh, I remember that for a diatomic molecule, the states are quantized in both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is when both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their lowest. So the next state could involve a change in either rotation or vibration.

But wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, that probably means the molecule transitions to the state with the next higher energy, which would be the first excited state. The next state with the lowest energy could be either the
