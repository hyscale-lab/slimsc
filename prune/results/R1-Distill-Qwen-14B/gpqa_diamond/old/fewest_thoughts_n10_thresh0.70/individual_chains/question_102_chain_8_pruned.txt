Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving transmembrane receptors and ligands, and some sort of genetic constructs. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is a bit complex, but I'll start by understanding what's being asked. So, they've created a bicistronic vector with ligand and receptor ORFs. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So both the ligand and receptor are being expressed from the same vector.

The setup is a lox-Cre vector. I remember that loxP sites are used in genetic recombination, often with Cre/LoxP systems to excise specific DNA segments. So, in this case, the vector has two lox sites. The ligand is at the 5' position with a stop cassette, and the receptor is at 3' with another stop cassette.

The ligand ORF is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think, so that's probably driving the expression of the ligand. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which can lead to the expression of a second gene without a traditional promoter. So, in bicistronic constructs, the first gene is under a promoter, and the second is under the control of an IRES, allowing it to be expressed as a separate mRNA or perhaps in a different way.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry (which is a fluorescent protein), there's a stop cassette with loxP. So, the ligand is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop in between. Similarly, the receptor is fused to eGFP with a lox2272 stop cassette. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites for Cre. LoxP is the standard site, and Lox2272 is another variant, I think, which Cre can also recognize but perhaps in a different orientation.

So, the idea is that when Cre is expressed, it will recombine these lox sites. If the Cre is active, it should excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand to be expressed with mCherry and the receptor with eGFP.

Now, the experiment: They transfected primary astrocyte cultures with this plasmid and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, meaning loading was correct. So, the proteins were being expressed enough to show up on the blot. But when they crossed the mouse model (homozygous for the construct in a wildtype background) to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, the offspring were born, and they looked for green signal under confocal. They didn't see any green.

The question is why there's no green signal. The options are A to D.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in the experiment, why would that matter? The Cre is from SOX10, which is expressed in neural crest cells. Wait, but the construct would be in the mouse, so the Cre would be active in certain tissues. If the ligand and receptor are paracrine, maybe they're acting on each other, but the eGFP is on the receptor. So, the lack of green signal could be because the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed. But why?

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. The eGFP is on the receptor, which is a transmembrane protein. If it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't be on the cell surface, so the antibody might not detect it, but in the Western blot, they should have detected it regardless of localization because the total proteins are being used. Wait, the Western blot uses total proteins, so whether it's in the membrane or cytoplasm, it should be present
