Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem starts with cyclohexanone and goes through a series of reactions, ending up with product 4. Then, we're supposed to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are A to D, with numbers 6, 8, 10, and 7.

Alright, let's break down each step.

First, cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, forming product 1. I remember that when ketones react with bromine, it's typically a halogenation. Wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone group. So, bromine addition—wait, no, more likely, it's an addition reaction. But wait, ketones don't react with bromine directly in a way that adds Br across the carbonyl, right? Or do they? Oh wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait—bromine could be adding to the carbonyl, but that's more for aldehydes or ketones in a different context. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: cyclohexanone has an alpha position. The alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. So when you treat a ketone with bromine, perhaps it undergoes bromination via the enol mechanism. That's right! So, cyclohexanone would form an enol, which can then react with Br2. So product 1 would be 2-bromocyclohexanone. Or wait, wait—when a ketone undergoes bromination, it's usually adding a bromine to the alpha position. So cyclohexanone (which has two alpha carbons, each with two H's) would add Br at one of those positions. So product 1 would be 2-bromocyclohexanone. 

Wait, but wait, how does that happen? Oh, right. The mechanism is that the ketone is deprotonated (enolate formation) in the presence of a base, but wait, bromine is a good electrophile. So the enol would attack the bromine. Alternatively, the enol is formed
