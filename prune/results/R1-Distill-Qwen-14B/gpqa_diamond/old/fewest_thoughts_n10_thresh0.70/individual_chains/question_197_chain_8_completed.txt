Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in what's called the hydroxymercuration reaction, or maybe it's for demercuration? Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when you have an alkene reacting with red phosphorus and HI, it's usually a halogenation reaction. Specifically, it's the hydrohalogenation but under certain conditions. Oh wait, no—red phosphorus and HI is used for the addition of HI to alkenes via a radical mechanism? Or is it for anti-Markovnikov addition? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another thought: I think that when an alkene reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it's for the formation of a vicinal dihalide. Or wait, no—maybe it's for the cleavage of the double bond. Oh, right! I remember now. Red phosphorus is used with HI for the cleavage of alkenes. It's called the oxymercuration reaction? No, wait. I'm getting confused. Oh, wait—maybe when HI is used along with red phosphorus, it's for the hydroxylation of alkenes, but I'm not certain. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Markovnikov addition. Wait, no. Wait, no, Markovnikov's rule is about where the H adds in an acid-catalyzed addition. But red phosphorus in HI—I think that's the method for the addition of iodine and H. Alternatively, perhaps it's the addition of HI to the double bond in an anti-Markovnikov fashion.

Wait, perhaps I should first figure out what Compound X is, because the reaction is on it, and the product is to be determined.

So, let's look at the spectral data given for Compound X.

The IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad range suggests maybe an -OH stretch, or maybe an N-H or something else. But looking at the other IR peaks, 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches.

So for the IR, broad around 3400 suggests maybe an alcohol, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 as a broad peak, and their carbonyl is around 1700. So that's possible. Alternatively, maybe an ester? Ester carbonyls are around 1720-1740, so 1720 is in that range. An aldehyde is higher, around 1720 too, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm in NMR.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet. That could be an aldehyde proton (but that's usually around 9-10), but aldehydes are usually deshielded and show up around 9-10, but in the case of an aromatic aldehyde, maybe higher? Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid O-H. Wait, but carboxylic acids have O-H stretches in IR, but in NMR, if it's a broad peak around 10.5, that's more indicative of a phenolic OH or perhaps an aldehyde. But wait, the other thing is that if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be around 10-12 as a broad peak. But in the NMR, that's 10.5 ppm, broad, 1H. So maybe a carboxylic acid.

But wait, the IR shows a 1720 cm-1, which for a carboxylic acid, that's a bit high because carboxylic acids usually have lower wavenumber for C=O (around 1700). Hmm, but maybe it's an ester or a ketone? Oh wait, but then the 3400–2500 might be an -OH from an alcohol or maybe an amine, but I don't see any NMR signals that would suggest an amine.

Wait, but the NMR has a d (doublet) at 8.0 ppm (2H) and another d at 7.2 ppm (2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Let me think: a para-disubstituted benzene would have two doublets in the aromatic region. So if the substituents are in the para positions, the protons are each two sets of doublets. So that would fit.

So the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, each integrating to 2H. Let's say that the more downfield (8.0) is the proton next to an electron-withdrawing group, and the 7.2 is next to electron-donating.

So, assuming para substitution, what groups could be there? If there's a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid, attached to the ring, that would cause the downfield shift.

Wait, but let's look at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a terminal CH2CH3 group. Like an ethyl group. The 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to something that splits into a doublet. Maybe a CH(CH3) group? Because the doublet for 3H would be from a methyl adjacent to another CH that's split into a doublet.

Wait, let's consider a structure. If there's a benzene ring, with substituents, and perhaps a side chain.

So, if the ring is para-substituted, say, with a substituent X and another substituent Y in para positions.

Looking at the substituents:

If the ring has two substituents, one being an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl) and another being an ethyl group. Or maybe the substituents are in such a way that the downfield shift is due to the substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and an isobutyl group or something similar.

Wait, the NMR also has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a terminal CH2CH3. So perhaps the side chain is an ethyl group attached to something else.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH that's itself attached to something else. For example, in an isobutyl group: the isobutyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the substituents. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH which is part of a larger group. So maybe it's a CH(CH3) group, as part of a longer chain.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a multiplet, which could be a CH next to another CH.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that's a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and another group that's a side chain leading to an ethyl group.

Wait, another thought: the 10.5 ppm peak is likely the aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes typically appear around 9-10 ppm. But wait, what about a phenol? Phenolic OHs can be broad but are usually in the 5-7 ppm range. So 10.5 seems more aldehyde-like.

But if it's an aldehyde, then the IR would have a strong peak around 2820 and 2720 (the aldehyde C-H stretches), but in the given IR, the broad region is 3400–2500, which includes the O-H and N-H regions. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm peak could be a carboxylic acid -OH. Because carboxylic acids typically have broad peaks around 10-12 ppm. But in that case, the IR would show a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm-1. The given IR does have 3400–2500, which could include the O-H stretch.

But then the 1720 cm-1 in IR would fit a carboxylic acid, but actually, carboxylic acids have lower wavenumbers for C=O, around 1700. Maybe 1720 could be an ester or a ketone.

Wait, but let me think again. The NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak, which is a broad singlet (bs, 1H). If that's a carboxylic acid -OH, why is the IR showing a 1720 cm-1? That's a higher wavenumber than typical for a carboxylic acid. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde. Aldehydes have C=O around 1720, which matches the IR. But then, where's the aldehyde proton? In the NMR, 10.5 is a bit upfield for an aldehyde, but possible. Also, aldehyde protons usually are sharp singlets, but in this case, it's a broad singlet. Hmm, maybe it's under exchange with water or something else, or it's a different environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative. So let's consider that.

So, structure: para-substituted benzaldehyde, with another substituent. Let's say para to the aldehyde group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons. So if it's benzaldehyde with another substituent, then the aldehyde would be in the meta or para position. Wait, no, if the substituent is in the para position, then the aldehyde would be in the ortho or meta. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a ketone group and a side chain.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group attached to the ring. Let me think. The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests an ethyl group (CH2CH3). The 1.4 ppm doublet (d,3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps a structure like Ph-CH2-C(CH3)2? No, wait. Let me think about it.

If we have a CH(CH3) group attached to a CH2, which is attached to the benzene ring. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't fit because the triplet at 0.9 would be from the end CH2 group. So maybe it's Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something? Hmm, perhaps it's a isopropyl group or a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the side chain is a secondary or tertiary butyl group. Let me think in terms of the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a multiplet, which is a single proton. That suggests a CH group connected to something else. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) are two protons, maybe a CH2 next to a CH.

Putting this together, the side chain could be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH3? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a isobutyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, let's consider that the side chain is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the structure would be benzene ring with a substituent like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something? Or wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH that is split into a doublet. So if the CH has two adjacent Hs, the CH would split into a triplet, but here it's a doublet. Hmm, maybe the CH is only adjacent to one other proton. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is attached to a CH that is part of a larger structure.

Wait, let's think about an isobutyl group. An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. No, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- as a substituent? Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe it's a tert-butyl group. But the tert-butyl group would have a singlet for the nine equivalent Hs, but in the NMR, we have a doublet for 3H, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Like, if the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Wait, but how would that fit with the NMR signals?

Wait, let's try to draw the structure.

Assuming the benzene ring is para-substituted. One substituent is X, and the other is Y.

Suppose substituent X is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), and substituent Y is an isobutyl group.

Wait, but let's think about the IR. The IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So it could be a ketone, an aldehyde, an ester, or a carboxylic acid.

If it's a ketone, then the peak would be around 1720. The NMR would not have an aldehyde proton then, unless it's another group, but the NMR shows a 10.5 ppm peak which is a singlet.

Wait, but if the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, then the NMR would not have that 10.5 peak as a carbonyl doesn't produce an NMR signal. So the 10.5 would need to be something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, an acyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options given and see if that helps.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So the options are all substituted benzenes.

Option A: propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group. So the structure would be benzene ring with an ethyl group in the 4 position and a propanoic acid group attached to the 2 position. Wait, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would be CH2CH2-COOH attached to the benzene? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring has a benzoic acid group (COOH) in the para position and a sec-butyl group in the 4 position? Wait, no, wait. 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have the benzoic acid group in the para position relative to the sec-butyl group. So the substituents are in para positions.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So benzene with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. But that's the same as para substitution, so methyl and sec-butyl are opposite each other.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So the benzene has an isobutyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4.

Wait, but let's get back to the NMR and IR.

If the compound is a benzoic acid, like option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

In that structure, the substituents are a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

So the NMR would have:

- The aromatic protons would be in two doublets, as in para-substituted benzene. The protons adjacent to the COOH would be more deshielded and appear downfield, and the ones adjacent to the sec-butyl would be more shielded and upfield.

The COOH group would have its O-H peak in the NMR around 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet. The IR would show a strong O-H stretch around 3000-2500 cm-1, and the C=O stretch around 1700. But in the given IR, the C=O is at 1720, which is a bit higher than typical for a benzoic acid, but possible.

Wait, but the NMR for benzoic acid would have the O-H as a broad peak, which matches. The aromatic region would be two doublets. So let's think about that.

In 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. The protons adjacent to the COOH would be more deshielded and appear around 8.0 ppm, and the ones adjacent to the sec-butyl would be upfield, maybe around 7.2 ppm. That matches the NMR data given.

Now, the side chain:

The substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's look at the NMR signals for that.

A sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, wait. The structure of sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): This is probably the CH group in the sec-butyl. Because in a sec-butyl group, the CH is attached to two CH2 groups and the benzene. So the CH proton would be a multiplet due to coupling with adjacent protons.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): These could be the two protons on the adjacent CH2 group, which is attached to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): This could be the methyl group attached to the CH.

Wait, but in a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. No, wait, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3), but that's for isobutyl. Wait, no: the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the ring? No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- but that's for isobutyl. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's a straight chain.

Isobutyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-.

Sec-butyl would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure is:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3

- isobutyl: CH(CH2CH3)CH2-

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The four carbons in butyl:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3

sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)- ?

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

So it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is actually -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring? No, wait, perhaps it's -(CH2)2CH(CH3)- ?

Wait, no. Let me visualize the structure. The substituent is a butyl group attached via the second carbon (the 'sec' position). So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. Wait, that would make the substituent -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's a three-carbon chain with a branching. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the NMR signals of the substituent.

The substituent's NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Probably the CH group in a sec-butyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): The two Hs on the CH2 next to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): The CH3 attached to the CH.

So, for a sec-butyl group, the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- ?

Wait, no. Let me think of the substituent as Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group. But the isopropyl group would have a singlet for the methyl groups, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which suggests coupling. So maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So, the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, not quite.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group that's sec. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. But that would make it a pentyl group? Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but that's an isopropyl group.

Wait, let me think about the NMR.

The substituent's NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): This is a CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): These are two Hs on a CH2.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): A CH3 group attached to a CH.

So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-something. The CH(CH3) is attached to another CH2, which is attached to the benzene.

Wait, so the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, that would be a pentyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to a CH2, but that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it a isobutyl group.

Wait, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but that would have a CH(CH3)2 group attached via a CH2 to the ring. Hmm.

But in that case, the NMR of the substituent would have:

- The CH2 group next to the ring would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH. So the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be the CH2 next to the ring.

The CH(CH3)2 group would have the central CH with two methyl groups. So the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be the CH group, and the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the methyl groups, but wait, in a CH(CH3)2 group, the methyl groups would be attached to a CH that's split by the adjacent CH2. So the methyl groups would be in a triplet or something else.

Hmm, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. So that suggests that the CH3 is attached to a CH, which is split by a neighboring CH2.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH3)- group. Like, the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

But that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group where the CH3 is attached to the CH, which is attached to another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that's a butyl group with a branch.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the substituent as a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group. The substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show the CH2 next to the ring as a triplet, perhaps due to coupling with the adjacent CH.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's move on and see if the IR and other NMR data fit.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the NMR would have the CH2 groups and the CH as described.

Now, the initial question is about the reaction of Compound X with red phosphorus and HI.

If Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI—what would that do?

Wait, benzoic acid has a -COOH group. Red phosphorus and HI is typically used in the hydroxymercuration or perhaps the dibromination of alkenes, but wait, if the molecule has a double bond, that's where the reaction would occur. But in the case of benzoic acid, there's no double bond. Wait, but wait, maybe the substituent has a double bond.

Wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a saturated group, then there's no double bond. So perhaps the reaction isn't with the substituent. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: if the substituent is a benzyl group with a double bond, like a styrene group, then reaction with HI and red phosphorus would add HI across the double bond.

But in this case, the NMR doesn't show any vinyl protons. The aromatic protons are in two doublets, but no protons in the 5-6 ppm range which would suggest a vinyl group.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not about adding HI to a double bond but about something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is about the cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

If the reaction is between Compound X and HI with red phosphorus, perhaps it's a substitution or addition reaction.

Wait, another possibility: if the substituent is a benzyl group with a leaving group, then HI could cause a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps Compound X has an ester group. Because, in that case, adding HI might lead to some reaction, like acid-catalyzed cleavage.

But let's go back. The initial reaction is between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI. I think I need to figure out what that reaction does.

Wait, I think when an alkene reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's a diiodination. Or perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation. Alternatively, it's a radical addition.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think: red phosphorus and HI is used for the addition of HI to alkenes in a radical mechanism, leading to allylic iodination. Or perhaps it's used for the hydroxylation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a halogenation. For example, in allylic positions. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a double bond. For example, if the starting material has a double bond, treatment with red phosphorus and HI would cleave it to form dihalides.

But in this case, the starting material's NMR doesn't show any vinyl protons, so perhaps the substituent doesn't have a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group, which could react.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group attached to a CH2 group. For example, if the substituent is a CH2-Ph group, then the CH2 could be adjacent to the ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, which is adjacent to a CH group that could undergo some reaction.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should go back and analyze the NMR and IR data again.

So, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So, either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid.

The NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit. The 1720 in IR would be a bit high for a carboxylic acid, but maybe it's a conjugated system lowering the wavenumber.

Alternatively, it's an aldehyde. The aldehyde would have a peak around 1720 in IR. The NMR would have the aldehyde proton around 9-10 ppm. But here it's 10.5, which is a bit high, but possible.

But in the given NMR, the aromatic protons are in two doublets, so the substituent is in para position. So, if the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, then the other substituent would be a side chain.

So, for example, if the substituent is a benzaldehyde group (CHO) in the para position, and another substituent which is a side chain.

Wait, let's consider that structure: para-substituted benzaldehyde with another substituent.

So, the aromatic protons would be as observed: two doublets, 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.

The aldehyde proton would be around 9.5-10 ppm, which matches the NMR. The 10.5 ppm peak could be that.

Then, the other substituent would be a side chain, which explains the NMR signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

So, the side chain's NMR:

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): terminal ethyl group.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): a CH2 group.

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): a CH group.

Putting that together, the side chain would be an ethyl group attached via a chain that has a branching. Perhaps it's a propan-2-yl (isopropyl) group, but the NMR doesn't fit that. Alternatively, maybe a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, the substituent could be a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

But then the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the ring (attached to the benzene) would be a triplet, perhaps at around 2.9 ppm. But in our NMR, 2.9 is a multiplet for 1H.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, making it a pentyl group, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that would be a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon, making it a isobutyl group. Wait, that's possible.

Wait, the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

But that would be a pentyl group, which doesn't seem to fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

So, the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

In that case, the NMR for the substituent would be:

- The CH2 next to the ring (CH2-) would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH. So, the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be the CH2 group.

- The CH group (CH(CH2CH3)) would have the proton at 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

- The CH2CH3 group would have the CH2 protons around 1.4 ppm (d,3H), but wait, that's a doublet, which would suggest coupling with another proton. Hmm, perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it an isobutyl group.

So, substituent structure: Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

But that's a butyl group with a branch, hence an isobutyl group.

In that case, the NMR signals would be:

- The CH2 next to the ring (CH2-) would have two protons, perhaps as a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH), but in the given NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. So that could fit.

- The CH group (CH(CH3)) would have one proton at 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

- The methyl group (CH3) attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H), but in an isobutyl group, the CH3 is split into a triplet because it's attached to a CH that's split by adjacent CH2. Wait, but here the methyl is a doublet, which suggests coupling with only one neighboring proton. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. No, that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, which would make it a pentyl group. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the substituent is a butyl group with a branching, such as a sec-butyl group. Then, the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's a butyl group.

Wait, the substituent would then be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that seems too long.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch.

But in that case, the substituent would be a pentyl group, which doesn't fit the NMR.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the reaction again.

If the reaction is between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI, and the product is one of the options, which one would that be?

Red phosphorus and HI—what kind of reaction is that? I think it's used for the addition of iodine to alkenes, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it's used in the hydroxymercuration reaction, but that typically uses mercury.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used in the synthesis of alkenes via the elimination of HX. No, that's not it.

Wait, I think that when an alkene is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to form a vic-dihalide (dihaloalkane) via a radical mechanism. Alternatively, it's a way to perform a hydrohalogenation, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to add iodine across the double bond, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a double bond. For example, the oxymercuration reaction cleaves the double bond, but again, I'm not certain.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is Compound X, which I need to identify first.

If Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then what reaction would occur with red phosphorus and HI?

Benzoic acid doesn't have a double bond, so maybe the substituent does. Wait, but if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a saturated chain, then there's no double bond to react with.

Hmm, that suggests that I might have made a wrong assumption about the structure of Compound X.

So perhaps the substituent in Compound X is not a side chain but a benzyl group with a double bond.

Wait, let me think again. If the substituent is a benzyl group (Ph-CH2-), then the CH2 could be adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, but let me imagine that the substituent is a vinyl group, like Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond somewhere.

But the NMR doesn't show any vinyl protons, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH-). But again, the NMR doesn't show any vinyl protons, which would appear around 5-6 ppm.

Hmm. I'm stuck again.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not about the substituent but about the carbonyl group.

If the substituent is a ketone, then reaction with HI might cause some kind of enol formation or addition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about the cleavage of the carbonyl group. For example, if it's a ketone, HI could add across it, but that's more of a nucleophilic addition, which typically requires a different setup.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used to convert alcohols to iodides. For example, if the molecule has an alcohol group, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would replace the -OH with an -I.

But looking at the NMR, there's a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be an -OH. If that's the case, perhaps the substituent is an alcohol group.

Wait, but the IR would then show an O-H stretch around 3200-3500 cm-1, which the given IR does (3400–2500 cm-1). The 1720 cm-1 would then be something else. Hmm, but then what?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an aldehyde group. Let me think again.

If the substituent is an aldehyde, the IR would have the C=O around 1720, and the aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm.

In the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak would fit, but that's a bit upfield for an aldehyde. But it's possible.

Then, the other substituent would be a side chain, which we've been trying to figure out.

So, putting this together, the molecule would have a benzene ring with an aldehyde group and a side chain in para positions.

If that's the case, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would be adding HI across the aldehyde. Wait, but aldehydes typically react with HI in a nucleophilic addition, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of red phosphorus, the aldehyde could be converted into an acid. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is not about the aldehyde but about another group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a Grignard addition, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI are used for that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -OH is replaced with -I. So, if the substituent is an alcohol, then after reaction, it becomes -I.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the reaction converts the -COOH group into something else, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -OH (if present) is replaced by -I.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the options and see which one would make sense after the reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, so perhaps it's a halogenation of an aromatic ring.

Wait, but aromatic halogenation typically requires a catalyst like Fe or Al, and HI isn't usually used for that. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzyl iodide. For example, if Compound X has a benzyl alcohol group, reacting with HI and red phosphorus would convert it to a benzyl iodide.

So, if Compound X is a benzyl alcohol, the product would be a benzyl iodide.

But looking at the options, none of them seem to fit that. Let me check.

Option A: propanoic acid derivative.

Option C: benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group.

Option B: isobutyl and methyl benzene.

Hmm, none of the options are benzyl iodides.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not on the substituent but on another part of the molecule. Like, if the substituent is a propyl group, the reaction could break it down.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to analyze the options based on the reaction.

The reaction is Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Let's think about each option:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. This has a propanoic acid group attached to a benzene ring that's ethyl-substituted. If this reacts with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the aldehyde group (if present) would be converted, but I'm not sure.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. This is a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group. Maybe the reaction would add HI to a double bond, but I don't see a double bond here.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This has a benzoic acid group and a sec-butyl group. If the reaction is a substitution of the acid group, perhaps it becomes an acid iodide, but I'm not sure.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Again, no obvious site for HI addition unless there's a double bond.

Wait, but wait a minute, looking at the NMR of Compound X, there are no signals that suggest a vinyl group, so perhaps the reaction is not about adding to a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is about the cleavage of the benzoic acid group. If the benzoic acid (COOH) is present, reacting with HI could lead to some reaction, but I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about the formation of an acid chloride, but that usually involves SOCl2 or similar reagents.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should try to think of which option would result from the reaction of a para-substituted benzene with a side chain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a demercuration or hydrohalogenation. If the substituent is a double bond, then adding HI would follow anti-Markovnikov addition. But if there's no double bond, perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, and the reaction is some kind of enol formation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group adjacent to the ring, which could undergo some reaction. For example, a CH2 group next to the ring could be iodinated.

But I'm not certain.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck, but I'll try to proceed.

So, based on the NMR and IR data, the most likely structure for Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The benzoic acid group would explain the 1720 cm-1 in IR and the 10.5 ppm peak in NMR. The substituent's side chain would explain the other NMR signals.

Now, treating this compound with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, what would that do?

Wait, benzoic acid is a strong acid. Maybe it's deprotonated under the reaction conditions. Then, perhaps the -COO- group could react with HI, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not on the benzoic acid group but on the substituent.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. If the substituent has a CH2 group next to the ring, perhaps that CH2 group could undergo some reaction with HI, like substitution or addition.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allylic position, allowing for some radical addition.

Wait, but the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a saturated chain, so there's no double bond. So, perhaps the reaction is not on the substituent.

Hmm. Maybe the reaction is a cleavage of the benzoic acid group.

Wait, benzoic acid (COOH) could react with HI to form an acid iodide. The reaction could be:

RCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O

But I'm not sure if red phosphorus is involved in this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution.

But I'm not certain about this. If that's the case, then the product would be RCOI, which is an acid iodide. But none of the options are acid iodides.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but I don't see any obvious reason for that here.

Hmm. I'm not making progress, but perhaps I should go with the structure of Compound X being option C and see what the reaction would do.

So, if Compound X is option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the benzoic acid into a benzyl iodide. But that would require the benzoic acid to lose CO2 and gain an iodide, which is possible under certain conditions.

The reaction could be:

RCOOH → RCH2I + CO2

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride followed by a reaction with HI to form an acid iodide, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the substituent. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, maybe the reaction would cleave it or add HI somewhere.

Wait, but without a double bond, I don't see where the HI would add.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So it's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4.

Wait, but how would that form from the reaction of Compound X with HI and red phosphorus?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that typically uses AlCl3 as a catalyst, and HI isn't the usual reagent.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a halogen on the ring. For example, if Compound X has a leaving group on the ring, HI could substitute it.

But looking at the NMR of Compound X, there's no indication of a halogen.

Hmm. I think I'm going in circles here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

From the spectral data, the most likely structure for Compound X is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would convert the carboxylic acid group into an acid iodide. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a saponification, but that's for esters.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a cleavage of the carbon chain adjacent to the carbonyl group. For example, if the substituent is a propyl group, the reaction could break it down.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. But I don't see how HI and red phosphorus would achieve that.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the reaction is an elimination. For example, if the substituent is a secondary alcohol, it could eliminate to form an alkene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the NMR, I don't see any signals indicative of an alcohol.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, as it fits the spectral data, and the reaction doesn't change the substituent.


The problem involves identifying Compound X, which reacts with red phosphorus and HI, based on its IR and NMR data. The IR data shows strong peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad, likely O-H or N-H), 1720 cm⁻¹ (C=O), 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretches). The NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), two doublets in the aromatic region at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H), and signals for a side chain: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These signals suggest a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl substituent.

### Analysis of Compound X:
1. **IR Data**:
   - The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak indicates a carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid due to the broad O-H stretch in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range.
   - The aromatic C=C stretches at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ confirm the presence of a benzene ring.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) is consistent with a carboxylic acid -OH proton.
   - The two doublets in the aromatic region (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - The side chain signals (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm) suggest a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

3. **Structure of Compound X**:
   - Based on the spectral data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This structure matches the IR and NMR data, with the carboxylic acid group in the para position relative to the sec-butyl substituent.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
- Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the addition of iodine to alkenes or for certain substitution reactions. However, in this case, Compound X does not contain a double bond, and the reaction does not appear to alter the aromatic ring or the side chain. The reaction likely does not change the structure of Compound X significantly, leaving it as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data and reaction conditions lead to the identification of Compound X as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not alter the structure, making **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** the correct answer.
