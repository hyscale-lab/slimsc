Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, right. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. Wait, no, more accurately, plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d.

So plx is inversely proportional to distance. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx with 1/d, then N would be proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Oh, wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the density of stars as a function of distance. Because the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be proportional to the surface area times the volume element or something like that.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a certain volume element. Let's think in terms of volume. For a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be 4π d² dr. But wait, the number of stars isn't just a function of volume, but depends on how star density varies with distance.

Wait, the number of stars is given by N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, so N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars is proportional to d^5. Hmm, but that would mean as d increases, the number of stars increases, which doesn't make sense because stars are farther away and should be fewer in number per unit volume.
