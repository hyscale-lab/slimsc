Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we have an electron state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So the first thing I think is, I should probably normalize this state because the question mentions it's proportional. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors need to be normalized so their probabilities add up to 1. 

So, |alpha> is given as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's compute the norm of this vector. The norm squared is the inner product of the vector with itself. So, the inner product would be (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) because when you take the conjugate, the cross terms (like up and down) would cancel out since up and down are orthogonal. Wait, no, actually, since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, their inner product is zero. So the norm squared is just the sum of the squares of the coefficients' magnitudes.

Calculating each coefficient's magnitude:

(1+i) has a magnitude squared of (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
(2-i) has a magnitude squared of (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1=5.
So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the norm is sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Wait, but the question says it's proportional, so we have to make it a unit vector. So yeah, we divide each coefficient by sqrt(7).

Now, the next part of the question is about the operator whose matrix representation has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i â‰  j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, because we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down, which
