Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound that has 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, let me break this down. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, right? So the benzene ring has two substituents. The total carbons are 8, which includes the 6 from the benzene ring, so the substituents must add 2 carbons. Wait, but wait. Wait, 6 from benzene, substituents adding 2, so that's two substituents each with one carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other is a single carbon? No, wait, wait. Wait, if the substituents are each one carbon, that would add two, making the total 8. Or perhaps one substituent is two carbons and the other is none? No, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents.

Wait, but the substituents could be groups like -OCH3 or something else. Let me think about the IR data. The IR shows a carbonyl group (C=O), so that suggests one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond. So one substituent is
