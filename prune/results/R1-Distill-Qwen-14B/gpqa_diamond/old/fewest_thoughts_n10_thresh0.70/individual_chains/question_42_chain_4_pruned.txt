Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the question says there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure how that method affects this particular problem—maybe it's just context.

The given data includes the equilibrium temperature ratios and mass ratios between the planets. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. That means Planet2's temperature is higher than Planet1's by that factor. Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So Planet3 is colder than Planet2, or wait, no—wait, the ratio is Planet2 to Planet3. Oh, wait, the way it's phrased: the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So I think that's T2 over T1 equals 1.4. Similarly, T3 over T2 is 2.3. So T3 is 1.4 * 2.3 = about 3.22 times T1? Hmm wait, no: T2 is 1.4 * T1. Then T3 is 2.3 times T2, so T3 = 2.3 * T2 = 2.3 * 1.4 T1 = 3.22 T1. So the equilibrium temperatures are increasing from Planet1 to Planet3? That doesn't make sense because if they're further from the star, their temperatures would be lower. Wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. So higher temperature implies closer orbit. So if Planet3 is hotter than Planet2, which is hotter than Planet1, then Planet3 is closest to the star, Planet2 is next, Planet1 is farthest. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ratios given are Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, so Planet2 is hotter than Planet1. So Planet2 would be closer to the star than Planet1. Then Planet3 is 2.3 times hotter than Planet2, so even closer than Planet2. So Planet3 is the closest, Planet2 next, Planet1 farthest. Or wait, no: the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T2/T1 = 1.4, so T2 = 1.4*T1. Then T3 = 2.3 * T2 = 2.3 * 1.4 * T1 = ~3.22 * T1. So Planet3 is hotter than Planet2, which is hotter than Planet1. So order of closeness to the star is Planet3 closest, then Planet2, then Planet1.

But wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive because usually when you have more massive planets, they might be in different orbits, but perhaps not. But the question is about the orbital periods. So maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

The question asks for the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1.
