Okay, so I have this question about hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, let me think. The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The clouds are absorbing light at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. 

Wait, Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame. But when the universe expands, this wavelength gets stretched, right? So the observed wavelength depends on the redshift, z. Oh right, the formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. 

But wait, the question is about detecting the absorption with optical telescopes. Optical wavelengths are from about 400 to 700 nm, I think. Oh wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. That's in the far ultraviolet, right? But ground-based optical telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere absorbs it. So the observed wavelength has to be in the optical range, which is longer than UV.

So the clouds must have a high enough redshift that the Lyman alpha line is shifted into the optical range. So the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. Let me calculate what redshift would bring this into the optical. Let's say the optical range is up to about 700 nm, which is 7000 Angstroms. 

So using the formula, observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z). We want λ_obs <= 7000 Angstroms.

So substituting, 7000 = 1216 * (1 + z). Let me solve for z. 7000 / 1216 is approximately 5.756. So 1 + z = 5.756, so z is about 4.756. So the redshift would have to be around 4.76 to bring the wavelength to 7000 Angstroms (700 nm). 

But wait, the options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. None of the options are around 4.75. So maybe I'm miscalculating something.
