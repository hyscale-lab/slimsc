Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

So the setup is about a nuclear decay where two heavy nucleons of flavor A decay into two of flavor B, and emit two lighter particles E and V. The reaction equation is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. They've mentioned that the total energy spectrum of E is continuous with some endpoint value Q.

Now, there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, they emit one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is asking how the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compares in this variant.

Hmm. So the first thing I think I should recall is the concept of conservation laws here—specifically energy and momentum. Because in decay processes, especially nuclear ones, these are crucial.

In the original decay, two E particles and two V particles are emitted. So the E and V's energies are probably related through these conservation laws. But when one M is emitted instead of two V's, what changes?

Wait, the original decay had 2E and 2V. The variant has 2E and 1M. So I need to think about how this affects the energy spectrum of E.

In the original case, when multiple particles are emitted, the energy spectrum of E is continuous. That usually happens when particles are emitted with a range of energies, which could be due to varying momenta because of conservation of energy and momentum.

So why is the original spectrum continuous? Because in a typical decay like beta decay, when multiple particles are emitted, the energies of the emitted particles can vary as long as the total energy and momentum are conserved. For example, in alpha decay, the alpha particle can take a range of energies up to a maximum, determined by the Q-value.

Wait, but in the problem, the total energy spectrum of E is continuous. So each E particle's energy isn't fixed but can vary. How does that happen? Maybe because when two E's are emitted, their energies can share the available energy in different ways. Similarly, the two V's would carry away some energy and momentum, affecting the E's.

But in the variant, instead of two V's, there's one massless M. So the number of particles emitted is different. Let's think about the usual decay process with two particles.

In the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So each E and V is perhaps a beta particle and an antineutrino, or something similar. But wait, the problem says E and V are much lighter than A and B. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is an electron and V is a neutrino or something.

But in the original setup, if E and V are emitted, their energies would be linked. But since the problem states that the E's have a continuous spectrum, it suggests that the decay is similar to beta decay where the emitted particles can have a range of energies up to a maximum.

Now, when the number of emitted particles changes, like from two V's to one M, how does this affect the E's?

In the original scenario, when two V's are emitted,
