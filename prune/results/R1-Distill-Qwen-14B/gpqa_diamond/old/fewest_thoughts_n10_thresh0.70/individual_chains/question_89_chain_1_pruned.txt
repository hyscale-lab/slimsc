Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me take it step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given, so I need to figure out what product 1 is.

Hmm, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has that diamondoid structure, right? So two bromines on adjacent carbons in the structure. When you heat a dibrominated compound with KOH, especially with excess, it's likely an elimination reaction. Wait, but wait, KOH is a strong base. So maybe dehydrohalogenation happens?

Wait, no, elimination would typically form an alkene. But in adamantane's structure, the positions might lead to a different product. Alternatively, maybe it's more about ring opening? No, adamantane is a very stable structure, so probably elimination.

Wait, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. That suggests maybe a ketone? Because if it's a carbonyl, and the reaction is with KOH, perhaps it's an elimination followed by some kind of tautomerism or maybe a Dieckmann condensation? Wait, but the starting material is dibrominated.

Wait, maybe it's an example of the Hofmann elimination or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a ring contraction or expansion. Wait, no, when you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, like in a dihalide, when treated with a strong base like KOH, you might get an elimination reaction to form a double bond, but if the base is in excess, maybe it abstracts a proton and the two Br leave, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a di-elimination. So two E2 reactions? Because when you have two adjacent leaving groups, perhaps the base can abstract protons from adjacent carbons, leading to the loss of both leaving groups and the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, for example, something like this
