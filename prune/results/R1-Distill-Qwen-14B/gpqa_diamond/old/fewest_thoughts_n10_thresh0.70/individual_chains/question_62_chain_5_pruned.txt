Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll try to sketch the structures to get a clearer picture. Ethynylcyclohexane has a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond CH2C≡CH), but wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group attached. Hmm, no, wait, ethynyl is -C≡C-CH2? Wait, maybe I should think again. No, ethynyl group is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane would have a cyclohexane ring with a -CH2-C≡CH group attached? Or maybe it's cyclohexane with a triple bond between two carbons, like cyclohexane-1-yn- something? Maybe the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2 group attached to a carbon that's triple-bonded. So, the structure might be cyclohexane with a substituent like CH2-C≡CH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring attached to an ethynyl group, which is a carbon-carbon triple bond. So, structure-wise, it's cyclohexane connected to a CH2-C≡CH group. So, the triple bond is between the CH2 and the C≡CH.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's parse that IUPAC name. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The aldehyde group is on the cyclohexane ring, I think. So, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. The substituent is at position 1, which is the same as the aldehyde position? Wait, maybe I should draw this.

Wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So, it's like:

- The main ring is cyclohexane with an aldehyde group (CHO) at position 1.
- At position 1, but wait, that's the same carbon as the aldehyde? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on a side chain attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which is a CH2-OH connected to a cyclohexyl group. So
