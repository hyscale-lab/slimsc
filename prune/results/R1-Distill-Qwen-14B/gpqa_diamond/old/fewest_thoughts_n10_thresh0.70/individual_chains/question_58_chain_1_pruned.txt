Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a process used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. Let me think about each option.

Option A is Superstring Theory. String theory is a bit different because it's a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics with general relativity. Strings vibrate at different frequencies, and these vibrations correspond to different particles. I think string theory doesn't have the same kinds of divergences that other quantum field theories have because it's a theory that works at high energies. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. String theories do require certain mathematical techniques, like maybe T-duality or other dualities, but do they regularize in the same way? Maybe not, but I'm not certain.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, right? I remember that in QCD, things like asymptotic freedom make the theory manageable at high energies. But when you go to low energies, like when quarks are confined, the coupling becomes strong, and calculations get difficult. But does QCD require regularization at high energies? Well, I think regularization is used more in perturbative calculations to handle loop divergences. So even if the theory is asymptotically free, you still have to deal with divergences in calculations, so you need regularization techniques. So QCD would require regularization, making option
