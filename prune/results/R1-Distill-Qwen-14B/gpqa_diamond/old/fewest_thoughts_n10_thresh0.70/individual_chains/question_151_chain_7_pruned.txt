Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let me read it again. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a 3-element column vector. So it's a three-dimensional state vector. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, each component corresponds to an eigenstate of the observable.

The observable is represented by matrix P. Let me write down the matrix P as described. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P looks like this:

[ 0        1/√2     0    ]
[1/√2     0        1/√2 ]
[ 0        1/√2     0    ]

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian operators. Let me check if P is Hermitian. The elements must satisfy P_ij = P_ji*. So let me check. The (1,2) element is 1/√2, and the (2,1) is also 1/√2, which is real, so that's good. (1,3) is 0, (3,1) is 0. (2,3) is 1/√2, and (3,2) is 1/√2. So yes, P is symmetric, which means it's Hermitian. So that's all good.

The question is to find the probability that the measurement of P yields 0. Oh right, so in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator P, and the probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude (the inner product of the state with the corresponding eigenvector).

But wait, maybe I should diagonalize P first to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Alternatively, another approach is to note that the expectation value of P is given by the state vector multiplied by P and then by the conjugate transpose of the state vector. But in this case, since we're looking for the probability of getting a specific eigenvalue, perhaps 0 is one of the eigenvalues.

Wait, let me think. The matrix P has elements that sum up in a way that each row's elements add up to sqrt(2)/something. Wait, let me compute the trace of P. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. So 0 + 0 +0 =0. The trace is 0, which is the sum of the eigenvalues. If 0 is an eigenvalue, then the sum of the other two eigenvalues would be zero. Hmm, but let me proceed step by step.

First, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. So let's find the characteristic equation: det(P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[ -λ        1/√2      0       ]
[1/√2      -λ       1/√2     ]
[ 0        1/√2     -λ       ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero.

Calculating the determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit involved, but let's try.

det = -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [something]. 

Wait, perhaps using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Alternatively, maybe a smarter approach. Let me see if P can be expressed in a simpler form. P seems to have a pattern. Let me think about its structure. Each diagonal is zero, and the off-diagonal elements are 1/sqrt(2) in a specific pattern. Wait, the matrix has a sort of path structure: row 1 is connected to row 2, row 2 connects to rows 1 and 3,
