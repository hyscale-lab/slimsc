Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I remember that orbital periods have to do with how long a planet takes to orbit its star. Since they're using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations, but I'm not entirely sure how that plays into this problem. Maybe it's just the method they used to discover the planets, so it's not directly relevant to solving the question.

The problem gives me some ratios of equilibrium temperatures between the planets. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is 1.4 times that of Planet2, and Planet2's is 2.3 times Planet3's. I should probably write these down as ratios:

T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3.

Wait, wait, equilibrium temperature. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star. But since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), that part cancels out when taking the ratios. So, the ratio of their temperatures depends on their distances from the star.

Wait, so the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. Because T is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4), so T is proportional to 1/(D^(1/2)). So, T ∝ 1/√D.

So, if T1/T2 = 1.4, then 1/√D1 / (1/√D2) = T1/T2. Which simplifies to √(D2/D1) = 1.4. So, D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 is about 1.96 times D1. So, Planet
