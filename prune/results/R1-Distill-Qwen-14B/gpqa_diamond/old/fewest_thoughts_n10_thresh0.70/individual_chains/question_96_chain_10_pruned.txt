Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, specifically the area of the event horizon. The formula I think is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area. Oh wait, right, that's the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula.

Okay, so I need to find the area of the event horizon. The problem gives me the angular size θ and the distance d. I remember that angular size is related to the actual size through the formula θ (in radians) ≈ s / d, where s is the size of the object. But wait, θ is given in degrees, so I should convert that to radians first.

Given θ = 1e-17 degrees. To convert degrees to radians, I multiply by π/180. So θ_rad ≈ (1e-17) * π/180. Let me calculate that. π is about 3.1416, so 3.1416/180 is roughly 0.01745. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, the size s (which is the diameter of the event horizon) is approximately θ_rad * d. Wait, no, actually, the formula is s = θ_rad * d
