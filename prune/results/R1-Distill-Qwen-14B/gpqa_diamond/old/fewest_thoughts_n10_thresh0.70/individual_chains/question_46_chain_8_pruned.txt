Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organometallic reactions, but let me think through this.

Grubbs catalyst, if I remember right, is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, it's like breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, probably ruthenium-based, and it's good for ring-closing metathesis too.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But since we're dealing with a double bond, maybe the configuration isn't that important here unless there's some sort of stereoselectivity in the reaction.

The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait no, wait: pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2- something. Wait, perhaps I should count the carbons again. 3-methylpent-1-ene: the longest chain is five carbons with a double bond starting at 1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me think: pent has five carbons. 1-ene means double bond between C1 and C2. 3-methyl would be a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the molecule looks like:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but wait, that would make the structure CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Hmm, so the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Now, when Grubbs is used on an alkene, it typically causes metathesis. So, the reaction will break the double bond and reform new ones. The general process is for the catalyst to bind to the alkene, then the alkene rotates, leading to the
