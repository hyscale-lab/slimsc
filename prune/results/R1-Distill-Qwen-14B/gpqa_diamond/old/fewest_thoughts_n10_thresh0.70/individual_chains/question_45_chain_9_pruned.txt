Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Hmm, let's read the question again to make sure I understand it right.

So, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of energy E, where E is given as pi squared hbar squared over 2mL squared. The options are A, B, C, D with various multiples of E.

Wait a second, the particles are spin-1/2, so they're fermions, right? Because spin-1/2 particles are fermions, which obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So that's important because it affects how the particles are filled into the quantum states.

The well is one-dimensional, so each particle's energy levels are given by the formula E_n = (nÂ²) * E, where E is the base energy unit provided. So for each particle, the energy depends on the quantum number n.

Since there are four particles, I'll need to figure out the possible quantum states they can occupy, considering the Pauli exclusion principle. Each state is characterized by a unique combination of quantum numbers and spin. But wait, since the particles are in a 1D well, the quantum number n is the main determinant of the energy. Spin comes into play in terms of whether the particles are fermions, so each state can hold a certain number of particles.

Each energy level E_n can accommodate a certain number of particles. For spin-1/2, each spatial state can have two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down. So, for each n, we can have two particles.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. In a 1D infinite well, each energy level n corresponds to a specific state. For each n, the spatial wavefunction is determined, and then the spin part can be either up or down. So each n can hold two particles: one spin-up and one spin-down.

So, for four particles, how do they fill these states?

The ground state would be the lowest energy possible, so the first few n levels filled with as many particles as possible.

Let me think about how the filling goes.

The energy levels are E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4, etc., each with E, 4E,
