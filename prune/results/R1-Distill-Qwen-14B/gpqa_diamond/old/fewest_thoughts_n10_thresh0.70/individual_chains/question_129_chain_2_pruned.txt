Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Hmm, let me read through the question again carefully.

So, the reaction scheme goes like this: 

- Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
- B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
- C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
- D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form E.

And there are some hints given. Let me look at the hints first.

Hint (a) says that compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on ylides, but I think they are used in some cyclopropanation reactions. Wait, maybe it's a Simmons-Smith reaction? Simmons-Smith uses a zinc carbenoid to add a cyclopropane ring. But wait, phosphorus ylides are more for Wittig reactions, right? Oh wait, the product has a cyclopentane ring with substituents. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The propan-2-ylidene group is like a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached to the cyclopentane.

Wait, the structure would be a cyclopentane ring where at position 4 there's a substituent that's a propenyl group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=. So the cyclopentane has at position 4 a substituent that's a propene group attached via the central carbon. So perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane or something else?

Wait, no. Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituent on the cyclopentane at position 4 is a propan-2-ylidene group, which is CH2-C(CH3)=. So the structure is a cyclopentane ring with two methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a propan-2-ylidene group at position 4.

But how did that come from reacting A with a phosphorous ylide? Hmm. Since the ylide is a phosphorus-based one, maybe it's a Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent would react with a carbonyl group in compound A. So, if A has a carbonyl, then the Wittig would add the ylide's R2C= group to form an alkene.

So, perhaps A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Let me think: if A is a cyclopentanone with substituents, and when the Wittig reagent is added, it would form a new double bond. So, for example
