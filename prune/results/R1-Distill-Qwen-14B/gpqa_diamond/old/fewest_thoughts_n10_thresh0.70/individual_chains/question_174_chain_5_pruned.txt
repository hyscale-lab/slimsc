Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Hmm, let me see how I can tackle this. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. And the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value using the classical approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. That means the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Oh right, because if one is moving one way, the other must balance it out.

Let me jot down the given information:

- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV. So M c² is 300 GeV. Wait, but when we're dealing with mass, do we need to consider c²? Hmm. Maybe not in the end because we're comparing kinetic energies, which are in terms of rest mass energy.

- After fission, two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. So let me denote the masses. Let the smaller mass be m, so the larger is 2m. But wait, the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So m + 2m = 0.99 M. That is 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the two fragments have masses 0.33 M and 0.66 M.

Wait, wait. Because 0.33 + 0.66 is 0.99 M, right. But the initial mass is M, so there's a loss of 1% of the mass, which goes into energy, probably kinetic.

Now, the nucleus is initially at rest, so the total momentum after fission is zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2.

But wait, in classical mechanics, momentum p = m v. So p1 = m1 v1, p2 = m2

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission, and I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation for the more massive fragment. Hmm, let's break this down.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So wait, M's rest mass is 300 GeV, but the sum of the two fragments is 0.99*M, which is 0.99*300 GeV = 297 GeV. That's 3 GeV less than the initial mass. So there's mass defect, and that energy is released as kinetic energy, right?

Wait, but actually, in fission, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum should be conserved. Since it's initially at rest, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momentum to conserve it. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me note down the given data:

- M_initial = M, rest energy = 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments: mass m1 and m2.
- m1 = 2 * m2.
- m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.

Wait, but the sum is 0.99*M. So, 3 M = m1 + m2 = 0.99 M? Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, M is the initial mass. So the sum of the two fragments' masses is 0.99*M. So M is 300 GeV/c², so the sum of the two fragments is 0.99*300 = 297 GeV/c².

Let me assign variables:

Let me let m2 be the mass of the lighter fragment. Then m1 = 2 m2. So m1 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. Wait, no, because 3 m2 = 0.9
