Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrophilic substitution reactions. Let me take a deep breath and try to work through this step by step.

The question is about the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic substitution reaction when certain substituents are attached to a benzene ring. The substituents are in substances 1 to 6, and each undergoes a bromination reaction with excess bromine. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.

Hmm, right. So I remember that directing groups on the benzene ring influence where the substitution occurs. If a substituent is meta-directing, the incoming electrophile tends to add in the meta position relative to it. Ortho/para directors, on the other hand, can direct the electrophile to either the ortho or para positions. But wait, some groups are strongly activating and others deactivating, which affects the reactivity as well.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, I need to determine whether it's ortho/para-directing or meta-directing. If it's ortho/para, then the para product would have a higher yield, but sometimes other factors like steric hindrance or the substituent's position might influence that.

Let me list out the substituents one by one.

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So when bromine adds, the major products should be the para and ortho isomers. But since the question is about the para fraction, which will be a significant part.

Wait, but wait, in some cases, the para might be more favored. Like, for toluene, the para isomer is generally more stable than ortho because of less steric hindrance. So the major product would be para. So the para isomer's weight fraction would be higher.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's phenyl acetate. The substituent here is an ester group, OCOEt (ethoxy carbonyl group). I think esters are meta-directing because they're electron-withdrawing groups. So the incoming Br would add meta to the ester group. So in this case, the para-isomer wouldn't form as much, right? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, meta direction means the substituent directs the electrophile to the meta position relative to itself. So if the substituent is at position 1, the Br would go to position 3 or 5. But wait, in a para substitution, for example, the substituent is at position 1, and the Br adds at position 4. But if the substituent is meta-directing, then it's directing to positions 3 and 5, not 4. So in this case, the para-isomer wouldn't form from a meta-directing group, unless there's another substituent or something else.

Wait, no. Wait, in this case, the substituent is at one position, and the electrophile adds either ortho, para, or meta. For
