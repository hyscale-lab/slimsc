Okay, so I have this genetics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound. They've done EMS mutagenesis and sequenced the gene in mutants. The changes are in the first exon.

Hmm, so I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, and any mutation in an exon can potentially change the protein product. The anti-nutritional compound is probably a result of the protein being produced, so if we can disrupt that protein, the compound might not be made.

Looking at the changes in the mutants. The intact gene is given, and each mutant has a different alteration in the first exon. I need to see which mutation would likely disrupt the gene's function.

Let me look at each mutant:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, comparing the first part, the intact has TTTCTCGC. Mutant 1 has TTCTACGC. Let me count the differences. Wait, perhaps it's easier to see the changes in the DNA sequence.

Wait, another approach: frame shifts or missense mutations? If a mutation leads to a premature stop codon, that would truncate the protein early, potentially making it nonfunctional.

Wait, but in the given sequences, the ends are similar. Let's see the start and end. The intact gene starts with ATG, which is the start codon. The mutants all start with ATG, so the reading frame is preserved.

Mutant 1 changes positions... Let me compare each:

Looking at the first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAAC... Wait, maybe I should write the sequences out.

Wait, perhaps aligning the sequences would help. Let me write each and see where they differ.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAAC... Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me count the nucleotides.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to look for a frameshift or a nonsense mutation.

Wait, but all the mutations are in the same exon, so probably they're in the same reading frame. So, if any
