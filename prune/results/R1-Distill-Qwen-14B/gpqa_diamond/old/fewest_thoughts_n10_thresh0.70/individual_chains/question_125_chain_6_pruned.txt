Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2)mω² r². I remember that in quantum mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a standard problem, and the potential here is similar to the three-dimensional case. 

The question is asking two things: the value of the energy of the third excited state and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue. The options given are A, B, C, D. 

First, I need to recall the structure of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions. I think the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, in three dimensions, the energy levels can be expressed in terms of the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

In one dimension, the energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω, where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...). But in three dimensions, since the problem is separable, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each of the x, y, and z directions. So, for each direction, the energy is (n_x + 1/2)ℏω, (n_y + 1/2)ℏω, and (n_z + 1/2)ℏω. Adding them together:

E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ℏω.

But wait, I think another way to think about it is that the total quantum number is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (n + 3/2) ℏω. 

But wait, I should double-check. Oh right, n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers. So each energy level is determined by n, which is the sum of n_x, n_y, n_z. So E = (n + 3/2) ℏω.

Now, the excited states. The ground state is the lowest energy state, which corresponds to n=0. The first excited state would be when n=1, second excited n=2, third excited
