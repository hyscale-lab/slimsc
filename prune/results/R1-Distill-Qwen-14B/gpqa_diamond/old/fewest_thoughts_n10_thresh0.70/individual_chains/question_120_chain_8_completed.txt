Okay, so I've got this question about the number of stars per unit range of parallax, assuming they're uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh yeah, the parallax (π) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the distance (d) in parsecs. So d = 1/π. But wait, no, actually I think it's d = 1/π. Because I remember that closer stars have larger parallaxes. Like, if a star is 1 parsec away, its parallax is 1 arcsecond. Oh right, so π = 1/d, so d = 1/π, but wait no, wait. Wait, the formula is actually π (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So π = 1/d. So if d increases, π decreases. That makes sense because stars get farther away, their parallax is smaller.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So let's say we have a range of parallax from π to π + dπ. How many stars are there in that range?

Wait, the problem states the stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, does that mean their distances are uniform, or their distribution in space is uniform? I think it's about their three-dimensional distribution being uniform. So the number density of stars is uniform in space.

Assuming that, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on that volume. So, how does the volume relate to parallax?

Let me think. The volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance is important here. The volume between distance d and d + dd is (4/3)π (d + dd)^3 - (4/3)π d^3. But since dd is small, we can approximate this as 4π d² dd. So the volume element is 4π d² dd.

But parallax π is 1/d, so d = 1/π. Therefore, d² is 1/(π²), and dd is the change in distance, which in terms of parallax would be -d² (since π = 1/d, so dπ = - (1/d²) dπ? Wait, maybe I should express dd in terms of dπ.

Wait, let's take π = 1/d. Then, differentiating both sides, dπ = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = - d² dπ. Since we're dealing with positive distances and parallax, perhaps I can just take the absolute value. So, the volume element is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/π²) (d² (-dπ) )? Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, let's express the volume element in terms of π. Since d = 1/π, then d² = 1/π². And the volume element is 4π (d)^2 dd. But dd is the change in distance, which can be written in terms of dπ. From π = 1/d, dπ = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² dπ. But since we're considering positive ranges, the negative sign just indicates direction, so we'll take absolute values. So, the volume element becomes 4π (d²) * |dd| = 4π (1/π²) * ( (1/π²) dπ )) Wait, no, because dπ is the change in parallax. Let me re-express.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express the number of stars per unit volume as a constant because they're uniformly distributed. So the number of stars in a volume dV is n * dV, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

So the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dd is 4π d² dd multiplied by n.

But we need to express this in terms of parallax π. Since π = 1/d, d = 1/π, and dd = -d² dπ → so the change in d is related to the change in π. But when we take the volume element, it's as a function of π.

So substituting d = 1/π, and dd = (1/π²) dπ. Wait, wait. Let me compute dd in terms of dπ.

From π = 1/d → d = 1/π. Taking derivative: dd = - (1/π²) dπ. So |dd| = (1/π²) dπ.

So the volume element dV is 4 π d² |dd| = 4 π (1/π²)² (dπ) )? Wait, wait, no. Wait, d² is (1/π²), and |dd| is (1/π²) dπ. So dV = 4 π * (1/π²) * (1/π²) dπ) = 4 π * (1/π^4) dπ) = 4/(π^3) dπ.

Wait, but the number of stars is n * dV, so N = n * (4/(π^3) dπ). So the number per unit dπ is N/dπ = 4 n / π^3.

But that's for a fixed dπ. Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Wait, the question says, "the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx".

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of distribution. The number of stars in a range dπ around π is proportional to the volume element (which depends on π) multiplied by the number density n.

So the number per unit parallax (dπ) is N = n * 4 π d^2 dd. But since d = 1/π, and dd = (1/π²) dπ. So substituting:

N = n * 4 π (1/π²)^2 (dπ) )? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, dV is 4π d² dd. So substituting d = 1/π, so d² is 1/π². And dd is (1/π²) dπ. So,

dV = 4 π (1/π²) (1/π²) dπ) = 4 π / π^4 dπ = 4/(π^3) dπ.

So the number of stars in this dV is n * dV = n *4/(π^3) dπ.

Therefore, the number per unit dπ is (n *4)/(π³) dπ. So as π increases (which means the stars are farther away), the number of stars per unit dπ (i.e., per unit change in parallax) decreases as 1/π³.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if you have a range of plx from π to π + Δπ, the number of stars in that range would be proportional to 1/π³ multiplied by Δπ.

So the number density per unit plx is proportional to 1/π³.

Wait, but the options are about how the number per unit plx changes with plx. So the number per unit plx would be proportional to 1/π³, which is the same as 1/(plx)^3.

Looking at the options, option D is ~ 1/plx^3.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the number of stars in a shell is proportional to 1/π^2 (because volume element is 4π d² dd, and d² is 1/π²). Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution.

Let me re-express everything.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is N = 4π d² n dd.

Expressed in terms of parallax π:

d = 1/π → dd = - (1/π²) dπ.

So substituting, N = 4π (1/π²) n ( - 1/π² dπ ) → but since dπ is positive when π decreases (because as d increases, π decreases), but the negative sign just indicates the direction, so we can take the absolute value.

So, N = 4π (1/π²) * n * (1/π²) dπ.

Wait, 4π * (1/π²) is 4/(π). Then multiplied by (1/π²), gives 4/(π^3). So N = (4 n / π^3) dπ.

So the number per unit dπ is (4n)/(π^3). So the number per unit parallax is inversely proportional to π^3, which is 1/π^3. So as π increases, the number per unit parallax drops like 1/π^3.

So the answer would be ~ 1/plx^3, which is option D.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( \pi \) is inversely related to distance \( d \), such that \( \pi = \frac{1}{d} \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). The number of stars in this shell is then \( N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd \), where \( n \) is the number density of stars.

Since \( \pi = \frac{1}{d} \), we can express \( d = \frac{1}{\pi} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\pi^2} d\pi \). Substituting these into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\pi^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\pi^2} d\pi\right).
\]

Taking the absolute value (since we are interested in magnitudes), this simplifies to:

\[
N = n \cdot \frac{4}{\pi^3} d\pi.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( d\pi \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\pi^3} \). As \( \pi \) increases (i.e., as stars are farther away), the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\pi^3} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**  
**B) ~ 1/plx^2**  
**C) ~ 1/plx^1**  
**D) ~ 1/plx^3**

The correct choice is **D**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to \( \pi^3 \).

Answer: D
