Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The data given includes IR and NMR spectra, so I'll need to use those to figure out what Compound X is, and then determine what happens in the reaction.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1. So breaking that down, the broad peak between 3400 and 2500 usually indicates an -OH group because that's where O-H stretches occur. Or maybe it's an amine or something else, but given the other peaks, I'm thinking it's an alcohol or carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, the peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indicator. That's usually a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but I'm not sure. Wait, the 3400–2500 could also be an alkyne, but I don't think so here. Alternatively, maybe an OH of a phenol? Hmm.

Wait, phenols have O-H stretches around 3200-3600, and they're usually broad. But then the 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. So maybe it's a phenol with a carbonyl group, like a phenol ester or a phenol ketone? Or perhaps a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, a carboxylic acid would have a very broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which matches the 3400–2500. And the carbonyl at 1720 would fit a carboxylic acid, but wait, wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm-1. Maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Wait, another possibility: the 3400–2500 could be from an alcohol, but the 1720 is more likely an ester or ketone.

But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR data is given as:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet around 10.5. That's probably an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols usually are around 1-5 ppm, but that's a broad peak, so maybe a phenol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, a phenol's O-H is usually around 5-7 ppm, but sometimes broader. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but that's a sharp peak. But this is a broad singlet at 10.5, so more likely an O-H, perhaps from a carboxylic acid.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons. Two doublets in the aromatic region. So maybe a para-substituted benzene, like two H in each position. Wait, that's the pattern for a para-substituted benzene. Like if you have substituents in the para positions, the adjacent protons would be doublets. So, let's say two H on one side and two H on the other. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring, with two substituents: one in position 4 and another elsewhere?

Wait, let's think about benzene
