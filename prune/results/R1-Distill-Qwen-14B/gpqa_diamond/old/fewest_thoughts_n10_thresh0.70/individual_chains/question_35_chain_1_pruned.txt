Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is given with its first row as (0 -i) and the second row as (i 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Then, from the options A to D, I have to pick the correct statement during the calculation.

Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a 2x2 matrix. Right, I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

First, let me write down the matrix S. S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, A_y is c multiplied by S. So, A_y = c * S.

What's c? c is h/(4π). So, A_y would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by the matrix S. Let me compute that:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So, the matrix A_y is:

[ [0, -(i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues a, I need to solve det(A_y - a I) = 0.

Let me write A_y - a I:

[ [ -a, -(i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ -(i h)/(4π) ) * (i h)/(4π) ) ]

Which is a^2 - [ ( -i^2 (h^2) ) / (16 π²) ) ]

Wait, because the product is ( (i h)/(4π) ) * ( -i h/(4π) ), but wait, wait—no, actually, the (1,2) element is -(i h)/(4π), and the (2,1) is (i h)/(4π). So when you multiply them, it's (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) )? Wait, no, the determinant is ( (A - a I)_{11} * (A - a I)_{22} ) - (A - a I)_{12} * (A - a I)_{21} )

So:

det = (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Compute each part:

First term: (-a)(-a) = a².

Second term: (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) = (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) = [ (-i²) ] * (h²)/(16 π²). Since i² is -1, so (-i²) is 1.

So, the second term is (1) * (h²)/(16 π²).

So, determinant equation becomes:

a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

Solving, a² = (h²)/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, but wait a second. Because the operator A_y is given as c·S, and S is a Pauli matrix. Wait, what's the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices?

Oh right, the Pauli matrices (like S_x, S_y, S_z) have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But wait, in this case, S is not exactly a Pauli matrix. Let me think. The given S matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh wait, that's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i. Because the standard Pauli Y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix.

Wait, no. Wait the standard Pauli Y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly S. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. So then S is σ_y. So, the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, because for Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues are ±1.

But wait, in our case, A_y is c times σ_y. So the eigenvalues of A_y would be c times the eigenvalues of
