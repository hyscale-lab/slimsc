Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

The question gives me four options, a to d, each describing different exoplanets. I need to compare their densities and find out which is the highest. Let me go through each one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So this one should have that same density. 

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, density is mass over volume. So if the mass is 2 Earth masses, but the density is the same as Earth, that means the volume must be twice Earth's because density = mass/volume. So if it's 2M but same density, volume is 2 times Earth's. So radius would be a bit larger, but the point is the density is same as Earth.

Option c: A planet with same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition means same density. Because density depends on what the planet is made of. So this planet's density is also 5.5 g/cm³. But wait, if the mass is 5 times Earth's, the volume would be (5)^(1/3) times Earth's radius. Because volume scales with radius cubed. Wait, no, wait. Volume is (4/3)πr³. So if mass increases by 5 times, and density is same, the volume must be 5 times. So Volume = mass/(density) → mass increases 5 times, density same → volume is 5 times Earth. So radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. But the density remains the same as Earth, so this planet's density is same as Earth.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition means same density. So density is 5.5 g/cm³. The mass is less, but density is same. So volume is less than Earth's, but density doesn't change.

Wait, so in options a, b, c, and d, all except option b have the same density as Earth. So option b has same density as Earth. But wait, no. Let me recheck.
