Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, which was something like the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Let me think.

The problem says the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 1e-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 1e10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy. The options are all around 1e59 to 1e66 J/K.

First, I should figure out the size of the event horizon. Angular size θ is given in degrees, but I think I need to convert that into radians because when calculating the size using distance, the formula involves radians. Oh right, the formula is size = distance * θ (in radians). 

Wait, how do I convert degrees to radians? I remember that 180 degrees is π radians, so 1 degree is π/(180) radians. So θ in radians is 1e-17 degrees multiplied by π/180. Let me calculate that. 1e-17 * π /180 ≈ 1e-17 * 1.745e-3 ≈ 1.745e-20 radians.

So the size r of the event horizon would be d (distance) multiplied by θ. Wait, but wait a second. The distance d is given as 1e10 parsecs. Wait, parsecs are a unit of distance. How many meters is that? I think 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 meters. Let me compute that: 3.086e26 meters.

So r = d * θ = 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-20 rad. Let me multiply that: 3.086e26 * 1.745e-20 = approximately 5.38e6 meters. Wait, that's 5,380,000 meters, which is about 5.38e6 meters. That seems really large. Wait, but a supermassive black hole's event horizon could be that big. For example, the Milky Way
