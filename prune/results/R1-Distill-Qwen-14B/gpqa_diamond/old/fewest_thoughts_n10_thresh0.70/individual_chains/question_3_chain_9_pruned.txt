Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx, up to one decimal place. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state vector. Since the operator here is a combination of σz and σx, I can probably compute the expectation values of each separately and then combine them with their coefficients.

Wait, the operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes sense because expectation values are linear.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is a superposition of σz eigenstates, this should be straightforward. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, right?

So the expectation value of σz is (0.5)^2*(+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2*(-1). Let me compute those squares. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. So 0.25*(+1) is 0.25, and 0.75*(-1) is -0.75. Adding them: 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

So the first part is 10*(-0.5) = -5. Got that.

Now, the tricky part is finding ⟨σx⟩. I remember that σx is the Pauli x matrix, which has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, but I'm not sure exactly. Alternatively, maybe I can express σx in terms of the basis states and compute the expectation value.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value of σx is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me write this out. The state |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, I can expand this.

But wait, σx is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when σx acts on |↑⟩, it becomes |↓⟩, and when it acts on |↓⟩, it becomes |↑⟩. So σx
