Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P yields 0. The system's state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). And the matrix P is given with specific entries.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. So P must be a Hermitian operator because it's an observable. The eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices are real, which makes sense for measurement outcomes.

Right, to find the probability of getting a certain eigenvalue (in this case, 0), I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue and project the state onto those eigenvectors. The probability would be the square of the magnitude of the inner product between the state and each eigenvector.

But wait, how do I proceed step by step?

First, I should probably find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix P. Because the probability is related to the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes, and the eigenvectors define the states where the outcome is that eigenvalue.

So the given P matrix is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down properly.

The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0].
Second row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)].
Third row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0].

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Yes, the first row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row is 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

I think I should find the eigenvalues of P. So I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) =0.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let me see the structure of P. It looks symmetric, so it's definitely Hermitian, which is good.

Looking at P, it might have some symmetry that can help. Let me consider the matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Hmm, perhaps I can guess the
