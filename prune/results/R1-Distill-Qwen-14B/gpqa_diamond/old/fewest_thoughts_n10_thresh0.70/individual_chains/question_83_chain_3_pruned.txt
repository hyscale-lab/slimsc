Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is that we start by diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Alright, so first, I should figure out the concentrations after dilution. Then, determine the volume of NaOH needed for 25% titration and at equivalence. After that, calculate the pH at those points.

Let me start by diluting the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20 cm³, concentration 0.05 M. When we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

The dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging in the numbers: (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) / 40 * 20 *0.05= wait, let me calculate that. 0.05 *20 = 1 mmol, divided by 40 cm³ (which is 40 mL) gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait. 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/dm³. 20 cm³ is 0.02 dm³. So moles of acetic acid initially are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 dm³) water, total volume is 0.04 dm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's find the equivalence point first. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 dm³ = 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol.

Concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 dm³, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question asks about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³. Wait, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, how much has reacted?

The moles of NaOH added at 25% is 0.1 M * 0.0025 dm³ = 0.00025 mol. Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. So after reaction, moles of acetic acid = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, what's the volume at 25% titration? The initial solution is 40 cm³, and we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 dm³).

So, the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 dm³ ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 dm³ ≈ 0.005882 M.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log
