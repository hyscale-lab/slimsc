Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, okay, I've studied some spectroscopy, so let's try to break this down.

The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. I remember that di-substituted rings have two substituents attached. The FTIR shows peaks for an ester group. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ester oxygen. So that means the molecule has an -O-CO-O- group or something similar? Wait, no, esters are like R-O-CO-R'. So the O in the ester is part of the carbonyl group and the ether-like linkage.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Let's see what each might represent. Two signals for aromatic H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern affects the number of unique aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are in the para position, there are two sets of aromatic protonsâ€”each pair equivalent. But if they're meta or ortho, the pattern changes. Wait, but the question says two signals, so maybe each substituent is causing a different environment for the H's. Or maybe the substituents are such that the ring has symmetry leading to two distinct sets.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to double bonds. So maybe there's a double bond somewhere else in the molecule, perhaps part of an ester group or another substituent. The doublet and doublet of quartets suggest coupling with neighboring protons. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-O-CO-something, the protons on the double bond would couple with each other and possibly with others. Or maybe it's part of a substituent attached to the ring.

The last two signals are for -CH3 groups. So there are two different methyl groups. No signals for -CH2 groups, which suggests that any methylene groups (CH2) are either not present or perhaps not split in a way that shows up as a separate peak. But wait, in the structure, maybe the substituents don't have any CH2 groups
