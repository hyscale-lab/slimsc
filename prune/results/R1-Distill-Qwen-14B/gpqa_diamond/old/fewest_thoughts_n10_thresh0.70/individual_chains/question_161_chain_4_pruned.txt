Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Let's read it carefully.

Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a really high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to have almost no gas molecules, because that's better for electron microscopy. But even so, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer.

He determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in that vacuum state to be λ1. The mean free path depends on things like pressure, temperature, and volume. Okay, so mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Right, the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T temperature, d the diameter of the molecule, and P pressure. So lower pressure would mean longer mean free path.

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2, and the temperature is the same as before. So why would the mean free path change?

Hmm. Well, the mean free path in a gas depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the molecular diameter. Since the temperature is the same, and the pressure in the sample compartment is still the same (because the pumps are running, though some gas is present), why would λ change?

Wait, but when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving at high speeds. High-energy electrons might cause some effects. Like, maybe the gas molecules are being ionized or excited. Or perhaps the electrons are causing the gas to heat up, but the question says the temperature is the same. So heating might not be the issue here.

Another thought: maybe the electrons are scattering off the gas molecules. That would mean that the gas molecules are being hit by electrons, which could cause them to move or perhaps even change their state. But wait, the mean free path is about how far the gas molecules go without colliding. So if the electrons are interacting with the gas, it's more about the electron's path, not the gas's movement.

Wait, but the mean free path λ is for the gas molecules. Oh no, no,
