Okay, so I've got this question about meiosis and genetic syndromes. Hmm, let me think. The question is about why Klinefelter's syndrome has less severe consequences compared to Down's syndrome. 

I remember that Klinefelter's affects males and results from an extra X chromosome, making the karyotype XXY. Down's is when there's an extra chromosome 21, so Trisomy 21. Both are caused by errors in meiosis, right? But the phenotypes are different in severity.

Wait, the question is about the molecular mechanism that leads to Klinefelter's having less severe effects. So what's the difference in how these conditions affect the body?

I think Down's syndrome is more severe because trisomy 21 affects multiple systems due to the presence of three copies of genes on chromosome 21. That leads to a range of developmental issues. But why is Klinefelter's less severe? Maybe because the extra X is in males, so it's an XXY, which is a sex chromosome issue. But how does that make the phenotype less severe?

Wait, another thought: Klinefelter's is caused by having an extra X, but since males have an XY, maybe the extra X doesn't have as many genes as a whole chromosome. Or perhaps the X is inactivated. Oh, like in females with XXY, but Klinefelter's is in males. Wait, males
