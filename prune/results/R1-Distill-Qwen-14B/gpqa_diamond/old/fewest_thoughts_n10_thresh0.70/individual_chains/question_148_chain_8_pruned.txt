Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think it through step by step. 

The question involves binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. Let me try to parse each part carefully.

First, substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the decomposition reaction could be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Wait, but fluorine is a diatomic gas, so perhaps it's F2. Also, the oF for A2 is given as 31.96%. oF probably stands for the oxygen of fluorine, but wait, no, oxygen is O. Oh, wait, in chemistry, sometimes the term 'oF' isn't standard, but maybe it's the oxygen-free fluorine? Or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's the formula weight or the percentage of fluorine in the compound. Oh, yes, probably the percentage of fluorine by mass. So A2 is a compound where fluorine makes up 31.96% of its mass. 

So, if A2 is YF_x, then (atomic weight of F * x) / (atomic weight Y + x*F) ) *100 = 31.96%. Let me see, the atomic weight of F is about 19. So, 19x/(Y + 19x) = 0.3196. Maybe I can solve for Y. Let's rearrange: 19x = 0.3196*(Y +19x). Multiply out: 19x = 0.3196 Y + 0.3196*19x. Subtract the right term: 19x - 0.3196*19x = 0.3196 Y. Factor: 19x (1 - 0.3196) = 0.3196 Y. So 19x * 0.6804 = 0.3196 Y. Divide both sides by 0.3196: Y = (19x * 0.6804) / 0.3196. Let me compute that: 0.6804 / 0.3196 is approximately 2.128. So Y = 19x * 2.128. Hmm, 19*2.128 is around 40.43. So Y is about 40.43 x. So Y=40.43 x. But Y has to be an element, so its atomic weight should be a specific number. Let me think about possible elements. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of possible fluorides where F is about 31.96%. Let's take Y as an example. Suppose Y is iodine, which has an atomic weight of about 127. Let's see: what x would give F as 31.96%? So (19x)/(127 +19x) = 0.3196. Multiply both sides by denominator: 19x = 0.3196*(127 +19x). 19x = 40.8872 + 6.0724x. Subtract 6.0724x: 12.9276x =40.8872 → x≈40.8872/12.9276 ≈3.167. Hmm, not an integer. So maybe Y is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element. Let's try Y with a lower atomic weight
