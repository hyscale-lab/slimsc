Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

First, the state is given as |ψ> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh right, |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states. And N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Oh wait, that's provided, so I don't have to compute that from scratch.

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, which is defined as delta_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the state |psi> and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember that Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions. Coherent states are Gaussian, and superpositions of coherent states can create non-Gaussian states. The Schrödinger cat state is a classic example of a non-Gaussian state, so expecting non-zero nG here.

But wait, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the best Gaussian approximation. Or is it the other way around? Because the relative entropy measure here is delta_b, which is the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau. So if the state is non-Gaussian, this delta_b should be positive, right?

But wait, I've read that the relative entropy between the state and the Gaussian state is sometimes used as a measure of non-Gaussianity. So the formula given is the correct approach.

But how do I compute this? Let me think about the steps.

First, I need to construct the density matrix rho for the given |psi>. The state is a superposition of two coherent states. The coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are eigenstates of the annihilation operator a, and their density matrices are pure states (since they’re coherent states, which are like classical states of the oscillator). But when you take a superposition, the state becomes mixed, so rho is |psi><psi|.

Wait, but for a pure state, the density matrix is |psi><psi|, so rho is pure. Then the entropy of rho would be zero, because pure states have zero entropy. Wait, but the state |psi> is a pure state, so rho is pure. Hmm, but when calculating the entropy, if rho is pure, then trace(rho ln rho) is zero. Because rho^2 = rho, so ln(rho^2) = ln(rho), but wait, no. Wait, for a pure state, rho squared is rho. So rho ln rho would be rho * ln(rho), which is zero only if rho is a delta function in the eigenbasis, but wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. The
