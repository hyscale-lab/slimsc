Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.

Alright, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So, the star moves a little because of the planet's orbit, and that causes a shift in the spectral lines we observe.

So the setup: two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected each planet, and the spectral line shifts are given as 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I think the key here is the relationship between the Doppler shift and the orbital period. From what I remember, the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is the maximum velocity the star moves toward or away from us. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) )) ) ? Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I remember that the formula involves the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and semi-major axis.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Doppler shift formula. The Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. So, the shift in wavelength (Δλ) is proportional to the velocity (v) via the formula Δλ/λ = v/c, where c is the speed of light. So, for a given wavelength λ, a larger Δλ means a larger velocity.

But wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity. So, the semi-amplitude K (which is the maximum velocity) is given by K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p
