Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, and a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0Â°C, so 277 is just a bit above. So B is a solid that melts just above freezing point, maybe like ice? Or maybe another substance.

The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. So each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Water vapor is H2O, but that's not a gas like maybe hydrogen or something else. Wait, wait, CO2 is a gas but I'm not sure. Let me think of possible molecules where protons equal neutrons.

Wait, the molecule's molecule, so each molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, total protons (sum of all atoms in the molecule) equals total neutrons. So like, if it's a diatomic molecule, maybe H2O, but H has 1 proton each, O has 8, so total protons would be 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons would be 2 (from H) plus 8 (O has 8 neutrons in its isotope, but wait, wait, O-16 has 8 neutrons. So H2O would have 10 protons and 2*1 (H's neutrons, assuming lightest isotope) +8 (O's neutrons) =10. Oh, that matches! So H2O has 10 protons and 10 neutrons. So W could be water vapor.

Wait, but wait. The reaction is between X and Y, releasing gas W. Let me think about reactions that produce water. For example, maybe a metal reacting with an acid. Or maybe an acid reacting with a carbonate, which produces CO2 gas. But wait, if W is CO2, then the protons would be 2 (C has 6, O has 8 each, so 6 + 2*
