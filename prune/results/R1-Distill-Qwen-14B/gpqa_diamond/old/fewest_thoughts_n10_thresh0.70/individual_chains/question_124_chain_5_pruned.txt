Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, with a Lorentz factor around 20 on average. Now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. So, the options are A) 54, B)68, C)40, D)28. 

Wait, okay, I remember that the Lorentz factor is gamma, which relates to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Because the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. So the distance they can travel before decaying depends on their speed.

I think the formula for the distance a particle travels before decaying is L = gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame). 

In the original scenario, with gamma_1 = 20, one third of the particles reach the detector's walls. So, the particles that reach the walls have a lifetime long enough to travel the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. 

Wait, but wait, the problem says "on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector's inner walls." So does that mean that one third have a lifetime long enough to reach 30 meters? Or maybe it's about the probability of decaying before reaching the wall.

Hmm, maybe it's more about the probability of decay. The particles have a certain lifetime, and the probability that they survive to reach the wall depends on their lifetime compared to the time it takes them to reach the wall.

In the lab frame, the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is t = R/(gamma*c) or wait, no. Wait, the time to reach the wall is t = (distance) / (velocity). But in the lab frame, the particle's velocity is v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, okay, so I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma relates to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. But how does that apply here? The particles are produced at the center and move outward, and only a fraction reach the walls. So I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls compared to their lifetime.

Right, because if the particle's lifetime is dilated due to their high speed, they can travel farther before decaying. But wait, in this case, the problem says they travel at ultra-relativistic speeds and are fast-decaying. So the number that reach the walls depends on their lifetime and speed.

I think the key here is to consider the proper time of the particles. Let me think: the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But from the lab frame (the detector's frame), the lifetime is longer, so gamma times the proper lifetime.

So, the particles are produced at the center of the detector. The distance they need to travel is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. The time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is t = distance / speed. Since they're moving at a relativistic speed, their speed is v ≈ c (because they're ultra-relativistic, gamma is large, so v is close to c). So t ≈ 30 m / c.

But the time available for the particle to reach the wall is this t, compared to its lifetime as measured in the lab frame. If the lab frame lifetime is longer than t, then the particle will make it. If the lifetime is shorter, it won't.

Wait, but the problem says that with gamma ~2
