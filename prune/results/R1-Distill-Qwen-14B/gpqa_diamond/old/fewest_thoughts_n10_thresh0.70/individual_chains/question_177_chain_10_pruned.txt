Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and break it down. 

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I need to find out by how much the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate which one is correct.

First, let's note down the given information:

1. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2.
2. The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, M1 = 1.5 * M2.
3. Both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. The formula is Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. The stars have the same peak wavelength, so same temperature. So T1 = T2.

Now, the problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. Since luminosity depends on radius and temperature, I can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Luminosity L is given by L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

But since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would make L1 2.25 times L2.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh right, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But in this case, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But wait, the problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest (their peak wavelengths) were the same. So, the observed λ_max is same for both stars. But if they're moving, their emitted wavelengths would be different, but the observed would be same because of Doppler shift.

Wait, but I thought that the temperature was the same, but maybe I'm missing something here because of the velocity. Let me think.

Wien's Law relates the peak wavelength to the temperature of the source. If the observed wavelength is the same, but the stars are moving, then their temperatures would be different. Because the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ) or something like that, depending on the direction of motion and the approximation used. Wait, I'm not too sure about the exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength. Let me recall.
