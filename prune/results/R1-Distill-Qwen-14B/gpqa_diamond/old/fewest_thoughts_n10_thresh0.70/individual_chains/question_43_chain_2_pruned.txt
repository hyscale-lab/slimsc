Okay, so I've got this IUPAC nomenclature question in front of me, and honestly, it's a bit intimidating. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which I think is an aldehyde group, so -CHO), and a cyano group (which is -CN). All of these are meta to one another. Hmm, meta to each other means each is separated by one carbon, so they are at positions 1, 3, and 5 if we consider the ring.

Wait, no. Wait, when substituents are meta to each other, they are on positions that are 120 degrees apart. So, for example, if one substituent is at position 1, another meta would be at 3, and the third also meta would be at 5. So all three are at 1,3,5 positions relative to each other.

But wait, the question says all three (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano) are meta to one another. That suggests each is meta to the others. So their positions are such that each is at the meta position relative to the others. So if I imagine the benzene ring, the three substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5.

Wait, but no. Wait, meta to each other could mean that each substituent is in the meta position relative to the others, which would require each to be at positions that are
