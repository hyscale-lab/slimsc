Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the question says there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not too sure about that—maybe it's gravitational variations? Well, maybe that's not super important for solving this problem.

The key data points given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. Let's list them out.

First, the equilibrium temperature ratios:
- Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4, which means Planet1 is hotter than Planet2.
- Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3, which means Planet2 is hotter than Planet3. So the temperatures are T1 > T2 > T3.

The mass ratios are:
- Planet1 to Planet2 is approximately 1.15, so M1/M2 = 1.15. So Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2.
- Planet2 to Planet3, it's about 1.35. So M2/M3 = 1.35. So Planet2 is more massive than Planet3.

The question is asking about the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So we're looking for P3/P1.

Wait, what determines the orbital period of a planet? Oh, Kepler's third law, right! The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (which, for circular orbits, is just the radius) divided by the mass of the star. But wait, wait—I think I might be mixing up the form. The actual formula when considering the star's mass is P² = (4π²/G(Mstar)) * a³. Or wait, when the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, which is usually the case, the formula simplifies to P² ∝ a³/(Mstar). But in this problem, we're dealing with exoplanets. So the star's mass is the same for all three, right? Because they're orbiting the same star.

Wait, but the problem doesn't directly give the semi-major axes. Hmm, so how can I relate the given data to the orbital periods?

The equilibrium temperature comes into play. The equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis), and the planet's albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16πσ a²) ]^(1/4) ), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the semi-major axis, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since all planets have the same albedo (0.3), that term (1 - a) is the same for all. Also, the star's luminosity L is the same for all, so the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends on the cube root of the reciprocal of the semi-major axis. Because T is proportional to (L/(a²))^(1/4). So T1/T2 = ( (a2²) / (a1²) )^(1/4), wait, no, I think the inverse. Because if a planet is farther away (larger a), its temperature would be lower. So T ∝ (1/a)^0.5, because T = [L(1-a)/(16πσ a²)]^½. Wait, no, let me re-derive it.

The equilibrium temperature (T) equation is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - a_p) )^(1/4 ), where a_p is the planet's albedo. But maybe it's better to think of it as T ∝ (L/(16πσ a² (1 - a)))^½. Wait
