Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down.

Wait, the question gives me bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Oh right, enthalpy of formation is the change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I need to find the enthalpy change for making this molecule from its constituent atoms.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The formula is something like: ΔH°f = sum of bond energies of reactants - sum of bond energies of products. But wait, wait. No, wait, actually, it's the other way around. Because when bonds are broken (reactants), you're putting energy in, and when bonds form (products), energy is released. So the formula is probably the sum of bond energies in the reactants minus the sum in the products. Hmm, no, wait. Let me think: the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of energies of the bonds broken (the reactants) minus the sum of the bonds formed (the products). Or is it the other way around? Maybe I should recall the correct formula.

Wait, the standard approach is to calculate the enthalpy change as the sum of the bond energies of the reactant bonds minus the sum of the bond energies of the product bonds. Because when bonds break (reactant side), you're absorbing energy, and when bonds form (product side), you're releasing it. So the overall enthalpy change is the energy needed to break the reactant bonds minus the energy released when forming the product bonds. So the formula is ΔH = (sum of bonds broken) - (sum of bonds formed).

But wait, in the case of enthalpy of formation, the reaction is the formation of the compound from elements. So elements are in their standard states, like O2, N2, CH4, etc. But wait, in this case, the compound is made from carbon and hydrogen. So the reactants would be C ( graphite?) and H2. The products are the given compound.

So the
