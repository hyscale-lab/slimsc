Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step. 

The question talks about two mixtures, X and Y, and a substance Z. There's a lot here, so I'll try to parse each part.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Wait, decolorizing bromine water usually happens because the substance has double bonds. Like alkenes can do that because they react with Br2. So, the liquids in X must have double bonds. 

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. But Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hmm, so Y doesn't have double bonds anymore. Oh, maybe they were hydrogenated? Because hydrogenation of alkenes would add H2 across the double bond, turning them into single bonds. So the reaction might be hydrogenation, but wait, the question says it's a disproportionation reaction. Oh right, so it's not hydrogenation but a reaction where one molecule is both oxidized and reduced.

Wait, so X is a mixture that when treated with Pt and heat, undergoes a disproportionation to form Y. So the reaction is a disproportionation. Let's think about possible substances that undergo disproportionation upon heating with a catalyst like Pt. One example I remember is the disproportionation of alcohols. For example, ethanol can't usually do this, but maybe something else. Oh wait, maybe it's about alkenes or something else.

Wait, but the problem says that Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y's components don't have double bonds. So if X's components had double bonds, but after reaction (disproportionation), the products don't have double bonds. Hmm.

Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated (in presence of Pt under severe conditions), they give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let me calculate what that is. 14.28% is roughly 1/7, because 14.28 is approximately 100 divided by 7. So if the mass of hydrogen is 14.28%, the mass of carbon would be 85.72%.
