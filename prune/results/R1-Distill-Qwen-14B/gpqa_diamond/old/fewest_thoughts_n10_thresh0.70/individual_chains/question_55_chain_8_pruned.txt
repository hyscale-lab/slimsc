Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are different types of propenyl or butenyl acetatesâ€”cis or trans for each. So, I need to match the NMR peaks to the structure.

First, let me think about the structures of these compounds. Acetate esters typically have an ester group (OAc), and the rest is a propenyl or butenyl group attached. So, the structure would be something like R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH3. So, the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3. Or wait, wait. No, wait, acetate is CH3COO-. So, the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of R-OAc, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this confused. Let me clarify. The ester would be formed from an acid and an alcohol. So, if the acid is acetic acid (CH3COOH) and the alcohol is, say, propenyl alcohol, then the ester would be propenyl acetate. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-OCH3? Or wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

Wait, propenyl groups are CH2=CHCH2-, right? So, propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? Or wait, I think I'm mixing up the substituents. Acetate esters are typically R-O-CO-OCH3, where R is the propenyl group. So, the structure would be R-O-CO-OCH3, where R is CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-O..., right? Or wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-O-Ac, where Ac is the acetate group.

Wait, but wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl.
