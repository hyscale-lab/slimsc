Okay, I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about the possible decay products of a boson X, given its mass is 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is provided, but I'm not sure if I need to look into that for the kinematic decay possibilities. Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so I think that's the key here.

Hmm, kinematically allowed decays. Kinematics depends on the conservation laws and the available energy. So, each decay product must have a mass less than or equal to half of X's mass if they are fermions, because fermions decay into pairs. Or wait, actually, for a particle at rest decaying into two particles, each must have energy less than or equal to the mass of the parent divided by two. Because in the rest frame, the invariant mass of the decay products can't exceed the parent's mass.

Wait, no, more accurately, when a particle of mass M decays into two particles each of mass m, each must satisfy m ≤ M/2. But if the decay products are leptons, which are massless compared to typical particle physics energies, except for the tau and maybe others. Oh wait, electrons have negligible mass, but muons and taus have masses. Let me think about the masses of the fermions.

So, X is a boson with mass 6 GeV. What particles can it decay into? The possible decay channels are into fermion-antifermion pairs. Let's list the possible fermions.

Fermions include quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), electrons, muons, taus, neutrinos. But for decay into a pair, the fermion must be able to have a mass pair that doesn't exceed X's mass.

Wait, the decay products would be a pair of particles. Each fermion's mass has to be less than or equal to half of X's mass because when the boson is at rest, each particle can have at most (M/2) energy, considering rest mass and kinetic energy. But wait, X is a boson, so it could decay into any allowed fermion pair as long as each fermion's mass is less than or equal to M/2.

So M(X) is 6 GeV. M/2 is 3 GeV.

Now, what fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Looking at the known fermion masses:

- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV (negligible)
- Muon: ~0.105 GeV
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV
- Up, Down: a few MeV, negligible
- Strange: ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV
- Top: way too heavy, ~173 GeV

So, the fermions that have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV are:

- Up (u)
- Down (d)
- Strange (s)
- Charm (c)
- Muon (mu)
- Tau (tau)
- Electron (e)

Wait, the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So, X can't decay into b quarks. Because 4.5 GeV is more than half of X's 6 GeV. If X decays into a b and anti-b, each b would need to be at most 3 GeV, but each is 4.5, which isn't possible.

So, the possible decay products are into the light quarks (u, d, s, c), and the leptons (e, mu, tau), assuming the Lagrangian allows for such interactions.

Wait, but the Lagrangian given is L = -λ f bar ψ f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ f(y). Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what this means. It looks like an interaction term between the field X and fermions ψ f, with a coupling λ. The term is Yukawa-like, I think. So, this would imply that the interaction is between X and each fermion type ψ f, where f is the flavor. So, which fermions are involved?

In the Lagrangian, the interaction is with fermions ψ_f. So, perhaps the fermions that X couples to are the ones present in the Lagrangian, which depends on the model. But wait, in the question, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f bar ψ f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps that's a typo in the question? Because the way it's written is a bit confusing. Maybe it's L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). That would make more sense. So, the interaction is between X and each ψ_f, where f is the flavor index.

So, the fermions that X can interact with are all the ψ_f, which probably includes all the known quarks and leptons. Because in the Standard Model, the Yukawa interaction couples Higgs to all fermions. But perhaps in this problem, X is a scalar (boson) that couples to fermions in the same way.

Assuming that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as they are kinematically allowed.

So, considering the masses, the possible fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. Because their masses are less than 3 GeV. The top quark is way too heavy (can't decay into t tbar), and the bottom quark is 4.5 GeV, which is over 3, so can't decay into b bbar.

So the possible decay channels are:

X → uū, dđ, sī, cč, e+ e−, mu+ mu−, tau+ tau−.

Wait, but wait, the tau is about 1.777 GeV. So 2*1.777 is 3.554 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? No, wait, no. Wait, M(X) is 6 GeV. If X decays into a tau and anti-tau, the mass of each tau is 1.777 GeV, so 2 * 1.777 GeV is 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's okay. Because X can have more than twice the tau mass. So that would be allowed.

Wait, no, wait: when a particle decays into two particles, each must be less than the parent mass. Because the maximum rest mass each can have is when the other is at rest. So for X → A + B, each A and B must have m_A ≤ M_X / 2, and similarly for m_B. So for X → tau+ tau−, each tau's mass is 1.777 GeV, which is about 1.777 ≤ 3 GeV. So that's allowed.

So possible decay products are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau, and their antiparticles. So the decay products are into pairs like uu, dd, ss, cc, ee, mu+mu−, tau+tau−.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b bbar, s sbar, uubar, dđ, tau+ tau−, e+ e−. So this includes b, but as we saw, b is too heavy. So this can't be right.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, uubar, dđ, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. So includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct, except what about the tau?

Wait, 6 GeV is enough for tau's. So all these would be allowed.

Option C: Includes c, s, u, d, t (no, because t is 173 GeV, way too heavy), but option C includes t. So that's not possible. So Option C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which is not allowed. So option D is incorrect.

So between options B and D. But wait, looking again, option B's decay products are c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau, mu, e. So all the allowed ones except for bottom.

So the correct decay products are all the light quarks (u, d, s, c), and the leptons (e, mu, tau). So the allowed decays are into c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, mu, e.

Looking back, option B includes all these. Option D includes b, which isn't allowed.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs, and the kinematic constraint is that the mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to half of \( X \)'s mass, i.e., \( M_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \). 

The masses of the known fermions are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (negligible)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up (\( u \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (negligible)
- Down (\( d \)): \( \sim 5 \, \text{MeV} \) (negligible)
- Strange (\( s \)): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \))
- Top (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (far exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \))

From this, the fermions with masses less than or equal to \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \). Therefore, the boson \( X \) can decay into the following pairs: \( u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \). Decays into \( b\bar{b} \) or \( t\bar{t} \) are not allowed because their masses exceed \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), which are all allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \).

Answer: B
