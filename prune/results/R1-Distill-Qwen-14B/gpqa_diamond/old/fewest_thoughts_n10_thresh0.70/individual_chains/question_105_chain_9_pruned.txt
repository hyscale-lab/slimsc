Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

So the problem is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, its brightness changes. These brightness variations can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is asking, if there were an exoplanet instead of spots, what would its radius need to be relative to the host star to produce the same brightness variation amplitude in the light curve?

Hmm. So the key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness, also known as the transit depth, when a planet transits in front of the star. The same method is used when trying to detect exoplanets, where the dip in brightness is measured.

Wait, but in this case, the star has spots, and that's causing the brightness variation. The question is saying that this variation is similar to what an exoplanet would cause. So we need to find the planet radius (Rpl) such that the transit depth is equal to the variation caused by the spots.

I remember that the transit depth (delta F) is given by (Rpl/Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio. So to find Rpl, I need to compute the square root of the delta F times (Rstar)^2, but wait, actually, delta F = (Rpl/Rstar)^2, so Rpl = Rstar * sqrt(delta F).

But first, I need to find delta F caused by the spots, and then find what Rpl would produce the same delta F.

Wait, but let's think about the star's brightness variation due to the spots. When a spot is on the side facing us, it blocks some of the star's light. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, the star's rotation will cause spots to come into and out of view. The brightness change is due to the spots being either on the visible side or not.

But how do the spots affect the overall brightness? The spots are cooler, so when they're on the visible hemisphere, the star's overall flux decreases.

Wait, the total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the unspotted and spotted areas. The star has a radius R, so its total surface area is 4πR². The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface, so 20% of a hemisphere is 0.2 * (2πR²) / 2? Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the entire star.

Wait, the star's total surface is 4πR². The problem states that the filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². Because a hemisphere is 2πR², right? So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, no, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's spotted. So hemisphere area is 2πR², 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the area of spots is 0.4πR².

But when the star rotates, the spots come into view and go out of view. But since it's only one hemisphere that's spotty, when the star rotates 180 degrees, the spots would be on the opposite side. So the maximum effect would be when the spots are facing us
