Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it again, and try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds. The data given includes mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR. Hmm, I've heard about these techniques in my studies, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me jot down the key points.

Mass spectrometry: molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%), and a peak at 158 (32%). So the molecular ion is the largest peak, and another peak is close to it. I remember that the molecular ion peak (M) is usually the highest one, and sometimes there are fragments or isotopic peaks nearby. Since 158 is 2 more than 156, maybe it's a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has two main isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if the molecular formula has a Cl, the M peak would be an average, and the M+2 would be another peak. Let me think: Cl contributes an average of about 35.5. So if the molecular weight is 156, what's the formula? Let me see the options.

IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. 1720 is a bit lower than a ketone (which is around 1700-1750 maybe?) Wait, benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1700. Wait, I think carboxylic acids have O-H stretches that are broad, and their carbonyl is around 1700. Alternatively, maybe an ester or something else. The broad peak could be from an -OH group.

1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H). Okay, I remember that in aromatic protons, the signals around 7-8 ppm are typical. The singlet at 11 ppm is probably an -OH proton, but wait, in D2O, it might exchange and broaden, but in NMR, a sharp singlet could mean it's not exchanging or maybe it's a different proton. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent proton, like an aldehyde. Because aldehydes have protons around 9-10 ppm, but wait, this is higher. Wait, 11 ppm is really high. That makes me think of a carboxylic acid's -OH. Wait, but carboxylic acid protons are usually broad singlets. But here, it's sharp. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? Wait, no, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10. 11 is higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic phenolic proton, but then it would be broad. Wait, but the problem says it's a singlet, so maybe it's not an -OH. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That's an aromatic compound with hydroxyl and aldehyde groups. Structure is Cl in position 3, OH in 2, and aldehyde in position 1 (if numbering starts from the aldehyde). The aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but here, it's 11. Maybe that's not right.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl on position 4, and a COOH group on position 1. The COOH would have an -OH proton, which would be around 11. Also, the IR would show a broad peak from the COOH O-H, and a strong peak around 1700 for the carbonyl. The NMR would show a singlet for the COOH proton, but wait, in DMSO or CDCl3, sometimes the COOH proton is a broad peak, but in the question, it's a singlet. Hmm, but if the sample is not dissolved in D2O, maybe the peak is sharp? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl attached to a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, so maybe Cl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, chloroformate would have the structure O=C(OCl)Ph? Wait, I'm not that confident. Alternatively, the structure might be Cl-CO-O-Ph, where the carbonyl is part of an ester group. The IR would show a peak around 1720, which is consistent with an ester
