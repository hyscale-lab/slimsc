Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound D is. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Okay, the question starts with compound A. It shows two signals in the proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet means each is next to three.

So, the triplet at 0.9 ppm—0.9 is usually a signal for methyl groups, like CH3. Since it's a triplet, maybe each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2 group. Because if two neighboring protons cause splitting into a triplet, perhaps each CH3 is next to a CH2 with two Hs. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the splitting is about neighboring groups. Oh wait, the triplet for 6H suggests that each of those Hs is next to a group with two Hs. So maybe it's a CH2CH3 group. Because the CH2 would split the CH3 into a triplet. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted group.

Wait, 6H is a lot. Maybe two CH3 groups each adjacent to a CH2. So 2 CH3 groups each with 3H, so total 6H. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm is 4H. Quartet suggests each of those Hs is next to a group with three Hs. Wait, or maybe two adjacent groups with two Hs each, leading to a quartet. Oh wait, 4H—could that be two CH2 groups each adjacent to another CH2?

Wait, maybe compound A is something like diethyl ether? Because diethyl ether has two ethyl groups. Let me think: the structure of diethyl ether is CH2CH2OCH2CH2. Wait, no, wait. No, diethyl ether is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. So each CH2CH3 group. The protons on the CH3 would be next to CH2, so they'd be triplet. Because each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2 with two Hs. So the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H (two CH3 groups
