Okay, so I have this question about optical activity and I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Optical activity means the compound has chiral centers, right? Or wait, does it also depend on whether there's an absence of a plane of symmetry or if the molecule isn't meso?

Let me go through each compound one by one. 

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Hmm, so the structure is CH2ClC(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, but wait, wait. The formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1: Cl, C2: CH(CH3), and the rest are CH2 groups? Wait, but for a double bond, the substituents are around.

Wait, but the configuration is Z. Z denotes that the higher priority groups on each carbon are on the same side. But does this make the molecule chiral? Let's see. The molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw it. The structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So
