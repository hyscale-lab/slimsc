Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on its spectral data. Let me read through the information again and try to break it down.

The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at 158, which is 32% of the base peak. Hmm, so the molecular ion is likely the major peak, and the 158 could be a fragment or maybe a different ion like a [M+2] peak. Wait, chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35.5, so if the molecule has a Cl, the [M+2] would make sense because Cl can have a +2 (since natural abundance for 35Cl is about 75% and 37Cl is about 25%, so sometimes you get a peak two mass units higher when the Cl is present).

Looking at the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad usually suggests O-H stretch, maybe a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 indicates a carbonyl group. So maybe a carbonyl like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide, or carboxylic acid. The exact cm^-1 can help. For example, carboxylic acids have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 (which I see is in the broad region here), and their carbonyl is around 1700. Esters also have carbonyls around 1720-1740. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid or an ester.

Now the 1H NMR data: 
- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): That's a really high chemical shift. Usually, that's an aldehyde proton (around 9-10 ppm) or a carboxylic acid proton (which can be around 10-12 ppm) but broad. Wait, but in the NMR, it's a singlet. Carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, but here it's a sharp singlet. So maybe it's an aldehyde? But aldehydes are around 9-10. Maybe a more deshielded aldehyde? Or wait, could it be an aromatic aldehyde? Or perhaps something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a phenolic OH, but those are usually around 5 ppm, and they are broad. So 11 ppm doesn't fit that. Alternatively, maybe a nitro group or something else, but that's less likely. Another possibility is an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid, but if it's a singlet, maybe it's deprotonated? Or perhaps it's an aldehyde. Hmm.

Looking at the other NMR signals:
- 8.02 ppm (d, 2H)
- 7.72 ppm (d, 2H)
These are in the aromatic region. The doublets with 2H each suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons on each adjacent carbon are equivalent and show as doublets. So this suggests a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

So putting the aromatic data together: two doublets each integrating for 2H. So perhaps a disubstituted benzene with substituents in the para positions. The substituents could be groups like Cl, COOH, CHO, etc.

Let's think about the molecular weight. The molecular ion is at 156. Let's see what that could be. Let's try to calculate the formula. Let's see: 156 g/mol. Let's see, assuming it's C8H6ClO2, let's calculate: C is 12*8=96, H is 6, Cl is 35.5, O is 16*2=32. Adding these: 96+6=102, 102+35.5=1
