Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let's see. The question involves an astronaut from an alien civilization traveling at a very high speed towards Earth, and I need to figure out how long the trip will take from their perspective. 

Alright, let's break it down. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's like super close to the speed of light. I remember that when you go that fast, time dilation comes into play. Time dilation is that effect where time moves slower for the person moving at a high speed relative to someone else. So from the astronaut's point of view, the trip would take less time than what someone watching from Earth would see.

Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. The average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. Oh, so if the trip takes more than, say, 128 years from Earth's frame, the astronaut might not live long enough. But wait, from the astronaut's perspective, the time is shorter because of time dilation. So I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, not the Earth time.

Wait, the question is about how long it takes from the astronaut's point of view. So I need to find the proper time, which is the time experienced by the traveler.

First, I should figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give that, so maybe I can find it from known data. The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 1
