Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about gene interactions related to disease resistance in white lupine. The setup is that someone did an experiment where they knocked out three genes, G1, G2, G3, and their double mutants, and then tested the plants' resistance to anthracnose. The question is about figuring out the relationships between these genes based on the resistance levels.

Let me first go through the data. The control has 100% resistance. The single mutants are g1 (75%), g2 (0%), and g3 (50%). The double mutants are g1g3 (10%), g2g3 (0%), and g1g2 (0%). 

The question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, probably it's a regulatory gene. Transcription factors usually activate other genes, so if a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes wouldn't be expressed, leading to reduced resistance.

Looking at the single mutants: g2 has 0% resistance, which is the worst. That suggests that gene G2 is crucial because without it, the plants can't resist the pathogen at all. So maybe G2 is the transcription factor, because if it's knocked out, all the downstream genes it activates aren't working, leading to no resistance.

Now, the double mutants: g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance. Since g2 is already 0%, adding another knockout (g1 or g3) doesn't make it any worse. So perhaps G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream of it. But wait, the double mutant g1g3 is only 10%â€”so what's happening there?

Let me think about epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. If G2 is the transcription factor (upstream), then G1 and G3 are downstream. If G2 is non-functional, then both G1 and G3 can't work, so the resistance is gone. But in the double mutant g1g3, which is 10%, perhaps both G1 and G3 are contributing to resistance, but when both are knocked out, the resistance drops further.

Wait, g1 has 75%, which is less than control but not zero. So maybe G1 alone can partially compensate or provide some resistance. Similarly, g3 is 50%, which is half of control. So without G3, the plant's resistance is halved, but without G2, resistance is gone. So G2 might be required for both G1 and G3's functions.

Looking at the double mutants: 

- g1g2 is 0%: Since G2 is already knocked out, even without G1, the resistance is gone. So G2's function is upstream of both G1 and G3.

- g2g3 is 0%: Similar reasoning.

But g1g3 is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is even lower than either single mutant. So maybe G1 and G
