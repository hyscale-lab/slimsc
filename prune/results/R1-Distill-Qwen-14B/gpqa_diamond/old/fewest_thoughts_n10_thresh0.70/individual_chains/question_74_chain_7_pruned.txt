Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The key here is that the decay process is memoryless, right? So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay shouldn't affect the future probability. 

Wait, the question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Hmm, that's the probability that the atom decays in that time frame. So, the survival probability after 100 minutes would be 1 minus 0.32, which is 0.68. 

But how does that tie into the decay constant? Oh right, the decay follows the formula N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt). The survival probability is e^(-λt), so that's equal to 0.68 when t is 100 minutes. So I can solve for λ.

Taking the natural log of both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ * 100. That gives λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that. 

Wait, ln(0.68) is negative, so when I divide by -100, λ will be positive. Let me approximate ln(0.68). I know ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. So 0.68 is closer to 0.5, but let me think. Maybe around -0.385?
