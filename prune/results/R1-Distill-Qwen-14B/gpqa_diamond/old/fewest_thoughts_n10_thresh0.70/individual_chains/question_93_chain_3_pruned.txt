Okay, so I have this question about qPCR and calibration curves. I'm a bit new to this, but let's think through it step by step.

Alright, the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency is 100%, RÂ² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. Hmm, I remember that a perfect efficiency (100%) means the reaction is doubling the target each cycle, so the efficiency formula is E = 100% when slope = -3.3219, which is close to -3.3. So the slope here makes sense for 100% efficiency.

Looking at the data, each concentration is diluted tenfold. The Ct values go down by about 3 each time. For example, 100000 copies have Ct around 34, then 10000 is around 31, 1000 is 27, 100 is 24, and 10 is 20.7.

Wait, the question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options talk about possible explanations for the discrepancies.

Let me look at each option:

Option A: qPCR cannot be used for quantification. No, that's not right. The premise says he's using it for quantification, and the data seems to follow a curve, so it's working. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Ct values not in agreement with target nucleic acid. Hmm, the Ct values are lower (earlier) when the concentration is higher. That's correct behavior because higher starting quantity means it reaches threshold sooner. So B might not be the right choice because the Ct and quantity seem to agree.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, each ten-fold dilution would ideally cause a decrease of about 3.3 cycles. Because with 100% efficiency, the formula is Ct = Ct0 + (log10(initial copies) * slope). So each tenfold (log10(10)=1) gives a change of slope*(-1) because slope is negative. His slope is -3.3, so each dilution of 10x would decrease Ct by 3.3. Looking at the data, from 100000 (10^5) to 10000 (10^4), the Ct drops from around 34 to 31, which is a 3 cycle difference. Similarly, each subsequent dilution drops about 3 cycles. So in this case, each tenfold dilution causes a Ct change of about 3.3. So the tenfold is exactly 3.3 cycles, so C says it's more than 3.3. Wait, in the data, 100000 to 10000 is a 10-fold, and the Ct changes by 3.3 (34.2 -30.9 is around 3.3). So the tenfold is exactly 3.3 cycles. So option C is incorrect because it's not
