Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can do.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus with HI is usually used for the hydrolysis of an ester, but wait, no, wait. Or maybe it's for the dehydrohalogenation? Hmm, wait, no. Oh right, when you have an ester and you treat it with something like HI and phosphorus, it's more likely a reaction called the Stephen reduction. Oh wait, no, Stephen reduction uses something else. Or maybe it's the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, red phosphorus and HIâ€”oh, right! That's the reaction used to hydrolyze an ester. Wait, or is it an acid chloride? Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction that converts a nitrile to an amine. No, that's with LiAlH4 or something else. Oh wait, another thought: maybe it's the reduction of a carbonyl group. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Red phosphorus and HI is commonly used in the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. For example, if you have an ester R-O-C-O-R', treating it with HI
