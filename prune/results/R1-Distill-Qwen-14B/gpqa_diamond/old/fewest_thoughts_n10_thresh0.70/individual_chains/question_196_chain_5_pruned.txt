Okay, I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are A to D, and they all involve some combination of c, k, m, and A.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(k A²/m). But this is relativistic, so things are different. Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

In relativity, the equations of motion change. The harmonic oscillator's potential is V(x) = (1/2)k x². But in special relativity, maybe we have to consider the relativistic momentum and energy.

Wait, relativistic energy is given by E = gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the oscillator is subject to Hooke's law, the potential energy is (1/2)k A² at maximum displacement. But in the relativistic case, when the mass is moving, its kinetic energy would be the total energy minus the rest energy. Or maybe I should think about the conservation of energy.

Wait,
