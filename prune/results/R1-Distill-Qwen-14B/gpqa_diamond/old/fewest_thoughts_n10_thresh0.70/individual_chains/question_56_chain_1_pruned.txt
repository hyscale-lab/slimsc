Okay, so I have this problem about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for dipole transitions are important here.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? I think for electric dipole transitions, the change in the angular momentum quantum number l and the magnetic quantum number m are important. So the rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh, but wait, the principal quantum number n can change by any amount as long as the other selection rules are followed.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It goes through two transitions to reach n=1, l=0, m=0. Each transition must follow the selection rules.

Let me think about the first transition from |3,0,0⟩. Since Δl can be ±1, the possible l values for the next state are l=1 (because 0 +1=1, and 0-1 would be -1 which isn't allowed). So the first step must go to a state with l=1.

So the first transition is from l=0 to l=1. Now, for each transition, the m can change by 0, ±1. So starting from m=0, the next m can be -1, 0, or +1. So the possible states after the first transition are |n',1,m'⟩ where m' is -1, 0, +1.

What about the n change? From 3 to 2, because 2 is lower by one, but wait, dipole transitions can have larger n changes, but I think in two steps, maybe you go 3→2 and then 2→1, or maybe 3→1 in one step? No, wait, the problem states it's via two dipole transitions, so each step must change l by ±1, but n can change more, but in this case, probably each step only changes n by 1.

Wait, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It goes to some state with l=1, which would be n=2 or n=4. But since we're going down in energy, probably n=2 is the next step. So first transition: 3,0,0 → 2,1,m'. Then from 2,1,m' to 1,0,0.

Wait, but from 2,1,m', the next transition must have Δl=±1. So l=1 can go to l=0 or l=2. But the target is l=0, so that's possible.

So the second transition must have l going from 1 to 0. So the first step is 3,0,0 → 2,1,m1; second step is 2,1,m1 → 1,0,0.

But wait, the initial state is l=0, m=0. After
