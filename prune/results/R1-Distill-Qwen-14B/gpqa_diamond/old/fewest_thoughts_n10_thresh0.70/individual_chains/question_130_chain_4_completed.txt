Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. 

I remember that neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs light at specific wavelengths. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, that's in the ultraviolet range, right? Because Lyman series is for hydrogen and it's in UV. So, if a cloud of hydrogen is in front of a quasar, it absorbs the quasar's light at that wavelength.

But wait, if a quasar is at a high redshift, the absorbed light would shift into longer wavelengths. So the observed wavelength would be longer than 1216 Angstroms. But optical telescopes can't see that if the wavelength is too long, especially considering the atmosphere's opacity. The atmosphere is opaque to a lot of UV, so ground-based telescopes can't observe the Lyman-alpha line in UV. But if the cloud is at a high enough redshift, the Lyman-alpha absorption would shift into the optical range, which telescopes can see.

So the key here is the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. Let's think about how redshift affects that. The observed wavelength λ_obs is equal to (1 + z) * λ_rest. So λ_obs = (1 + z) * 1216 Å.

But optical telescopes can't go beyond certain wavelengths. Wait, what's the cutoff? I think the Earth's atmosphere is mostly transparent to visible light, but not to everything. The optical range is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength needs to be within that range for ground-based telescopes to detect it.

But wait, sometimes the Lyman-alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra, right? Those are absorption lines from neutral hydrogen clouds at various redshifts. So I think those clouds are at higher redshifts than the quasars, or maybe lower? Or maybe the quasars are at higher redshifts. Not sure, but the point is the Lyman-alpha line is redshifted into the visible range.

So for the Lyman-alpha emission (or absorption) to be in the optical range, the redshift z must satisfy λ_obs = (1 + z) * 1216 Å ≤ 7000 Å (since 700 nm is the red end of visible). Wait, but wait, 1216 is 121.6 nm, which is UV. So when redshifted, it becomes longer.

Let me calculate the smallest z for which λ_obs is in the optical range. Let's set λ_obs = 4000 Å (the start of visible, but maybe higher? No, because higher redshift would mean longer wavelength).

Wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the smallest z where the Lyman-alpha line can still be detected in optical. Because if z is too small, the Lyman-alpha would be in UV, which ground-based telescopes can't see.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The cloud is in front of the quasar, so the quasar's light passes through the cloud, which absorbs the Lyman-alpha. So the quasar's emission is in the optical, but the absorption is at 1216 Angstroms. If the quasar is at a high redshift, then the Lyman-alpha absorption would be shifted into a longer wavelength. So for the absorption line to be in the optical (so the telescope can detect it), (1 + z) * 1216 must be less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms (since beyond that is near-infrared, which some ground telescopes can handle, but maybe the question is considering optical only up to about 700 nm).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, quasars emit across the spectrum, but the point is that the Lyman-alpha line from the cloud is absorbed. So the cloud's own emission isn't the point; it's the absorption in the quasar's light. So the quasar's light is observed through the cloud. So the cloud must be at a redshift where the Lyman-alpha line is in the observed spectrum. But if the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar, then the Lyman-alpha would be redshifted but still in the UV, which can't be detected. So the cloud must be at the same or higher redshift than the quasar? No, wait, no, the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. Hmm, no, because if the cloud is in front, it's at a lower redshift, as it's closer to us. So for example, quasar is at z=3, cloud is at z=2. So when the quasar's light comes through the cloud, the cloud's absorption is at its own z. So the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption is (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 Ang.

So for the absorption line to be in the optical, (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 must be in the optical range. Wait, but if the quasar is at a higher redshift, say z_quasar = 3, and the cloud is at z_cloud = 2, then the absorption is at 1216*(1+2)=3648 Ang, which is 364.8 nm, which is in the UV. So ground-based telescopes can't see it. So to have the absorption line in the optical, (1 + z_cloud)*1216 must be greater than 4000 Ang (400 nm is violet, the start of visible). Wait, 400 nm is 4000 Ang, and 700 nm is 7000 Ang.

So let's compute the minimum z_cloud such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >= 4000 Ang.

Let me compute:

(1 + z_cloud) = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29.

So z_cloud ≈ 2.29.

But wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is close to option C) 2.4. But wait, wait, the question says "lower limit on the redshift of this objects"—so the minimum z where the cloud can be detected. So the minimal z would be where λ_obs is just at the limit of optical. Let me think, if the cloud is at the minimum z, then the Lyman-alpha is observed at the lower end of the optical range, say 400 nm. If the cloud is at a higher z, the observed wavelength is longer (redwards), which is still in optical.

Wait, but if the cloud is at a lower z, then the observed wavelength is shorter, which would be in UV, which we can't see. So the minimal z is when the observed wavelength is at the start of the optical, 400 nm.

Wait, but wait, what's the exact cutoff? Because the atmosphere is opaque to a lot of UV. The ground-based telescopes can't observe wavelengths below about 300 nm (which is UV), so the Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted into the optical.

So I'll set λ_obs >= 300 nm (3000 Ang). Then,

(1 + z_cloud) * 1216 >= 3000

So 1+z >= 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.468.

So z >= ~1.468.

Wait, but the options given are D)1.9, which is higher than 1.468, and C)2.4.

Wait, but if I take the optical range as starting at 400 nm, then:

1216*(1+z) >= 4000.

So (1+z) >= 4000/1216 = approx 3.29.

So z >= 2.29. So the lower limit is about 2.29, so the minimal z is 2.3, which is option C) 2.4, but wait, 2.3 is lower than 2.4. Hmm, so perhaps the calculation is for a higher wavelength?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the quasar's own emission line. Wait, no, the question is about the absorption line.

Wait, another angle: the quasar's light is redshifted due to its own redshift. Wait, no. The quasar's light is emitted at various wavelengths. The Lyman-alpha absorption from the cloud is at 1216*(1+z_cloud) Ang. So for this to be in the optical, that product must be less than about 7000 Ang (700 nm).

Wait, wait, no. Because if λ_obs is less than 4000 Ang, that's in the UV. So for the line to be in the optical (say >=400 nm, 4000 Ang), we need (1 + z_cloud)*1216 >=4000.

So 1 + z = 4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z≈2.29.

So the lower limit is z=2.29, so the cloud must be at least z≈2.29 for the Lyman-alpha line to be in the optical. So the lower limit is about 2.3. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4 and option D is 1.9.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the quasar's own redshift. Because the quasar's light is being observed through the cloud. So the quasar's rest frame has its own emission lines, but the cloud's absorption is at 1216 Ang in the cloud's frame. So when the quasar is at a higher redshift, the absorption line is at (1 + z_cloud) * 1216. But for the quasar's light to be in the optical, the quasar's redshift must be such that its emitted optical lines (like Lyman alpha) are redshifted into the observed optical.

Wait, maybe the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission is at 1216 Ang, but if the quasar is at a high redshift, that emission would be in the optical. But the question is about the absorption in the quasar's light by the cloud. So the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar, but the absorption feature is at (1 + z_cloud) * 1216. So for this absorption line to be in the optical, the value must be between 4000 and 7000 Ang.

Let me restate: For the Lyman-alpha absorption line from the cloud to be in the optical, (1 + z_cloud) *1216 must be ≥4000 Ang (so we can see it).

So 1 + z_cloud > 4000 / 1216 ≈3.29 → z_cloud > 2.29.

So the lower limit is about 2.29, so the cloud must have a redshift of at least approximately 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher value is option C) 2.4. So the lower limit is 2.29, so any z_cloud >=2.29 is acceptable. So the minimal z is about 2.3, so the lower limit is 2.3, which is roughly 2.4 as the next option.

Wait, but why would the redshift of the cloud be lower than the quasar's? Because the cloud is in front of the quasar, so it's at a lower redshift. So the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. So if the cloud is at z_cloud=2.29, the quasar must be at a higher z, say z_quasar=3 or higher.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the object (the cloud), so the minimal z is 2.29. So the answer would be option C) 2.4.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the formula. Let me check again.

The relation between observed wavelength and redshift is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z). So for the Lyman-alpha line at 1216 Ang, observed at 4000 Ang, z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ (3.29) -1 ≈ 2.29.

So the minimal redshift is 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29. Therefore, any cloud with z >=2.29 will have the Lyman-alpha line in the optical. So the minimal z is about 2.3, which is close to option C (2.4). But why is option D 1.9? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the quasar's light is in the optical. Because the quasar is at a high redshift, its own emission lines (like H-alpha or others) could be in the optical. Wait, but the question is about the absorption line.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The quasar's emitted Lyman-alpha is at 1216 Ang. If the quasar is at redshift z_quasar, then its Lyman-alpha emission is observed at λ_quasar = 1216*(1 + z_quasar). For that to be in the optical, z_quasar must be such that 1216*(1 + z_quasar) is in the optical. But the absorption is about the cloud's z. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The main point is that the Lyman-alpha line (1216 Ang) must be redshifted into the optical. So for the line to be in the optical, (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 >= 4000 Ang. So the minimal z is when it's 4000 Ang.

So z_cloud = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ (3.29) -1 = 2.29.

So the minimal z is about 2.29. Among the options, the smallest higher value is 2.4 (option C). So the lower limit is 2.29, so any z above that is acceptable. So the minimal is 2.29, which is approximately 2.3. So the answer must be option C) 2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman-alpha absorption (at a rest wavelength of 1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the redshifted wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line. 

The observed wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Here, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å}\), and \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\) must lie within the optical range of ground-based telescopes, which is approximately \(4000 \, \text{Å} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å}\). To find the lower limit on the redshift, we consider the smallest \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\) in the optical range, which is \(4000 \, \text{Å}\). Substituting this into the formula:

\[
4000 = 1216 \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Solving for \(z\):

\[
1 + z = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29
\]

\[
z \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud is approximately \(z \approx 2.29\). Among the given options, the smallest value greater than this is \(z = 2.4\). Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud is \(z = 2.4\).
