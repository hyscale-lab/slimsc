Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom states and transitions. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels through emission or absorption of photons, and dipole transitions are one of the allowed mechanisms.

Wait, dipole transitions are governed by selection rules, right? Oh right, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen are: delta l = ±1 and delta m = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

The initial state is |3,0,0>, so n=3, l=0 (which is an s orbital), m=0. It decays to |1,0,0>, which is n=1, l=0. Wait, but l has to change by ±1. Oh, wait, the initial l is 0, so the next state after transition should have l=1. Because l can't stay the same in a dipole transition. So the first transition must go from l=0 to l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So the first transition is from n=3, l=0 to some n', l=1. Now, what about the possible n' and m values? The selection rules say that delta n can be any, but in reality, it's more about the energy levels. But since it's a two-step process, maybe the first step is from 3,0,0 to some 2,1,m state, then from there to 1,0,0.

Wait, wait, the first transition must go from l=0 to l=1, so the possible options are to go to states with l=1. So for the first step, the state after transition should have l=1.

Looking at the options, option A is 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0. So first transition is 3s to 2p (m=0), then 2p to 1s. Another option is B, which goes to 2,1,1. Option C goes to 2,1,-1. Option D is similar to A but the probability is 2/3.

Now, what about the possible transitions. The first transition must go from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. Because when l=0, the next allowed l is 1. So the first transition is 3,0,0 → 2,1, m. So m can be -1, 0, +1. So the intermediate state could be any of these m values.

Now, the second transition must go from l=1 to l=0. Because the final state is l=0. So the second transition must have a change in l of -1. So from l=1 to l=0. So the second state after the first transition must go to a state with l=0. So the second transition would be from 2,1,m to 1,0,0.

Wait, but for the second transition, the initial state is |2,1,m>, and the final state is |1,0,0>. So the delta l is -1, which is allowed. Also, delta m must be 0, ±1. So, let's see what m can change to.

The initial m is m1, and the final m is 0. So delta m = -m1. So m1 must be 0, 1, or -1 because delta m can be 0, ±1. Wait, no, the delta m is the change. So for example, if the initial state is m = +1, then the next m could be 0 (delta m = -1), or 1 (delta m=0), or 2 (but that
