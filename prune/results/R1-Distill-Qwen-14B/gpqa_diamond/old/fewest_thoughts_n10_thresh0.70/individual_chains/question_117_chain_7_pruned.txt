Okay, so I've got this question about isomerism, specifically optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has something to do with molecules being chiral, right? Chiral molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, which means they can rotate plane-polarized light. So the question is asking which of the given compounds exhibit this property.

Let me look at each option one by one. The compounds are numbered 1 to 4, and the options give different combinations. I'll go through each.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have different substituents on each ring. If the substituents are in positions that allow for a plane of symmetry, then maybe they don't have optical isomerism. Wait, but if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral. The structure mentioned has two nitro groups on the 6 positions and two carboxylate groups on the 2 positions. The biphenyl is 1,1' meaning the two rings are connected at position 1. So the substituents at 2 and 6 might be arranged symmetrically. Wait, maybe not. Let me visualize: on each phenyl ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. Oh wait, 6 is adjacent to the connecting point (1), so the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So for each ring, the groups are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other (like para positions). So each phenyl ring would have two substituents opposite each other. But since both rings are the same in their substitution pattern, perhaps the whole molecule is symmetrical. So it could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But wait, the substituents on each ring are nitro and carbonyl? Or wait, no. The molecule is dimethyl 6,6', so each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So each ring has two substituents, which are para to each other. So the arrangement on each ring is the same. But the whole molecule, the biphenyl, is connected at 1,1'. So
