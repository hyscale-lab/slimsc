Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, the target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, actually, the numbering is a bit tricky. The name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So the ring has substituents in the 1,2,3 positions. Wait, that doesn't seem right because benzene is symmetric, but maybe the substituents are meta or para.

Wait, benzene rings are numbered based on substituents. Let's visualize it: the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So that's a meta arrangement for nitro and ethoxy (since 1 and 3 are meta), but the tert-butyl is in between. Hmm, I think I might have to think about the directing effects of the substituents and how they influence the positions of new groups added.

Alright, benzene is the starting material. The substituents will be added via electrophilic substitution reactions. The order in which substituents are added can determine where the next group attaches because each substituent directs incoming electrophiles to certain positions.

Let me list the substituents and their directing effects:

- tert-butyl group: it's a bulky substituent. Since it's an alkyl group, it's an activating group and ortho/para-directing.
- ethoxy group: OCH2CH3 is an activating group (electron-donating via the lone pairs on O) and ortho/para-directing.
- nitro group: a strong deactivating (meta-directing) group.

So the plan is to add these substituents in an order that allows each new group to be added in the correct position relative to the existing ones.

Wait, but wait: the substituents in the
