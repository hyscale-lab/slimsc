Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding an eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The question says the operator is P, and it's for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ℏ/2, and we need to find the eigenvector. The components of P are given for X, Y, and Z, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ℏ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So P = P_x X + P_y Y + P_z Z. But wait, in quantum mechanics, operators are usually represented as vectors of their components, each being an operator. So each component is an operator, and the overall operator depends on the direction you're measuring in. Oh wait, but the question is about the operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So that direction can be represented as n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ) but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero? Or wait, no, wait. The x-z plane implies that the angle φ (the azimuthal angle) is zero or π/2, but actually, wait, the x-z plane is where y=0, so φ would be 0 or π. So the direction vector n is in
