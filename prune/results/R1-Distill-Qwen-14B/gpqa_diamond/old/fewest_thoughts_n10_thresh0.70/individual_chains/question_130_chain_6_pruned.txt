Okay, so I'm trying to answer this astronomy question about redshift and detecting hydrogen clouds with ground-based optical telescopes. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum because hydrogen's electron transitions to the first energy level emit at that wavelength.

Wait, but the question is about absorption. Oh right, when the quasar's light passes through intervening hydrogen clouds, the hydrogen absorbs at the Lyman alpha wavelength, creating a absorption line. So these are called Lyman-alpha absorbers.

The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Ground-based telescopes can't observe in the ultraviolet much because the atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV light. So if the absorption line is shifted into the optical range, we can see it from the ground.

Redshift z is calculated using the formula 1 + z = observed wavelength / rest wavelength. The rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. We want the observed wavelength to be in the optical range. The optical range is roughly from about 400 to 700 nanometers, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

So I need to find the minimum z where 1216*(1+z) is just above 4000 Angstroms, because beyond that, the
