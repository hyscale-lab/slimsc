Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets have both poles together, like a magnet has a north and a south pole that are connected. But in this other universe, they can have isolated poles, which probably changes some fundamental physics.

Maxwell's equations are four in total, right? They describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. The equations are about divergence and curl of these fields. Let me think about each equation.

The first equation is Gauss's law for electricity: the divergence of E equals rho over epsilon_0. That's about electric charge distribution. I don't think that would change here because it's about electric fields and charges. So this equation probably stays the same.

The second equation is Gauss's law for magnetism: the divergence of B is zero. Oh wait, in our universe, magnetic monopoles don't exist, so divergence B is zero, meaning no isolated magnetic charges. But in this parallel universe, they can have isolated north or south poles. So the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. So that equation would change. Instead, divergence B would equal some term related to the magnetic charge density, maybe like rho_m over mu_0 or something.

The third equation is Faraday's law of induction: the curl of E is equal to the negative rate of change of B. Hmm, I don't think this changes because it's about how changing magnetic fields create electric fields. Unless the existence of magnetic monopoles affects this, but I think Faraday's law might still hold. Or maybe it does change? Hmm, not too sure yet.

The fourth equation is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition: the curl of B equals mu_0 times J plus epsilon_0 times the time derivative of E. Ampère's law in our universe relates the magnetic field around current-carrying wires. I'm not sure how isolated magnetic poles would affect this. Wait, Ampère's law is about how currents create magnetic fields. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that change how the magnetic field behaves? Or maybe it's about how electric fields relate to the time derivative of the magnetic field.

Wait, let's think about how Maxwell's equations change when magnetic monopoles exist. In our universe, there are no magnetic monopoles, so the divergence of B is zero. But if they exist, then divergence B equals some magnetic charge density. So the second equation changes.

Also, Faraday's law might change. Wait, in our setup, curl E is - dB/dt. But if there are magnetic charges, maybe there's a contribution from them. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, let's think about duality. Maxwell's equations have a symmetry when you swap E and B and change charges to currents and vice versa. But when you have magnetic monopoles, you can't just swap them anymore, so the symmetry breaks, and both the divergence of B and perhaps the curl of E would change.

Wait, no, maybe the curl E equation would have an additional term. Because in
