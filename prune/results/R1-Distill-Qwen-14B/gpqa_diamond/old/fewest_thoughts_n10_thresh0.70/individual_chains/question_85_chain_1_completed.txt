Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmmm, let me see. The planets are detected using both transit and radial velocity methods, but I'm not sure how that affects the temperature ratio. The question gives me a bunch of data: the star's mass, radius, and effective temperature, and then the masses and radii of the two planets. Also, there are some Doppler shift values for each planet affecting a forbidden line. Oh wait, but the question is about equilibrium temperatures. Right, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star, right?

So, equilibrium temperature formula: T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ), or wait, maybe it's T = (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4). Oh right, L is the star's luminosity, and a is the planet's orbital distance. But since we don't have the planets' orbital distances, I need to figure those out somehow.

Wait, wait. The RV method gives the mass of the planet and the orbital period, but since the problem doesn't give us the periods, maybe I can find the distance another way. Oh, but wait, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, which is related to the mass of the planet and the distance. The shift in the spectral line is due to the Doppler effect caused by the star's movement due to the planet's gravity. So the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the shift in wavelength. 

The Doppler shift formula is Δλ / λ = v / c, but another way to write it is v = (Δλ) * c / λ. Oh wait, but I think the formula can also be written as v = (λ - λ0)/λ0 * c, but wait, the problem gives the shift as 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. The forbidden line is at 6300 Å, so the change in wavelength (Δλ) is 0.03 and 0.04 Å respectively.

So the velocity semi-amplitude K would be (Δλ / λ) * c. Let me compute that. For Planet1: Δλ=0.03 Å, λ=6300 Å. So K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Wait, but c is about 3e5 km/s. Wait, but wait, no, the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, but we can compute it as:

K1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * 3e8 m/s. Wait, wait, let me make that calculation. 0.03e-10 m is 3e-12 m. 6300e-10 m is 6.3e-7 m. So (3e-12)/(6.3e-7) ) = approx 4.76e-6. Multiply by c=3e8 m/s: 4.76e-6 * 3e8 = 1.428e3 m/s, which is 1.428 km/s. Hmm, but wait, that seems really high. Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Oh wait, no, the Doppler shift formula is v = (Δλ/λ) * c. So for small shifts, v is approximately that. So for Planet1, K1 is (0.03 / 6300) * c.

Wait, but wait, 0.03 Å is 0.03e-10 meters. So 0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03 / 6300 = 1e-5 approximately. So 1e-5 * 3e8 m/s is 3e3 m/s, 3 km/s. But that seems too high for a planet's RV semi-amplitude. Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor. Or perhaps the RV semi-amplitude K is given, but the question states the shift is up to 0.03 Å, which I thought is the semi-amplitude. So perhaps the K for each planet is 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å respectively.

But wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which is K. So each planet induces a shift of K in the spectral line. So the K for Planet1 is 0.03 Å, and K for Planet2 is 0.04 Å.

But how does K relate to the planet's mass and the distance? The formula for RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) ) / (M_star^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) (P/(day))^(1/3) ) ) ) Hmm, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I recall another formula: K = ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1/(a (1-e²)^(1/2)) ) )^(1/ (something)) ). Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude K to the planet's mass and orbital period.

Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (a (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula I recall is K = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) * ( (M_star / M_sun) )^(-2/3) ) * ( P/(yr) )^(-1/3) ) ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

Wait, that's complicated, but perhaps we can find a way to relate the two planets' K values to their orbital distances. Because the question gives the RV semi-amplitude (induced shift) for each planet, perhaps I can find the ratio of their semi-major axes.

Wait, but both planets are orbiting the same star, so M_star is the same for both. Let me think. The formula for K is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / (a * (1 - e^2)^(1/2)) ) ) ] 

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so (1 - e^2)^(1/2) = 1. Also, for M_p << M_star, (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star, so we can approximate K ≈ ( (G M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(a)) )^(1/3) ) ?

Wait, perhaps there's a better way. Let me think of the formula for K, the RV semi-amplitude:

K = (v) = ( ( (27.4 m/s) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star^(1/3)) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) * ( (P/(1 day))^(1/3) ) ) )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude K to the planet's mass and orbital distance.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2 π G) / P )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, we can approximate this as:

K ≈ ( (2 π G) / P )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Alternatively, since both planets orbit the same star, perhaps their K values can be compared, given that M_p and a are variables.

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (v) ) = ( ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1 / (a (1 + M_p / M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, the (1 + ...) term is about 1, so K ≈ ( (G M_p) / M_star )^(1/3) ) * (1/(a)) )^(1/3) )? Wait, no, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps K is proportional to (M_p) / (a^(1/3)) * something, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relationship between K and a. Since K is proportional to (M_p / a^1 ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a ratio of a for the two planets. Let's denote K1 and K2 as the RV semi-amplitudes for Planet1 and Planet2.

So, K1 = 0.03 Å, K2 = 0.04 Å. But wait, no, K is the velocity, and the shift in wavelength is proportional to velocity. So the velocity semi-amplitude K is (Δλ / λ) * c.

So for each planet, K = (Δλ / λ) * c. So K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c, K2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

So K1 = (0.03/6300) * c, K2 = (0.04/6300) * c.

So K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.

But what does K depend on? K is the star's velocity towards and away from us due to the planet's orbit. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^(1/2))) ) 

But since e=0, that term is 1. Also, M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / M_star )^(1/3) ) * (1/a) )^(1/3) )? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me think again.

The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ] * [ (1) / (a (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) ] 

Wait, correct formula is:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / (a (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) ) 

Wait, maybe I should refer to the formula as:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * ( P / (2 π) )^(-1/3) )

But since we don't have the periods, perhaps it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the planet's mass and orbital period.

Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(a (1 - e²)^(1/2))) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) )

But since e=0 and M_p << M_star, it simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G M_p) / M_star )^(1/3) ) * (1/(a)) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of Kepler's third law. The orbital period P is determined by (a^3) = (G (M_star) P^2)/(4 π²). So a^3 ∝ M_star P².

But how does K relate to a and M_p? Let me think of the formula again.

Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K can be expressed as:

K = (v) = [ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) ] * [ (M_star / M_sun) )^(-2/3) ) ] * [ (P / (yr) )^(-1/3) ) ] / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)

But again, without knowing P or M_p, it's hard to proceed. But perhaps since both planets are around the same star, and we have the K for each, we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes.

Wait, since K is inversely proportional to a^(1/3) (because from Kepler's law, a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_star, so a ∝ (P^2 M_star)^(1/3), and then K would be proportional to M_p / a^(1/3) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the RV semi-amplitude for a planet is given by K = (v) = [ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(a * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) ]

But for circular orbits (e=0), this becomes K = ( (G M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1/a )

Wait, but I'm not sure that's correct. Let me see. Alternatively, I found a formula elsewhere that K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) ) * ( (1 - e²) )^(-1/2) )

Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated for what I need. Since the problem doesn't give the periods, but only the K values, perhaps I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes a1 and a2.

Wait, the problem says both planets are in circular orbits, so e=0. So let's think: for each planet, K is determined by M_p, a, and M_star.

The formula for K is:

K = ( ( (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1/(a)) ) ) * ( (1/(1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) 

Since e=0, the last term is 1.

Approximating (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star, then:

K ≈ ( ( G M_p / M_star )^(1/3) ) * ( 1/a )

So K is proportional to (M_p / a )^(1/3) * (1/(M_star^(1/3))) )

But since M_star is the same for both planets, the ratio K1/K2 is ( (M_p1 / a1 )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_p2 / a2 )^(1/3) ) )

Which simplifies to [ (M_p1 a2 ) / ( M_p2 a1 ) ]^(1/3 )

So,

K1/K2 = [ ( M_p1 a2 ) / ( M_p2 a1 ) ]^(1/3 )

But I need to find a1/a2, the ratio of the semi-major axes.

Let me rearrange:

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 a2 )/( M_p2 a1 ) ]^(1/3 )

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(K1/K2)^3 = (M_p1 a2 )/( M_p2 a1 )

Solving for a1/a2:

a1/a2 = [ ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) ( a2 / a1 ) ) * ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) ) ] Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me rearrange the equation:

(K1/K2)^3 = (M_p1 a2 )/( M_p2 a1 )

Multiply both sides by (M_p2 a1 ) and divide both sides by (K1^3 K2^0 ):

M_p2 a1 (K1^3) = M_p1 a2 (K2^3 )

So,

a1 / a2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 )

Wait, because:

a1/a2 = [ (M_p1 * a2) / ( M_p2 * a1 ) ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 ) ] ? Hmm, perhaps I should write the equation again.

We have:

(K1/K2)^3 = (M_p1 a2 )/( M_p2 a1 ) 

Which can be rewritten as:

( a1 a2 ) terms:

Multiply both sides by (M_p2 a1 ) and divide by (M_p1 a2 ):

( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * M_p2 a1 = M_p1 a2 

Wait, perhaps I should consider the ratio a1/a2:

From (K1/K2)^3 = (M_p1 a2 )/( M_p2 a1 )

Divide both sides by (M_p1 a2 ):

( K1^3 / K2^3 ) = ( M_p1 a2 ) / ( M_p2 a1 )

Multiply both sides by a1 and divide by a2:

( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( a1 / a2 ) = ( M_p1 ) / ( M_p2 )

So,

( a1 / a2 ) = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 )

Ah, yes, that's the correct rearrangement.

So,

a1/a2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 )

Wait, no, let me see:

We have (K1/K2)^3 = (M_p1 a2)/(M_p2 a1 )

Multiply both sides by (M_p2 a1 ) / ( M_p1 a2 ):

( (K1/K2)^3 ) * ( M_p2 a1 )/( M_p1 a2 ) ) = 1

So,

( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 a1 )/( M_p1 a2 ) ) = 1

Rearranged:

a1/a2 = ( M_p1 a2 )/( M_p2 a1 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me just proceed with the ratio.

Given that,

a1/a2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 )

Because:

From the equation,

( K1/K2 )^3 = ( M_p1 a2 )/( M_p2 a1 )

=> ( a1/a2 ) = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 )

So,

a1/a2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 )

Now, M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses. So M_p1/M_p2 =7/5 = 1.4.

K1 is 0.03 Å, K2 is 0.04 Å. So K2/K1 = 0.04 /0.03 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333.

So K2^3 / K1^3 = (4/3)^3 = 64/27 ≈ 2.37.

So,

a1/a2 = (7/5) * (64/27) )

Let me compute that:

7/5 = 1.4, 64/27 ≈ 2.37.

1.4 * 2.37 = approx 3.318.

So a1/a2 ≈3.318. So Planet1 is about 3.3 times farther from the star than Planet2.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because a higher K would imply the star is moving more, which would happen if the planet is closer and more massive. Let me make sure I did the ratio correctly.

Wait, a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet1, and a2 is that of Planet2. So if a1 is larger, Planet1 is farther away.

So, since Planet1 has a higher RV semi-amplitude (0.03 vs 0.04 Å for K2), but wait no, K1=0.03 and K2=0.04. So K2 is larger than K1. So a1/a2 = (7/5) * ( (0.04/0.03)^3 ) )= (7/5)*( (4/3)^3 )= (7/5)*(64/27) ≈ (1.4)*(2.37)≈3.318.

So a1 is about 3.3 times a2. So Planet1 is farther away than Planet2.

Now, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the distance. The formula is:

T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) )

Wait, no, wait. The equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) 

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) )

Wait, but let me think in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The flux from the star at distance a is F = L/(4πa²), where L is the star's luminosity.

The star's luminosity L is 4 π R_star^2 σ T_star^4.

So F = (4 π R_star^2 σ T_star^4 ) / (4 π a² ) ) = ( R_star² σ T_star^4 ) / a².

The planet absorbs this flux, and reaches equilibrium when the absorbed power equals the emitted power (assuming no albedo; but since the problem says both have the same albedo, it's irrelevant for the ratio because it cancels out).

The planet's cross-section area is π R_p², and the power absorbed is F * π R_p^2 (1 - albedo). The power emitted is 4 π R_p² σ T_p^4.

So,

F * π R_p^2 (1 - A) = 4 π R_p^2 σ T_p^4

Cancel π R_p^2 (1-A) on both sides:

F = 4 σ T_p^4 / (1 - A)

But F = (R_star^2 σ T_star^4 ) / a² 

So,

(R_star^2 σ T_star^4 ) / a² = (4 σ T_p^4 )/(1 - A)

Simplify:

T_p^4 = (R_star^2 T_star^4 )/(4 a²) * (1 - A)

So,

T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * sqrt( (1 - A) )^{1/4}

Wait, but since both planets have the same albedo, (1-A) is the same for both, so it cancels out when taking the ratio.

So,

T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) )

= sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We have a1/a2 ≈3.318, so a2/a1≈ 1/3.318≈0.301.

So,

T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt(0.301) ≈0.549.

So the ratio T_p1 : T_p2 is approximately 0.549, meaning T_p1 is about 0.55 times T_p2. So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T1/T2 ≈0.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close. Option A is ~0.98, which would be if they were similar in distance. Option D is ~1.05, which is close to 1. So the correct answer should be about 0.55, which is closest to option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by analyzing the given data. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is influenced by the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

\[
T_p = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}}
\]

Here, \(T_{\text{star}}\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance. Since both planets orbit the same star, \(T_{\text{star}}\) and \(R_{\text{star}}\) are constant for both. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude data provided for each planet. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the planet's mass \(M_p\), orbital distance \(a\), and the star's mass \(M_{\text{star}}\) by the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{a^{1/3}}
\]

Since both planets orbit the same star, \(M_{\text{star}}\) is constant, and the ratio of \(K\) values can be used to find the ratio of \(a\):

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1} \cdot a_2^{1/3}}{M_{p2} \cdot a_1^{1/3}}
\]

Rearranging for \(a_1/a_2\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \cdot \left(\frac{K_2}{K_1}\right)^3
\]

Given:
- \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}, \, M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}, \, K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)

Substitute the values:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \left(\frac{0.04}{0.03}\right)^3 = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{64}{27} \approx 3.318
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 3.318 \cdot a_2\), meaning Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

Now, substitute \(a_1/a_2 \approx 3.318\) into the equilibrium temperature ratio formula:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.318}} \approx \sqrt{0.301} \approx 0.549
\]

The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately \(0.55\). Comparing this to the options provided, the closest match is:

**C) ~0.53**

Answer: C
