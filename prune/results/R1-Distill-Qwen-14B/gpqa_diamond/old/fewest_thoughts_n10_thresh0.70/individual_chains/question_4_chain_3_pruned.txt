Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets don't have isolated poles; they always come in pairs. That's because the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero, right? So, Maxwell's equation says ∇·B = 0, which implies that there are no magnetic monopoles.

But wait, the question is in a parallel universe where this isn't the case. So, if there were isolated poles, that would change some of Maxwell's equations. Let me think. Maxwell's equations are four in total. The first one is about the divergence of E, which relates to charge density. The second is about the curl of E, which relates to changing magnetic fields. The third is the divergence of B, which should be zero in our case. The fourth is about the curl of B, which relates to the current and changing electric fields.

If magnetic monopoles exist, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Instead, it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. So equation 3 changes. But also, another equation might change too. Maxwell's equations have symmetry when there are electric and magnetic charges. Oh right, the curl of E equation. In our world, the curl of E is -dB/dt. But if there are magnetic charges, perhaps the curl of E would have an additional term, like + (some constant) * (magnetic charge density change) or something like that.

Wait, let me recall. When you have magnetic monopoles, the modified Maxwell's equations have two changes. The divergence of B is rho_m (magnetic charge density), and the curl of E would include a term with the current density or maybe the time derivative of the magnetic charge. Alternatively, maybe the curl of E would have a different sign or include something else.

So looking at the original Maxwell's equations:

1. ∇·E = rho / epsilon_0
2. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
3. ∇·B = 0
4. ∇×B = mu_0 J + mu_0 epsilon_0 ∂E/∂t

If magnetic monopoles exist, equation 3 becomes ∇·B = rho_m, where rho_m is the magnetic charge density. Additionally, equation 2 would change. Because in Ampère's Law (equation 4), the current J would include magnetic current terms if we have moving magnetic charges. But when you take into account magnetic monopoles, the modification would affect equation 2 as well. I think equation 2 would have an additional term, possibly a positive time derivative of the magnetic current or something similar.

Wait, let me think again. Without magnetic monopoles, equation 2 is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic monopoles, does equation 2 change? I recall that with magnetic monopoles, the Faraday's Law (equation 2) would have an extra term. Specifically, when you have magnetic charges, Faraday's Law
