Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the question then goes into two parts, A and B, which require me to determine certain properties of given compounds.

The first part (A) asks which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Hmm, tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different structures by the movement of a hydrogen atom along with a shift in double bonds. For example, like in ketones and aldehydes, or in amino acids.

Benzoquinoneâ€”wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. I think there are two common types: para-benzoquinone and ortho-benzoquinone. But regardless, benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Do they have any hydrogens alpha to the carbonyl groups? Because for tautomerism, you need alpha hydrogens. Oh wait, benzoquinone's structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups across from each other. The carbonyl groups are attached to the ring, so the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (the alpha carbons) are part of the ring. But wait, the ring carbons are each bonded to two other carbons and one O (in the carbonyl). So, do the alpha positions have hydrogens?

In benzene rings, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and an R group. In benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring. So for example, in para-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4-C=O. Each carbonyl is attached to a benzene carbon. But those benzene carbons are each connected to two other carbons in the ring. So the carbons attached to the carbonyl groups are each bonded to two other carbons (from the ring) and the carbonyl O. So that would mean each of those carbons has only one H, perhaps? Wait, no. Wait, in benzene, each carbon is bonded to one H in the parent structure. But in benzoquinone,
