Okay, so I've got this problem here about a diatomic molecule, X and Y, modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The question is asking about the momentum of a photon needed for the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state when in its fundamental state. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Wait, first, I should recall what the fundamental state means. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. But wait, for a diatomic molecule, the states are determined by both rotation and vibration. So the fundamental state would be the combination of the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). But wait, in the rigid rotor model, J can't be zero for certain symmetries, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The problem states it's the non-rigid rotor model, but I'm a bit confused about the exact model used here.

Wait, the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. So this model considers both rotational and vibrational energy levels, and they are treated as coupled, meaning that transitions can involve changes in both vibrational and rotational states.

So, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the one with the lowest possible energy, which would be the vibrational ground state (v=0) and the rotational ground state, which is J=0? Or wait, no, in the rigid rotor model, for a diatomic, the ground rotational state is J=0, but sometimes in some contexts, the first allowed rotational state is J=1 because of selection rules, but I'm not entirely sure.

But the question is about an absorbed photon causing the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think this refers to the next higher energy state, which would be the first excited state. But what's the next state in terms of vibrational and rotational transitions?

Wait, in quantum mechanics, when considering transitions, the selection rules come into play. For diatomic molecules, the vibrational selection rule is Δv = ±1, and for rotational, ΔJ = ±1, but I think that's for the rigid rotor model. But in the non-rigid rotor model, there might be coupling between vibrational and rotational states, so the transitions are more complex. Oh, wait, rotation-vibration coupling can lead to phenomena like the P and R branches in infrared spectroscopy, where the rotational state changes alongside vibrational.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state, and the next state would be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), whichever is lower in energy. Wait, but I remember that vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than rotational ones. So the vibrational energy quantum (hν) is much larger than the rotational energy (which is about (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I)). So the energy of the vibrational transition would be much higher than that of the rotational.

Wait, but in the fundamental state, the molecule is at v=0, J=0. The next higher energy state would be either v=1 (vibrational first excited state) or J=1 (rotational state), but which one has lower energy? Let me compute both.

Wait, the photon's energy has to match the energy difference between the two states. So if the molecule is absorbing a photon, it's going from the current state to a higher state. The question is asking for the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the energy of the photon is E_photon = h ν_photon, and the momentum p is related to the energy by E = p c, so p = E/(c). Alternatively, since photon momentum is p = h ν / c, but I need to think about which energy difference we're considering.

Wait, but in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state is (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would have to be the one where either v increases by 1 (v=1, J=0) or J increases by 1 (v=0, J=1), whichever has a lower energy.

So let's compute the energies for both possibilities.

First, the vibrational energy for v=0 is 0, and for v=1, it's (1/2) h ω + (3/2) h ω = 2 h ω? Wait, no, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) h ω. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is h ω. So the energy required for a vibrational transition is h ω.

For the rotational energy, the rotational energy is E_J = [ J (J+1) ] (ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I is μ r^2, with μ the reduced mass.

So for J=0, E_J = 0. For J=1, E_J = [1*2] (ħ²)/(2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So the energy required for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is ħ²/(I).

Now, which of these two energies, h ω or ħ²/(I), is lower? Let's compute both.

Given:

μ (reduced mass) = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = (40) / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but to compute I, which is μ r², we have r in meters.

r is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ * r².

But first, let's compute μ in kg. 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's compute 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, wait: 1.818 * 1.6605 → 1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988, so 3.016e-27 kg.

r is 2e-10 meters, so r² is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = μ r² = 3.016e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ^2 is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.112e-68) J² s².

So E_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.112e-68 J² s²) / (1.2064e-46 kg m²).

Wait, kg m² is the denominator. Let me compute that:

E_rot = (1.112e-68) / (1.2064e-46) ) J.

Wait, J is kg m²/s², so let's see:

So 1.112e-68 / 1.2064e-46 = approximately 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, because 1e-68 / 1e-46 = 1e-22, but 1.112 / 1.2064 is about 0.921.

So E_rot ≈ 0.921e-22 J = 9.21e-23 J.

But what's the vibrational energy difference? h ω.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So E_vib = h ω = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing E_rot (≈9.2e-23 J) and E_vib (≈2.65e-19 J), clearly E_rot is much smaller. So the energy required for the rotational transition is lower than the vibrational transition.

So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the rotational transition, from J=0 to J=1, while keeping v=0.

Wait, but wait, when you increase J, the rotational energy increases, but the vibrational energy is the same. So the next state would be J=1, v=0. But wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would be (v=0, J=1), because that requires less energy than (v=1, J=0). So the photon's energy must match the rotational energy difference.

So the energy needed is E_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, but wait a second: the non-rigid rotor model allows for coupling between rotational and vibrational states. So perhaps the transitions are not purely rotational or vibrational but involve a change in both. But in the question, it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe the first possible transition is a vibrational transition, but that requires higher energy. So the lowest energy transition is the rotational one.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state and the next state is (v=0, J=1), which is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0). So the photon must have energy equal to the rotational energy difference.

So the photon's energy E_photon = E_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

But the question is about momentum, not energy. Since photons have E = p c, where p is momentum, then p = E / c.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are close to that. Let me check my calculations again. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me recalculate the rotational energy.

E_J = [ J (J + 1) ] * (ħ²) / (2I)

Wait, wait, earlier I just computed E_rot as ħ² / I, but actually, for J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is E_J1 - E_J0.

E_J0 is zero, E_J1 is [1*2] * (ħ²)/(2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So that part was correct.

So E_rot = ħ²/(I) ≈ (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2064e-46 kg m²).

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2064e-46 = approximately 9.21e-23 J.

So E_rot ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, but options are in 1e-28 to 1e-27 N*s. Hmm.

Wait, momentum p is E/c. So p = E / (3e8 m/s).

So p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But wait, N*s is kg m/s, so 3.07e-31 N s. But none of the options are close to that. The options are A) 1.9e-28, B) 2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, my calculation is giving 3.07e-31 N s, which is about 3e-31. None of the options are that small.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me recheck.

r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

Masses:

Mx = 20 amu, My=2 amu.

Reduced mass μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

So I = μ * r² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I confused the rotational energy formula. Let me recall: the rotational energy levels are E_J = [ J (J+1) ] * (h/(8π² c)) / (I) * other factors? Or wait, perhaps I should express it in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, another approach: the rotational energy levels can be written as E_J = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I).

So for the transition J=0 → J=1, ΔE_rot = E_1 - E_0 = (ħ² * 2)/(2I) - 0 = ħ²/(I), which is what I did before.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass. Let me check that again.

Wait, the formula for the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). So Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Yes, that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia in terms of the bond length and the two masses.

Wait, the moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μ r².

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, let me compute it again.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

μ = 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

So I = (3.016e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Yes, that's correct again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ħ². Let me compute ħ² again.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s. So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2064e-46 = approximately 9.21e-23 J.

Hmm, that's correct.

So the energy difference is 9.21e-23 J. So the photon's energy must match that. Then, the momentum is p = E/c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N s.

But looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

None of these are close to 3e-31. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the next state is a vibrational transition, not a rotational one. Because maybe the vibrational transition is the first possible transition.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that the vibrational transition requires much more energy than the rotational one. So why would the molecule prefer that?

Wait, the problem states the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which in the non-rigid rotor model would be v=0 and J=0.

The next state would be the one with the next higher energy, which in this case is the (v=0, J=1) state, as its energy is lower than (v=1, J=0).

So the energy needed is the rotational transition, E_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, but the options are way off. Did I make a mistake in taking the rotational energy as the change? Or perhaps the model is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the model includes both rotational and vibrational contributions, but the next state is a vibrational transition, which is higher in energy than the rotational.

Wait, but the question is, what's the photon's momentum? So maybe the photon's energy is the sum of both, or a combination.

Wait, no, no. The molecule is in the fundamental state, and the photon causes a transition to the next state with the lowest energy. So the next state is the one with the smallest possible energy increment.

In that case, the (v=0, J=1) state would require less energy than (v=1, J=0). So the photon's energy must be the rotational energy.

Hmm, but the options don't match. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy using the vibrational angular frequency? No, that doesn't make sense. The rotational angular frequency is different.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational constant. The rotational constant B is ħ²/(2 I c), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the rotational energy levels are given by E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

Wait, another approach: the rotational constant B is given by:

B = (h)/(8 π² c I) ≈ (h)/(8 π² c μ r²}

Wait, but I might be mixing up different expressions. Alternatively, the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia as B = ħ²/(2 I).

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. And B is given by B = h/(8 π² c I).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The energy levels for rotation are E_J = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I). So for J=1, E_J = (ħ² * 2 )/(2I) = ħ²/(I), which is the same as before.

So the energy difference is E_J=1 - E_J=0 = ħ²/(I) = 9.21e-23 J.

Hmm, that's about 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the rotational constant B and then find the energy as B * J (J+1).

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B = (h)/(8 π² c I).

Let me try that.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

I = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So B = (6.626e-34) / (8 * π² * 3e8 * 1.2064e-46 )

Compute denominator: 8 * (pi)^2 ≈ 8 *9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator = 78.9568 * 3e8 * 1.2064e-46.

Compute 3e8 * 1.2064e-46 = 3.619e-38.

Multiply by 78.9568: 78.9568 *3.619e-38 ≈ 2.858e-36.

So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / 2.858e-36 ≈ approximately 231.8 m^{-1}.

Wait, the rotational constant B is 231.8 cm⁻¹? No, wait, B is in cm⁻¹? Or m⁻¹? Hmm, the units: h is J s, I is kg m². Let me compute the units for B.

B has units of 1/(length), correct? Because E_J = B J (J+1) in units of energy. But B itself is in cm⁻¹. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

But regardless, the value of B is about 231.8 m⁻¹, which is 23.18 cm⁻¹.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that helps. So the energy difference for the rotational transition is E_rot = B * (J+1)(J) → For J=0 to J=1, it's 2 B. But wait, no, E_J = B J (J+1), so the difference between J=1 and J=0 is E_1 - E_0 = B (2) - 0 = 2 B.

So the energy is 2B. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

But regardless, the calculation I did earlier for E_rot was 9.21e-23 J, which seems correct.

But the options are way higher in magnitude. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy using the vibrational frequency. No, that doesn't make sense. The vibrational and rotational frequencies are different.

Wait, maybe the molecular bond length is given in angstroms, and I forgot to convert it into meters correctly. Wait, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters, correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't about the pure rotational transition but about the vibrational transition.

Wait, if the molecule is in the vibrational ground state (v=0), the next state would be v=1. The energy required would be h ω, which is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So E_vib = h ω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, the momentum p is E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 1.9e-28, D is 1.4e-28.

Hmm, 8.8e-28 is not exactly matching any of the options. But it's closest to option A or option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rotational transition requires lower energy. But perhaps the question is referring to the first allowed transition after the fundamental state, which might involve a vibrational and rotational change.

Wait, but the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy would be (v=0, J=1), which requires less energy than (v=1, J=0).

But maybe the model includes coupling between vibrational and rotational levels, so the next state is a vibrational transition with a simultaneous change in rotation. Hmm, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, so it should be the one with the smallest energy difference.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the energy differences again.

E_rot = 9.21e-23 J, E_vib = 2.65e-19 J.

E_rot is much smaller than E_vib. So the next state is (v=0, J=1), which requires E_rot.

But then the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N s. But the options don't have that.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Maybe the fundamental state isn't (v=0, J=0) but (v=0, J=1), but that doesn't make sense because J=0 is the lowest rotational state.

Wait, perhaps the model is different. Maybe the non-rigid rotor model doesn't consider J=0 as allowed. For example, in some molecules, J must be at least 1 due to symmetry, but I'm not sure. But even if J starts at 1, then the next state would be J=2, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the vibrational ground state to the next vibrational state, which would be a much higher energy. But if that's the only transition, then perhaps the photon's momentum would be based on E_vib.

But the options don't match that either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me recalculate E_rot.

E_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2064e-46 kg m²)

Compute the numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

Denominator: 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2064e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2064) * 1e-22 J.

1.112 / 1.2064 ≈ 0.921, so E_rot ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So I think my calculation is correct, but the options don't align. Perhaps I made a mistake in the problem interpretation.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the state of lowest energy, which would be (v=0, J=0). So the transition would be to (v=0, J=1) since that's the next higher state with the lowest energy.

So the photon's energy would be E_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

p = E/c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But the options are way larger. So perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition, not the rotational.

But why? Because the energy difference for rotation is too small, and the options are in the 1e-28 range.

Wait, let's compute E_vib / c.

E_vib = h ω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E_vib/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 N s.

Which is closest to option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). But 8.8e-28 isn't any of them. So perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy in terms of the angular frequency and the reduced mass and bond length.

Wait, the angular frequency ω is given by ω = sqrt(k/μ), but perhaps I can compute k from the given ω.

Alternatively, I might have to compute the vibrational energy using the formula (1/2) h ω, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are E_v = (v + 1/2) h ω.

So the transition from v=0 to v=1 requires ΔE = h ω.

Which I computed as 2.65e-19 J.

So the momentum is p = E/c = 8.83e-28 N s.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the value of ω. The problem states ω is 4e14 rad/s.

Yes.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is referring to the Raman transition, which involves simultaneous rotational and vibrational changes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the dipole selection rules, which for the rigid rotor model allow ΔJ = ±2 in vibrational transitions. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the next state is a combination of vibrational and rotational changes, like going to (v=1, J=0), which would require more energy than (v=0, J=1), but perhaps that's the first allowed transition.

But then the energy would be E_vib + E_rot. But that's way higher than either.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So it's the one with the smallest energy above the current state.

So the answer must be the rotational transition, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia is different. Let me compute I again.

r is 2 angstroms = 0.2 nanometers. Wait, no, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters.

μ is (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

μ in kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

So I = μ r² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy using the formula including the vibrational angular frequency. No, that's not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of wavenumbers, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me re-examine the rotational energy formula.

E_J = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I).

So for J=1, E_J = (ħ² * 2 )/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

Yes, that's correct.

So I think my calculation is correct, but the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0). So that's a pure vibrational transition, which would require E_vib = h ω = 2.65e-19 J.

So p = E/c = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 1.9e-28, which is roughly half of that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps because the vibrational transition requires a change in dipole moment, and the selection rule is Δv = ±1. So maybe the photon's energy is exactly h ω.

But I can't find any error in my calculations. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which for a diatomic molecule in the non-rigid rotor model would involve both a vibrational and rotational change, but that would require more energy than either alone.

But I think the next state with the lowest energy is (v=0, J=1), which requires E_rot.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition, which is option A or D.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should recalculate the rotational energy.

Let me compute ħ²/(I) again.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

I = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2064e-46 = around 9.21e-23 J.

Hmm, correct.

So the momentum p = E_rot / c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 N s.

No option matches this, so perhaps the question is incorrect, or I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational-vibrational coupling, and the next state is a combination where both v and J change, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the selection of the vibrational transition, which gives p = 8.83e-28 N s, closest to option A (1.9e-28) or D (1.4e-28). But why would the rotational transition not be the answer?

I'm confused. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the photon's momentum is given by p = h ν / c, where ν is the frequency.

In the rotational transition, ν_rot = E_rot / h = (9.21e-23 J) / (6.626e-34 J s) ≈ 1.39e11 Hz.

But that's a very low frequency, so the momentum p_rot = h ν_rot / c = (6.626e-34 *1.39e11)/(3e8) ≈ (9.21e-23) /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Again, same result.

So I think the correct answer is not among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reduced mass in atomic mass units. Wait, no, I think I did it correctly.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C, 1.1e-27 N s. But I don't see how.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state (v=1, J=0), which is a pure vibrational transition. So E = h ω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 N s.

But the options are A)1.9e-28, D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the vibrational frequency is given as angular frequency ω, which is 2π ν. So maybe I should use ν = ω/(2π) instead.

Wait, in that case, E_vib = h ν = h (ω/(2π)) = (6.626e-34) * (4e14)/(2π) ≈ 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.21e-19 J.

Then p = E/c = 4.21e-19 /3e8 ≈ 1.4e-27 N s.

Which is option C: 1.1e-27. Hmm, close but not exactly.

Wait, 4.21e-19 /3e8 is 1.403e-27. So approximately 1.4e-27 N s, which is option B (2.3e-27) or perhaps option C.

Wait, option C is 1.1e-27, which is close to 1.4e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute ν = ω/(2pi).

ω=4e14 rad/s → ν=4e14/(2pi) ≈ 4e14 /6.283 ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So E_vib = h ν = 6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈ 4.21e-19 J.

p = E/c = 4.21e-19 /3e8 ≈ 1.403e-27 kg m/s → 1.403e-27 N s.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.3e-27, which is higher, option C is 1.1e-27, lower.

Hmm, none exactly match. But perhaps the calculation expects me to use ω as the frequency, not as the angular frequency. Wait, that's a common mistake.

Ah! Maybe I messed up the definition of frequency and angular frequency.

The vibrational energy is E_v = (1/2) h ω, where ω is the angular frequency. So perhaps E_vib = (1/2) h ω.

But wait, the vibrational energy levels are E_v = (v + 1/2) h ω. So the transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE = h ω.

But if the problem uses ω as the regular frequency, then perhaps E = h ω.

Wait, but the question states that ω is the angular frequency, given as 4e14 rad/s.

So in that case, E_vib = h ω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 8.83e-28 N s.

Which is closest to option A (1.9e-28) or D (1.4e-28). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the photon's momentum is E = h ν, but since E = p c, p = E/(c) = h ν /c.

But if ω is given as the angular frequency, ν = ω/(2π), so p = h (ω/(2π))/c = h ω/(2 π c).

So for E_vib, p = (6.626e-34 *4e14 )/( 2 *3.1416 *3e8 ) → numerator is 2.65e-19 J, denominator is 1.885e9.

So p = 2.65e-19 /1.885e9 ≈ 1.407e-27 N s.

Which is approximately 1.4e-27 N s. Looking at the options, the closest is option C (1.1e-27) and option B (2.3e-27). Hmm, 1.4e-27 isn't an option. But option D is 1.4e-28, which is an order of magnitude smaller.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute:

p = h ω/(2 π c) = (6.626e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) / (2 *3.1416 *3e8 m/s )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J s * rad/s → but rad is dimensionless.

Denominator: 2 *3.1416 ≈6.2832. 6.2832 *3e8 ≈1.885e9 m/s.

So p = (2.6504e-19) / (1.885e9) ≈ 1.407e-27 kg m/s.

So p ≈1.4e-27 N s.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.1e-27, option B is 2.3e-27.

So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but perhaps option B is the intended choice.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the rotational transition's momentum, which is about 3e-31, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1), but that's more complicated.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think again: perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which is a vibrational transition. So p = h ω/(2π c) = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/(2pi *3e8) ≈ 1.4e-27 N s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option B (2.3e-27), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a different selection rule, where the photon's energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational differences, but that would be higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational momentum. Rotational energy E_rot =9.21e-23 J. p_rot = E_rot/c =3.07e-31 N s.

But none of the options are close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy using the moment of inertia as (mu r^2), but perhaps I should use the bond length in a different unit.

Wait, 2 angstroms is 0.2 nanometers, but that's correct in meters.

Another thought: perhaps the reduced mass is calculated incorrectly. Let me recalculate μ.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula for photon momentum p = h ν /c, but ν is the vibrational frequency. But the given data is angular frequency ω=4e14 rad/s.

So ν = ω/(2π) ≈6.366e13 Hz.

p = (6.626e-34 *6.366e13)/3e8 ≈(4.21e-19)/3e8 ≈1.403e-27 kg m/s.

So p ≈1.4e-27 N s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:1.1e-27, which is close but not exact.

But maybe the problem expects this, so perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, no, 1.4e-27 is closer to option B (2.3e-27) than to option C (1.1e-27). Wait, perhaps option B is the intended answer, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

p = h ν /c.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

ν= ω/(2pi) =4e14/(6.283) ≈6.366e13 Hz.

So p =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 /3e8 = (6.626e-34 *6.366e13) = approx 4.21e-20.

Wait, wait, 6.626e-34 *6.366e13 =6.626 *6.366e(-34+13) = approx 42.06e-21 =4.206e-20.

Divide by 3e8: 4.206e-20 /3e8 =1.402e-28 kg m/s.

Oh! I see. I made a mistake earlier in the exponent.

So p = (6.626e-34 *6.366e13) / 3e8 = (4.21e-20) /3e8 =1.403e-28 kg m/s.

So p ≈1.4e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N s. So the correct answer is D.

Ah! I see. Earlier, I thought that I had computed p=1.4e-27, but actually, the correct calculation gives p=1.4e-28, which matches option D.

So the correct answer is option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Molecule Properties**:
   - Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Bond length: \( r = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
   - Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

2. **Fundamental State**:
   - The fundamental state corresponds to the lowest energy state, which is \( (v=0, J=0) \), where \( v \) is the vibrational quantum number and \( J \) is the rotational quantum number.

3. **Next State with Lowest Energy**:
   - The next state with the lowest energy is \( (v=1, J=0) \), as the vibrational energy difference is much larger than the rotational energy difference. The rotational transition \( (v=0, J=0) \to (v=0, J=1) \) requires a smaller energy change than the vibrational transition \( (v=0, J=0) \to (v=1, J=0) \).

4. **Photon Momentum Calculation**:
   - The energy of the photon must match the vibrational energy difference, \( \Delta E = h \omega \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( \omega \) is the angular frequency.
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)).

### Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Energy**:
   \[
   \Delta E = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Photon Momentum**:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]

3. **Adjustment for Angular Frequency**:
   - Since \( \omega \) is given as an angular frequency, the vibrational frequency \( \nu \) is related by \( \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \). Substituting this into the momentum formula:
   \[
   p = \frac{h \nu}{c} = \frac{h \cdot \frac{\omega}{2\pi}}{c} = \frac{h \omega}{2\pi c}.
   \]
   - Recomputing:
   \[
   p = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14})}{2\pi \cdot (3 \times 10^8)} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{6.283 \cdot 3 \times 10^8} = 1.403 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The calculated momentum of the photon is approximately \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \), which matches **option D**.

Answer: D
