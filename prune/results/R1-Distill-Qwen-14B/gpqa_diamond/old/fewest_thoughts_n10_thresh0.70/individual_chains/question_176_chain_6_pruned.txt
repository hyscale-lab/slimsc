Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that's three elements, so it's a 3x1 column vector. Hmm. So the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually normalized, right? So I should check if this is normalized.

To normalize, I calculate the inner product of the vector with itself. That is, (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is probably this divided by sqrt(6). Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors are supposed to have a norm (or length) of 1. So the state is |ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1; 2; 1].

Next, the problem talks about two observables, P and Q, each represented by their respective matrices. The operator for P is a 3x3 matrix with first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, interesting. So let me write it down.

P matrix:
Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

And Q's matrix is diagonal. First row: 1,0,0; second row: 0,0,0; third row: 0,0,-1. So the eigenvalues for Q are 1, 0, -1. So when you measure Q, you can get 1, 0, or -1.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no, the question says measuring Q after P. So first, measure P, get 0, then measure Q, get -1. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the wording is "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P", so the order is first measure P, then measure Q.

Wait, but wait, measurements affect the state. So when you measure P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue you measured. Then, the state after P is measured is an eigenstate of P, so when you measure Q, it's in that state.

But wait, no, that's only if the observables are compatible, but in general, they might not be. Hmm, but maybe I should proceed step by step.

So first, I need to find the probability of
