Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let's see what I can remember from my studies.

The problem says there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here, maybe just context.

The key data given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. Oh wait, and their albedo is the same, 0.3. The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So, how much longer is Planet3's orbital period than Planet1's?

Alright, equilibrium temperature. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since all three planets have the same albedo, a is 0.3 for all, so that cancels out when taking ratios.

The equilibrium temperatures given are the ratios between Planet1 and Planet2 (1.4), and Planet2 and Planet3 (2.3). Wait, no, the ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4, and T2/T3 = 2.3? Or wait, the way it's phrased: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4" — does that mean T1 is 1.4 times T2, or the other way around? I think it's T1 over T2 equals 1.4, so T1 = 1.4 T2.

Similarly, between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So T2/T3 is 2.3, which implies T2 = 2.3 T3. Or wait, the way it's phrased is the ratio between P2 and P3 is 2.3. So T2 over T3 is 2.3, so T2 = 2.3 T3.

Wait, putting it together: T1 = 1.4 T2, and T2 = 2.3 T3. So T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 T3 = 3.22 T3. Wait, but that's probably not directly relevant. Wait, but the problem is about orbital periods, so how does temperature relate to orbital period?

The period of a planet's orbit is given by Kepler's third law, right? The formula is P² = (4π²/G M) * a³, where a is the semi-major axis (assuming circular orbits here), M is the mass of the star. Wait, but in this problem, are the masses of the planets given or the star? Oh, the masses given are between the planets themselves. The ratio of Planet1 and Planet2's masses is about 1.15. So M1/M2 = 1.15.
