Okay, I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. So the scientist made a calibration curve using positive controls with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. His Ct values vary a bit, but I need to see why.

Wait, in qPCR, the Ct (threshold cycle) is inversely proportional to the amount of target. More copies mean lower Ct because the target is reached faster. The efficiency is 100%, so the reaction is perfect, meaning each cycle doubles the DNA. 

The R² of 1 indicates a perfect linear relationship. That makes sense because the efficiency is high. The slope is -3.3. Hmm, I remember that the slope is related to efficiency. The formula is Slope = log10(efficiency) * ln(10) * something... Wait, maybe it's simpler. The ideal slope for a 100% efficient PCR is -3.32, right? Because each ten-fold increase in target should decrease Ct by about 3.32 cycles. 

Looking at the data. The concentrations are 100,000; 10,000; 1,000; 100; 10 copies per µl. The Ct values are as follows:

100,000: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5 → average around 34.2.
10,000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2 → average ~30.9.
1,000: 27.3... ~27.6.
100: 24.0... ~24.3.
10: 20.7... ~21.0.

Wait, let's see the differences between each dilution. From 100,000 to 10,000 is a ten-fold decrease. So the Ct should increase by about 3.3 cycles. Let's check: 30.9 minus 34.2 is -3.3. Oh wait no, because as concentration decreases, Ct increases. Wait, wait—maybe I'm getting this backward.

Wait, higher concentration (more copies) leads to lower Ct. So 100,000 is higher than 10,000, so Ct should be lower for 100,000. But in the data, 100,000 has Ct ~34, while 10,000 has ~30.9. Oh wait, that's the opposite. That can't be right. That doesn't make sense because more copies should mean more target, so the Ct should be lower. So the higher the concentration, the lower the Ct.

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. So 100,000 copies per µl should have lower Ct than 10,000 copies. But in the data
