Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I remember that the impulse approximation is a model where nucleons in a nucleus behave as if they're free. That probably means that the interactions are treated in a way that ignores, or at least simplifies, the complexities of the nucleus as a whole.

The question is asking which of the four given assumptions together imply this "impulse" approximation. Let's look at each assumption one by one.

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So this is saying that each nucleon is interacting independently, not with each other much. That makes sense because if each nucleon is treated separately, their behavior would resemble free particles since they don't influence each other much.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Transparent probably means that other nucleons don't affect the interaction. So, only the selected nucleon is interacting, and the rest are like not there. That would mean the other nucleons don't contribute, so the selected one behaves almost as if it's free.

3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Oh, right. Quarks are the building blocks of nucleons. If they're non-relativistic, that means their velocities are much lower than the speed of light. So the internal structure is treated classically, perhaps, which simplifies things. But wait, how does that tie into the impulse approximation? Well, if the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe their motion within the nucleon is considered static or not contributing much to the interaction. So the nucleon as a whole is treated as a point particle, which aligns with the idea of free nucleons.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, so the binding forces, like the strong nuclear force that holds the nucleus together, are ignored. If the nucleon feels no binding, then it's as if it's free. Because in reality, the binding forces would cause interactions with neighboring nucleons, but if we neglect that, each nucleon acts independently.

Now, the question is which of the options combine these to imply the impulse approximation. Let's think about each option.

Option A: 1,2,4. So 1 says interaction is with individual nucleons. 2 says the
