Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard and chiral.

Okay, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, right? It's a peracid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation occurs across a double bond, forming an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, meaning the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the product.

So, let's think about each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA.
Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA.

After each reaction, aqueous acid is added. I remember that when epoxides are treated with acid, they undergo ring-opening reactions. The acid catalyzes the opening, typically via a protonation, leading to the formation of diols. But wait, in this case, how does the stereochemistry of the starting epoxide influence the diol product?

Epoxides can form from either E or Z alkenes. Let me draw out what happens.

First, reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene.

Structure of (E)-oct-4-ene: CH2CH2 is not right, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on either side of the double bond. Wait, no. Let me structure it correctly. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. The structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, maybe I should think of it as CH2CH2 on either end of the double bond. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Maybe I should just think of it as a chain with a double bond between C4 and C5.

But more importantly, the E configuration means that the higher priority groups on each carbon of the double bond are opposite each other. So, for oct-4-ene, each end of the double bond (C4 and C5) has two substituents. Let's say on C4, the substituents are CH2CH2CH3 and a hydrogen (since it's oct-4-ene, right?), and on C5, it's CH2CH2 and a hydrogen. Wait, maybe I should think of it as CH2CH2CH2CH3 on one side and CH2CH2CH2CH3 on the other, but in the E configuration, the two larger substituents are on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, and (Z) is cis. So when mCPBA reacts with each, it forms an epoxide.

mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an
