Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question shows a density matrix ρ, which is given as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state). 

Wait, what's a pure state versus a mixed state? Oh right, a pure state is a single ket vector, like |ψ><ψ|, while a mixed state is a statistical mixture of pure states, represented by a density matrix that can't be written as a single outer product.

So looking at ρ here, it's an average of |0><0| and |1><1|. Each term is a pure state. So ρ is a mixture of the two basis states. That makes sense. The density matrix for a completely mixed state in a qubit would have all the basis states equally probable. 

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Oh, right, the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere represents qubit states, with pure states as points on the surface and mixed states inside. For a single qubit, any state can be written as a vector r on the Bloch sphere, with ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So let me break down the given ρ. The given matrix is (|0><0| + |1><1|) all multiplied by 1/2. Let me write each term out in matrix form. 

|0><0| is a 2x2 matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) * I, where I is the identity matrix. So I can write ρ = I/2.

Now, comparing this to the Bloch sphere parametrization: ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. If I set this equal to my ρ, which is I/2, then the coefficients for σ_x, σ_y, σ_z must all be zero. So r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. That gives the vector r = (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but let me think again. The density matrix for the maximally mixed state is indeed I/2 for a single qubit. And the Bloch vector is at the origin, which is the center of the Bloch sphere. So yes, that makes sense because the maximally mixed state has no preferred direction and is equally likely in all directions, so its vector r is zero.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, as it is a statistical mixture of the pure states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation, where the density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector describing the state's position in the qubit space.

For the given \(\rho\), expanding the terms:

\[
\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Adding these matrices gives the identity matrix \(I\), so:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I.
\]

Comparing this to the Bloch sphere parametrization, the coefficients of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) must all be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This represents the maximally mixed state, which has no preferred direction and is equally likely in all directions.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Answer: C
