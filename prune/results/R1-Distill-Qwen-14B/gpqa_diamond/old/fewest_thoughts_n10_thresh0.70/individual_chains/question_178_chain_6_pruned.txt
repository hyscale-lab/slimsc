Okay, so I've got this physics problem about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constants determines whether the theory is renormalizable. So the question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of each field in the Lagrangian. Wait, the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless, and it's the integral of the Lagrangian density over four volume (which has dimension 4). So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Breaking down the terms in L_int. Let's see: ψ̄ is a spinor field, so each ψ has dimension 3/2. The σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (they're just matrices), so σ has dimension 0. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Each F has dimension 2 because the field A has dimension 1 (since the covariant derivative is ∂ + i e A, and ∂ has dimension 1, so A must have dimension 1 as well. F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so yeah, dimension 2).

Putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's compute the dimensions.

The product ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Because σ is dimensionless. And then F is 2. So the entire term is κ * 3 (from the fermion fields) multiplied by 2 (from F), so 3 * 2 =6. So the term has dimension 6, but the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. That means κ must have dimension 4 -6 = -2? Wait, no. Wait, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the term L_int = κ (ψ̄ σ ψ F) must have dimension 4.

So the dimension of κ times the dimensions of everything else equals 4.

The ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ is 3/2, so together that's 3. σ_{μν} is dimensionless. F has dimension 2. So the product inside is 3 * 2 = 6. So κ * 6 = 4. So κ must have dimension (4/6) = 2/3? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the Lagrangian term is L = κ * [ψ̄ σ ψ F]. Each ψ is (3/2), so ψ̄ ψ is (3/2 + 3/2) = 3. F has 2, so 3 * 2 =6. So L has dimension [κ] +6 =4. Therefore, [κ] = 4 -6= -2? So the mass dimension of κ is -2
