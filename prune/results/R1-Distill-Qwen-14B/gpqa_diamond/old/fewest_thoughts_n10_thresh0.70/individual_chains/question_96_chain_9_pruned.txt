Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, which is related to their area. The question gives me some angular size and distance, and I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy.

Wait, right, the formula I think I need is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. It says that the entropy S is proportional to the area of the event horizon, right? The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, and the constants are Planck's constant ħ, gravitational constant G, Boltzmann's constant k_B, and the speed of light c.

But wait, do I remember correctly? Oh yeah, the area of the event horizon for a Schwarzschild black hole is A = 16 π (G M / c² )². So that would make S = (16 π (G M / c² )²) * (c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Let me simplify that. Oh right, it simplifies to S = (4 π G² M² c² )/( ħ G k_B ) * (c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), wait maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The correct formula for entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ). And A is 16 π (r_s/2)^2, where r_s is the Schwarzschild radius. Alternatively, it's A =
