Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The question says that two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. We're supposed to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, each electron has an l of 1 (since p orbitals have l=1), and the total angular momentum l is 2, with m being -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for both particles. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give -ħ.

Hmm. So, each Li_z is the z-component of orbital angular momentum for each electron. Orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are li for each, so for each, the eigenvalues are li * ħ. So for each, the possible m's are from -li to +li in integer steps.

Wait, but the state here is a coupled state, so it's a combination of the individual states. The given state is |1,1,2,-1>. That means electron 1 has l1=1, electron 2 has l2=1, the total orbital angular momentum is l=2, and m (the projection along z) is -1.

But wait, when we couple two angular momenta, the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual ones. So |l1, l2> becomes |l, m>, where l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Here, l1 and l2 are both 1, so possible l values are 0,1,2.

But the given state is |1,1,2,-1>, so l=2 and m=-1.

The question is about measuring L1z and L2z. So each Li_z is the z-component of the individual electron's orbital angular momentum. So each can have eigenvalues m_i * ħ, where m_i ranges from -l_i to +l_i.

But wait, in the coupled state, the individual m's don't necessarily add up to the total m. Because the total m is the sum of the individual m's. Wait, if the coupled state is |l,
