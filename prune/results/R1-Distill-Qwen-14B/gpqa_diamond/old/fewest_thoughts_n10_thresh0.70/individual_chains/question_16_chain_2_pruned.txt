Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when there's a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. But wait, wait, there are other possibilities too, like allenes or other structures that might have a plane of symmetry or not.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Structure-wise, this is a chloroalkene. The molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, or is it CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond? Wait, no. Structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Let me draw that. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH2. Wait, no, wait. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The butene is four carbons: the double bond starts at C1. So structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So maybe Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So the structure is Cl–C(CH3)=CH–CH3? Wait, no, but wait
