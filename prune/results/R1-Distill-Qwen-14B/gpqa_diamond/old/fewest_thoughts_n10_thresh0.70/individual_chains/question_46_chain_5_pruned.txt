Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when the positions of substituents in a carbon-carbon double bond are exchanged. Right, and Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually rhodium or ruthenium based, that facilitates this.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So the molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2 in pentene. The structure must be CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂? No, wait. Let me draw it out. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₃. But 3-methyl would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, 3-methyl in pent-1-ene: the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So 3-methyl would be where? Oh, wait, wait. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, that would be 3-methyl. Wait, pent has five carbons. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So for 3-methylpent-1-ene, it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait that's five carbons. Wait, no, because 3rd carbon would be CH(CH3), and then the chain continues. So structure: CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the molecule is (E and Z not applicable here because it's a single double bond), but it's racemic, so it must have a chiral center. Wait, does 3-methylpent-1-ene have a chiral center? Let's see. The structure after the double bond is CH(CH3), so the third carbon is connected to CH2, CH3, and two
