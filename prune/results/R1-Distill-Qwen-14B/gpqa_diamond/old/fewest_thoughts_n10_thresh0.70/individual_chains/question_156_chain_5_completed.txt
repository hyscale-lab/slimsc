Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and understand what's going on.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are analyzed using HPLC columns—both standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, right? I remember that mCPBA is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. 

Wait, the starting materials here are (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are reacting with mCPBA under the same conditions, and then acid work-up. So each will form an epoxide. But wait, the configuration of the starting alkene affects the epoxide structure.

Wait, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it's an electrocyclic opening? No, no, wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond in an epoxidation. Oh wait, no, the epoxidation forms an epoxide. So for each isomer, (E) and (Z), the epoxide would form differently.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each end. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2 in the middle. Let me get that right. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, octene is eight carbons. So position 4 is between carbons 4 and 5. So structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? Wait no, maybe it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, maybe it's better to draw it out mentally. 

Regardless, the key point is that (E) and (Z) isomers will form different epoxides when treated with mCPBA. Because the geometry of the double bond affects the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, but when you epoxidize a trans (E) alkene, you get a trans epoxide? Or does it form a cis epoxide? Let me think. The mCPBA adds across the double bond, but the stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene. The epoxidation proceeds via a cyclic transition state, I think, so the geometry of the starting alkene dictates the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each side of the double bond are opposite. So when mCPBA adds, the oxygen will form the epoxide bridge. So, the two possible configurations of the epoxide would be different based on the starting geometry.

Wait, but wait a second. When you have an E alkene, the substituents (the two CH2 groups on either side) are opposite each other. So when you form the epoxide, the oxygens would be on opposite sides? Or same?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of the transition state. Epoxidation is a pericyclic reaction, specifically an electrocyclic opening of the peracid. Wait, no, it's more of a concerted addition. The mCPBA adds across the double bond, forming the epoxide. The geometry of the starting double bond determines the stereochemistry of the epoxide.

So for (E)-oct-4-ene, which is trans, the epoxide that forms will have the oxygens on opposite sides? Or same sides? Hmm.

Wait, I think that when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, the peracid adds to the same face of the alkene, leading to an epoxide where the two oxygen atoms are on the same face. So the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, no. Let me think: when the alkene is E (trans), the two substituents are opposite. When mCPBA adds, each oxygen comes from the same face, leading to the epoxide. So the configuration of the epoxide would be such that the two new bonds (from the epoxide oxygen) are formed on the same face.

Wait, perhaps I should consider an example. Let's say we have (E)-2-butene. The structure is CH2CH-CH2CH3 with E geometry. When mCPBA adds, it adds across the double bond, and the two oxygen atoms are added to the same face. So for (E)-2-butene, the epoxide would have the two adjacent CH2 groups on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the transition state.

Another approach: When an E-alkene reacts with mCPBA, the epoxide formed would have the two new chiral centers with opposite configurations, because the starting substituents are opposite. For a Z-alkene, the substituents are on the same side, so the epoxide's substituents would be on the same side.

Wait, perhaps an E-alkene leads to a trans epoxide and a Z-alkene leads to a cis epoxide. Or maybe it's the opposite?

Wait, no. For example, let's imagine (E)-2-butene: CH2CH2 (but actually, the substituents are on opposite sides). When mCPBA adds to the same face, the resulting epoxide would have the oxygen atoms on the same face, but the substituents (like CH3 groups) would end up on the same side or opposite?

Wait, perhaps using the concept of "cis" and "trans" in epoxides. If the starting alkene is trans (E), the epoxide would have the substituents on the same side? Or opposite?

Alternatively, maybe the epoxide retains the geometry of the alkene. So (E)-oct-4-ene would form a trans epoxide, and (Z) would form a cis epoxide.

Wait, I think that's correct. Because when mCPBA adds, the addition is syn, so the substituents that were on the same side of the double bond (Z) would end up on the same side of the epoxide, making a cis epoxide. Similarly, substituents on opposite sides (E) would end up on opposite sides of the epoxide, making a trans epoxide.

Wait, but wait, the epoxide is a three-membered ring. So the substituents would be on adjacent carbons. So if the starting double bond is E (trans), the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are on opposite sides. When the epoxide forms, the adjacent substituents (like the two CH2 groups) would be on opposite sides. So the epoxide would have adjacent substituents on opposite sides—so the epoxide itself would be trans, meaning that the two substituents (like the two CH2CH2 groups) are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring.

Similarly, for the (Z) isomer, the substituents are on the same side, so the epoxide would have substituents on the same side—so a cis epoxide.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. When an E-alkene reacts, the epoxidation would lead to a trans epoxide. So, for example, (E)-but-2-ene would form trans-2,3-epoxybutane. Similarly, (Z)-but-2-ene would form cis-2,3-epoxybutane.

Wait, but wait, the actual outcome depends on the transition state. Oh, right, mCPBA adds in a way that the peracid's oxygen attacks the same face of the double bond, leading to a syn addition. So the two new oxygen atoms are added to the same face of the alkene, leading to the epoxide.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are opposite. When the same face adds the oxygen atoms, the epoxide would have the substituents (on each carbon) on the same side? Or opposite?

Alternatively, perhaps I should imagine the alkene in a certain conformation. Let's say (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, so the two CH2 groups are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen comes from the same face, so the substituents on each carbon (the CH2 groups) would end up on the same side, making the epoxide in a cis configuration.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me try another approach. When the double bond is E (trans), the substituents (like R groups) are on opposite sides. Adding the oxygen from the same face would cause each oxygen to add to the same face of each carbon. So, for each carbon in the double bond, the substituent (R) and the new oxygen would be on the same face.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the transition state. The reaction proceeds with the peracid attacking the same face of the alkene. So for a trans-alkene, the two substituents (like R and R') are on opposite sides. So when the peracid attacks, the two oxygens add to the same face. For each carbon, the substituent and the oxygen are on the same face.

Wait, perhaps if the substituents were on opposite sides of the double bond, the addition of the same face for both would result in the substituents on adjacent carbons being on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. So in the epoxide, the substituents would be trans.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to think of a specific example. Let's take (E)-2-butene, which is CH2CHCH2CH3 with the double bond between C2 and C3, and the substituents (CH3 and CH2CH3) on opposite sides.

When mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms are added across the same face. So, for each carbon, the same face is attacked. So for (E)-2-butene, the two substituents (CH3 and CH2CH3) are on opposite sides. When the same face is attacked, the resulting epoxide will have the two substituents on the same side of the epoxide ring. Wait, because each substituent is on the opposite face of where the oxygen was added.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible products.

After epoxidation, each starting material (E and Z) will form a different diastereomer of the epoxide. The E isomer gives a trans epoxide, and the Z gives a cis epoxide.

Wait, but wait. No, that's not correct. Because the epoxidation leads to a specific stereochemistry. For a trans starting alkene, the epoxide would have the substituents on adjacent carbons in a trans arrangement. Similarly, the cis starting alkene would lead to a cis arrangement in the epoxide.

Wait, but in reality, when a trans alkene is epoxidized, the resulting epoxide is a trans-diepoxide. So for example, (E)-2-butene would become trans-2,3-epoxybutane, where the two CH2 groups are on opposite sides.

But wait, actually, in the epoxide, the two substituents (like the two CH2 groups) are adjacent. So in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the two substituents on adjacent carbons in a trans arrangement. While the (Z) would have them in a cis arrangement.

So, after epoxidation, we get two different diastereomers: one from the E-alkene (trans epoxide) and another from the Z (cis epoxide).

But wait, wait. Now, after epoxidation, what's the structure? Let me think. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. The double bond is between C4 and C5, if I'm counting correctly. So when epoxidized, the structure becomes an epoxide between C4 and C5, making cis or trans, depending on the starting geometry.

Wait, but oct-4-ene is a symmetric molecule. Wait, no. Wait, if it's (E)-oct-4-ene, then the substituents on each end of the double bond are CH2CH2-CH2 and CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Or perhaps the substituents are CH2CH2-CH2 on one side and CH2CH2-CH2CH3 on the other. Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled in the structure, but perhaps it's symmetric.

Wait, no. Oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the double bond is between C4 and C5. So the substituents on each end of the double bond are CH2CH2-CH2-CH2- and CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, perhaps I should write it as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, octene has eight carbons. So, positions 1 to 8.

Wait, position 4 would be between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. The double bond is between C4 and C5. So each end has two CH2 groups attached. So the substituents on each end are CH2CH2- and CH2CH2-CH2CH3?

Wait, maybe the substituents on either end of the double bond are two CH2CH2 groups. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are on opposite sides, and for (Z), on the same.

So when mCPBA epoxidizes each, the E will form a trans epoxide and Z a cis epoxide. So, we have two different epoxide products.

But wait, wait. The problem says that each reaction goes to 100% completion. So reaction 1 gives one product (trans epoxide), and reaction 2 gives another product (cis epoxide). Then, the chemist combines these products.

So the products are two diastereomers of the same epoxide. Because the starting alkenes are E and Z, the epoxides are diastereomers.

Now, when the products are combined, we have a mixture of these two epoxide diastereomers.

But wait, wait, after the epoxidation, what happens when aqueous acid is added? Oh, right, the work-up with acid. So, mCPBA forms the epoxide, and then aqueous acid is used. So, what's the product of epoxide under acid conditions?

Ah, acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides. In acidic conditions, the epoxide ring opens. The mechanism involves the protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, water or another nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon (if any) in a process called ring-opening.

Wait, but in this case, we don't have any other nucleophiles. The epoxide is undergoing ring-opening in aqueous acid. So, each epoxide will undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening to form a diol.

So, the trans and cis epoxides will form diols with different stereochemistry.

Wait, so let's think about each.

First, reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → acid → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → acid → diol.

Each epoxide will open to form a diol. The configuration of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide and the mechanism of the ring-opening.

In acid-catalyzed ring opening, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because the carbocation is more stable there. Wait, no, actually, in epoxide ring opening under acid conditions, the attack is typically on the less substituted (less hindered) carbon because the transition state is less hindered. Or is it the more substituted?

Wait, wait. Epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions: the protonation of the epoxide oxygen makes the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized when forming a carbocation. Wait, but in epoxide ring-opening, the attack is typically at the less substituted carbon because the more substituted carbon would lead to a more stable transition state? Or is it the other way around.

Wait, perhaps a better way to think: in acid-catalyzed epoxide opening, the nucleophile attacks the less substituted carbon because that leads to a more stable transition state or because the more substituted carbocation is more stabilized.

Wait, let me recall: in an epoxide, each oxygen is connected to two carbons. Upon protonation, each adjacent carbon becomes more positive. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because that leads to a more stable carbocation. For example, in propylene oxide, the attack would be on the central carbon, which is more substituted.

So, in the case of our epoxide, which structure? Let's think about both trans and cis epoxides.

Wait, the initial epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene would be trans. So, the two adjacent carbons (C4 and C5) each have two CH2 groups attached. So the substituents on each are the same. Therefore, when the epoxide opens, the attack is on either carbon as both are equally substituted.

Wait, but in reality, the attack would be on the same carbon due to ring strain and structure. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, but wait, regardless of the starting epoxide configuration, the ring-opening under acidic conditions will lead to a diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, let me think about the trans-epoxide first. Imagine a trans epoxide where the two CH2 groups are on opposite sides. When the acid attacks, the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. The nucleophile (water) attacks the less substituted carbon, but in this case, both are equally substituted because it's oct-4-ene. So the attack can be on either carbon.

But regardless, the attack leads to the formation of a diol. The configuration of the diol's stereocenters depends on the epoxide's configuration and the attack's stereochemistry.

Wait, in the acid-catalyzed ring opening of an epoxide, the attack occurs with anti addition. Because the epoxide ring opens by the nucleophile attacking the less substituted (or equally substituted) carbon from the opposite side of the leaving group.

Wait, perhaps an example. Take trans-2,3-epoxybutane. When it opens, the water attacks the less substituted carbon, but in our case, both carbons are equally substituted. So, regardless, the attack occurs on either carbon with anti addition.

But wait, in the case of a symmetric epoxide (like where both carbons are the same), the ring-opening would produce a single diastereomer. But in our case, the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene would have adjacent substituents in a trans configuration, making it a non-symmetric epoxide. Hmm, but wait, in oct-4-ene, the epoxide is between C4 and C5, each attached to two CH2 groups. So in reality, the epoxide is symmetric, so the ring-opening would lead to the same product regardless of which way the attack happens.

Wait, no, because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack from either side would lead to the same product. So, for the trans-epoxide, the diol formed would have adjacent stereocenters in a trans configuration.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think about the ring-opening of the trans-epoxide. When the epoxide is trans, the two substituents (the CH2 groups) are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. When the ring opens, water attacks each carbon from the opposite side. So, the two hydroxyl groups would end up on the same face or opposite faces.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the transition state. The ring-opening is an SN2-like mechanism, leading to inversion of configuration.

Wait, no, the ring-opening of epoxides under acidic conditions is typically an SN1-like mechanism, where the ring opens to form a carbocation intermediate. Wait, but in reality, it's an SN2-like process because the epoxide ring is strained and the transition state involves the nucleophile attacking the same face as the leaving group. No, wait, in acid-catalyzed conditions, the ring-opening is more likely to proceed through an SN2-like mechanism with backside attack.

Wait, no, in the acid-catalyzed ring-opening, the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making the adjacent carbons more positive. The nucleophile attacks the less substituted carbon (if any) from the opposite side, leading to a trans diol.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think of a specific example. Take cis-2,3-epoxybutane. When opened under acidic conditions, the diol formed would have the two hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis) because the attack occurs on the same face. Or wait, no, because the attack is from the opposite face due to the backside attack in SN2.

Wait, perhaps I should consult a textbook example. Oh wait, I can't do that, but I'll try to remember.

In the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of cis-epoxide, the diol formed has the hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis), because the attack occurs on the same carbon from the same face but opposite to the leaving group.

Wait, no. Let me think again: when the epoxide is cis, the two substituents (like CH2 groups) are on the same side. Upon protonation, the oxygen becomes positively charged, and the nucleophile attacks from the opposite side, leading to the formation of the diol with adjacent hydroxyls on the same or opposite sides.

Wait, maybe this is easier. For a trans epoxide, the ring-opening would lead to a diol with the two hydroxyl groups on opposite sides (trans), and for a cis epoxide, the hydroxyls would be on the same side (cis). Or is it the opposite?

Alternatively, perhaps the diol's stereochemistry is the same as the epoxide's. So a trans-epoxide leads to a trans-diol, and a cis-epoxide leads to a cis-diol.

Wait, that sounds plausible. Because the addition of the hydroxyl groups occurs on the same face as the epoxide's substituents.

Wait, perhaps the diol's configuration is the same as the epoxide's configuration because the attack occurs from the same face. So, for the trans-epoxide, the diol would be trans, and for the cis-epoxide, the diol would be cis.

But wait, I'm not so sure. Let me imagine the transition state. In the epoxide ring-opening, the nucleophile (water) attacks the carbon from the opposite side of the leaving group. So, if the epoxide has substituents on the same face, the attack would lead to the hydroxyl groups on the opposite face.

Wait, maybe it's better to imagine the epoxide as a three-membered ring. For a cis epoxide, when the ring opens, the two OH groups add on the same face, leading to a cis diol. For a trans epoxide, the OHs add on opposite faces, leading to a trans diol.

No, wait, perhaps that's the opposite. Let me think: when the epoxide is cis, the substituents are on the same face. When the ring opens, the water attacks from the opposite face. So, the hydroxyl groups would end up on the same face as the substituents. So, if the substituents were on the same face, the hydroxyls would be on the same face, making the diol cis.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too confusing. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the products.

After Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → acid → diol product A.

After Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → acid → diol product B.

What are product A and B?

In the case of Reaction 1, the trans-epoxide would form a diol where the two OH groups are on opposite sides of the former double bond. So, trans-diol.

In Reaction 2, the cis-epoxide would form a diol where the two OH groups are on the same side, so a cis-diol.

Wait, but wait. If the epoxide is trans, the diol would be trans, and if the epoxide is cis, the diol would be cis. Is that correct?

Yes, I think that's right. Because the diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration. So, each reaction produces a different diol: one trans, one cis.

But wait, are these diols enantiomers, diastereomers, or the same compound?

Since the diols are formed from different starting materials, their configurations would be different. So, the diol from (E)-ene would be trans, and from (Z) would be cis.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the diol structure. The diol from each epoxide would have two stereocenters. So, for trans diol, the two OH groups are on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration. For cis diol, the OHs are on the same side.

So, when these two diols are combined, we have two diastereomers.

Wait, but what about the possibility of multiple stereoisomers? For example, each diol has two stereocenters, so each can have R,R or S,S configuration, or R,S and S,R (enantiomers). Or perhaps in the case of trans diol, it's R,S or S,R, which are enantiomers, and the cis diol is R,R or S,S.

Wait, no. Let me think. The diol from the trans epoxide would have the two OH groups on opposite sides. So, if the two stereocenters are on adjacent carbons, the configuration would be R,S and S,R, which are enantiomers. But in reality, since the molecule is symmetric, maybe it's a meso compound.

Wait, if your diol is from a symmetric epoxide, like the trans-epoxide of an internally symmetric alkene (like (E)-ene), then the diol would be a meso compound. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Ah, that's a key point. So, if the starting material is symmetric, the diol formed would be a meso compound.

Wait, for example, let's take (E)-but-2-ene. Its epoxide would be trans-2,3-epoxybutane, which is symmetric. When it opens under acid conditions, the diol would be 2,3-butanediol. But wait, 2,3-butanediol can exist as three stereoisomers: R,R; S,S; and R,S (which is the same as S,R). But if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, like in 2,3-butanediol, the R,S configuration is a meso compound.

Wait, so in our case, the diol from the trans-epoxide would be a meso compound, meaning it has two stereocenters but is achiral because of an internal plane of symmetry.

Similarly, the cis-epoxide would form a diol where the two OH groups are on the same side. But in that case, the diol would not be symmetric. So, for the cis-epoxide, the diol would have two stereocenters without a plane of symmetry, leading to two enantiomers (R,R and S,S). But wait, no, because the molecule is not symmetric. Wait, no, if the starting epoxide is symmetric, the diol would also be symmetric.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled again. Let me try to focus.

In the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is trans and symmetric. So, upon ring-opening, the diol would be a meso compound. Thus, it has two stereocenters but is achiral. So, it's a single compound, not a pair of enantiomers.

In the case of (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is cis and symmetric as well. Wait, no, because (Z) and (E) are the same in terms of symmetry for oct-4-ene. Because oct-4-ene is symmetric, both E and Z isomers are actually the same? Wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is a symmetric molecule, so the E and Z isomers are actually the same. Because the molecule is symmetric, flipping it would make E and Z the same.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. For oct-4-ene, the double bond is in the middle, so it's symmetric. So, the (E) and (Z) isomers would be identical because the molecule can be flipped over the center. So, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are actually the same compound. Oh! That's a crucial point I missed earlier.

Wait, no. Wait, no, for oct-4-ene, which is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, the double bond is between C4 and C5. So, each side of the double bond has two CH2 groups. So, the molecule is symmetric. So, the (E) and (Z) isomers are actually the same because the molecule is symmetric. So, (E)-oct-4-ene is the same as (Z)-oct-4-ene because the molecule can't distinguish between the two configurations due to symmetry.

Wait, that would mean that the starting materials are actually the same, which would make the problem have no difference between reactions 1 and 2. But that can't be correct because the problem states that the starting materials are (E) and (Z) isomers. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, maybe the structure isn't symmetric. Let's count the substituents.

Wait, oct-4-ene: positions 1 through 8. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. The double bond is between C4 and C5. So, each end of the double bond has two CH2 groups. So, each end is CH2CH2 on one side and CH2CH2CH3 on the other? Wait, no, because it's the middle of the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same. So, each side is -CH2CH2- and -CH2CH2-.

Wait, that can't be right. Let's think again. Oct-4-ene: CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, C4 is connected to C3 and C5, and C5 is connected to C4 and C6.

Wait, no, the structure is: CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. The double bond is between C4 and C5. So, C4 is connected to C3 (CH2-) and C5 (CH2-). Similarly, C5 is connected to C4 (CH2-) and C6 (CH2-). So each end of the double bond has a CH2 group and another CH2 group.

Wait, so each substituent on the double bond is a CH2CH2 group. So the molecule is symmetric. Therefore, (E) and (Z) isomers are actually the same because the molecule can't distinguish the configuration due to symmetry.

Wait, that would make the starting materials identical, which would make the reactions produce the same epoxide. But the problem states that the starting materials are (E) and (Z) isomers, so perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, perhaps for oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are different. For example, one end has two CH2 groups, and the other has a CH2CH2CH3 group. Let me think: perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, so C4 is CH2 and C5 is CH2. But that would make the substituents on each end the same, making the molecule symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the double bond at C4, making each end (C4 and C5) connected to two CH2 groups. So, the molecule is symmetric.

But that would imply that (E) and (Z) isomers are the same, which can't be, because the problem says they are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe oct-4-ene is structured as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with substituents that aren't the same on both ends.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a straight-chain alkene with substituents (CH2CH2 and CH2CH2) on each end of the double bond. So, in that case, the molecule is symmetric, and the (E) and (Z) isomers are identical. But that can't be correct because the question treats them as different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed under the assumption that (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are different, non-symmetric molecules. So each has different substituents on either end of the double bond, making the epoxide products different.

But perhaps I should proceed without getting stuck on the structure. Let's proceed under the assumption that the epoxidation leads to two different diastereomeric epoxides, which upon acid work-up produce two different diastereomeric diols.

So, each reaction produces a single diol, but these diols are diastereomers. So when the chemist combines the products, they have a mixture of the two diols.

Now, the question is about HPLC analysis. The products are run on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.

In an achiral column, how many peaks would each diol produce? Well, if the diol is a meso compound (achiral), it would produce a single peak. If it's a chiral compound (enantiomers present), they would co-elute on an achiral column, producing a single peak. But if the diol is a pair of enantiomers, then on an achiral column, they would appear as one peak, but on a chiral column, they would split into two.

Wait, but in our case, each diol is a diastereomer. Are they enantiomers or diastereomers?

Wait, the two diols are from different epoxides. So, they are diastereomers. So, each diol may be a single stereoisomer or a pair, depending on their structure.

Wait, let me think again. The diol from the (E)-ene is trans, and the diol from (Z)-ene is cis.

If each diol is a meso compound (achiral), then they would each produce a single peak on the achiral column. But if the diols are chiral, then each would have enantiomers, but since the reaction is 100% efficient, each diol would be a single enantiomer.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the diol from the (E)-ene: it's a trans diol. If this diol is a meso compound, it's achiral and would produce one peak on achiral and chiral columns. But wait, no. On a chiral column, a meso compound would still give a single peak because it's not chiral.

Wait, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers? Because each diol has two stereocenters. Let me think: the diol from the (E)-ene would have the two OH groups on opposite sides. So, it would have two stereocenters. Are they enantiomers or a meso form?

If the two stereocenters are opposite (R and S), and the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso compound. So, the diol from the (E)-ene is a meso compound.

Similarly, the diol from the (Z)-ene would have the OH groups on the same side. Are those stereocenters the same or different? Let's see: suppose the diol has two stereocenters, both R, which would be the same configuration. Or both S, which is the same as R,R.

Wait, but if the diol is from the (Z)-ene, which is a cis epoxide, and upon ring-opening forms a diol where both OHs are on the same side, then each stereocenter would be the same (like R,R or S,S), but without symmetry, so the molecule would be chiral, leading to two enantiomers.

Wait, but in the case of the (Z)-ene, the epoxide is symmetric. So, perhaps the diol is a meso compound as well.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me summarize:

If the diol from (E)-ene is a meso compound, it's achiral. The diol from (Z)-ene, if it's also a meso compound, would also be achiral. So, when combined, you have two achiral diols.

But wait, in that case, each would produce a single peak on the achiral column. So, the combined product would have two peaks on the achiral column.

But wait, no. If the diols are different, perhaps they are not meso compounds. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the diol from (E)-ene is a meso compound (so one peak on achiral), and the diol from (Z)-ene is a chiral compound (two enantiomers, but since they're formed in 100% yield, perhaps each diol is a single enantiomer).

Wait, but in the (Z)-ene case, the diol may not be a meso compound. Let me think about it. The diol from (Z)-ene would have both OH groups on the same side. So, for example, if each stereocenter is R, then the molecule would be R,R, which is a single enantiomer. But wait, no, because if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might be a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from (Z)-ene is a meso compound as well. So, in that case, each diol would be achiral, leading to two peaks in the achiral column.

Wait, but that would mean that each reaction produces a single achiral diol, so the combination would have two peaks on the achiral column.

But the question is asking what the chemist observes in each chromatogram.

So, in the achiral HPLC, if both diols are achiral, you get two peaks. On the chiral HPLC, each diol would be a single compound, leading to two peaks as well. Because a chiral column would separate enantiomers, but if the diol is achiral, it would just elute as a single peak.

Wait, but wait. If the diol is a meso compound (achiral), then on a chiral column, it would still appear as a single peak because it's not chiral. Enantiomers would split into two peaks on a chiral column, but achiral compounds would not.

So, in this scenario, if both diols are meso, then the chiral column would show two peaks as well, because each is a single compound (achiral). So, in the achiral HPLC, two peaks (each diol). In the chiral HPLC, two peaks (each diol is a single compound). So, the answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both.

But wait, another possibility: each diol is a pair of enantiomers. So, if each diol is a racemic mixture, then on the achiral column, each would be a single peak. On the chiral column, each would split into two. But the problem states that each reaction goes to 100% completion, so each diol is a single enantiomer, not a racemic mix.

Wait, but if the diol is a meso compound, it's a single compound, so on both columns, it's a single peak. If the diol is chiral (like the diol from the (Z)-ene), then it would be a single enantiomer, which on a chiral column would show as a single peak.

Wait, no. If the diol is a single enantiomer, it would show as a single peak on both achiral and chiral columns. Because the achiral column can't distinguish enantiomers, so it would appear as one peak. The chiral column would show it as one peak as well because it's a single enantiomer.

But in reality, a chiral column separates enantiomers, so if you have a single enantiomer, it would produce a single peak. If you have a racemic mixture, it would produce two peaks.

But in our case, each reaction is 100% complete, so each diol is a single enantiomer. So, each diol contributes a single peak on both columns.

Wait, but wait. The diol from reaction 1 is trans (from E-ene) and the diol from reaction 2 is cis (from Z-ene). So, each is a diastereomer, not an enantiomer.

So, on the achiral column, each diastereomer would produce a separate peak. So, two peaks in the achiral HPLC.

On the chiral column, each diastereomer would still be a single peak because the column is for separating enantiomers, not diastereomers. So, diastereomers would elute at different times, but each would be a single peak.

Wait, no. Wait, a chiral column separates enantiomers, but diastereomers would also have different retention times because their interactions with the column are different. So, each diastereomer would produce a separate peak on the chiral column as well.

Wait, but wait. On a chiral column, the separation is based on the interaction of chiral compounds with the chiral stationary phase. So, enantiomers would have opposite interactions and potentially elute at different times, while diastereomers have different structures and would elute at different times regardless. So, for each diastereomer, it would elute as a single peak on a chiral column.

Thus, the products are two diastereomers. On the achiral column, each diastereomer is a separate peak—so two peaks. On the chiral column, each diastereomer would also be a separate peak—so two peaks. So, the answer is option C: 2 peaks in both HPLCs.

But wait, let me make sure. If the diols are diastereomers, the achiral column would separate them into two peaks. The chiral column, which is also capable of separating diastereomers based on their interactions, would also show two peaks.

So, the chemist would see two peaks on both the standard and chiral HPLC.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The key steps and reasoning are as follows:

1. **Epoxidation with mCPBA**:  
   - mCPBA adds across the double bond of alkenes, forming an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.  
   - For (E)-oct-4-ene (trans-alkene), the substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides, leading to a trans-epoxide.  
   - For (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis-alkene), the substituents on the double bond are on the same side, leading to a cis-epoxide.  

2. **Acid-Catalyzed Ring-Opening of Epoxides**:  
   - Under acidic conditions, the epoxide ring opens to form a diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide.  
   - For the trans-epoxide (from (E)-oct-4-ene), the diol formed has the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, resulting in a trans-diol.  
   - For the cis-epoxide (from (Z)-oct-4-ene), the diol formed has the hydroxyl groups on the same side, resulting in a cis-diol.  

3. **Nature of the Diols**:  
   - The diol from the trans-epoxide is a meso compound (achiral) due to the molecule's symmetry.  
   - The diol from the cis-epoxide is chiral, as it lacks a plane of symmetry and exists as two enantiomers (R,R and S,S).  

4. **HPLC Analysis**:  
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**:  
     - The achiral column cannot distinguish between enantiomers but can separate diastereomers.  
     - The trans-diol (meso compound) and cis-diol (chiral) are diastereomers, so they will elute as two separate peaks.  
   - **Chiral HPLC**:  
     - The chiral column separates enantiomers. However, since the trans-diol is achiral (meso compound), it will elute as a single peak. The cis-diol, being chiral, will also elute as a single peak because it is a single enantiomer (100% conversion ensures no racemic mixture).  
     - Thus, both diols will appear as two separate peaks on the chiral column due to their diastereomeric relationship.  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   - On the standard (achiral) HPLC, two peaks are observed (one for each diastereomer).  
   - On the chiral HPLC, two peaks are also observed (one for each diastereomer).  

Thus, the chemist observes **2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC chromatograms**.
