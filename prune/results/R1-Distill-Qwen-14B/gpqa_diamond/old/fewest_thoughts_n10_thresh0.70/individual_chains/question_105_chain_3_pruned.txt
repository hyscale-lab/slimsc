Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

So, there's this star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The question is about the brightness variation caused by the star's rotation, which can look like an exoplanet transit. They want to know what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same amplitude in the light curve. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. So, for the same effect as the spots causing a dip, the planet's size relative to the star should match the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but the spots are dark, so when they're facing us, they make the star appear dimmer. But when the other side (without spots) comes into view, the star appears brighter. So the variation would be like a dimming and then brightening as the star rotates. But a planet would just block some light when it's in front.

Wait, no, the problem says that the variations are because of rotational modulation. So the spots cover a part of the star, and as it rotates, different amounts of spotted area come into view. So the brightness goes up and down periodically.

The question is asking: if this star's brightness variation is caused by a planet instead of spots, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude?

Wait, no, the question is a bit different. It says, "if the star was not covered by spots!", what would the exoplanet's radius need to be to produce the same amplitude. So the amplitude caused by the spots is the same as the amplitude that would be caused by a planet. So we need to find R_planet / R_star such that the light dip from the planet is the same as the maximum dip from the spots.

Wait,
