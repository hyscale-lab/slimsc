Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm a bit rusty on the subject, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that a proton is injected into a synchrocyclotron at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is how many revolutions the proton makes.

Hmm, I remember that synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron used to accelerate charged particles to high energies. They use a magnetic field and an alternating voltage to push the particles, making them spiral outwards and gain energy with each revolution.

Wait, but how does the acceleration work here? In a regular cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency changes to keep the particles in phase with the accelerating voltage as they gain energy. But this problem mentions two accelerations, so maybe it's a two-stage process?

The proton starts with negligible KE, so its initial velocity is low. The voltage is alternating, and the phase is given as π/4. The voltage probably helps accelerate the proton each time it reaches a peak.

I'm a bit confused about the formula for the voltage. The general form is U(t) = U0 cos(2πν t + Φ0), where ν is the frequency. But wait, here they have ν(α). Oh, right, in synchrocyclotrons, the frequency ν depends on the particle's momentum, which increases as the particle gets accelerated. So ν(α) is the frequency as a function of the particle's radius α (or maybe another variable like the momentum). But I'm not exactly sure how that function behaves.

Wait, but maybe I can find the number of revolutions without knowing the exact dependence. Let me think about the energy gain. Each time the proton goes through a potential difference U, it gains energy. But in a synchrocyclotron, the voltage is applied such that the proton is accelerated each time it completes a half-cycle of the voltage, right
