Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that phase shifts are related to partial waves in scattering theory, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas.

Wait, the phase shifts are given as delta_0, delta_1, delta_2, delta_3, delta_4. Oh right, in scattering theory, each partial wave has a phase shift, and these are denoted by these delta values for each angular momentum l.

The scattering amplitude, I think, is given by a formula involving the sum over all l of these phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is something like f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l + 1) exp(i delta_l - i l pi/2) ] multiplied by the spherical harmonics Y_lm, but wait, when you're looking along the incident direction, theta is 0 degrees or 180 degrees? Because the scattering angle theta=0 would be along the beam direction.

Wait no, wait. The scattering amplitude f has different components at different angles. But the problem specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So that's theta=0, I think.

Alternatively, sometimes the scattering amplitude is written in terms of the Legendre polynomials for certain angles. Oh wait, maybe for the direction along the beam (forward direction) which is theta=0, the formula simplifies.

Wait, I remember that the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude can be written as:

f(theta) = sum_{l=0}^{infinity} (2l + 1) * e^{2i delta_l} * P_l(cos theta) / (k * (2ik)) ?

Wait, no, let me get this right. The general formula is:

f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^{âˆž} (2l + 1) e^{2i delta_l} P_l(cos theta)

But wait, I've also heard that for the forward direction (theta=0), the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) = 1, since cos 0 is 1. So when theta is zero, each term becomes (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} * 1. 

So f(theta=0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^{n} (2l +1) e^{2i delta_l}

Wait, but the problem says to ignore the rest beyond delta_4. So they give up to l=4. So we take l from 0 to 4.

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to compute Im(f(0)).

So let me write:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{i (2 delta_l)} )

Wait, no, wait. The exponential is e^{2i delta_l} because each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} P_l(cos theta), and theta=0, so P_l(1)=1.

So the sum becomes sum from l
