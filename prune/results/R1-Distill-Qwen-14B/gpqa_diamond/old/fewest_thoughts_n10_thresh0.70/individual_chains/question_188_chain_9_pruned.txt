Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, rhombohedral crystals, right. I remember they have all sides equal and all angles equal too. Oh wait, the question says the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms.

Wait, interatomic distance... Oh, I think that refers to the lattice constant 'a' because in a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corners of a cube, but wait no, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all edges are equal and all angles are equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, all angles are 30 degrees.

So, the interplanar distance d for a crystal plane (hkl) is given by the formula from the Bragg's law. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ) ) ). Wait, no, wait. Or is it another formula? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α ), but wait, no, because in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are
