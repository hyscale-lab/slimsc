Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves five binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. So, Y is some element that forms multiple compounds with F. The compounds are labeled A1 to A5. Let's go through each clue one by one.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is 20°C or room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think this might be the oxidation state or perhaps the formula units) of A2 is 31.96%. Wait, maybe that's the percentage composition, like the mass percentage of fluorine in A2. So if A2 has a fluorine content of 31.96%, that could help us find its formula.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing usually involves acting as a reducing agent or maybe as an oxidizing agent. Wait, no, if A1 is the oxidizing agent, it would cause another substance to lose electrons. Xenon is being oxidized, so A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine compounds are often strong oxidizing agents, but which one?

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So fluorination implies that Y is a metal that reacts with F2 to form a fluoride. So Y is probably a metal. When Y reacts with F2, it forms A3. So A3 is YF_x, where x is some number.

When adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. So, adding Y to A4 solution gives A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So maybe A5 is a salt that undergoes hydrolysis?

The question is asking for the molecular weight range of A4. The options are A) 140-160, B) 220-240, C) 160-180, D) 110-130.

Let me try to figure out what each compound could be.

Starting with A1. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. Let's assume the decomposition is something like A1 → A2 + F2. Suppose A1 is a higher fluoride that breaks down into a lower one and fluorine gas.

Since A1 oxidizes xenon, which is a noble gas, that suggests A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Common strong oxidizing fluorides include F2 itself, but F2 is a diatomic gas. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is ClF3 or something similar, but wait, fluorine compounds can be oxidizing. Another possibility is OF2, but that's not a binary compound with Y.

Wait, the compounds are binary, so they are Y and F. So Y must be the other element in all these compounds.

Wait, if A1 is a high oxidation state fluoride, perhaps YF5 or YF6?
