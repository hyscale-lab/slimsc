Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, I remember that luminosity relates to a star's properties like radius and temperature. Let me think.

The problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, do I need the mass for calculating luminosity? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, the question says they computed luminosity using the assumption that stars radiate as black bodies. So the formula for luminosity as a black body would be L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. So I probably need to find the temperatures of the two stars.

The question also mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right! The wavelength where a black body emits most strongly is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same, right? Because if λ_max is the same, then T would be inversely proportional to each other. Wait no, because λ_max is the same, so T1 must equal T2. Wait, no, let me think again. If λ_max is the same, then T = b / λ_max. So same λ_max implies same T. So T1 = T2. Oh, got it.

Wait, but earlier I thought that maybe the other factors would influence temperature, but since λ_max is the same, their temperatures are equal. So T1 = T2 = T.

Wait, but wait. The radial velocities are given too. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh! Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But if Star_1 is not moving towards or away (radial velocity zero), while Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. How does that affect the observed wavelength? Because of the Doppler effect, right.

Oh wait, the observed wavelength
