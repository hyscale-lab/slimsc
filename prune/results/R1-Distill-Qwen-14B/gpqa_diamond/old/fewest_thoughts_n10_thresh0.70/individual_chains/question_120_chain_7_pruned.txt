Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax (usually denoted as 'plx') is inversely proportional to the distance of the star. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away, and a larger parallax means it's closer.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution probably means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So, the number of stars depends on the volume of space we're considering. 

But wait, how does parallax come into play here? Let me think about the relation between parallax and distance. I recall that plx (parallax) in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, distance d = 1 / plx. So as plx increases, d decreases, meaning closer stars.

The key here is to find how the number of stars in a given parallax range (like between plx and plx + dplx) changes with plx. So, for a small change in parallax, how does the number of stars in that bin vary?

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. The number per unit volume is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume is proportional to the volume.

Let's model this. For a star at distance d, the volume element in spherical shells would be 4πd² dd. Because volume of a shell is surface area (4πd²) multiplied by thickness (dd). But wait, how does distance relate to parallax?

Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, I think I should express everything in terms of plx. Let me see: plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But I'm dealing with a change in plx, dplx, which would correspond to a change in d. 

Wait, but I'm trying to find the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx. So, the distance ranges from d to d + dd, where dd = (1/plx²) dplx. Because when plx increases, d decreases. So, the volume element in terms of plx is:

Volume element = 4π d² dd. Substituting d=1/plx and dd = (dplx)/(plx²). So,

Volume element = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx)/(plx²) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

So, the number of stars in that volume element is proportional to the volume. Since the number density (n) is constant, number of stars = n * Volume element = n * (4π dplx / plx^4).

So, the number of stars per unit plx (dplx
