Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency for the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I think I remember that red phosphorus and HI are involved in some kind of elimination or addition reaction. Wait, no, red phosphorus usually is used in the hydroboration reaction or maybe for something else. Oh wait, when you have a carbonyl group and you use HI with red phosphorus, it's probably a Wittig reaction. Oh wait, no, the Wittig reagent is made from an alkyl halide and triphenylphosphine. Red phosphorus might be part of a different reaction.

Wait, maybe it's about the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that's with ketones and a peracid. Hmm. Alternatively, when you have a carbonyl and HI, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but red phosphorus might be involved in a different process. Oh, right! I think when you have a carbonyl group like a ketone or aldehyde and you treat it with a phosphorus reagent like phosphorus triiodide or something, it can lead to a substitution. Or wait, maybe it's about the formation of an oxaziridine or something? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think about the reagents. Red phosphorus is often used in the preparation of ylides, which are used in Wittig reactions. Oh, right! The Wittig reaction uses a ylide (like made from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide) to react with carbonyl groups to form alkenes. But wait, in this case, the reagent is red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh wait, maybe this is a case where the carbonyl is being converted into an alkene via a Wittig-type reaction. Or maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, I think when you have a carbonyl group and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it might be undergoing a substitution. Hmm, wait, I'm trying to remember. Oh! When a carbonyl group reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to form an iodide. For example, in the case of an aldehyde or ketone, the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by an iodide. But wait, how does that work? I think the reaction is called the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, but that uses alcohols. No, maybe it's the hydroiodic acid addition.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the formation of an enol iodide. Wait, another thought: when a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde or ketone) reacts with a phosphorus reagent, it can lead to the formation of an alkene via elimination. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a case where the carbonyl is undergoing a dehydration. But with HI and red phosphorus, maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the structure of the starting material. The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw its structure. It's a cyclohexene ring. The substituents: at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), wait, no, vinyl is CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached. So 5-vinyl would be a CH2CH2 group attached to position 5? Wait, no, the structure is cyclohexene, so carbon 3 is double bonded to 4, I think. So positions 1, 2, 3, etc., around the ring.

So cyclohex-3-ene: that's the ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, the substituents are at 2 (formyl) and 5 (vinyl). So the 2-formyl is a CHO group attached to carbon 2, and the 5-vinyl is a CH2CH2 group attached to carbon 5. Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So the substituent at C5 would be a CH2CH2 group with a double bond. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's not critical for determining the index of hydrogen deficiency. Maybe I should think about the reactions.

So the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think this is a way to convert carbonyl groups (like the formyl group) into alkenes. Wait, yes! Because in the Wittig reaction, the ylide abstracts the carbonyl oxygen, leading to the formation of an alkene. So if the starting material has a formyl group (CHO), then after the Wittig reaction, it would become CH2- group, and the oxygen would be replaced by a new structure, perhaps forming an alkene.

Wait, but the ylide is usually made from an alkyl halide and triphenylphosphine. But in this case, the reagent is red phosphorus and HI. Oh, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a ylide. Let me think: when an aldehyde or ketone reacts with a phosphorus ylide, it forms an alkene. So the product would have an additional double bond.

Wait, but the starting material already has a double bond in the cyclohexene ring, and a vinyl group (another double bond) as a substituent. So, the product after the reaction would have another double bond from the formyl group being converted into an alkene.

So the starting material's structure has several double bonds. Let me count them. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond (one), the vinyl group is a substituent with another double bond (two), and the formyl group is a carbonyl (which isn't a double bond, but after reaction, it would become a new double bond. So the product would have how many double bonds?

Wait, no. The starting material's index of hydrogen deficiency is: the formula is C8 H6 O3? Let me see. The base is cyclohexene: C6 H10. But wait, substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Let me compute the hydrogen deficiency. For a cyclohexene ring, the base is C6 H10. Each double bond contributes one to the index. So the ring itself contributes one. Then, the substituents: the formyl group is CHO, which is a carbonyl (so no additional double bond, but an oxygen). The vinyl group is CH2CH2 with a double bond (so that's another double bond). So before reaction, the molecule has two double bonds (the ring and the vinyl group). The formyl group is a carbonyl, which is another double bond, but that's part of the structure, so the index of hydrogen deficiency is 3.

Wait, the index is the number of double bonds plus rings, each counting as one. Wait, no. The index is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But in this case, perhaps I should think about the product after the reaction.

But the question is about the index of the product, not the starting material. So the product is formed when the starting material reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. As I thought earlier, this is likely a Wittig reaction. The formyl group (CHO) will react to form an alkene, so the product will lose that carbonyl group and form a new double bond.

So the starting material has a formyl group at position 2. After the reaction, that becomes CH2, but wait, no: the Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl (O) with a CH2 group and forms a double bond. So the formyl (CHO) group becomes CH2- with a double bond adjacent. So the product will have an additional double bond where the formyl was.

Wait, more accurately, the Wittig reaction converts a carbonyl group (like R-C=O) into an alkene (R-CH2-CH2-R'), but actually, no, it replaces the O with a CH2 group and forms a new double bond between the R group and the new CH2. So the product would have a new double bond where the carbonyl was.

So, the starting material has a formyl group (CHO) which is a carbonyl. After reaction, that becomes a CH2 group, but the new double bond is between the adjacent carbon and the one from the carbonyl. So, the formyl (CHO) becomes CH2, but with a double bond adjacent. So, the product would have a new double bond.

So the starting material has:

- One double bond in the cyclohexene ring.

- One double bond in the vinyl substituent.

- One double bond from the formyl carbonyl (but wait, a carbonyl is a double bond, but it's not a ring or an alkene). So, the starting material's index of hydrogen deficiency is: rings = 1, double bonds from cyclohexene ring (1), vinyl substituent (another 1), and the formyl's carbonyl (another 1). So that's a total of 3. But wait, I thought the starting material's index is 3, but the question is about the product.

After the reaction, the formyl group is converted into an alkene, so the carbonyl becomes a double bond. So that's another double bond. Wait, no. The starting material's formyl is RCHO. The Wittig reaction replaces the O with a CH2 group and forms a new double bond. So, suppose the formyl was at position 2. The product would have a CH2 group with a double bond adjacent, so the ring would have another double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, it's a cyclohexene ring with a formyl group at position 2 and a vinyl group at position 5.

When you perform the Wittig reaction on the formyl group, it would convert the CHO into a CH2 group connected via a double bond to the adjacent carbon. So, the ring would gain another double bond. So, the product would have:

- The cyclohexene ring's double bond (1)

- The vinyl group's double bond (1)

- The new double bond formed from the formyl group (1)

Wait, but wait, the formyl group is at position 2, and the cyclohexene ring's double bond is between 3 and 4. So, when the formyl group is converted into an alkene, the new double bond would be between position 2 and position 1, perhaps? Or maybe between position 2 and 3?

Wait, maybe the starting material is cyclohex-3-ene, so carbons 1, 2, 3, 4,5,6. The double bond is between 3 and 4. The substituents are at 2 (formyl) and 5 (vinyl). So when the formyl group is converted via Wittig, the new double bond would be between 1 and 2, perhaps. Or maybe between 2 and the adjacent carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is on carbon 2, and the Wittig reaction forms a double bond between 2 and 1, making the ring have a double bond between 1-2 and the existing 3-4. But wait, that would create a cyclohexa-1,3-diene, which is a conjugated diene. But that depends on the position.

Wait, but if the starting material's ring already has a double bond (between 3 and 4), and the formyl is on 2, then converting the formyl into an alkene would create a new double bond between 2 and 1. So the ring would now have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. So that's two double bonds in the ring, making it a diene.

But wait, the ring is cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond. If another double bond is formed adjacent, would that cause some ring strain or would it form a conjugated diene?

Alternatively, perhaps the new double bond is between 2 and 3, which is adjacent to the existing 3-4 double bond. That would make a conjugated diene between 2-3 and 3-4, but that's not possible because a carbon can't have two double bonds. So perhaps the new double bond is between 2 and 1, and the existing is between 3 and 4. So that would form a diene with two double bonds in the ring, but separated by a single bond.

Wait, but I think that would actually be possible if the ring is large enough, but cyclohexene is six-membered, so adding another double bond would make it a 1,3-diene in the ring.

Wait, but in a six-membered ring, having two double bonds would require them to be conjugated. So for example, positions 1-2 and 3-4 would be conjugated, but that would require the ring to have a 1,3-diene arrangement. Now, when you form the new double bond, perhaps the ring becomes a 1,3-cyclohexadiene.

So the product would have:

- The ring now has two double bonds: 1-2 and 3-4. So that's two from the ring.

- The vinyl group at position 5 has a double bond: that's the third.

So the product has three double bonds. Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency would be the number of double bonds plus the number of rings. Wait, no. The index is calculated as:

Index = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2

But in this case, perhaps it's easier to count the number of double bonds and rings. Each ring counts as one, each double bond counts as one. So the product has:

- One ring (the cyclohexene ring remains, so that's one ring).

- Three double bonds: two from the ring and one from the vinyl group? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, the product after the Wittig reaction. The starting material has:

- One ring (cyclohexene) → contributes 1 to index.

- The formyl group (CHO) → which is a double bond (C=O) → contributes 1.

- The vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) → another double bond → contributes 1.

So before reaction, the starting material has an index of 3 (1 ring + 2 double bonds).

After the reaction, the formyl group is converted into an alkene via the Wittig. So the formyl's carbonyl (C=O) is replaced by a C=C. So the new structure would have:

- The original cyclohexene ring's double bond (now perhaps a different position).

Wait, no. The Wittig reaction doesn't change the ring's double bond; it creates a new double bond from the formyl group. So the original cyclohexene's double bond remains, the vinyl group's double bond remains, and the new double bond from the formyl group is added.

Wait, but wait, the starting material already has the vinyl group's double bond. So after the reaction, the product would have:

- Cyclohexene ring's double bond → 1.

- Vinyl group's double bond → 1.

- New double bond from formyl → 1.

So that's 3 double bonds. Plus the ring → 1. So index = 3 (double bonds) + 1 (ring) = 4?

Wait, but wait, the ring itself is a ring, which contributes 1 to the index. Each double bond contributes 1. So the product would have 3 double bonds and 1 ring, so index is 4.

But wait, the options don't have 4. The options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, so that suggests I'm making a mistake here. Maybe I'm not counting correctly.

Wait, perhaps the ring's double bond is replaced. Because when the formyl group is converted into an alkene, maybe the ring's double bond is converted into a single bond, and the new double bond is elsewhere.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between 3 and 4.

The formyl group is at 2. So when the formyl undergoes a Wittig reaction, the carbonyl (CHO) becomes a CH₂ group, but the Wittig forms a new double bond. So the formyl at 2 would now form a new double bond between 2 and 1, perhaps, creating a new double bond in the ring.

But wait, the ring already has a double bond between 3 and 4. If the product forms a new double bond between 1 and 2, then the ring would have two double bonds: 1-2 and 3-4. So that makes the ring a 1,3-cyclohexadiene. So the ring now has two double bonds. So each double bond is a separate contributor to the index.

So the product's structure would have:

- Two double bonds in the ring, making that part two contributions.

- The vinyl substituent's double bond (another one).

So that's three double bonds, plus the ring (but wait, the ring itself is just a single ring, so that's one contribution). Wait, no, the ring is a six-membered ring, which is one ring. So the index is the number of double bonds plus the number of rings.

Wait, each ring and each double bond adds 1 to the index. So:

Number of rings = 1.

Number of double bonds = 3 (two in the ring and one in the vinyl group).

So index = 1 + 3 = 4.

But the options don't have 4. So I must be making a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternative approach: perhaps the reaction doesn't add a double bond but removes one. Let's think again. Maybe the reaction is a reduction. Wait, red phosphorus and HI could be a reducing agent. For instance, the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes, using Zn(Hg)/HCl, but red phosphorus and HI might be a different system. Or perhaps it's the hydroboration reaction, but that uses BH3.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, adding HI to the double bonds. But that would lead to more substitution, not elimination.

Wait, when you have a carbonyl group and treat it with HI, it might undergo addition. For example, a ketone or aldehyde could add HI, leading to a diiodide. Alternatively, red phosphorus in HI is used in the von Braun degradation, which converts carbonyl groups into methylene groups. Wait, von Braun degradation uses a mixture of HI and red phosphorus to convert carbonyl groups into CH₂ groups. So the RCHO becomes RCH₂I, but perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, if the formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH₂I, then the product would have a CH₂I group attached, which doesn't add a double bond. So the product would no longer have the formyl's carbonyl as a double bond, but as a CH₂I group. So the starting material has:

- One ring double bond.

- One vinyl double bond.

- One formyl double bond (C=O).

After reaction:

- The formyl becomes CH₂I, so that double bond is gone.

So the product would have:

- One ring double bond.

- One vinyl double bond.

So total double bonds: two. Rings: one.

So index would be 3 (two double bonds + one ring).

Wait, that gives an index of 3, which is option B. But wait, let's think about the product structure.

Wait, perhaps the von Braun degradation converts the carbonyl group (CHO) into CH₂I. So the product would have a CH₂I group at position 2, the vinyl group at position 5, and the ring remains with its double bond. So:

- The ring has one double bond (so 1).

- The vinyl group has one double bond (so another 1).

- The formyl group is gone, replaced by CH₂I (no double bond).

So total double bonds: two. Rings: one. So index = 1 (ring) + 2 (double bonds) = 3. That would be option B.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the reaction was a Wittig which forms a new double bond. So why would it be a von Braun degradation instead?

Ah, the von Braun degradation is when a carbonyl group is treated with red phosphorus and HI, leading to the conversion of the carbonyl (RCHO) into RCH₂I. So this reaction would eliminate the carbonyl's double bond (the C=O) and replace it with a CH₂I group, which doesn't have a double bond. So the product would have one less double bond than the starting material.

Wait, but let me confirm: starting material has three double bonds (ring, vinyl, formyl), so index 3. After reaction, the formyl's double bond is gone, so two double bonds (ring and vinyl), plus the ring. So index 3 (2+1=3). So the product's index would be 3, which is option B.

But wait, the question is about the index of the product. So if the product has two double bonds and one ring, that's 3. So the answer would be B)3.

Alternatively, if the reaction forms a new double bond, then the index would be higher. But if the reaction replaces a double bond (the formyl's C=O) with a single bond (CH₂I), then the index decreases by one. Wait, let me recount the starting material's index.

Starting material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (cyclohexene), a formyl group (CHO, which is a carbonyl, so double bond), and a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-, another double bond). So the starting material has three double bonds (ring, formyl, vinyl) and one ring. So index = 3 (double bonds) + 1 (ring) = 4.

After the reaction, if the formyl is converted to CH₂I, then the product has two double bonds (ring, vinyl) and one ring. So index = 2 +1 = 3.

Thus, the correct answer would be B)3.

But wait, the product also has the carboxylic acid group. Oh, but in the reaction, are other groups affected? The reaction is with excess HI and red phosphorus. The carboxylic acid (COOH) group is at position, let's say, position 6. Would that react?

Carboxylic acids can react with HI. For example, they can undergo acid-base reactions, but I'm not sure they would undergo the von Braun degradation. Wait, the von Braun degradation specifically targets aldehydes and ketones. So the carboxylic acid group (COOH) might not react under these conditions. So the COOH group remains as is. So the product would still have that group.

So, in the product, the COOH group is present, but the formyl group is converted to CH₂I. So the only double bonds present are in the ring and the vinyl group. Therefore, the index is 3 (two double bonds and one ring).

So the correct answer is B)3.


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency for the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The reaction conditions suggest a von Braun degradation, where a carbonyl group (RCHO) is converted into a CH₂I group, eliminating the carbonyl double bond.

### Analysis of the Starting Material
The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following structural features:
1. A six-membered cyclohexene ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.
2. A formyl group (CHO) at position 2, contributing a carbonyl double bond.
3. A vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) at position 5, contributing another double bond.

The index of hydrogen deficiency for the starting material is calculated as:
- **Rings**: 1 (from the cyclohexene ring).
- **Double bonds**: 3 (one from the ring, one from the formyl group, and one from the vinyl group).

Thus, the starting material has an index of hydrogen deficiency of **4**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI
The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is a von Braun degradation, which converts the formyl group (CHO) into a CH₂I group. This reaction eliminates the carbonyl double bond (C=O) from the starting material. The other double bonds in the ring and the vinyl group remain unaffected.

### Structure of the Product
After the reaction:
1. The cyclohexene ring retains its double bond between carbons 3 and 4.
2. The vinyl group at position 5 retains its double bond.
3. The formyl group at position 2 is converted into a CH₂I group, eliminating the carbonyl double bond.

The product has:
- **Rings**: 1 (from the cyclohexene ring).
- **Double bonds**: 2 (one from the ring and one from the vinyl group).

### Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product
The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as:
\[
\text{Index} = \text{Number of rings} + \text{Number of double bonds}
\]
\[
\text{Index} = 1 + 2 = 3
\]

Thus, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **3**.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B) 3**.

Answer: B
