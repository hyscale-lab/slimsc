Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll do my best.

So, the question is about two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and their periods are given as 2 years and 1 year respectively. The period is the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Then, there's some spectroscopic data about radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. And the masses are the sum of the two stars in each system.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity curves (those sine variations) relate to the velocities of the two stars orbiting each other. But wait, the velocities depend on the masses of the stars because of Kepler's laws. Oh right, the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, so maybe a smaller velocity amplitude.

Wait, in a binary system, both stars orbit around their common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, and the less massive will have a larger orbit. So, the velocity amplitudes (RV) are inversely proportional to their masses. Because if one star is more massive, it moves less, so its velocity is lower.

So, the ratio of the velocities of the two stars in a system should be inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses. Let me think: if star A has mass M_A and star B has M_B, then their velocities V_A and V_B should satisfy V_A / V_B = M_B / M_A. Because the center of mass is where M_A * a_A = M_B * a_B, where a is the orbital radius. And since velocity is proportional to angular velocity times radius (v = Ï‰ a), the velocities would also be in the same ratio as a_A and a_B. So, V_A = (M_B/(M_A + M_B)) * V_total, and V_B = (M_A/(M_A + M_B)) * V_total. Wait, I'm not sure, maybe I should think in terms of mass function or Kepler's third law.

Alternatively, I think the
