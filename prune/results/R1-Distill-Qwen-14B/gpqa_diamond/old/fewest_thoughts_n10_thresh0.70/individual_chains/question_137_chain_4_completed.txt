Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators. The question is about how many revolutions a proton makes as it's accelerated from negligible kinetic energy to 950 MeV. 

Let me try to break it down. The initial kinetic energy T is almost zero, so we can ignore it. The final kinetic energy is 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t)=U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where U0 is 190 kV and Φ0 is π/4.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how synchrocyclotrons work. I know that in a cyclotron, charged particles move in a magnetic field and are accelerated by an electric field. The key point is that the cyclotron frequency is used to synchronize the electric field so that the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the electric field region. But wait, isn't a synchrocyclotron different in that it has a varying magnetic field? Or was that another type? Oh, right, the regular cyclotron uses a fixed magnetic field, but the particles' frequency changes as their mass increases relativistically. Synchrocyclotron adjusts the magnetic field to keep the cyclotron frequency constant, which allows for more efficient acceleration. But maybe that's not directly relevant here.

The problem is about the number of revolutions. Let's think about the energy gain. Each time the proton goes around, it's accelerated by the voltage. So the kinetic energy increases by the voltage each revolution. Wait, but the voltage is time-dependent. Oh, but maybe in a synchrocyclotron, the voltage is synchronized with the proton's motion so that each time it passes through the acceleration gap, it gets a kick of voltage U0. But wait, the given voltage is an alternating voltage, so maybe the effective voltage per revolution is the peak voltage divided by something?

Wait, the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where ν(α) is the frequency. But wait, in a cyclotron, the frequency depends on the velocity and the magnetic field. But in a synchrocyclotron, they adjust the magnetic field so that the cyclotron frequency remains the same as the driving frequency. So the acceleration happens once per revolution, right? So each time the proton goes around, it gains an energy of about U0, but considering the actual voltage.

Wait, but the voltage is time-dependent. Oh wait, no, the time dependence is perhaps because of the varying frequency? Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. In the problem, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν(α) t + Φ0]. Hmm, but the way the problem is worded, the frequency ν(α) might be the same as the cyclotron frequency adjusted for the changing mass. So each time the proton completes a revolution, it's accelerated once by the peak voltage. Or does it get a varying voltage each time?

Alternatively, perhaps the average energy gained per revolution is a certain value. I'm a bit uncertain here. Let me try to recall some formulas.

The kinetic energy gained in each revolution in a cyclotron is given by the product of the voltage and the charge. For a proton, charge is e. So each revolution, it gains e * U0. But wait, the voltage here is an alternating voltage, so the maximum voltage is U0. So perhaps the energy gain per revolution is e * U0, but considering the phase as well.

Wait, no. Because the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(...), so the maximum is U0, but the phase shift might affect whether the acceleration is in the same direction each time.

Wait, but in a cyclotron, the electric field is applied in a way that the protons are accelerated when moving through the gap between the dees. The electric field is set up so that when the proton is moving through the gap, the field is in the direction that accelerates it. So perhaps the effective voltage per revolution is U0, because the field is applied in phase with the motion.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think step by step.

First, the kinetic energy of the proton is given as T1 = 950 MeV. The initial energy is negligible, so the proton starts from rest. The energy gained should come from the work done by the electric field, which is the integral of the voltage over time multiplied by the charge, but perhaps that's getting too detailed.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the number of revolutions using the energy gained and the energy per revolution.

So, the total energy gained by the proton is T1 = 950 MeV. Each revolution, the proton gains e*U0, because the maximum voltage is U0. But wait, protons are accelerated every half-cycle, perhaps? So each time they go around once, they get a kick of eU0. So the total number of revolutions N would be T / (e U0), where T is the kinetic energy.

But wait, the voltage given is U(t) = U0 cos(...), so the peak voltage is U0. Since each half-cycle, the voltage changes direction. But in a cyclotron, the particles are accelerated once per revolution because the electric field is applied in the region where they're moving. So perhaps the energy per revolution is e U0.

Wait, but the voltage is applied as a function of time, so the average energy per revolution might not be exactly e U0. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: in a cyclotron, the time for each revolution is T = (2π m)/(qB), but as the particle gains energy and its velocity increases, the magnetic rigidity qB remains constant if the magnetic field is fixed. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is adjusted to keep the cyclotron frequency constant. So, the time for each revolution remains the same, but the speed increases. Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases as the particle's momentum increases so that the cyclotron frequency remains fixed.

But maybe the exact details of how the magnetic field varies aren't needed for this problem. Let me think about the energy gain.

Each time the proton goes around, it's accelerated once by the voltage. The energy gained per revolution is e*U0. Because the maximum voltage is U0, so each time, the proton gets a kick of U0. So the number of revolutions N would be T1/(e U0).

Wait, but the phase factor Φ0 is given as π/4. Does that affect the energy gain? Hmm, because the voltage starts at U0 cos(π/4), which is U0 * sqrt(2)/2. So the initial voltage is lower than U0. But since the proton is starting with zero velocity, the first acceleration is partial. So perhaps each revolution doesn't contribute exactly U0 * e, but an average.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective voltage is U0 / 2. Because the cosine function has an average value of zero, but the maximum is U0, so the peak is achieved after a certain time. But wait, the problem states that the proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so it's starting from rest. So the initial acceleration would be based on the initial phase. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find the number of oscillations, or revolutions, the proton makes until it reaches the desired energy. The energy per revolution is perhaps e*U0, so N = T1/(e*U0).

Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:
T1 = 950 MeV
U0 = 190 kV = 190,000 V
e = 1.602e-19 C

Compute N = T1 / (e U0)

But wait, let me compute that.

First, T1 = 950 MeV = 950e6 eV

e U0 = (1.602e-19 C) * (190e3 V) = 1.602e-19 * 190e3 = 1.602e-19 * 1.9e5 = let's compute that.

1.602e-19 * 1.9e5 = 3.0438e-14 eV? Wait, no. Wait, 1 eV is 1 Volt * elementary charge. So e*U0 in eV is U0 * e in eV is actually U0 * (1 eV / 1 V) * (since eV = e * V). So e*U0 in eV is U0 * 1 eV per volt? Because e is 1.6e-19 C, and 1 eV = 1 C * 1 V. So e*U0 (in eV) is U0 * 1 eV per V. So for U0=190 kV, that's 190,000 V. So e*U0 = 190,000 eV = 190 keV.

Wait, but wait. The energy per revolution would be e * U0, which is 190 keV per revolution.

So the number of revolutions N is T1 / (e U0) = 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV per revolution.

Wait, 950e6 / 190e3 = 950e3 / 190 = 5000.

Wait, 190e3 is 190,000 eV. 950e6 is 950,000,000 eV.

So 950,000,000 / 190,000 = (950,000,000) / (190,000) = 950,000,000 / 1.9e5 = (950e3) / 1.9e3) = 950 / 1.9 = 500.

Wait, that's 500 revolutions. But that's not one of the options. The options are 1864, 5300, 3536, 2500. Hmm, 500 isn't an option. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute N again.

T1 is 950 MeV = 950e6 eV.

Each revolution gives e * U0 = 190,000 eV.

So N = 950e6 / 190e3 = (950e6) / (190e3) = (950 / 190) * (1e6 / 1e3) = 5 * 1e3 = 5000.

Ah, wait, because 950e6 is 950,000,000 eV, and 190e3 is 190,000 eV. So 950,000,000 / 190,000 = 950,000,000 / 190,000.

Let me compute that: 950,000,000 divided by 190,000.

Well, 190,000 * 5,000 = 950,000,000. Because 190,000 *5 = 950,000. So 190,000 *5000 = 950,000 * 1000 = 950,000,000. So N=5000.

But looking at the options, option B is 5300, which is close to 5000. But why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating e*U0. Let me recheck.

U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts. The charge of a proton is e = 1.602e-19 C. So e * U0 is 1.602e-19 C * 190e3 V.

Calculating that in joules: 1.602e-19 * 190e3 = 1.602e-19 * 1.9e5 = (1.602 * 1.9) * 1e-14 = approx 3.0438e-14 J.

But 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so to convert joules to eV:

3.0438e-14 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 190,000 eV. So yes, 190 keV per revolution.

So the calculation was correct. So N=5000. But the options don't have 5000; the closest is option B:5300.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Because in a cyclotron, the particles are accelerated every half-revolution, right? Because the electric field alternates direction each half-cycle, but the phase is such that acceleration happens every full revolution. Wait, no, in a cyclotron, the electric field is applied in such a way that the particle is accelerated once per full revolution. Or perhaps considering the phase shift, maybe the protons are accelerated twice per cycle? Hmm.

Wait, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(...). The period of the voltage is T_v = 1/ν(α). And the period of the proton's motion is T_r = 1/(f), where f is the cyclotron frequency.

In a synchrocyclotron, the cyclotron frequency f is kept constant by varying the magnetic field. So each time the proton goes around, it's accelerated once by the voltage. So each revolution contributes e*U0 per revolution.

But wait, perhaps the effective voltage is U0 / 2. Because the voltage alternates, so over a full cycle, the average voltage is zero, but the peak is U0. Alternatively, the effective acceleration is based on the root mean square (RMS) voltage.

Wait, but the acceleration is not based on RMS. Because the particles are only accelerated when the voltage is at the right phase. So the maximum voltage is U0, and it's applied once per revolution.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the peak voltage. So each revolution, the proton gains e U0.

Wait, but the initial phase is Phi_0 = pi/4. So the initial voltage is U0 cos(pi/4) = U0 * 0.707. So the first acceleration isn't the maximum. But since the proton starts with negligible energy, the initial acceleration is only partial. However, for a large number of revolutions, does the initial phase affect the total number significantly?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial phase is negligible, and the total number is still T1/(e U0), which is 5000. But since none of the options match exactly, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: the time taken for each revolution is T_r. The time taken to reach 950 MeV would be the number of revolutions multiplied by T_r. But I'm not sure how that would help without knowing T_r.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing the energy per revolution. Let me think about relativistic effects. The question states that the proton is injected at negligible kinetic energy, implying non-relativistic initially, but as it gains energy, it might become relativistic.

Wait, 950 MeV is a lot. For a proton, the rest mass is about 938 MeV/c². So the kinetic energy is approximately equal to the total energy when it's close to the speed of light.

But in terms of how that affects the acceleration, perhaps the acceleration voltage per revolution is e U0, but the frequency depends on the velocity. Wait, but synchrocyclotrons adjust the magnetic field to keep the cyclotron frequency fixed, so the time per revolution remains the same as the frequency of the applied voltage.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the number of revolutions as T1/(e U0) as I did before. But that gives 5000, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy per revolution is e * U0 * sqrt(2)/2, because the initial phase is pi/4. So the first kick is U0 * cos(pi/4), which is U0 * sqrt(2)/2. But for the rest of the kicks, the phase might align to give maximum acceleration. But for a large number of revolutions, maybe the average is around U0 * something.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase Phi_0 is a red herring because the problem states that the proton is injected at t=0, and the phase is pi/4. But maybe the effective voltage is U0 * cos(phi_0) for the first acceleration, and then the subsequent ones are at maximum.

But that complicates things a lot. Let me think: the initial voltage is U(t=0) = U0 cos(Phi_0) = U0 cos(pi/4) = 0.707 * U0. So the first acceleration is e * 0.707 U0. Then, each subsequent revolution the phase increases by 2 pi each time. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the voltage is applied in such a way that each time the proton comes to the acceleration gap, the phase is such that the voltage is positive. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, if the cyclotron is designed so that the voltage is in phase with the proton's position for maximum acceleration each time.

But perhaps the initial phase affects the first few revolutions but not the total number by much. For example, the first few revolutions might contribute less, but the majority would contribute the maximum. So perhaps the average is still close to e U0.

Wait, but again, the calculation leads to N=5000, which isn't an option. The options have C) 3536 and D)2500. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the energy per revolution is (e U0)^2 / (2 m), but that's for non-relativistic speeds. But the problem states that the final energy is 950 MeV, which is much higher than the rest mass of the proton (about 938 MeV). So it's a relativistic case, and the energy calculation can't be treated as non-relativistic.

Hmm. Another approach: the kinetic energy gained per revolution is the work done by the electric field. The electric field does work when the proton is moving through the gap. The average electric field is E_avg = U0 / d, where d is the gap distance. But maybe that's too vague.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to model the energy gain as proportional to the integral of the voltage over time, but that seems complicated.

Wait, another thought: the formula for the number of revolutions in a cyclotron is N = (2 m T)/(e^2 B^2 U0). But I don't have B here. Alternatively, perhaps in synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions is determined by the ratio of the kinetic energy to the product of e and U0.

But I'm stuck, so perhaps I should look for alternative reasoning. Let me think about the options given. The options are A)1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Earlier calculation gave me N=5000, which is close to option B (5300). Perhaps the correct answer is B. But why the discrepancy?

Wait, maybe I forgot that each revolution gives two accelerations. Because in a cyclotron, the electric field is applied in both D-shaped regions, so the proton is accelerated twice per revolution. So the energy gain per revolution is 2 e U0. Then N would be T1/(2 e U0) = 950e6 / (2 *190e3) = 950e3 / (2*190) = (950 / 380) * 1e3. 950 divided by 380 is about 2.5. So 2.5 *1e3=2500. Which is option D.

Wait, that makes sense. So if each revolution gives two accelerations, each of e U0, then per revolution, the proton gains 2 e U0. So the number of revolutions N is T1/(2 e U0).

Let me compute that.

T1 = 950e6 eV
e U0 = 190e3 eV
So 2 e U0 = 380e3 eV
N = 950e6 / 380e3 = 950e3 / 380 = (950 / 380) * 1e3.

950 divided by 380: 380 *2=760; 950-760=190; 190 is exactly 0.5 *380. So 2.5.

So N=2.5e3=2500, which is option D.

Ah, that makes sense. So each revolution, the proton is accelerated twice, once in each D-shaped region, so that each revolution contributes 2 e U0 to the kinetic energy. So with that, N becomes 2500.

But wait, why would a synchrocyclotron have two accelerations per revolution? Oh, because the protons pass through the acceleration gap twice per revolution, once in each of the two D's. So each time they go through the gap, they get a kick. So two kicks per revolution. So yes, that would double the energy per revolution.

So the correct number of revolutions would be 2500, which is option D.


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain per revolution and the total kinetic energy imparted to the proton. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (\(T \simeq 0\)) and is accelerated to a final kinetic energy of \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). The alternating voltage applied is given by:

\[
U(t) = U_0 \cos\left[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0\right],
\]

where \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Energy Gain Per Revolution**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton is accelerated twice per revolution, once in each of the two "D"-shaped regions. Each acceleration provides an energy gain of \(eU_0\), where \(e\) is the elementary charge and \(U_0\) is the peak voltage. Therefore, the total energy gain per revolution is:

   \[
   \Delta E = 2eU_0.
   \]

   Substituting \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} = 190,000 \, \text{V}\), the energy gain per revolution is:

   \[
   \Delta E = 2 \times 190,000 \, \text{eV} = 380,000 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Total Number of Revolutions**:  
   The total number of revolutions \(N\) is the total kinetic energy \(T_1\) divided by the energy gain per revolution \(\Delta E\):

   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{\Delta E}.
   \]

   Substituting \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000,000 \, \text{eV}\) and \(\Delta E = 380,000 \, \text{eV}\):

   \[
   N = \frac{950,000,000}{380,000} = 2500.
   \]

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The proton makes **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron. This matches option D.

Answer: D
