Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about the key factor that allows converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. The options are A through D. I remember that when dealing with matrix exponentials, especially in the context of solving systems of equations, the way the matrix is handled can affect the algorithm's parallelism.

So, the problem mentions using higher-order finite differences and parallel splitting. I think parallel splitting refers to methods like the Parareal algorithm or other time-parallel methods. These methods try to compute different time steps simultaneously, which speeds things up.

Matrix exponential functions are crucial in solving systems of ODEs, which often come up in PDEs when using methods like the method of lines. Approximating these exponentials can be tricky, and the choice of approximation affects the algorithm's structure.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's about ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up or become inaccurate. But does it directly relate to making the algorithm parallel? Maybe indirectly, but I'm not sure it's the key factor here.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions can complicate things, but I'm not immediately seeing the connection to parallelism. If the boundaries are nonlocal, maybe it affects how the matrix is set up, but I'm not sure that's the main point for parallel algorithms.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Fractional approximation methods, like those using Padé approximants, approximate the matrix exponential by a rational function. If those approximations have complex roots, that might affect the factorization of the matrix, which is important for parallel computing. Because if the matrix can be split into independent parts, you can compute them in parallel.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fractions can break down a rational function into simpler terms, which might allow for parallel computation. For instance, if you can split the matrix into diagonal blocks or something that can be handled independently, that's perfect for parallel processing.

Wait, the question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. I think it's about how the approximation allows for the matrix to be decomposed in a way that can be processed in parallel. 

Fractional approximation methods, such as Padé approximations, can be represented as a rational function, which is a ratio of two polynomials. If this leads to a matrix that can be split into lower-dimensional components, each handled on a different processor, then the algorithm becomes parallel.

Option D says "linear partial fraction of fractional approximation." Hmm, partial fractions break down a complex fraction into simpler terms. If the approximation can be decomposed into a sum of simpler matrices, each of which can be exponentiated independently, that would allow for parallel computation. Because each term could be computed on a different processor and then combined at the end.

Alternatively, complex roots (option C) might affect how the matrix is diagonalized or decomposed. If the matrix has complex roots, it might lead to a different kind of approximation which is more amenable to parallel splitting. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused here.

Another angle: In the context of parallel-in-time methods, the key is often the ability to split the time integration into independent parts. For example, in the Parareal method, you have coarse and fine propagators. The approximation of the matrix exponential allows for this splitting. If the approximation can be expressed as a sum of terms that don't interfere with each other across time steps, you can compute them in parallel.

So, if the fractional approximation can be linearly partially fractioned, perhaps each term can be handled in parallel. That would make D a candidate.

Wait, what's a linear partial fraction? Oh, right, partial fraction decomposition is a method where a rational function is written
