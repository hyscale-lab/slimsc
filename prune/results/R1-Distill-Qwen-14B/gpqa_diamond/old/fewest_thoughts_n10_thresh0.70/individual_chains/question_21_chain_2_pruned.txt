Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and some specific compounds. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct pair.

First, let's tackle part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Hmm, I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a double bond. For example, in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydrogens, like in carbonyl groups, tautomerism can occur, such as in enols and ketones.

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, right? So it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. Now, can this undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism usually requires adjacent hydrogen atoms and double bonds. But in benzoquinone, each ketone is on a benzene ring. Each O is double-bonded to C, but the adjacent C (on the ring) doesn't have H because in a benzene ring, each C is bonded to another C. Wait, unless there are alpha hydrogens. Wait, quinones are generally without alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. So they can't tautomerize because there's no H to shift. That rings a bell. Benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens, so it can't undergo tautomerism. So benzoquinone is not tautomerizable.

Then, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. Let me visualize it. Each ketone is at every other carbon. So, the structure has three O's in a symmetric position.

Does this compound have alpha hydrogens? Let's see. Each ketone is at C1, C3, C5. The adjacent carbons (like
