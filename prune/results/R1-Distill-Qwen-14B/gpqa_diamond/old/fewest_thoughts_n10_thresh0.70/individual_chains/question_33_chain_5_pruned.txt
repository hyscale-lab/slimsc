Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione under heat. I need to find the exo product from the given options.

First, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are Diels-Alder reactions. The Diels-Alder is a [4π + 2π] pericyclic reaction, so one molecule acts as the diene and the other as the dienophile. The product forms a six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds.

Looking at the reactants, 2,5-dimethylthiophene is a thiophene ring with methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. Furan-2,5-dione is another name for 2,5-furandione, which is an electron-deficient dienophile because the two ketone groups pull electrons away from the ring, making it a good dienophile.

Wait, no, wait. In Diels-Alder, the diene is usually the conjugated diene (like 1,3-diene), and the dienophile is an electron-deficient molecule, right. So in this reaction, which one is the diene and which is the dienophile?

2,5-dimethylthiophene is a five-membered ring, so it's not a diene. Furan-2,5-dione has a conjugated dienophilic double bond? Wait, furan is a diene, but with two ketone groups, which make it an electron-deficient dienophile. So maybe in this case, furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile, and the diene is something else. Wait, but 2,5-dimethylthiophene is a thiophene, which is an aromatic five-membered ring with sulfur. It's not a diene. So wait, maybe the diene is something else here? Or am I thinking about it wrong.

Wait, no, sometimes the Diels-Alder can involve a
