Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nuclear fission. Hmm, let me read it again and think through what I know.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I'm supposed to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, okay. So initially, the nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, their momenta must cancel each other out. So, the momentum of the more massive fragment (which is larger) must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the lighter fragment.

But wait, the rest masses are given in terms of their sum. The sum is 99% of M. So, let me denote the rest masses.

Let me call the masses of the two fragments m1 and m2. The problem states that m1 = 2 m2. And m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum equation:

2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M => 3 m2 = 0.99 M => m2 = (0.9

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the classical approximation of that.

Wait, the classical approximation usually refers to non-relativistic mechanics, right? So I need to calculate T1 the correct way and then subtract the non-relativistic T1 from it, or vice versa? The question asks for the difference between the correct value and the classical one. So if the correct is higher, then the difference would be positive.

Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, initial nucleus: rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M is the rest mass, and since energy is 300 GeV, M = 300 GeV / c². But maybe I don't need to calculate M directly because we can work with mass ratios.

After fission, two fragments: one is twice as massive as the other. Let me denote the rest masses. Let’s say the smaller one has rest mass m, so the larger is 2m. The total rest mass after is 3m.
