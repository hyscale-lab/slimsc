Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the three dissociation constants for H3PO4: Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3, Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8, and Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in the solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So the options are all in the order of 1e-7 M, which is pretty low.

Wait, let me think about the compounds involved. KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, I think. When it dissolves, it should give Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. But wait, the dihydrate part probably just affects the molar mass but doesn't change the ions it produces once dissolved.

So we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. Now, these are buffer solutions because they're a weak acid and its conjugate base. Or wait, actually, H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (since H3PO4 is a triprotic acid), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-. So the solution should have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which might form a buffer.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.
