Okay, so I have this physics question about nuclear interactions and approximations. Hmm, I need to figure out which assumptions lead to the impulse approximation. Let me think.

The question says the impulse approximation assumes that nucleons behave like free particles. So, the idea is that each nucleon interacts independently without much effect from the others. I remember that in the impulse approximation, the nucleus is treated as a collection of free nucleons, and each one interacts with the external field or force as if it's separate.

Looking at the options, each of the four assumptions is numbered 1 to 4. The options combine these into groups. I need to see which group jointly implies the impulse approximation.

Let me go through each assumption one by one.

1. Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. That makes sense because if the interaction is only with individual nucleons, then each can be treated separately. So this supports the impulse approximation.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, transparent? Oh, I think this refers to the idea that during the interaction, other nucleons don't contribute or don't affect the process much. So, when a particle interacts with the nucleus, it only interacts with one nucleon and the rest are like transparentâ€”so they don't participate. That would imply that each nucleon behaves as if it's free because the others aren't affecting it during the interaction. So this would support the approximation.

3. The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, non-relativistic quarks. I'm not sure how this ties in. If the quarks are non-relativistic, that might imply that the internal structure of the nucleon isn't too complicated. Wait, but in the impulse approximation, we treat the nucleon as a point particle, right? So if the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe their internal dynamics are not considered, so the nucleon behaves like a free particle. Not entirely sure about this one.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, right. If the nucleon isn't bound, it's like it's free. So during the interaction, the binding forces (like the strong nuclear force holding the nucleus together) are ignored. So the nucleon moves as if it's not part of the nucleus anymore, hence acting like a free particle. This definitely supports the impulse approximation.

Now, the question is which combination of these assumptions imply the impulse approximation. The options are A to D.

Let me look at each option:

Option A) 1,2,4: So only 3 is excluded. So all three assumptions here support the impulse. Wait, but what about 3?

Option B) 2,3,4: So includes 3, which I'm not sure about.

Option C) 1,2,3: Includes 3 but not 4.

Option D) 1,3,4: Includes 3 and 4, but not 2.

Wait, but according to the impulse approximation, the key points are that each nucleon interacts independently (assumption 1), the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect the interaction (assumption 2), and that the nucleons aren't bound during the interaction (assumption 4). So 1,2,4.

But what about assumption 3? If the quarks are non-relativistic, does that contribute to the approximation? Well, the impulse approximation is more about treating the nucleons as free and not considering their internal structure. So if the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe their internal dynamics are simpler, but I'm not sure if that's a necessary condition for the impulse approximation.

Wait, the question is which assumptions jointly imply the approximation. So all of them in the group must be correct.

So, the impulse approximation requires that each nucleon interacts individually (1), the nucleus is otherwise transparent (2), and the selected nucleon is not bound (4). So the group would be 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option A is 1,2,4. So that would be the correct group.


The impulse approximation assumes that nucleons in a nucleus behave as free particles, interacting independently without significant influence from the rest of the nucleus or binding forces. To determine which assumptions jointly imply this approximation, let us analyze each assumption:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons**: This supports the impulse approximation because it implies that each nucleon can be treated independently during the interaction.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon**: This assumption aligns with the impulse approximation, as it suggests that other nucleons do not significantly affect the interaction, effectively making the nucleus transparent except for the selected nucleon.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic**: While this assumption simplifies the internal dynamics of the nucleon, it is not directly necessary for the impulse approximation, which primarily focuses on treating nucleons as free particles rather than their internal structure.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces**: This assumption is critical for the impulse approximation, as it implies that the nucleon is not bound to the nucleus during the interaction, allowing it to behave like a free particle.

From this analysis, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are **1, 2, and 4**. These assumptions ensure that nucleons interact independently, the rest of the nucleus is transparent, and the nucleons are free from binding forces. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
