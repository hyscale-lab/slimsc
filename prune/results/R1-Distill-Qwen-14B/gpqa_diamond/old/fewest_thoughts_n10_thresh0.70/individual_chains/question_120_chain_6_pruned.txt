Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. The formula is distance = 1 / parallax. So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. If another has 0.5, it's 2 parsecs away, and so on.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution in what sense? I think it's uniform in space, meaning the number density of stars is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume of space doesn't depend on where you are in that volume.

But wait, how does parallax come into play here? Parallax is a measure of distance. So, if stars are spread out uniformly, the number of stars at a particular distance should depend on the volume of space they occupy.

Let's model this. Suppose we have a thin spherical shell at a distance d from us. The volume of that shell would be the surface area times a small thickness. Surface area is 4πd². Thickness would be the change in distance, say dd. So the volume element dV is 4πd² dd.

If the number density of stars is n (stars per cubic parsec), then the number of stars in this shell would be n * dV. But since we're looking for per unit range of parallax, we need to relate d to parallax plx.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The change in parallax, delta plx, would correspond to a change in d. Let me think about how plx relates to d. If plx increases, d decreases, because plx is inversely proportional to d.

So, if we're considering a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, how does this translate to d?

Hmm, since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. The differential dd is - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because d is 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases.

But for the purposes of counting stars, direction might not matter, so maybe I can take the absolute value. So dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, so the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π d² dd, which is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx). Because d is 1/plx, so d squared is (1/plx)^2. And dd is (1/plx²) dplx.

Putting it together: dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in this shell, which is a thin slice in plx, would be the number density n multiplied by dV. So N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So the number per unit plx (dplx) would be (n * 4π) / plx^4. That would mean the number of stars per unit plx range is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the count goes down as plx increases, which makes sense because higher plx (smaller distance) would mean more stars in a given plx range? Or wait, no—wait, wait.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the variables. Let me think again. The
