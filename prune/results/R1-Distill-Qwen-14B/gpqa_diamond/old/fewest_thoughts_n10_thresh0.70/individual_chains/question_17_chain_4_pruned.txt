Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where they form a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember from my studies that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium pretty tightly.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Also, the temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. Oh wait, the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So, I think the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, but what's the actual formula? I think EDTA has a charge of 4- when it's in its deprotonated form, which is probably what's happening here because the pH is ideal. So, the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2- with K being 5e10.

Wait, the formation constant K is the product of the concentrations of the products over the reactants. So, K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]).

But in this case, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. That means [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, right? Because each mole of complex comes from one mole of Ca²+ and one of EDTA^4-.

So, plugging into the equation: 5e10 = 0.02 / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, what about the concentrations of EDTA^4- and Ca²+? Oh, because the complex is formed, the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- should be very low. The problem is asking for [Ca²+], so I need to find that.

But I'm a bit confused about the stoichiometry here. Let me think. The complex is Ca-EDTA, so for every mole of complex, there's
