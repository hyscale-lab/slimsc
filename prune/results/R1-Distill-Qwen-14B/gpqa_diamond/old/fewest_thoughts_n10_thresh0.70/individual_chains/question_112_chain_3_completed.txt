Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which is S_z. But the question is about another operator whose matrix elements are given by Aij. The operator A, I think, is such that Aij is hbar/2 when i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. So it's a 2x2 matrix, right? Because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, so two states.

Wait, let me write that matrix down. For a 2x2 matrix, the indices go from 1 to 2. So A_12 and A_21 would be hbar/2, and the diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are zero. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0   hbar/2
  hbar/2  0 ]

Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So this operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Wait, but what is the operator used for? Oh, the question is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. And then find the average value of the operator.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of operator A. Because to find the probabilities, I have to express the state |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, if the operator A has eigenstates |+> and |->, maybe orthogonal, then the probability of measuring each eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of |+> and |-> in |alpha>.

But wait, maybe it's easier to diagonalize the operator A first. Let me think.

The operator A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of A as well, since it's just a scalar multiple. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), so eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are the states |+x> and |−x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. The standard eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but wait, actually, let me double-check. The x spin eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, no, wait: for sigma_x, I think the eigenstates are |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|0> − |1>)/sqrt(2), but in our case, |up> and |down> are probably the |0> and |1> states. So yeah, same thing.

Wait, maybe I should write |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Because then the coefficients will give the probabilities.

But wait, the state |alpha> is given. But it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So first, I have to normalize it. Because the coefficients have a magnitude, and the total squared magnitude should be 1.

Wait, the state |alpha> is proportional to that sum. So to get the actual state, I need to divide by the normalization factor, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

So the coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down>.

The magnitude squared for (1+i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Similarly, for (2 -i), the magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the normalization factor is sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |−x>, because A is proportional to sigma_x.

Wait, let me recall: |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me denote |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>.

So, substituting the expressions for |+x> and |−x>:

c_+ [ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ] + c_- [ (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

Comparing this to |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So equate the coefficients:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) ) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)

( c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) ) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Now, we can write these as two equations:

Equation 1: c_+ + c_- = (1 + i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) / 1 ?

Wait, wait, let me rearrange:

(c_+ + c_-) = (1+i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
(c_+ - c_-) = (2 -i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Wait, because:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7) → c_+ + c_- = (1+i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Similarly, ( c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7) → c_+ - c_- = (2 - i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

So now we have two equations:

1) c_+ + c_- = (1+i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
2) c_+ - c_- = (2 - i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

We can solve for c_+ and c_-.

Let me add equations 1 and 2:

(1) + (2): 2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Simplify the bracket: 1 + i + 2 -i = 3.

So 2 c_+ = 3 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → c_+ = (3/2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)).

Similarly, subtract equation (2) from (1):

(1) - (2): 2 c_- = [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Simplify the bracket: 1 +i -2 +i = (-1 + 2i)

So 2 c_- = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → c_- = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check the algebra again.

Wait, let's compute (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3. That's correct.

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i. Correct.

So, c_+ = [3] * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

And c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) ] * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

So now, the coefficients c_+ and c_- are known.

The probability of measuring the eigenvalue corresponding to |+x> is |c_+|^2, and similarly for |c_-|^2.

So let's compute |c_+|² and |c_-|².

First, c_+ = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)).

So |c_+|² = (9 * 2) / (4 *7) ) → (18)/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428.

Then |c_-|² is | [ (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ] |^2.

The magnitude of (-1 + 2i) is sqrt( ( -1 )^2 + (2)^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4) = sqrt(5).

So |c_-|^2 = (5) * (2) / (4*7) ) → (10)/(28) = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, 5/14 is about 0.357.

Wait, but wait 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 =1, so that's correct.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428 and 5/14 is about 0.3571, which sum to 1.

But looking at the options, I don't see 9/14 and 5/14. Let's check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 → close to 0.6428 and 0.3571, so 0.64 and 0.36.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 → that's way off.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72 → No.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46 → No.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. That's option A's first two numbers.

Wait, but let me check the exact fractions.

Wait, 9/14 is exactly 0.642857..., which is ~0.643, which is closer to 0.64 than 0.6428 is. But the options have 0.64 and 0.36, which would be 0.64 and 0.36. So that's option A's first part.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The average value is ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, and the probabilities p1 and p2 for each, then the average is (p1*(hbar/2)) + (p2*(-hbar/2))).

Which is [ (9/14) * (hbar/2) ) ] + [ (5/14) * (-hbar/2) ) ]

= (9/14 -5/14) * (hbar/2 )

= (4/14) * (hbar/2 )

= (2/7) * hbar/2 → hbar/(7).

Wait, that's hbar/7.

Wait, but let me compute that again:

p1 = 9/14, p2=5/14.

So average = p1*(hbar/2) + p2*(-hbar/2) = (9/14 -5/14) * (hbar/2) = (4/14) * (hbar/2) = (2/7) * (hbar/2 )= (2/7)*(1/2) hbar = (1/7) hbar.

Hmm, so average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 → yes.

Alternatively, I can compute the average using the matrix representation.

Because A is the operator, and |alpha> is a state vector, the average is ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

|alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal.

So let's compute ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

Let me denote |alpha> as a column vector:

[ a ]
[ b ]

Where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2-i)/sqrt(7).

Then, A is:

[ 0        hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0     ]

So A |alpha> is:

[ (hbar/2)*b ]
[ (hbar/2)*a ]

Then, ⟨alpha| A |alpha> is the inner product of [a*, b* ] with [ (hbar/2) b, (hbar/2) a ].

So it's a* (hbar/2 b) + b* (hbar/2 a ).

Which is (hbar/2)(a* b + b* a )

= (hbar/2)( 2 Re(a* b) )

= hbar Re(a* b).

Compute a* b:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7) → a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7)

b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) / 7.

Compute numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2 is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = (1) -3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

So Re(a* b) is 1/7.

Hence, average = hbar * (1/7) → hbar/7.

Which matches our earlier result.

So the average is hbar/7.

Looking again at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the other options to ensure. The other options have different averages. Option C's average is hbar/sqrt(7), which would be larger than hbar/7. So unless I made a mistake, option A is correct.


The problem involves an electron in a state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The coefficients of |α⟩ are (1+i) for |up⟩ and (2-i) for |down⟩. The magnitudes squared of these coefficients are:
- |1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2,
- |2-i|² = 2² + (-1)² = 4 + 1 = 5.

The normalization factor is:
\[
\sqrt{2 + 5} = \sqrt{7}.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, with eigenvalues ±ℏ/2. Its eigenstates are the spin eigenstates along the x-axis:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩
Substitute the expressions for |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ into |α⟩:
\[
|α⟩ = c_+|+x⟩ + c_-|-x⟩,
\]
where:
\[
c_+ = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}}, \quad c_- = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are given by:
\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2, \quad P(-x) = |c_-|^2.
\]
Compute:
\[
|c_+|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left|\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]
Thus, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

### Step 5: Average value of A
The average value of A is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α | A | α \rangle.
\]
Using the eigenvalues ±ℏ/2 and their probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \left(\frac{9}{14}\right)\frac{\hbar}{2} + \left(\frac{5}{14}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Simplify:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14}\frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14}\frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{4}{14}\frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is ℏ/7. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
