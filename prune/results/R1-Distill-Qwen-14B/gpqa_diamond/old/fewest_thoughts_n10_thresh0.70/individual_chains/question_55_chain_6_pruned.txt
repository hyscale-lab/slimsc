Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let me see what I can do. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

Hmm, first, I should probably understand what each of these compounds looks like. Let's think: propenyl acetate would have an acetate group (OAc) attached to a propenyl group, which is like CH2CH2CH3, but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- maybe? Or is it CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond? Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but when it's attached as an ester, I think it's something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Or maybe for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, no, acetate is OAc-, so perhaps it's CH2CH2-OAc but with a double bond. Let me think again. Oh wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Similarly, butenyl would have a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

Wait, but the question gives options like Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. So for propenyl, the structure would have the double bond in position 1, so CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Then, for butenyl, it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, perhaps?

Wait, no, maybe it's more like the ester groups are attached to the end of the chain. Let me think again. Acetate is OAc-O-R. So for propenyl acetate, R is CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond. So propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so R is CH2CH=CH2? No, wait. Wait, propenyl groups can be either allyl or isopropenyl, but I think in this case, it's the allyl group. So, the structure for propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Similarly, butenyl would be a four-carbon chain with a double bond, so maybe CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc? Or perhaps the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, making it CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, or maybe CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc, depending on the position.

But wait, the NMR data given is for the unknown compound. Let's look at the NMR data:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

I should start by analyzing each peak.

First, the peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a relatively large coupling constant. In aromatic protons, coupling constants are usually around 2-4 Hz,
