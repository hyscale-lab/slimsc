Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about determining the starting materials A and B that, when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce two different diketones. 

Hmm, the products given are 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione and 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. I remember that treatment with HCl, NaNO2, and H2O is often related to some kind of nitration or diazotization reaction. Wait, but wait—diazonium salts are usually involved in reactions like substitution or coupling, but how does that lead to diketones?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Another possibility: when you have a compound with a hydroxyl group in a certain position, treating it with HCl and NaNO2 under cold conditions (like 0-5°C) could lead to the formation of a nitroso compound or perhaps an elimination. Oh wait, wait! I remember the Stephen reduction involves ketones and nitrous acid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about the oxidation of alcohols.

Wait, no, another thought. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions. If you have an aryl diazonium salt, it can be used for substitution, but we're dealing with cyclohexane here, which is aliphatic. Oh! Wait, maybe it's a dehydration reaction. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: The products are diketones. So both products have two ketone groups. How do you form a diketone from a starting material? One way is via oxidation of adjacent diols (vicinal diols), but wait, the treatment here is with HCl, NaNO2, and water. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the hydrolysis of a nitro compound. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps this is about the formation of a gem-diazo compound, which then upon hydrolysis would form a ketone. Wait, another option: nitrous acid can react with alcohols in certain conditions. Oh! Wait, maybe it's the Gattermann
