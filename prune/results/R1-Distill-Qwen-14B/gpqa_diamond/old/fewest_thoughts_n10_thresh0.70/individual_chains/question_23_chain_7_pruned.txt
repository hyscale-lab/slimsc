Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked the reaction progress using TLC. The reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to find out which of the given options could be the products.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to visualize it better. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me break that down. The benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached to it. The substituent on the oxygen is a butenyl group. Specifically, the butenyl is 3-en-1-yl, which means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if I count from the point of attachment to the oxygen). Wait, actually, the butenyl group is CH2CH2CH2CH2, but wait with a double bond. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, the numbering is 1-based from the oxygen. So, the structure is:

O

O-benzene-CH2-C(CH2CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let's see: The butenyl group is four carbons long. The substituent is attached to the oxygen at position 1. So positions 1,2,3,4. The double bond is between 3 and 4, so it's a terminal double bond. Also, positions 2 has two methyl groups attached. So the structure is:

O
|
O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no, wait. The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is:

Position 1: attached to O.

Position 2: two methyl groups.

The double bond is between 3 and 4.

So the structure is:

O-benzene-CH2-C(CH
