Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, I remember that in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels depend on the quantum number n. The formula given is E = (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), but each energy level is E multiplied by n squared, right? So the energy levels are E_n = n² E.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait no, the formula they provided is E= pi²ħ²/(2mL²), so each state's energy would be E multiplied by n squared. So the ground state is n=1, first excited n=2, second excited n=3, etc. But wait, wait—this is for a single particle. But here, there are four particles. Oh, right, but I think in this context, each particle can occupy different states, but since they're indistinguishable fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each state can only have a certain number of particles.

So each state in the well is defined by a quantum number n and a spin state. Since these are spin-1/2 particles, each can have spin up or down. So each n level can hold two particles—one with spin up and one with spin down.

But wait, the problem says four identical spin-1/2 particles. So I need to figure out how they fill up the energy levels.

The ground state will have
