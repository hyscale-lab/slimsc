Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, and I need to figure out the right answer. I'm a bit rusty on my qPCR details, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and ran three technical replicates at each dilution. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, which means the curve fits perfectly, so that's ideal. The slope is -3.3. 

Looking at the data, for each concentration, the CT values are pretty close. For example, at 100000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average would be like 34.2, maybe. The other concentrations also have similar patterns. So each dilution step seems to be about a 3.3 CT difference from the next. Wait, the slope is -3.3. Hmm.

Wait, what's the slope in the qPCR equation? I remember that the standard equation is something like Ct = a + b(log copies). Or was it Ct = a - b log(copies)? Because higher copy numbers should give lower Ct values (since it reaches threshold sooner). So a higher concentration would have lower Ct. 

In the data, when concentration drops by 10x (like from 100,000 to 10,000), the Ct increases by about 3.3. Because 33.9 to 30.6 is about 3.3. So each 10x dilution adds about 3.3 cycles. 

Wait, but the slope is -3.3. So the equation would be Ct = (intercept) + (-3.3) * log(copies), I think. Because when copies increase, Ct decreases, which aligns with the data. 

The question is about the discrepancies in the results. The options are A to D.

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. But that's not true. Because he got a perfect R², the curve works, so A is incorrect.

Option B says Ct values don't agree with target nucleic acid. But in this case, the data seems consistent. Each 10x dilution gives an increase of ~3.3 Ct. The efficiency is 100%, so the PCR is working perfectly. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, wait. Wait, ten-fold dilution is a 10x reduction. The expected change in Ct for a 10x dilution, assuming 100% efficiency, is about 3.32 cycles. Because each cycle represents a doubling. So 10x is log2(10) ≈3.32. So a 10x dilution should cause a 3.32 increase in Ct. So in the data, the differences are around 3.3, which matches. So the ten-fold dilution corresponds to about 3.3 cycles. So the slope is -3.3
