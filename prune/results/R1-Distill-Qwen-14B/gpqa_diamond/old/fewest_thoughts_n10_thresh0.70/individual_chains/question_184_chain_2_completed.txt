Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I think I should draw the target molecule to visualize it better. So, benzene ring with substituents. Wait, the numbering is 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. So positions 1, 2, and 3 on the benzene ring. So, in order, looking at the ring, ethoxy is in position 1, tert-butyl in 2, and nitro in 3.

Now, starting from benzene, what reactions can introduce each of these groups? I remember that substituents can be introduced through electrophilic substitution reactions, which are directed based on the substituents already present.

Let's list the substituents and their directing effects:

- Ethoxy group (OEt): It's an activating, ortho/para director.
- tert-Butyl group (t-Bu): It's a bulky, but it's a deactivating (since it's an alkyl group attached via a carbocation) meta director. Wait, no, actually, wait. Alkyl groups are activating, right? Because they have +I effect which donates electrons. So t-Bu is an activating group, o/p director. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes bulky groups can have different effects. Oh right, the substituent's effect depends on its ability to donate or withdraw electrons. Since t-Bu is an alkyl group, it's activating, so it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

But wait, in Friedel-Crafts alkylation, the t-Bu group would be introduced via AlCl3 as a catalyst, using t-Bu chloride. So that's like a typical Friedel-Crafts reaction.

Nitro group (NO2) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

So the target molecule has three substituents. Let's think about their order of introduction. The order matters because each new group directs the next substitution.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so the order of adding substituents affects where the next group goes. So let's plan the steps.

Let me think about the possible substituents and their order. The target has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro. Let's see.

Ethoxy is an activating group. So perhaps it's best to add it earlier so that it directs the next substitution to the correct position.

Wait, but the nitro group is meta-directing and deactivating. So timing when to introduce nitro is crucial because once it's in place, it deactivates the ring, making further substitutions harder.

So the steps probably involve adding the activating groups first, then the deactivating ones.

But wait, let's think about the positions:

In the target molecule, ethoxy is in position 1, t-Bu in 2, and nitro in 3. So on the benzene ring, if we imagine numbering, position 1 is ethoxy, 2 is t-Bu, and 3 is nitro.

Wait, perhaps I should arrange substituents based on their directing effects.

Let me consider the order of substitution. Let's think about the first substitution.

Option 1: Introduce t-Bu first.

If I start with benzene and Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl using AlCl3, I get t-Bu-benzene. Then, adding another group.

But the t-Bu is o/p directing. So the next substituent would enter either ortho or para to t-Bu.

If I then introduce the nitro group next, where would it go? Since nitro is a meta director but is being added via an EAS reaction. Wait, no: the nitro group is meta directing because it's a strong deactivating group. But when you add nitro, it's more about the directing effect of the existing substituents.

Wait, no: when adding a nitro group as an electrophile (like via nitrating mixture), the current substituents on the ring will direct the nitro group. So if I have t-Bu already on the ring, which is activating, then the nitro group would be added in an ortho or para position to t-Bu, but wait, no. Wait, the nitro group is a meta director for itself, but when being added, the existing substituents determine where it goes.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the existing substituent's directing effects.

Let me outline the possible sequences.

Possible Approach:

1. Add ethoxy group first.

Ethoxy is activating, o/p director. Then, subsequent groups will be directed by this.

After adding ethoxy, the next substituent can be added ortho, meta, or para to ethoxy.

Wait, but then we have to add t-Bu and nitro.

Wait, but in the target, the t-Bu and nitro are in positions 2 and 3 relative to ethoxy (position 1). So, if ethoxy is in position 1, t-Bu is in 2 (ortho), and nitro in 3 (meta from ethoxy), but wait, nitro is meta to what? Or perhaps it's in a different position relative to another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps adding nitro first. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: Draw the target structure. Let's imagine benzene with substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So, positions 1, 2, 3 are all adjacent to each other, meaning the substituents are at 1, 2, 3 in a row.

Wait, but the benzene ring is cyclic, so positions 1, 2, 3 are all adjacent in a meta arrangement? Hmm, perhaps it's better to think as 1, 2, and 3 in a way that they're adjacent sequentially.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in the order where ethoxy is in position 1, t-Bu in 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro in 3 (meta to ethoxy or ortho to t-Bu? Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at position 2, and nitro at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy. Hmm, but nitro is a meta director. Wait, no, when you add nitro, the existing substituent directs where it goes.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

First, introduce ethoxy group. Then introduce t-Bu, which is o/p directed by ethoxy, so it might go in position ortho or para. But in the target, t-Bu is in position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy (position 1). Then, introduce nitro in such a way that it's in position 3, which is meta to ethoxy or some other position.

Wait, but after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, the next substituent (nitro) would have to go in a position directed by both groups. But after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, which substituent is more activating? Well, ethoxy is more activating than t-Bu, perhaps? Or maybe it depends on their positions.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options and see which sequence could get the substituents in the right places.

Looking at the options, each has a series of reactions. Let me think about each option.

Option A: i) t-Bu Cl / AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation), so benzene becomes t-Bu benzene. ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), so nitro group is added. iii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation, which is a meta director). iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization). v) dilute H2SO4 (heating, maybe decomposition?). vi) H3O+ and H2O/Heat (hydrolysis). vii) NaOH/EtBr (ethoxy group via SN2, perhaps). viii) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction). ix) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration).

Wait, but this sequence starts with adding t-Bu. Then nitration. But t-Bu is o/p director, so nitro could go ortho or para to t-Bu. Hmm, but then where would the ethoxy group come in? It's introduced via NaOH and EtBr, which is a nucleophilic substitution; that's for introducing ethoxy via an SN2 reaction, but wait, benzene can't undergo SN2. Oh wait, the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution if there's a leaving group. Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for adding alkyl groups, but for adding ethoxy, perhaps it's better to use an ether via some other method, like using an ethyl halide with a good leaving group under basic conditions. Wait, but I think that's not possible on benzene. Alternatively, perhaps using Williamson ether synthesis, but that's more for forming ethers from alcohols and alkyl halides. Alternatively, maybe introducing an ethyl group first and then converting it. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Option B: i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3, ii) HNO3/H2SO4, iii) Fe/HCl (maybe for some reduction?), iv) HNO3/H2SO4, v) NaNO2/HCl, vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat, vii) NaOH/EtBr, viii) SO3/H2SO4, ix) dilute H2SO4.

This option also starts with adding t-Bu, then nitrates. Maybe after some steps, introduces ethoxy.

Option C: i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3, ii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation), iii) HNO3/H2SO4, iv) Fe/HCl, v) NaNO2/HCl, vi) HNO3/H2SO4, vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat, viii) dilute H2SO4, ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Sulfonation is a meta director. So after adding t-Bu, if I sulfonate, the next substituent would go meta to t-Bu. Then nitration would follow. But I'm not sure.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), ii) Fe/HCl (maybe for some reduction, like removing a nitro group?), iii) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3, iv) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration), v) NaNO2/HCl, vi) SO3/H2SO4, vii) dilute H2SO4, viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat, ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm, starting with nitration. But benzene is not very reactive towards nitration without a catalyst. Wait, no, HNO3 and H2SO4 are the nitrating agents, so that should work. So D starts with nitration of benzene, adding nitro group. Then Fe/HCl: Fe in HCl usually is for dissolving metal reactions, like in the reduction of nitro groups. So after nitration, perhaps they reduce the nitro group to amine? Or maybe another reaction.

Wait, but the target has three substituents, so maybe the nitration is done in a way that allows addition of two nitro groups? No, the target only has one nitro group. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to add the ethoxy group first, then t-Bu, then nitro. Or ethoxy and t-Bu first, then nitro.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitration first to add nitro group. But that's a meta director. Then, add ethoxy, which is activating and o/p.

But no, if I nitrate benzene, I get nitrobenzene. Then, adding ethoxy would have to be in a position directed by nitro. Nitro is meta director, so the next substituent would go meta to it.

Wait, but that would complicate the positions. Maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then t-Bu in an ortho position, then nitro in a position directed by the ethoxy and t-Bu.

Wait, after adding ethoxy, the next substituent (t-Bu) would be added ortho or para to ethoxy. Let's say it's para, but in the target it's ortho.

Wait, but let's think: benzene → ethoxy benzene via, say, using ethyl chloride and AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation? No, ethoxylation is better done via another method. Oh wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for alkyl groups; for ethers, perhaps it's better to use a different approach. Alternatively, I can use the ethyl group via some other method. Wait, maybe using an O-ethylating agent, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe after introducing an ethyl group via Friedel-Crafts, convert it to ethoxy. Hmm, but that might not be straightforward.

Wait, the ethoxy group is an ether, so perhaps it's added via an electrophilic substitution where the ethyl group is introduced first, then converted to ethoxy. But that seems a bit convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution, but benzene is not nucleophilic enough. So perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 mechanism, but that's not typical for benzene. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, each has a series of steps. Let me see which one correctly adds the substituents in the right order.

Let's consider each option's steps:

Option A:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → t-Bu benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration: t-Bu is o/p director, so nitro goes into o or p.

But in the target, nitro is in position 3, which is meta to ethoxy. Hmm, maybe not.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation: sulfonic acid group is a strong meta director.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization (requires aromatic amine, but where is the amine here?)

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe this option is not the right one.

Option B:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → t-Bu benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration, adds nitro in o or p to t-Bu.

iii) Fe/HCl → Fe in HCl is for dissolving metals, perhaps reduces something. Wait, if there's a nitro group, Fe and HCl might reduce it to an amine, but that's in the presence of a catalyst. Or maybe it's a different reaction.

Hmm, perhaps after nitration, the next step is to reduce the nitro group to amine, but I'm not sure how that would help.

This seems a bit confusing.

Option C:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → t-Bu benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate group is added. Since t-Bu is o/p director, the sulfonic acid group would go o or p.

But sulfonic acid is a strong meta director for further substitutions.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration would add nitro group meta to the sulfonic acid group.

But in the target, the nitro is next to t-Bu and ethoxy. Not sure.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduces nitro to amine; but then what?

iii) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation would add t-Bu, but wait, after reducing nitro to amine, the ring is activated with an amine group (NH2 is a strong activating, o/p director).

So in D:

Step 1: nitro group added to benzene.

Step 2: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. Now, the ring has an amine group, which is a strong o/p director.

Step 3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → adds t-Bu group. Since amine is o/p director, t-Bu would be added in o or p to amine.

But wait, amine is a strong activating group, but in the presence of AlCl3, would Friedel-Crafts work? Because Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires activating groups, but if the ring is highly activated, it might not proceed as easily. Alternatively, maybe the amine group directs the t-Bu group to ortho or para.

But in the target, the t-Bu is in position 2 relative to ethoxy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding t-Bu, we nitrate again. But the target only has one nitro group. So perhaps this is getting complicated.

Wait, looking for the sequence that adds ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro.

But how to get the ethoxy group in place.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

1. Introduce t-Bu group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Then introduce nitro group, which would go meta to t-Bu.

3. Then introduce ethoxy group, which would go in a position directed by the existing substituents.

But wait, the target has ethoxy in position 1, t-Bu in 2, nitro in 3. So the substituents are 1,2,3 in order.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is:

First, nitrate benzene to add nitro group. Then, introduce t-Bu, which would be directed by the nitro group. Nitro is meta director, so t-Bu would be added meta to nitro. Then, introduce ethoxy, which is o/p director.

But let me see.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group, so after nitration, the ring is less reactive. Friedel-Crafts alkylation may not proceed easily. So adding t-Bu after nitration might be difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add t-Bu group in ortho.

3. Add nitro group in meta to ethoxy.

But how to do that.

Wait, after adding ethoxy, the ring is activated, so the next substituent (t-Bu) would go o/p to ethoxy. Let's say it's added ortho (position 2). Then, the next substituent (nitro) would have to be in a position directed by both ethoxy and t-Bu.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, but it's being added as an electrophile. The existing substituents (ethoxy and t-Bu) would direct the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position that is meta to ethoxy or ortho to t-Bu.

But the target has nitro in position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1) and ortho to t-Bu (position 2). Hmm.

Wait, if the ethoxy is in position 1, and t-Bu in 2, then position 3 would be meta to ethoxy and adjacent to t-Bu.

In that case, the nitro group would be added in position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-Bu.

But after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, when adding nitro, the existing substituents (ethoxy and t-Bu) would direct the nitro group.

But ethoxy is a stronger activating group than t-Bu. So the nitro group would be directed by the ethoxy group.

Wait, ethoxy being an o/p director, but the nitro is a meta director, so perhaps the nitro would go meta to ethoxy.

But in the target, the nitro is in position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1), and ortho to t-Bu (position 2). So that fits.

So the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy to benzene → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add t-Bu in ortho to ethoxy → 2-t-Bu-ethoxybenzene.

3. Nitrate in meta to ethoxy → which is position 3, adjacent to t-Bu.

But how to perform these steps.

Wait, but the problem is that after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, adding nitro may be difficult because the ring is activated, and nitration is a strong electrophilic substitution. Nitration is usually done under strong conditions (HNO3, H2SO4).

But perhaps it's possible.

Now, looking at the options, which one follows this order.

Looking at the options:

Option D starts with nitration, which may not be ideal.

Option C: Starts with t-Bu, then sulfonate, then nitrate. Not sure.

Option B: Starts with t-Bu, then nitrate, then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction), then nitrate again. That seems confusing.

Option A: Starts with t-Bu, then nitrate, then sulfonate, which is a meta director.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is adding ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitration. But looking at the options, none seem to start with ethoxy introduction.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, how is the ethoxy group introduced in the options?

Looking at the steps in the options:

Option A: Step vii) is NaOH/EtBr. NaOH and EtBr is for an SN2 substitution, perhaps for introducing an ethoxy group via Williamson-like conditions. Wait, but benzene can't undergo SN2. Hmm, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, maybe they use a benzyl halide and perform a nucleophilic substitution. Or perhaps it's a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires a strongly activated ring, which may not be the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group comes from a tosylate or some leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps via a benzene ring with a good leaving group, such as a nitro group, which could be replaced by ethoxy under certain conditions.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating, making substitution harder.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution using a bromide or chloride on the benzene ring. But such substitution typically occurs under strongly basic conditions, but benzene is generally unreactive towards SN2 unless there's a strong activating group.

Wait, perhaps after some activating substituents are in place, like if the ring is already activated with an -OEt group, then another substitution can occur.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkyl groups, not ethers. Oh wait, for ethers, perhaps it's better to use an alkyl chloride and AlCl3 to introduce the ethyl group, and then convert it to ethoxy.

Wait, but that's a two-step process. Alternatively, perhaps using an ethyl tosylate or similar.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me think differently.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro. Let's think about their order of addition, considering their directing effects.

The ethoxy group is an activating, o/p director. Therefore, it would be best to add it early so that it can guide the placement of other groups.

t-Bu is an activating, o/p director. So if added after ethoxy, it would go ortho or para relative to ethoxy.

Nitro is a deactivating, meta director. Since it's deactivating, it's best to add it last, because once added, it makes further substitutions difficult.

So the order would be: ethoxy → t-Bu → nitro.

Now, how to introduce ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro in that order.

Introducing ethoxy first: Let's think about how to introduce an ethoxy group onto benzene. One method is via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps using a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with ethyl chloride, but that would add an ethyl group, not ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps using a different approach: first, introduce an ethyl group via Friedel-Crafts, then somehow convert it to ethoxy. But that would require steps. Alternatively, maybe using an ethyl group followed by oxidation or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using an electrophilic substitution with an ethoxy group. But I don't know of a direct way to add an ethoxy group via EAS. So perhaps another method is needed.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a benzene ring with a leaving group. For example, if we have a nitro group in a position, and then replace it with ethoxy. But that would require a meta director.

Wait, but this is getting a bit too vague. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, each step sequence is:

Option C: i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → t-Bu benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate group added.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce something.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitrate.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → SN2 substitution.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro. But none of the options start with ethoxy.

Wait, looking at the options, none of them start by adding ethoxy. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, such as using a benzyl bromide and a strong base, but that's more for alkyl groups, not ethers.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding some substituents, the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitration: add nitro group.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-Bu.

3. Introduce ethoxy via some method.

But let me think about the directing. After nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts may not work. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But the problem is that adding ethoxy after t-Bu may be difficult because the ring is activated, but the ethoxy group is a good activating group.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option D:

Step 1: Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

Step 2: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline derivative.

Step 3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add t-Bu. Since amine is an o/p director, t-Bu would be added ortho or para to amine.

But wait, the target has t-Bu in position 2 relative to ethoxy, so perhaps that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps this sequence is not the right one.

Hmm, maybe I should think of each substituent's position relative to others.

In the target molecule, ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

So, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the nitro is meta to ethoxy and adjacent to t-Bu.

So, when adding ethoxy and t-Bu, the next substituent (nitro) would be in position 3.

But how to achieve that.

I think I'm getting stuck, so perhaps it's better to approach this by elimination.

The correct answer must have steps that first add t-Bu and ethoxy in such a way that nitro can be added in the correct position.

Looking at the options, which option adds nitro last.

Option A: Steps i) t-Bu, ii) nitrate, then iii) sulfonate, iv) diazotize, etc. It's unclear when the ethoxy is added. Perhaps ethoxy is added via step vii), NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, NaOH and EtBr is a nucleophilic substitution. So if there's a good leaving group attached to the benzene ring, like a bromide, it could be replaced by ethoxide.

But when would the bromide be present?

Alternatively, perhaps one of the steps involves introducing a leaving group, like a nitro group, which is then replaced.

Wait, perhaps in one of the steps, a nitro group is added, then reduced to an amine, and then converted into a leaving group.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add ethoxy via a substitution, directed by t-Bu.

3. Add nitro via nitration, directed by ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about option B:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → t-Bu benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added o/p to t-Bu.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

Hmm, adding another nitro group seems unlikely, as the target has only one.

Option C:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → t-Bu benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate group added, o/p to t-Bu.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate, which would go meta to sulfonate.

But the target has nitro not in that position.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu in o/p of amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

But target has only one nitro, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Looking at option C:

Steps:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → t-Bu benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate group added (o/p to t-Bu).

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate, which would go meta to the sulfonate (since sulfonate is a strong meta director).

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

Hmm, but target has only one nitro group.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the nitration step.

The target molecule has a nitro group in position 3. So during nitration, the nitro group must be added in a position that's meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-Bu.

So, perhaps the ethoxy is added first, then t-Bu, then nitration.

But in the options, none of them have ethoxy as the first step.

Wait, except perhaps looking at option B:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → SN2 to introduce ethoxy.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → something.

Wait, perhaps after introducing t-Bu and nitro, they reduce the nitro to amine, then nitrate again (which doesn't fit the target). So probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps after steps, they introduce ethoxy via SN2, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: the target has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro. So, perhaps the nitro is added via a directed metallation or some other method, but that's probably beyond the scope of this question.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add ethoxy to benzene → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add t-Bu in ortho → 2-t-Bu-ethoxybenzene.

3. Nitrate in meta to ethoxy → which would be position 3, adjacent to t-Bu.

So, the steps would be:

i) Ethoxylation.

ii) Friedel-Crafts t-Bu.

iii) Nitration.

Looking at the options, perhaps option D includes some steps that could do this.

Wait, option D starts with nitration, which may not be ideal.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is in option C.

Wait, perhaps in option C:

i) t-Bu added first.

ii) sulfonate, which is a meta director.

iii) nitrate, which would go meta to sulfonate.

But that leaves the nitro not in the correct position relative to ethoxy and t-Bu.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, let me think about option A's steps:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → t-Bu benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added o/p to t-Bu.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate added.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → SN2 to introduce ethoxy.

viii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce something.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

But this seems to add nitro multiple times.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, option C's steps:

i) t-Bu.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl (reduce nitro to amine).

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazonium salt.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider the positions and the order.

The target has substituents at positions 1, 2, 3.

If I first add t-Bu, it would be in position 1. Then add ethoxy in position 2 (ortho to t-Bu). Then add nitro in position 3 (meta to ethoxy).

But how to achieve that.

Wait, first, add t-Bu to benzene.

Then, add ethoxy, which would be o/p to t-Bu. Let's say it's added in position 2.

Then, nitration would be directed by ethoxy, which is o/p. So nitro would go into position 3 (meta to ethoxy) or position 4 (para to ethoxy).

But in the target, nitro is in position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and adjacent to t-Bu.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. t-Bu added to benzene.

2. ethoxy added ortho to t-Bu.

3. nitro added meta to ethoxy.

Now, how to implement this.

Looking for an option where:

- t-Bu is added first.

- Then ethoxy is added ortho.

- Then nitration occurs.

Now, looking at the options, perhaps option A or C.

Option A:

i) t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → adds nitro o/p to t-Bu.

iii) sulfonate → adds SO3 group.

iv) diazotization.

v) H2SO4.

vi) H3O+ and heat.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → introduces ethoxy.

Hmm, the ethoxy is added after nitrate and sulfonate steps. That might not be the right order.

Option C:

i) t-Bu.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl.

v) diazotization.

vi) nitrate again.

Hmm, not matching.

Another approach: perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro. But the options don't seem to have that.

Wait, perhaps looking at option B:

i) t-Bu.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl (reduce nitro to amine).

iv) nitrate again.

v) diazotization.

vi) H3O+ and heat.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → introduce ethoxy.

Hmm, in this case, after adding t-Bu and nitro, nitro is reduced to amine, then perhaps after another nitration (which doesn't fit), ethoxy is added.

Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the nitro group is added last.

Wait, in option D:

i) nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to aniline.

iii) t-Bu added via Friedel-Crafts.

iv) nitrate again.

But target has only one nitro, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps option A:

i) t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → nitro in o/p of t-Bu.

iii) sulfonate → adds another group.

iv) nitrate again → but target only has one.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting anywhere, so I'll try to think about the correct order and see which option matches.

The correct order of substitution is:

1. Add ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add t-Bu ortho to ethoxy → 2-t-Bu-ethoxybenzene.

3. Add nitro meta to ethoxy → 3-nitro-2-t-Bu-ethoxybenzene.

So the steps would be:

a) Ethoxylation.

b) Friedel-Crafts t-Bu.

c) Nitration.

Now, looking at the options, which option does this.

Option A's steps:

i) t-Bu.

ii) nitrate.

iii) sulfonate.

iv) diazotize.

v) H2SO4.

vi) H3O+.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → which would introduce ethoxy.

So, in option A, ethoxy is added at step vii, after nitrate and sulfonate. So the order is t-Bu, nitrate, sulfonate, then ethoxy. That's not the desired order.

Option B:

i) t-Bu.

ii) nitrate.

iii) reduce.

iv) nitrate again.

v) diazotize.

vi) H3O+.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

Again, ethoxy is added after nitration steps.

Option C:

i) t-Bu.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) reduce.

v) diazotize.

vi) nitrate again.

vii) H3O+.

viii) H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

Here, ethoxy is added last. Not desired.

Option D:

i) nitrate.

ii) reduce.

iii) t-Bu.

iv) nitrate again.

v) diazotize.

vi) sulfonate.

vii) H2SO4.

viii) H3O+.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

Again, ethoxy is added last.

Hmm, none of the options seem to add ethoxy first. Therefore, perhaps I'm wrong in assuming that ethoxy is added first. Maybe the correct sequence involves ethoxy being added via a substitution after other groups are in place.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution, such as using NaOH and EtBr after a leaving group is present. But when would that leaving group be introduced?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is converted into a leaving group, like a nitro group is reduced to an amine, then treated with HNO2 to form a diazonium salt, which can be hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group, and then replaced with ethoxy.

But that seems complicated.

Wait, let's think about that possibility.

Suppose the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Diazotize with HNO2 → diazonium chloride.

4. Hydrolyze with H2O and heat → phenol.

5. Treat with NaOH and EtBr → substitute the phenolic OH with OEt via SN2.

But would that work? I'm not sure because phenol is a strong activating group, but in this case, perhaps the substitution is feasible.

But in this scenario, the ethoxy group would be added after nitration and reduction steps.

But the target has three substituents, so perhaps I need to add t-Bu and another group before this.

Hmm, this is getting too complex. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options provided.

Considering all the steps, the correct order likely involves adding t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro. But looking at the options, option C adds sulfonate after t-Bu, then nitrate. Then, reduction and other steps, and finally ethoxy via NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

Wait, in option C:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → t-Bu benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate group added, which would be para to t-Bu (since t-Bu is o/p director).

But sulfonate is a strong meta director.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Since sulfonate is meta director, nitro would be added meta to sulfonate.

But wait, what's the position of the nitro group relative to t-Bu and the eventual ethoxy.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to go with option C as the correct answer, but I'm not entirely confident.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents in an order that ensures proper directing effects and yields the target molecule. The substituents are:

1. **Ethoxy group (-OEt)**: An activating, ortho/para-directing group.
2. **tert-Butyl group (-t-Bu)**: An activating, ortho/para-directing group.
3. **Nitro group (-NO2)**: A deactivating, meta-directing group.

### Key Considerations:
- The ethoxy group is an activating group and should ideally be introduced early to direct subsequent substitutions.
- The tert-butyl group is also activating and should be introduced before the nitro group to avoid deactivation of the ring.
- The nitro group, being deactivating, should be introduced last to minimize its impact on subsequent reactions.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
1. **t-Bu Cl/AlCl3**: Adds the tert-butyl group to benzene.
2. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitrates the ring, but the tert-butyl group directs the nitro group to the ortho or para position.
3. **SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonates the ring, introducing a meta-directing group.
4. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotizes an amine (if present).
5. **dilute H2SO4**: Hydrolyzes intermediates.
6. **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Further hydrolysis.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Introduces the ethoxy group via substitution.
8. **Fe/HCl**: Likely reduces a nitro or diazo intermediate.
9. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Additional nitration.

This sequence introduces the ethoxy group late, which conflicts with the need for it to direct the nitro group. Additionally, multiple nitrations make it unlikely to yield the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **t-Bu Cl/AlCl3**: Adds the tert-butyl group to benzene.
2. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitrates the ring, with the tert-butyl group directing the nitro group to the ortho or para position.
3. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces the nitro group to an amine.
4. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitrates the ring again.
5. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotizes an amine.
6. **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes intermediates.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Introduces the ethoxy group via substitution.
8. **SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonates the ring.
9. **dilute H2SO4**: Hydrolyzes intermediates.

This sequence involves multiple nitrations and reductions, which are inconsistent with the target molecule's structure. The ethoxy group is introduced late, which disrupts the directing effects.

#### **Option C**:
1. **t-Bu Cl/AlCl3**: Adds the tert-butyl group to benzene.
2. **SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonates the ring, introducing a meta-directing group.
3. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitrates the ring, with the sulfonate group directing the nitro group to the meta position.
4. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces the nitro group to an amine.
5. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotizes an amine.
6. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitrates the ring again.
7. **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes intermediates.
8. **dilute H2SO4**: Hydrolyzes intermediates.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Introduces the ethoxy group via substitution.

This sequence introduces the ethoxy group late, which conflicts with its role as a directing group. Additionally, multiple nitrations make it unlikely to yield the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitrates benzene, introducing the nitro group.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces the nitro group to an amine.
3. **t-Bu Cl/AlCl3**: Adds the tert-butyl group to the ring.
4. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitrates the ring again.
5. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotizes an amine.
6. **SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonates the ring.
7. **dilute H2SO4**: Hydrolyzes intermediates.
8. **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes intermediates.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Introduces the ethoxy group via substitution.

This sequence starts with nitration, which deactivates the ring and makes subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation difficult. The ethoxy group is introduced late, disrupting its directing effects.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none perfectly match the desired sequence of introducing the ethoxy group first, followed by the tert-butyl group, and finally the nitro group. However, **Option C** comes closest to aligning with the required steps, despite some inconsistencies in the order of introducing the ethoxy group.
