Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various properties, and I need to figure out which two can be observed by both instruments.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can observe. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. The question says, "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, actually, in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because the scale is inverted. So if a star's apparent V magnitude is 16, that's brighter than 17.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So apparent V magnitude less than 16. So, for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude and see if it's less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. Wait no, wait. Wait, the question says: for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So if a star's apparent V mag is 16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag less than 16.

Wait, no. Wait, if a star's apparent magnitude is, say, 15, that's brighter than 16 and 17. So HIRES can see it (since it can go down to 16), and so can ESPRESSO (since it can go down to 17). So the star would be observable by both.

But wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be observable by both. So for each star, I need to compute its apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction (
