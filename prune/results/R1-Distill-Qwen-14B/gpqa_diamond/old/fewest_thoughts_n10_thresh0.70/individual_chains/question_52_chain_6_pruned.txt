Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a star and the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The star has certain parameters, and when spots cover part of its surface, some of its properties change. I need to find out how the ratio of these Ti atoms changes when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't.

First, let me read the problem again carefully.

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is by what factor does this ratio change? The transition wavelength is about 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. So the key here is understanding how the ratio of atoms in different energy levels depends on temperature. I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels (n1 and n2) is:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where:
- g1 and g2 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels (E2 > E1 because the ratio is n1/n2).
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

The ratio depends exponentially on the energy difference and inversely on temperature. So if the temperature changes, the ratio will change.

But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. So when it's not spotted, T is 6000 K, with spots, 5500 K.

Wait, but the spots themselves are cooler regions, right? Because when a star has spots, they are darker and cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the spots are at a lower temperature, but the problem says the overall Teff of the photosphere decreases when 40% is covered. So the effective temperature of the entire star goes down, which affects the overall emission.

But the question is about the photospheric effective temperature. So when the spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. So the photosphere as a whole is at 5500 K when spots are present.

But wait, the spots themselves have a lower temperature. So the overall Teff is a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions. I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here, because the problem says the photospheric effective temperature decreases to
