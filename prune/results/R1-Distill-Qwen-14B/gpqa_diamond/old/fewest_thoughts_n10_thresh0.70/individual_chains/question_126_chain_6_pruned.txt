Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many peaks the chemist observes in the chromatograms. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question involves two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, each starting with a different compound. After these reactions are completed, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral one. The task is to determine how many peaks each will show.

Let me start by looking at Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. I remember that LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent. It's typically used to reduce ketones to alcohols. So, when (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one reacts with LAH, the ketone group (the -one) should get reduced to a secondary alcohol. 

Wait, but wait. The structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the ketone is on carbon 3, and carbon 5 has a methoxy group. After reduction, the ketone becomes a hydroxyl group. So the product should be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, wait, the starting material is an S configuration. When the ketone is reduced, does the configuration change? No, because the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol is a stereospecific process. Well, actually, waitâ€”no, the ketone is planar, so when it's reduced to an alcohol, the hydroxyl group can be added from either face, but wait, wait, the starting material is chiral because of the methoxy group? Or is the methoxy group on a chiral center?

Wait, let's structure this. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the molecule is hexan-3-one, with a methoxy group on carbon 5. Let me draw the structure mentally:

Carbon chain: 1 2 3 4 5 6
Positions:    CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? Wait, wait,
