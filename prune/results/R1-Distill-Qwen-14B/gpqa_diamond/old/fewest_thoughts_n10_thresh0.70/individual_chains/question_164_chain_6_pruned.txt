Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my studies.

The question is about determining which system is more massive and by what factor. We've got two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with certain periodsâ€”2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. Then there are radial velocity (RV) variations given for each system.

I think the key here is to figure out the masses of each star in the systems and then sum them up to find the total mass of each system. The ratio of these masses will tell us the factor by which system_1 is more massive.

Wait, how do radial velocities relate to mass in binary systems? Oh right! In a binary system, each star orbits the common center of mass. The radial velocity amplitude (K) of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. Because the more massive star would be moving slower, right? So K1/K2 = M2/M1, where K is the velocity amplitude and M is the mass.

But wait, the sum of the masses (M_total = M1 + M2) is what we're after. So each system's total mass is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Let's think about the data. For system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. Let me call them K1 and K2. So K1=10, K2=5. For system_2, K1=15, K2=10.

So for each system, the ratio of the velocities is K1/K2 = (M2)/(M1) for that system. Because M1*K1 = M2*K2 (since the center of mass is the same point for both), right?

Wait, because the product of mass and velocity should be the same for both stars in a binary system. So M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So M1/M2 = K2/K1. So M1 = (K2/K1)*M2.

So for system_1: M1/M2 = (5)/(10) = 1/2. So M1 = (1/2) M2. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = (1/2 M2) + M2 = (3/2) M
