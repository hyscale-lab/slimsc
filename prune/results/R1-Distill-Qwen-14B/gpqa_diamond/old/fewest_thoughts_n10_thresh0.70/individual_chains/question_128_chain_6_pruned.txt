Okay, so I've just landed this job at a structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The PI has given me four plasmid options, and I need to choose the right one. Hmm, I remember from my studies that producing proteins in E. coli often involves using plasmids with certain features, especially for proper expression and solubility.

The goal is to get the correct amino acid sequence, so the plasmid must have the right DNA sequence encoding P53. But wait, I think plasmids used for protein expression in E. coli usually include a promoter that the bacteria can recognize, like the T7 promoter, since BL21 strains often have the T7 RNA polymerase under an inducible promoter, such as lacUV5.

Looking at the options, each option starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So thatâ€™s correct. But I need to check if the plasmid contains an appropriate promoter before the ATG. Wait, the given sequences might not include the promoter but focus on the coding region. Or maybe the options show the entire plasmid, including the promoter.

Wait, the question says the options are four different sequences. So each option is the DNA sequence of a plasmid. I need to figure out which one correctly encodes the given amino acid sequence.

Wait, the given amino acid sequence starts with MEEPQ... So the first few amino acids are M, E, E, P, Q... So the corresponding DNA should start with ATG (for M) followed by the codons for E, E, P, etc.
