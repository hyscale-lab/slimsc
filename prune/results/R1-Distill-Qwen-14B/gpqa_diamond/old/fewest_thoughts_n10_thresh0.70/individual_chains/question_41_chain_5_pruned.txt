Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in different media. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index n. So normally, when the medium isn't moving, the speed would be v_light = c/n. But here, the glass is moving. Does that affect the speed as observed in the lab frame?

Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on how relative motion between the medium and the observer affects light. I think this might involve special relativity. Oh wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v, which is probably much less than the speed of light, but maybe it's not necessarily small. Wait, the problem says v is constant, so perhaps it's in the realm where relativistic effects are significant.

Wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The velocity addition formula says that if an object is moving at speed u in the frame of another object moving at speed v relative to the lab frame, then the speed in the lab frame is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/cÂ²). But wait, in this case, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So the light's speed in the glass's frame is v_light = c/n (since in the glass's rest frame, the speed is c/n). But in the lab frame, since the glass is moving, we need to apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, let me get this straight. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n towards the observer (since the beam is toward the observer, I think the direction matters). But the glass itself is moving towards the observer in the lab at velocity v. So the direction of the light in the glass's frame is the same as the direction of the glass's movement in the lab frame.

Wait, so the light's velocity in the lab frame would
