Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a qubit, the state can be pure or mixed, and the density matrix captures that.

First, I should write down what ρ looks like in matrix form. Let's see, |0> is [1, 0]^T and |1> is [0, 1]^T. So |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1s in the first position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 1 in the second position.

Adding these two, |0><0| + |1><1| gives the identity matrix, right? Because each is [[1,0],[0,0]] and [[0,0],[0,1]] respectively, adding to [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then, multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix ρ becomes [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. I remember that this is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. It represents a completely classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. Wait, qubit space is two-dimensional, right? Because a qubit is a two-level system. But how is the density matrix represented geometrically?

I think the Bloch sphere comes into play here. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent the state of a qubit. For a pure state |ψ>, it's a point on the surface of the unit sphere. The state is represented as a vector r = (x, y, z), where the components correspond to the angles θ and φ in the density matrix's parameterization.

For a mixed state, like this density matrix ρ, I think the representation is a bit different. In the case of the density matrix, it can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z). 

Let me expand that. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when I compute r·σ, it's x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z.

Substituting into ρ, we get (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2. Let's compute that for our specific ρ.

Our ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Let's express this as (I + something)/2. Since I is [[1,0],[0,1]], (I + something)/2 must equal ρ. So (I + something) equals I, because ρ * 2 is I. So I + something = I → something = 0. 

So, x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z must be the zero matrix. The only way that happens is if x=0, y=0, z=0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). 

Wait, but what does the Bloch vector being zero mean? Oh, right, that's the completely mixed state. It's the point at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which is the center. So all directions are equally probable, which makes sense for the maximally mixed state.

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). That must be the correct answer.

Alternatively, if I had a pure state like |0>, the density matrix would be |0><0|, which is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Then, using the same formula, (I + something)/2 = [[1,0],[0,0]]. So I + something would be [[2,0],[0,0]], which implies something is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Which means x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z equals [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Looking at the Pauli matrices, this is exactly σ_z. So the coefficients would be x=0, y=0, z=1. So the Bloch vector is (0,0,1), which is option B. So that's a pure state at the north pole.

But our case is different. Our density matrix has both diagonal elements equal and symmetric, meaning the Bloch vector is at the origin. So the answer is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the system is in a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability.

To determine the geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single-qubit density matrix, it can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector. Substituting the given \(\rho\) into this formula, we find:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}.
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

\[
I = I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}.
\]

This implies:

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0.
\]

The only solution for this equation is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the Bloch vector is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the completely mixed state.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
