Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about titration and pH calculations. Let's see what it says.

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. Hmm. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, you get a buffer solution until the equivalence point. Beyond that, it's the salt of the weak acid and water.

So the problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

The options are A to D. I know that for the equivalence point, if it's a weak acid and a strong base, the pH will be greater than 7. Because the salt formed is the conjugate base of the acid, which will hydrolyze in water to make it basic.

Wait, but let's get into the nitty-gritty. Let's tackle each part step by step.

First, let's figure out the initial concentration after dilution. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting it with 20 cm³ of water, so total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution = (volume1 * concentration1) / total volume.

So, (20 * 0.05) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.0125 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.0125 M.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially = 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol.

Wait, no. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. Then when diluted to 40 cm³, the concentration is 0.0125 M, but moles remain same, 0.001 mol.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you dilute, the number of moles doesn't change. So yes, moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. So at equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed will be 0.001 mol. Because the reaction is 1:1.

The volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / concentration. Moles is 0.001 mol, concentration is 0.1 M. So volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about the equivalence point of the diluted solution. So, correct, 10 cm³ of NaOH needed.

But wait, the problem is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So for 25% titration, we'll have added 25% of the equivalence volume, which is 2.5 cm³. Because 10 cm³ is equivalence, 25% is 2.5 cm³.

So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

Let me think about the buffers. At 25% titration, which is before the equivalence point, I'll have a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate ion.

So, to find pH at 25% titration, use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

But wait, first, let's figure out the moles of acetic acid and acetate at this point.

Total moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Reaction: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.

So, the solution now is 40 cm³ (original diluted solution) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

pKa is given by Ka = 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, no. pKa = -log(Ka). So:

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait no, pKa is -log(Ka). So 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so -log(1.85e-5) = 5 - 0.267 = 4.733.

So pKa ≈4.733.

Now, [A-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, that's around 4.26.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Moles of HA: 0.00075, moles of A-:0.00025.

Volume is 42.5 mL, so 0.0425 L.

Concentration HA: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Concentration A-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Ratio A-/HA=0.005882 /0.017647 ≈0.3333. So log(0.333)= -0.477, so pH=4.733-0.477=4.256≈4.26.

So at 25% titration, pH is about 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions.

So moles of acetate: 0.001 mol.

Volume is 40 mL (original) + 10 mL (equivalence point volume) → 50 mL=0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Acetate is a weak base, so it will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5 → Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10.

Then, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the [OH^-], then:

Kb ≈ (x^2)/(0.02 -x) → since Kb is very small, x is negligible compared to 0.02, so:

x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x^2 = (5.405e-10) *0.02= 1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6).

Log(3.288)=0.516. So pOH≈5.484 → pH=14-5.484=8.516≈8.52.

So equivalence point pH is about 8.52.

Looking back at the options:

Option A says 4.26; 8.52 → that matches. Option D is 4.57;6.92 which doesn't match.

Wait, but wait another thing: Wait, when I calculated the initial dilution, I think I made a mistake.

Wait, initial acetic acid: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 = 0.001 mol. Then diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So concentration is 0.001/0.04= 0.025 M? Wait, wait no! Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, 20 cm³ added makes 0.04 L. So moles are 0.001. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M? Wait wait, no: 0.001 / 0.04 is 0.025 M? Wait, 0.001 divided by 0.04 is 0.025? Let me compute: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 → yes.

Wait, no, wait: 0.001 /0.04 → 0.025 M. So that's correct. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but earlier I thought the concentration was 0.0125 M. Oh no! Wait, wait, my mistake. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, 20 cm³ acetic acid is 0.02 L. 20 cm³ water added, so total volume is 0.04 L. So concentration is (0.02 L * 0.05 M) / 0.04 L = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So I was wrong earlier, the concentration is 0.025 M, not 0.0125.

Oh wait, that changes things! So I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the 25% titration part.

So, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.02 L *0.05 M=0.001 mol. Diluted to 0.04 L, so 0.025 M. Then, when we add 25% of the equivalence volume.

Wait, the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, as before.

At 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.0025 L *0.1 M=0.00025 mol.

So, moles of CH3COOH consumed: 0.00025 mol. Remaining CH3COOH: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume now is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈0.017647 M.

Concentration of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 /0.0425≈0.005882 M.

Same as before. So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.3333. So pH= pKa + log(0.3333)=4.733 -0.477≈4.256. So 4.26.

But wait, the equivalence point calculation: Now, the moles of acetate at equivalence are 0.001 mol, and the volume is 40 +10=50 cm³=0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

So Kb= (1e-14)/(1.85e-5)=5.405e-10.

Then, Kb=5.405e-10= (x^2)/(0.02) → x^2=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=3.288e-6 → [OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.484 → pH=8.516.

So, the equivalence pH is 8.52.

So the values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, the options say option A is 4.26;8.52. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, another thought—no, wait: in the initial calculation, I thought that the initial concentration was 0.0125 M, but that was wrong. It's actually 0.025 M. However, the key part that affects the 25% point is the moles, which remain the same. Because when you dilute, the moles don't change. So, regardless of the initial concentration, the moles are 0.001, so when titrated, the same number applies.

Wait, but the initial mistake in concentration doesn't affect the 25% titration because the moles are what's important. So the pH at 25% is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52.

So the correct option is A.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the initial solution's concentration is important for the calculations.

Wait, for the equivalence point, the solution is 0.02 M acetate. So, the Kb calculation uses 0.02 M.

So the earlier calculation is correct.

So the answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by determining the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are calculated as:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.02 \, \text{L} \times 0.05 \, \text{M} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.0025 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After the reaction:
- Remaining moles of acetic acid (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}\)) = \(0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}\),
- Moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed = \(0.00025 \, \text{mol}\).

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### At the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The moles of acetate ions are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ions hydrolyze in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \(K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\). Let \([\text{OH}^-] = x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \(K_b\) is very small, \(x \ll 0.02\), so:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \times 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 = 8.516 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
