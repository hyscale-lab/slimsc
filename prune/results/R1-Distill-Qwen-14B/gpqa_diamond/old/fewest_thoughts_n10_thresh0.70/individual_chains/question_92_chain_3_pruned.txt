Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure.

Wait, the formula seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should count the number of each type of bond in this molecule. Because the question gives me bond energies, and I remember that enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies.

But wait, wait. How does that work again? Oh right, the enthalpy of formation is calculated by subtracting the bond energies of the reactants (elements in their standard states) from the bond energies of the products. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

Actually, the standard approach is using Hess's Law. The enthalpy of formation of a molecule is the difference between the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (like breaking bonds in elements) and the sum of the bond energies of the products (like forming bonds in the molecule). Or wait, maybe it's the opposite? No, wait, no. When you form a molecule, you're making bonds. So bond energies are the energy released when forming bonds. So to form the molecule, you have to break apart the elements' bonds (which require energy) and then form the molecule's bonds (which release energy). So the overall enthalpy change
