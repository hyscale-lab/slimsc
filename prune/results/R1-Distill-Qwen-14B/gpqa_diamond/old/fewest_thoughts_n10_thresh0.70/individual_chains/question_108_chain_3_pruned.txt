Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and is 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m has small values. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that paramagnetic coupling involves the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field.

The problem asks to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the energy due to this interaction) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are about whether the paramagnetic term is much larger, much smaller, roughly equal, or just greater than ΔE.

Wait, the wavelength given is probably for the emission or absorption line corresponding to the transition. So I can calculate ΔE using the wavelength. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Let me remember the constants: h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s, c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters.

So plugging in, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6). Let me calculate that. Let's see, 6.626e-34 *3e8 is approximately 1.9878e-25. Dividing by 0.4861e-6 gives 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7. Wait, 4.861e-7 is 0.4861e-6. Hmm, 1.9878e-25 divided by 4.861e-7 is roughly (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18. Let me compute 1.9878 / 4.861. Hmm, 4.861 is about 5, so 2/5 is 0.4. So
