Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when the molecule has chirality, which requires at least one stereogenic center. But wait, there are other things too, like if the compound has a plane of symmetry or not. Oh, and sometimes even with stereogenic centers, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral. So each compound I need to check for chirality.

The question lists seven compounds, and I have to determine how many are optically active. Let's go through them one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, Z configuration. Let me draw this out. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is connected to Cl and two CH2 groups? No, wait, wait. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. Oh wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 with a methyl group.

Wait, structure: C1 is Cl and double bond. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with the double
