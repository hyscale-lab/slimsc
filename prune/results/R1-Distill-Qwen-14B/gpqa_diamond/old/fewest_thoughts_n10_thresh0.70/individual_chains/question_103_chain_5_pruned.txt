Okay, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem. The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I need to look at the options and see which sequence of reactions will give the desired product with high yield.

First, let's think about the target molecule. The structure is a phenyl group with substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. Specifically, there's a bromine at the 3 position and a nitro group at the 5 position. Also, it's attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one), meaning the benzene ring is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O).

So, benzene needs to undergo several reactions to add these groups in the correct positions. Let's break down the necessary steps.

1. **Nitration**: To introduce the nitro group. Nitration is typically done with HNO3 and H2SO4 as a catalyst. The position where the nitro group attaches depends on the directing groups present.

2. **Bromination**: Introducing bromine. Bromination of benzene is done with Br2 in FeBr3 as a catalyst. But the position again depends on the directing groups.

3. **Introducing the acetyl group (CH3CO-) to form the ketone.** Acetylation can be done using CH3COCl with AlCl3 as a catalyst, which is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. If there are deactivating groups present, like nitro, that could interfere.

Wait, the nitro group is a strong meta-directing group. If we nitrate first, then the next substitution (like bromination or acetylation) will be directed to the meta position relative to the nitro group. But we need the substituents at 3 and 5, which are meta to each other. Hmm, perhaps the order of introducing the groups matters.

Wait, the target has bromine at 3 and nitro at 5. So, if we start with benzene, maybe first nitrate it, which would add a nitro group at position 1 (let's say para position if we're numbering in a certain way, but maybe I should think about the ring positions carefully).

Wait, benzene is symmetric, so let's think about the numbering
