Okay, so I have this question about a transmission electron microscope and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, let me try to think it through.

So, the setup is that Mike designed a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is that with such low pressure, there aren't many gas molecules around, which is good for electron microscopy because fewer gas particles mean less scattering of the electron beam, right?

But even in this ultra-high vacuum, some gas particles remained. The mass spectrometer detected them, so Mike found the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. I remember the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecule, and P is pressure.

So before the electron beam was turned on, the mean free path was λ1. But when he started the electron beam, he noticed that the mean free path became λ2, which is different from λ1. The question is, how does λ2 compare to λ1?

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? The temperature of the sample compartment remained the same, so T is the same. The pressure is also the same because the pumps are running and the system is under ultra-high vacuum. So the only factor that might change is related to the electron beam itself.

Oh, right! When the electron beam is operating, especially at high voltages like 1000 kV, it can cause various effects. One of them is that the electron beam might ionize the residual gas molecules. Ions have a much longer mean free path because their mass is higher and they're charged, so they interact less frequently with the walls or other particles? Or wait, actually, ions have a different behavior. Or maybe it's more about the electrons from the beam hitting the gas molecules, causing them to become charged.

Wait, when gas molecules are struck by high-energy electrons, they can become ionized. So the neutral gas atoms become ions. Ions have a different mass, so their mean free path would change. But wait, the formula for mean free path depends on the diameter of the particles. Ions are bigger? Or similar in size? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, but the mean free path formula is inversely proportional to the square of the diameter. If the ion's diameter is larger, the mean free path would decrease. But wait, another thought: when a gas is ionized, the effective pressure changes because you have charged particles which might be affected by electric fields, but in this case, the system is in a vacuum, so maybe the ions just move freely.

Alternatively, when the gas is ionized, the effective pressure might change because the number of ions is lower? Or perhaps the mean free path changes because the collisions are now between ions and electrons or other ions, but that's more about the type of collisions.

Alternatively, the electron beam could cause heating of the gas molecules. But the question states
