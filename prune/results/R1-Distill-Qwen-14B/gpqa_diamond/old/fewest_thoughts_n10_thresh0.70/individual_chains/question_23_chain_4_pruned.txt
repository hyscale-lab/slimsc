Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a reaction involving a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. The options are A, B, C, D, and I need to pick the correct products based on the reaction and the TLC results.

First, let me read the question again. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, wait, that's a mouthful. Let me parse that structure. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether is connected to a but-3-en-1-yl group, which has two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure looks like benzene-O-(CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?), but wait, no, the butenyl group is but-3-en-1-yl. So that's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond starting at position 3. Wait, no. Let me count: but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait no, but that's but-1-en-3-yl or similar. Wait, perhaps it's the structure where the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but but has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because but-3-en would imply positions 3 and 4, but but has only four carbons. So the structure must be CH2-CH2-CH-CH2, with a double bond from C3 to C4. Wait, but that would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond? Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out.

The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, but that can't be because but-3-en-1-yl would be where the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but but has four carbons: 1
