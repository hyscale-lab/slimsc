Okay, so I have this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation describes the current-voltage behavior in semiconductors, specifically in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V^2)/(L^3).

Wait, I think the SCLC regime is when the current is limited by the space charge—so the electric field is so strong that the charge carriers are generated in such a way that they create their own space charge, which then limits the current. So in this case, the dominant current transport mechanism is probably a combination of drift and maybe some field emission.

The question is about the validity conditions of the Mott-Gurney equation. So I need to look at the options and see which conditions apply.

The equation is given as J proportional to V squared over L cubed. I remember that in the SCLC model, the current is due to the emission of charge carriers from the electrodes, and the electric field is determined by the space charge.

Let me think about the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation. I think the derivation assumes that the device is single-carrier, meaning either electrons or holes, but not both. Because if it's a two-carrier device (like both electrons and holes contributing), the equation might be different. So the equation is for a single-carrier case. So any option that says two-carrier can probably be eliminated. Looking at the options, option D says two-carrier, so maybe D is incorrect.

Another point: what about the contacts? Ohmic or barrier contacts. The Mott-Gurney model assumes that there's no injection barrier. Wait, Ohmic contacts allow carriers to flow without much barrier, so if the device has an Ohmic contact, that would mean that the carriers can move easily, perhaps leading to the conditions needed for SCLC. But wait, wait. If there is an injection barrier, like a Schottky contact, then the current might be limited by the tunneling or emission at the barrier, which might not fall under the SCLC regime. Or wait, in the SCLC model, the space charge is built up, which would imply that the current is due to the movement of these carriers in the bulk, not from injection through a barrier. So maybe the model assumes that the contacts are Ohmic, so that the carriers are freely injected, but the space charge builds up, leading to the SCLC.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under certain conditions. Let me try to recall. The derivation assumes that the current is due to the emission from the cathode, and that the space charge is such that the electric field is E = (V)/(L), where L is the device length. But wait, isn't the electric field in a capacitor-like structure (like a diode with space charge) E = V/(L), but with some correction due to the space charge itself? Or maybe that's another model.

Wait, another thought: the SCLC model is applicable when the space charge is so dominant that it creates a region where the electric field is E = (9/2) (V/(L)) ), but wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, the Mott-Gurney equation comes from the Child-Langmuir law, which applies to field emission. Oh wait, the Child-Langmuir equation says that the current density is proportional to V^2/(L^3), which is similar to the equation here. Because in the Mott-Gurney equation, the same form appears, so maybe it's the same as the Child-Langmuir result.

Wait, so Child-Langmuir is for field emission, where the emission is due to the electric field at the cathode. The Mott-Gurney equation is for space-charge-limited current, where the space charge modifies the electric field. So in that case, the Mott-Gurney equation is the correct one for SCLC.

So the Mott-Gurney equation applies when the space charge is significant enough that the current is limited by the space charge itself, not by the contact barriers.

So for the equation to be valid: the device must be single-carrier, because if both electrons and holes are moving, the space charge would behave differently. So options with two-carrier can be eliminated. So option D is two-carrier, so out.

Now, about the contacts. The Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the contacts are Ohmic, because if the contacts have a Schottky barrier, then the current might be limited by the barrier, which would complicate the SCLC scenario. But wait, Mott-Gurney applies when the current is limited by the space charge, so maybe the barriers are negligible in that case. Or perhaps the equation assumes that the injection is efficient, so that the carriers are available to contribute to the space charge. Ohmic contacts would allow easy injection, so the current isn't limited by the contact but by the space charge.

Another point: the equation ignores traps. If there are traps (defects or impurities), they could capture the carriers, leading to different current behavior. So the equation is valid for a trap-free device because traps would complicate the space charge dynamics. So the device should be trap-free.

Looking at the options, option B says trap-free, single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier. Wait, no carrier injection barrier—so that would imply Ohmic contacts. So device has no injection barrier, which is Ohmic. And it's trap-free, single-carrier.

Option A: trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible drift current. Hmm, wait, the equation includes mobility (μ), which is related to drift current. So if drift current is negligible, would that affect the equation?

Wait, in the Mott-Gurney equation, the current is due to the space-charge-limited drift. So maybe drift is significant and diffusion is negligible. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, in the SCLC regime, the current is due to drift under the influence of the electric field. The space charge creates an electric field that causes the carriers to drift. So drift is the main mechanism, not diffusion. So if the equation includes μ, which is the drift mobility, then it's considering drift current.

So if someone said 'negligible drift current', that would imply the equation doesn't apply. So looking at the options:

Option B: negligible diffusion current. Hmm. Because in the derivation, we probably assume that the space charge is built up, and the carriers are drifting, so diffusion is perhaps not the main factor. So if diffusion is negligible, that's acceptable.

Option A: negligible drift current. No, because drift is what's causing the current. So if drift is negligible, the equation wouldn't hold.

So looking at the options:

A) ... negligible drift current. That would make the equation invalid, because the equation depends on drift.

B) ... negligible diffusion current. That's acceptable because the model assumes drift dominates.

C) Schottky contact. Which would imply a barrier, which would mean the current is limited by the barrier, not the space charge. So the equation wouldn't apply.

So option B says 'trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current'. No injection barrier implies Ohmic contacts, which allows easy injection. So trap-free, single-carrier, no injection (Ohmic), negligible diffusion. So this aligns with the conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation.

Wait, but let me think again. The equation includes the mobility, which is a drift parameter. So the model must involve significant drift, not diffusion. So if the current is dominated by drift, then diffusion is negligible. So the conditions would require that diffusion is negligible, but drift is accounted for.

So looking at the options, option B says 'no carrier injection barrier' (so Ohmic, so no barrier to injection) and 'negligible diffusion current', which fits. So B is a possible correct option.

Option A says 'negligible drift current', which would make the equation invalid, so A is incorrect.

Option C says 'Schottky contact', which implies a barrier, so current could be limited by that, not by space charge, so C is incorrect.

So the correct statement is option B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current-voltage behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation, given as 

\[
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3},
\]

is derived under specific assumptions about the device and operating conditions. To determine the validity of the equation, the following points are considered:

1. **Single-Carrier Device**: The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices (either electrons or holes) because the presence of both electrons and holes (a two-carrier device) would complicate the space-charge dynamics. This eliminates **Option D**, which refers to a two-carrier device.

2. **Trap-Free Device**: The equation assumes that the device is trap-free, as traps (defects or impurities) would alter the space-charge behavior and make the equation invalid. This eliminates any option that does not explicitly state "trap-free."

3. **Ohmic Contacts**: The equation assumes that the contacts are Ohmic, meaning there is no significant injection barrier. If the contacts were Schottky barriers, the current could be limited by the barrier rather than the space charge, making the equation invalid. This eliminates **Option C**, which refers to a Schottky contact.

4. **Drift vs. Diffusion**: The Mott-Gurney equation relies on drift current, as the space-charge-limited current is driven by the electric field created by the space charge. Therefore, the equation assumes negligible diffusion current, as diffusion is not the dominant transport mechanism in this regime. This supports **Option B**, which specifies "negligible diffusion current."

5. **No Carrier Injection Barrier**: The equation assumes that the device has no carrier injection barrier, which is consistent with Ohmic contacts. This further supports **Option B**, which explicitly states "no carrier injection barrier."

Given these considerations, **Option B** is the correct choice because it aligns with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation: a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
