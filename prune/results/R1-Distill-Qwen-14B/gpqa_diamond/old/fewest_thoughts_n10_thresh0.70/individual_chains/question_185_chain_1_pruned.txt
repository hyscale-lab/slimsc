Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Let me think about how to approach this.

The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n vectors. So, H = ε σ · n.

Wait, σ here are the Pauli spin matrices. Right, each of them is a 2x2 matrix. And n is a unit vector, which I guess means it's a direction in space. But since n is arbitrary, maybe the specific direction doesn't matter for the eigenvalues—just the magnitude or something else.

So, I remember that for Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues of a spin component operator like σ · n should be ±1. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and combining them in a direction should give the same kind of result, just multiplied by a scalar.

Wait, but wait. The Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. So σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Each of those σ matrices has eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by the respective Pauli matrix. So the operator σ · n is a sum of these, each scaled by components of n. But since n is a unit vector, the sum should still have eigenvalues ±1, right? Because any linear combination with unit vector coefficients would have the eigenvalues the same as the individual ones, I think. Because the direction doesn't change the maximum and minimum values.

So if σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, then when I multiply by ε, the eigenvalues become ±ε. So the eigenvalues of H are ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. That seems right.

But wait, maybe I'm forgetting something about the Pauli matrices. Let me think again. Each Pauli matrix (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) has eigenvalues ±1. So when we take a linear combination of them with coefficients that are components of a unit vector, the resulting matrix (σ · n) should have eigenvalues of ±1 as well because the magnitude of the coefficients is 1. The eigenvalues come from solving the equation (σ · n - λ I)|ψ> = 0, leading to λ^2 =1, so λ=±1.

So yes, the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1. Then, multiplying H by ε gives eigenvalues ε*(1) and ε*(-1
