Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, maybe they forgot to normalize it? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized. So I probably need to normalize this vector first before proceeding.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me compute its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))[-1, 2, 1]^T. Okay, that's important because all the probabilities depend on that.

Next, the problem introduces two operators, P and Q. The matrix for P is given. Let me write it down:

P =
[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

And Q's matrix is:
Q =
[1, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, -1]

The question is: What's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first and then Q.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. Oh, no, the sequence is measurement of P first, then measurement of Q. But wait, the wording says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". So the process is: measure P, then Q.

But wait, the measurements are done in sequence, so the state might collapse after each measurement. So we first measure P, get 0, then measure Q on the resulting state. But wait, the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So the combined probability of these two outcomes.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, when we measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the measured operator. So after measuring P and getting outcome 0, the state becomes the eigenstate of P corresponding to 0. Then measuring Q on that state will give the probability of -1.

Alternatively, is there a way to compute this without dealing with the post-measurement states? Hmm, perhaps.

But first, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q.

Let me start with operator Q since it seems simpler.

Operator Q is a diagonal matrix with entries 1, 0, -1. So its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. So for eigenvalue 1: [1;0;0]; eigenvalue 0: [0;1;0]; eigenvalue -1: [0;0;1].

Wait, wait. Let me check. The matrix Q is diagonal, so yes, the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, and eigenvalues are the diagonal elements. So, the eigenvalue 0 corresponds to the second basis vector.

Now, for operator P. Let's find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it again:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm. So P is a symmetric matrix, so it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

To find the eigenvalues, I can compute the determinant of (P - λ I) and set it to zero.

The matrix (P - λ I) is:

[ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]

[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - 1/sqrt(2) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, I'll write the determinant using the rule for 3x3 matrices.

So determinant = 

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] 

- 1/sqrt(2) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] 

+ 0 * [ anything ]

So let me compute each term.

First term: -λ * (λ² - (1/2) ), since 1/sqrt(2)^2 is 1/2.

Second term: -1/sqrt(2) * ( -λ / sqrt(2) ) 

Third term is zero.

So let's compute:

First term: -λ (λ² - 1/2 ) = -λ^3 + (λ)(1/2)

Second term:

-1/sqrt(2) * (-λ / sqrt(2)) ) = (λ)/(2) 

So adding all terms: 

(-λ^3 + (λ/2 )) + (λ/2 ) = 

-λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2 = 

-λ^3 + λ = 0

So the equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² +1 ) =0 → λ (1 - λ² )=0 → λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So when we measure P, possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

But the problem is about measuring P and getting 0.

So the eigenvalue we're interested in is 0. Let's find the eigenvectors for P when λ=0.

So for P - 0 I = P.

We can set up the equations:

Row 1: 0 x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0 z = 0 → (1/sqrt(2)) y =0 → y=0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) x +0 y + (1/sqrt(2)) z =0 → (1/sqrt(2))(x + z )=0 → x + z=0 → z= -x.

Row 3: 0 x + (1/sqrt(2)) y +0 z = 0 → same as row 1, y=0.

So, the system reduces to y=0, z= -x. So the eigenvector is any vector of the form [x, 0, -x]^T, which can be written as x [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is [1, 0, -1]^T, up to a scalar multiple.

But wait, I should check normalization. The eigenvector [1,0,-1] has a norm squared of (1)^2 +0 + (-1)^2 =2. So normalized, it becomes (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the eigenspace for P=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by [1,0,-1]^T normalized.

So when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses into this eigenvector. 

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Wait, but wait. The initial state is [-1, 2, 1]^T, but normalized. So when we measure P, the probability of getting 0 is the square modulus of the inner product between |ψ> and the eigenvector |p0>, which is the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0.

Wait, the eigenvector for P=0 is [1,0,-1]^T, normalized as (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1]. So let me compute the inner product between |ψ> and this |p0>.

Wait, |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,2,1]. So inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1*(1/sqrt(2)) ) + 2*0 + 1*( -1/sqrt(2) ) ]

So that's (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ] = (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-2/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Which is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-2/sqrt(2)) ) = -2/(sqrt(6)sqrt(2)) ) = -2/ (sqrt(12)) ) =-2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

The square modulus is ( -1/sqrt(3) )^2 = 1/3. So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Okay, so that's the first part. The probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenvector |p0> = [1,0,-1]^T / sqrt(2).

Now, we need to measure Q on this new state. The operator Q has eigenvalues 1,0,-1, as before.

We need the probability that Q is measured as -1. Since Q is diagonal in the standard basis, the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors.

So the state after P=0 is |p0> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

We can write this as ( |e1> - |e3> ) / sqrt(2), where |e1> and |e3> are the first and third standard basis vectors.

Now, when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. The probability of each outcome is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding basis component in |p0>.

But wait, the state |p0> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1]^T. So the components are:

Component 1: 1/sqrt(2)

Component 2: 0

Component 3: -1/sqrt(2)

So when we measure Q, which in the standard basis, the probabilities are:

- Probability of Q=1: |1/sqrt(2)|² = 1/2.

- Probability of Q=0: |0|² =0.

- Probability of Q=-1: |-1/sqrt(2)|²=1/2.

Wait, but that's a problem because the probabilities should add up to 1. 1/2 +0 +1/2=1. So that works.

But the question is about the probability of getting Q=-1 in the second measurement.

So the probability is 1/2.

Wait, but wait. When you have a state |p0>, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue of Q is the square modulus of the amplitude in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector.

In this case, the state |p0> is (1/sqrt(2)) |e1> + 0 |e2> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |e3>.

So the amplitude for Q=1 is 1/sqrt(2), so probability is 1/2.

Similarly, for Q=-1, the amplitude is -1/sqrt(2), so probability is 1/2.

So the probability of getting Q=-1 is 1/2.

But wait, the original question is about the joint probability of P=0 and Q=-1.

So the overall probability is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given P=0.

So total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Wait, that would be the case only if the measurements are independent, but in quantum mechanics, the second measurement is done on the state after the first measurement. So in this case, the second measurement is dependent on the first.

So the initial calculation is correct. The probability P(P=0) is 1/3. After that, the state is |p0>, so the probability P(Q=-1 | P=0) is 1/2. So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

But wait, let me double-check the steps.

1. Normalize the initial state: correct.

2. Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P: done, found that 0 is an eigenvalue with eigenvector [1,0,-1]^T normalized.

3. Compute the probability of P=0: correct, 1/3.

4. After P=0, the state is |p0> = (1/sqrt(2))[1,0,-1]^T.

5. Compute the probability of Q=-1 in this state: 1/2.

6. Multiply the two probabilities to get the joint probability: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the answer should be 1/6, which is option D.


The problem involves determining the joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) for a quantum system with a given initial state and operators \( P \) and \( Q \). Here's the analysis:

1. **Initial State Normalization**:  
   The initial state is given as \( \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is computed as:  
   \[
   \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
   \]  
   The normalized state is:  
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)**:  
   The operator \( P \) is given by:  
   \[
   P = \begin{bmatrix} 
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]  
   Solving for the eigenvalues, we find \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is:  
   \[
   |p_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Probability of \( P = 0 \)**:  
   The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the overlap between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |p_0\rangle \):  
   \[
   P(P=0) = \left| \langle p_0 | \psi \rangle \right|^2.
   \]  
   Compute the inner product:  
   \[
   \langle p_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \left( -1 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot (-1) \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
   \]  
   The probability is:  
   \[
   P(P=0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
   \]

4. **State After \( P = 0 \)**:  
   If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the state collapses to \( |p_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

5. **Probability of \( Q = -1 \)**:  
   The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:  
   \[
   Q = \begin{bmatrix} 
   1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
   0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
   0 & 0 & -1 
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]  
   Its eigenvalues are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with eigenvectors being the standard basis vectors. The state \( |p_0\rangle \) is expressed as:  
   \[
   |p_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |e_1\rangle - |e_3\rangle \right).
   \]  
   The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( |e_3\rangle \) in \( |p_0\rangle \):  
   \[
   P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left| \langle e_3 | p_0 \rangle \right|^2 = \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]

6. **Joint Probability**:  
   The joint probability of \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:  
   \[
   P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
   \]

**Final Answer**:  
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
