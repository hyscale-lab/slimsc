Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. The question is about the Cope rearrangement of a specific compound. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. That means a six-membered transition state is involved, right? It typically occurs in 1,5-dienes, moving the substituents in a way that forms a new six-membered ring or rearranges substituents. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure here, so let me think more carefully.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So that's a norbornene structure, I believe. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound with two rings: a five-membered and a six-membered ring? Or wait, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, so it's a bridged bicyclic system with two rings.

Looking at the structure, the substituents are at position 2. There's a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached, and it's also an azabicyclo, so there's a nitrogen in the ring. Wait, the numbering is a bit confusing. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene: the bridgeheads are positions 1, 4, and 5? Or maybe 1, 2, etc. Wait, no. Let me think. Bicyclo[m.n.p] means the numbers are the bridge lengths. For [2.2.1], the main bridge has 2 carbons, another bridge 2, and the third bridge 1. So the structure is something like a norbornene, with two rings: a five-membered and a six-membered, but with a bridge.

Now, the substituents: position 2 is where the vinyl group and the nitrogen are. Wait, the compound is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the nitrogen is at position
