Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, it's about angular momentum in quantum mechanics. So, considering two electrons in p orbitals. Wait, I remember that p orbitals have l = 1. So each electron has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. 

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1, 1, 2, -1>. Wait, that notation is |l1, l2, l, m>, right? So l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number. But wait, the maximum possible l when adding two angular momenta is l1 + l2. So 1 + 1 = 2. So that's correct.

The question is about measuring L1z and L2z, the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum. We need to find the joint probability that both have eigenvalues of -ħ.

Wait, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is l, and the z-component is m. So for each electron, Lz can be -lħ, ..., +lħ. So for l=1, possible m values are -1, 0, +1. So, for each electron, the possible eigenvalues are -ħ, 0, +ħ.

But the state is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so the total angular momentum quantum number is l=2, and m= -1.

Now, when you have a coupled state, the individual states aren't in the product basis. So to find the probability of certain individual outcomes, I think you have to expand the coupled state into the product basis.

Wait, the product basis is |l1, m1> |l2, m2>. So the coupled state is a linear combination of these product states.

So the state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = m = -1.

But since l=2, the possible m values are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. So for each m, we have a certain combination.

Wait, but our state is |l=2, m=-1>, so it's a specific state. But how do we get the product states from the coupled state?

I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are involved here. Clebsch-Gordan coefficients describe how the coupled states are built from the product states.

Wait, for two p orbitals (l1=l2=1), the total angular momentum can be 0,1,2.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific state in that total l=2 multiplet, m=-1.

So, to find the expansion in terms of product states |m1, m2>, we can write:

|1,1,2,-1> = sum_{m1, m2} <m1, m2 | 2, -1> |m1, m2>

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <m1, m2 | 2, -1> is non-zero only when m1 + m2 = -1. So possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-2) but wait m2 can't be less than -1 because l2=1, m2 can be -1,0,1. So 1,-2 is not possible because m2 can't be -2. So only possible pairs are m1=-1 and m2=0, and m1=0 and m2=-1.

So the state |2,-1> is a combination of | -1,0> and |0,-1>.

Wait, what's the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m1=-1 and m2=0? Let me think. The general formula for CG coefficients when the total state is |l, m> is given, and for two l=1 states. 

Wait, for |l=2, m= -1>, the expansion would be:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( ( (2*(2+1)) ) ) something... Wait, maybe I should recall the explicit form. 

Alternatively, I can think about the possible product states contributing to |2,-1>.

The product states are |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

So possible m1 and m2 pairs are:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → product state | -1, 0 >.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → product state |0, -1>.

But wait, are there any other possibilities? m1=1 and m2=-2 → but m2 cannot be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can't be less than -1. Similarly, m1=-2 is impossible. So only those two product states contribute.

So the state |2, -1> is a linear combination of | -1,0> and |0, -1>:

|2,-1> = a | -1, 0> + b |0, -1>

What are the coefficients a and b?

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1 and l2=1, adding to l=2 and m=-1. 

I think the CG coefficients for |m1, m2> → |M=2, m=-1>.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the general expressions.

Wait, the CG coefficients for two p orbitals (l1=l2=1) adding to l=2.

The state |l=2, m= -1> can be written as:

sqrt( ( (2*(2+1)) ) ) but I'm a bit rusty. 

Wait, another approach: the CG coefficients for two l=1 states adding to l=2.

The general formula for CG coefficients is:

< m1, m2 | l, m > = sqrt( [ (2l +1) (l - m1 + m2)! (l + m1 - m2)! ) / ( (l + m1 + m2 +1)! (l - m1 - m2)! ) ) ] ) * something.

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to remember specific values.

For l1=1, l2=1, l=2:

The state |2, 2> is |1,1>.

|2, 1> is (|1,0> + |0,1>)/sqrt(2).

|2, 0> is (|1,-1> + |0,0> + |-1,1>)/sqrt(3).

Wait, wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.

Wait, for l1=1 and l2=1, the possible m1 and m2 are each -1, 0, +1.

So for l=2, m=2: only m1=1, m2=1 → |1,1>.

For l=2, m=1: m1=1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=1.

So the state is (|1,0> + |0,1>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for l=2, m=0: the possible (m1, m2) are (1,-1), (0,0), (-1,1).

So the state is (|1,-1> + |0,0> + |-1,1>)/sqrt(3).

Wait, no, that's for l=1 and l=1 adding to l=2, but I think the coefficients are different. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the general formula for CG coefficients. The CG coefficient <m1, m2 | l, m> is:

sqrt( [ (2l +1) (l - m1 + m2)! (l + m1 - m2)! ) / ( (l + m1 + m2 +1)! (l - m1 - m2)! ) ] ) × certain signs.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the expansion for |2, -1>.

Since m = m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible pairs are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

So the state |2, -1> is a linear combination of | -1, 0 > and | 0, -1 >.

The question is: what are the coefficients?

I think the CG coefficient is symmetric for these cases. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait another approach: the normalization condition.

The state |2,-1> must be orthogonal to other m states, but that's not helpful now.

Wait, perhaps the coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) each. Because for m=1 in l=2, it's (|1,0> + |0,1>)/sqrt(2). So perhaps for m=-1, it's (| -1, 0 > + |0, -1 > ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let's test normalization.

The state |2,-1> is a combination of two states, each with coefficient a and b.

The sum of squares of the coefficients should be 1.

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

If it's (| -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) / sqrt(2), then the coefficients are 1/sqrt(2), so the sum is (1/2 + 1/2) = 1. That works.

So let's proceed under the assumption that the state is (| -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) / sqrt(2).

So the coupled state |2, -1> is [ | -1, 0 > + |0, -1> ] / sqrt(2).

Wait, this is crucial. So in terms of the product states, the state |2,-1> is a combination of these two.

Now, the question is, what is the probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ.

That would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, because L1z |m1> = m1 ħ |m1>, same for L2z.

So we're looking for the component where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

But looking at the two product states in the expansion:

The first term is | -1, 0 > → m1=-1, m2=0.

The second term is |0, -1> → m1=0, m2=-1.

Neither of these product states has m1=-1 and m2=-1.

So the coefficient for | -1, -1 > in the expansion is zero.

Therefore, the joint probability is zero.

Wait, but wait a minute. The state |2,-1> is an eigenstate of Lz with eigenvalue -ħ, but it's a combination of product states where each electron's m is -1 and the other's m is 0, or one is 0 and the other is -1.

So there's no component in the | -1, -1 > product state.

So when you measure L1z and L2z, the possible outcomes are:

Either (m1=-1, m2=0) or (m1=0, m2=-1).

So the probability of getting both m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero.

Therefore, the joint probability is zero.

Looking back at the options, option D is 0.


To solve the problem, we analyze the coupled angular momentum state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), where \( l_1 = 1 \), \( l_2 = 1 \), \( l = 2 \), and \( m = -1 \). The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) and obtaining eigenvalues of \( -\hbar \) for both.

### Step 1: Coupled State Expansion
The coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) is expressed as a linear combination of product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the \( z \)-components of orbital angular momentum for the two electrons. Since \( m = m_1 + m_2 = -1 \), the possible pairs \( (m_1, m_2) \) are:
- \( (-1, 0) \)
- \( (0, -1) \)

Thus, the coupled state can be written as:
\[
|1,1,2,-1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |-1, 0\rangle + |0, -1\rangle \right)
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Measuring \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \)
The joint probability of measuring \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \) corresponds to the coefficient of the product state \( |-1, -1\rangle \) in the expansion of \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \). From the expansion above, there is no \( |-1, -1\rangle \) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \( |-1, -1\rangle \) is zero.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since the coefficient of \( |-1, -1\rangle \) is zero, the joint probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is:
\[
P = 0
\]

### Final Answer:
The joint probability of obtaining \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is \( 0 \).
