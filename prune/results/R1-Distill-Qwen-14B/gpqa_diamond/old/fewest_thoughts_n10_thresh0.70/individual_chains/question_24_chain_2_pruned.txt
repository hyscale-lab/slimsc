Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves mixtures X and Y, hydrogenation reactions, and some properties of substances involved. Hmm. I'll try to break it down.

First, the setup: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. So, when bromine water (Br2) is present, and a substance causes it to decolorize, that usually means the substance has double bonds. Because alkenes (with C=C) react with bromine, causing it to decolorize. So X must have two liquids, each with double bonds, maybe alkenes or maybe something else like conjugated dienes or aromatic rings. But wait, the problem says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So no conjugated dienes or aromatic rings. So the liquids in X probably are simple alkenes, maybe mono-alkenes.

Then, when X is treated with platinum (Pt) under heat, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. This reaction is a disproportionation, which means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. So, X must be a molecule that can undergo such a reaction.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. Oh, no, wait. Wait, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it forms Y. So, X is a mixture, but Y is formed from X through this reaction. So maybe X is a single substance that decomposes or reacts to form two products Y1 and Y2 in equimolar amounts.

Wait, but the problem says X is a mixture of two liquids. Oh, maybe each component of X can undergo a reaction. Hmm, perhaps each component undergoes a different reaction, but leading to a mixture Y with two new liquids. Or maybe the two components of X each undergo some reaction, but each gives one product, and all four are in the mixture Y. No, wait, but Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each component of X produces one component of Y. So, X has two components, each reacting to form one component in Y. So, equimolar. So if X is equimolar in two components, and each component in X reacts to form one component in Y, then Y would be 1:1 as well
