Okay, so I've got this question about NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly fine, except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Those peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So maybe it's not a coupling issue because the integrals together are correct. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so it's not like they're splitting each other.

Then there's the LC-MS part. The crude sample shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So they have the same molecular weightâ€”so same compound? But why two peaks then?

Wait, the options are about possible explanations. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Hmm, the LC-MS would show two peaks if the crude has both the product and the precursor. But the question says both have the same mass as expected, which is the product. So a precursor would have a different mass. So A probably not.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, same NMR shifts except in chiral environments. But in NMR, if the sample is racemic, the alpha protons (if they are in identical environments in each enantiomer) would show as a single peak, because the NMR can't tell them apart. Unless it's a chiral column in LC, but the question says the peaks have same mass, and the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. So if it's racemic, why two NMR peaks? Because maybe the synthesis is not enantioselective, but in NMR, you wouldn't see separate peaks unless something else is going on. But the problem states that the two NMR peaks integrate to 1H. So if it's enantiomers, they wouldn't split into separate signals in 1H NMR. So maybe B is not the right answer.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Wait, double coupling... Oh, in amide bonds, sometimes when the coupling isn't clean, like when you have side reactions, you can form more than one product. Wait, but how does that affect the NMR? Maybe if two different diastereomers form, but that leads me to option D.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers would have different physical properties, so they'd show up as separate peaks in LC-MS. In the NMR, each diastereomer would have their own set of protons, possibly leading to two separate signals for the same proton in each isomer. So in the NMR, you'd see two peaks for the same proton if the diastereomers have different environments for that proton. But how does that fit with the integral adding to 1H?

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. If the compound is a diastereomeric mixture, two different structures would each have that proton, but in different environments. So each would have a separate peak. But the integrals would add to 1H because each peak corresponds
