Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's read the question again carefully.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

The options are A to D with various expressions. Alright, so I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally v_medium = c/n. Oh wait, but this is when the medium is at rest relative to the observer, right?

But in this case, the medium (the glass) is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed of the light beam? I think this is a case where we need to consider the Doppler effect or maybe relativistic velocity addition because the medium is moving relative to the observer.

Wait, no, wait, the Doppler effect is usually for sound or light frequency changes when sources or observers are moving. But here, the question is about the speed of the light beam, not the frequency or wavelength. Hmm.

So in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. But in a medium, it's different because the medium's motion could affect the light's speed as observed.

Wait, but when the medium is moving, how does that influence the speed of light within it? I'm a bit confused. Let me think about it step by step.

Let me consider the glass medium moving at velocity v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v.

The speed of light in the glass is, in its rest frame, v_glass = c/n. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_glass = 1/n (since c=1). But the glass is moving through the lab frame at velocity v. So how do we find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame?

I think this is a problem where we need to perform a Lorentz transformation because velocities don't just
