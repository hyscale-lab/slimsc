Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answers. Let's take it step by step.

The first part of the question is about the reaction between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that when a ketone reacts with an acrylate ester, it's likely a conjugate addition or maybe a Michael addition. But wait, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. That probably means it's promoting an elimination reaction, maybe an E1cb mechanism or some kind of enolate formation.

Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, but the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me draw the structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone (O) at position 1, and substituents at 2 (ethyl), 2 (another methyl?), wait no, wait the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. Oh, so position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or position 2 is ethyl, and position 6 is methyl? Wait the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the 2 position has an ethyl and a methyl, making it a substituent. So the ring has the ketone at C1, and at C2, there's an ethyl and a methyl group.

So the structure would have the ketone at C1. C2 has two substituents: ethyl and methyl. C6 has a methyl. So the ring looks a bit crowded around C2.

When t-BuOK is present, it's going to deprotonate something. But where? In a ketone like this, the alpha protons are at the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. So in this case, the alpha carbons are C2 and C3 (since the carbonyl is C1). Wait, in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C1, so C2 is adjacent. So the alpha hydrogens are on C2 and possibly C6? Hmm, but the substituents at C2 and C
