Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different starting materials and reactions. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the given options.

Starting with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under acidic conditions and heat to form product A.

Hmm, I remember that in such conditions, especially with heat, pericyclic reactions like Claisen or Cope rearrangements might occur. Wait, but the starting material here is an amine with two methoxy groups. Oh wait, maybe it's a case for the Claisen rearrangement? Or perhaps the Cope? Let me think about the structures.

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have an ethanamine backbone where both carbons are substituted with methoxy groups. Wait, no, the structure is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So ethanamine is NH2CH2CH2NH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. But in this case, it's 1,1-dimethoxy, so it's (CH3O)2CH-NH2? No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be H2N-C(OCH3)2. So the nitrogen is attached to a carbon that has two methoxy groups and another group, which is the amine.

Wait, perhaps it's more like (CH2OCH3)2NH, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is (CH2OCH3)2CH-NH2? No, wait, the 1 refers to the position on the ethane chain. So it's CH2(NH2) with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. So it's CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Or perhaps the amine is on a central carbon connected to two meth
