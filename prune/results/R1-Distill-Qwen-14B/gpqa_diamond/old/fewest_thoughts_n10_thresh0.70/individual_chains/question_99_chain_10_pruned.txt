Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct structure of a compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is an unknown, and they've used FTIR and 1H NMR to characterize it. Let me look at the data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Hmm, I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Oh wait, because the question is about identifying the product, and the options have a COOH group. So that makes sense. The second strong peak is at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that fits with a carboxylic acid group, since they have both C=O and O-H.

Now onto the 1H NMR. Several peaks, none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds, which makes sense because all the options don't have any vinyl groups; they all seem to be branched alkanes with a COOH group.

Looking at the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another a doublet of triplets of triplets. Okay, so these are complex splitting patterns, which suggests that each proton is split by multiple neighboring sets of protons.

Let me think about how splitting works. Each neighboring set of equivalent protons will split the signal into a number of peaks equal to that set's multiplicity + 1. So for example, a triplet would cause a splitting into 3+1=4 peaks. But if there are multiple neighboring groups, each with their own number of protons, the splitting becomes more complex.

So, what kind of structure would lead to such splitting? Probably a system where a single proton is next to multiple sets of protons, each causing their own splitting.

Looking at the options, the structures are all similar, with a COOH group attached to a carbon chain. Let me sketch them out.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So that's (CH3)(C2H5)C(H)-C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Wait, no, better to write it as:

The main chain is CH2CH2... Wait, maybe it's a 2-carbon chain leading to the COOH. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's structure:

Option A: The structure is (CH3)(C2H5)C(H)-C(CH2CH3)(CH3)CH2COOH? No, wait, the formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So it's a central CH2 group attached to COOH, but wait, perhaps each CH is connected to two substituents. Let me imagine the structure.

Wait, perhaps each of the central carbons is connected to three substituents. Let me think: For option D, for example, the structure is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the COOH is on the fourth carbon, right? Wait, no, perhaps it's a four-carbon chain where the middle two carbons each have two substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a geminal di-substitution on two adjacent carbons. For example, the two central carbons each have two methyl and one ethyl groups? I need to think more carefully.

Let me try again. The options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, perhaps each structure is a four-carbon chain, with substituents on C2 and C3, leading to COOH on C4 (options B and D) or C5 (options A and C? Wait, no, let me count.

Wait, for option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

So the structure is: CH2CH2... No, wait: the formula is CH
