Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when compounds are chiral, right? Chiral means they have a non-superimposable mirror image, so they can rotate plane-polarized light. I remember that a molecule must have a chiral center, or maybe another type of chirality like axial chirality, to exhibit optical activity.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. Let's take them one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   I'm picturing this structure. It's a biphenyl compound, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2,2' and 6,6' on each ring. The nitro groups are substituents, and the carboxylate groups are esterified with methyl. So, the structure must have some sort of symmetry. Wait, since the substituents are at symmetric positions, maybe this molecule has a plane of symmetry. Or perhaps the biphenyl arrangement allows for some kind of chirality.

   Wait, biphenyls can have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis. For example, in biphenyls, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from being superimposable on its mirror image, then it can be chiral. So, if the substituents are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry, the molecule can exhibit optical isomerism.

   Looking at compound 1, the nitro groups are at 6 and 6' positions, and the ester groups at 2 and 2'. So, is there a possibility of cis or trans arrangements here? Wait, no, the question is about whether it has optical isomerism, so it's about whether the molecule is chiral. 

   Alternatively, maybe the substituents create a chiral center. But in this compound, each carbon (like the ones attached to the ester groups) is connected to two phenyl rings, but wait, no, the structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], so each phenyl is connected directly to each other. The substit
