Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a solution contains a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

Hmm, okay. Let's break down the molecular formula first. C10H14. For benzene derivatives, the general formula is CnH2n-6. So if n is 10, wait no, wait, benzene is C6H6. So if the compound is C10H14, subtracting the benzene ring (C6H5), we have C4H9 attached. Oh wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The formula for a mono-substituted benzene is C6H5R, where R is the substituent. So if the overall formula is C10H14, that's C6H5-C4H9, but wait, C6H5 is C6H5, which has 5 H's, and then the substituent is C4H9, which would have 9 H's? Wait, but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene. Let me think.

Wait, the molecular formula C10H14. For an aromatic compound, the degree of unsaturation can help. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation. Which could be one benzene ring (3 double bonds or equivalent) and one ring (like another benzene? No, because that's more H). Alternatively, one benzene ring (3 degrees) and one double bond or another ring. Wait but C10H14 would be a monos
