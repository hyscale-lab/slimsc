Okay, so I've got this question about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other.

The question says an electron is traveling at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Wait, I think the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is often written as Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and Δx is the uncertainty in position. Since the question asks for the uncertainty in energy, I probably need to connect Δp to ΔE.

Momentum p is mass times velocity, right? So p = mv. The uncertainty in momentum Δp would be mΔv, but wait, wait! Actually, the speed v is given, but the uncertainty is in the momentum, which relates to the velocity uncertainty via Δp = mΔv. But wait, the question gives the speed, but not the uncertainty in speed. Hmm, maybe I can make an assumption here. Oh, wait, perhaps the given speed v is the average speed, and the uncertainty in momentum is related to the uncertainty in position via the uncertainty principle.

Alternatively, maybe the question simplifies things by considering that the uncertainty in momentum is roughly the momentum of the electron multiplied by some factor due to the uncertainty in velocity. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle in terms of energy and time is another form, but in this case, since we're dealing with position and momentum (and hence kinetic energy), maybe I should stick to the Δx and Δp version.

So, starting with the uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2.

I can rearrange this to find Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx).

Once I have Δp, I can find the uncertainty in kinetic energy. The kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), so the uncertainty in E, ΔE, would be approximately ( (Δp)^2 )/(2m), assuming that Δp is small compared
