Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about quasars and the comoving distance. Hmm, let's see. The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak around 790 nm in near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. Wait, I remember something about quasars and their emission lines. Oh right! The Lyman-alpha emission line is a prominent line in quasars, but it's at about 121.6 nm. But wait, why is there a peak at 790 nm?

Oh! That must be due to redshift. Because 790 nm is much longer than the rest wavelength of Lyman-alpha. So if the observed wavelength is longer, the quasar must be moving away from us, causing the redshift. So the observed wavelength λ_obs is 790 nm, and the rest wavelength λ_rest is 121.6 nm.

Redshift z is calculated by the formula (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1. Let me compute that. So 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately... Let me calculate. 121.6 * 6 is 729.6, which is less than 790. 121.6 * 6.5 is, let's see, 790.4. Oh wait, 6.5 times 121.6 is 790.4. So 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.5. So z is 6.5 - 1 = 5.5. So the redshift z is about 5.5.

But wait, sometimes when the quasar's light has to pass through intergalactic medium, there's the Gunn-Peterson trough at wavelengths longer than Lyman-alpha. But I think that's more relevant for very high redshifts, like z > 6. But I'm not sure how that affects the current question.

The question is about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. The universe is described by the Lambda-CDM model with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m=0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and it's flat (so Omega_k=0).

Comoving distance is the distance we use to express the position of objects in the universe at a given redshift, considering the expansion of the universe. The comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H(a)) da, where a is the scale factor (a=1 now, a=1/(1+z) at emission). Alternatively, using integrals involving the Hubble parameter over redshift.

Wait, no, the comoving distance formula can be a bit tricky. Let me think. The comoving distance is the distance that would be measured between two points if you could somehow measure perpendicular to the line of sight, accounting for the expansion. It's given by D_C = (c / H0) * integral from 0 to z of dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda).

Alternatively, for a flat universe, E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_λ). Since in this case,
