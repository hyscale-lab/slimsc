Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, let's see what the question is.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, so I can focus just on the orbital part. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. I think that means each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l1=1 and l2=1. The total angular momentum quantum number is l=2, and m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each particle. They ask for the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ. Wait, does that mean both L1z and L2z are -ħ? So what's the probability of that happening?

I remember that for angular momentum, the eigenvalues are Lz = mħ. So for each electron, the eigenvalue would be mħ. So if we're measuring L1z and L2z, and we want both to be -ħ, that would mean m1 is -1 and m2 is -1 for each, right? Because L1z = m1 ħ, so if it's -ħ, m1 is -1.

But wait, in the coupled state, we have a total m of -1. But each electron's m can vary, but their sum should equal the total m. So in this state, the total m is -1. So when we measure m1 and
