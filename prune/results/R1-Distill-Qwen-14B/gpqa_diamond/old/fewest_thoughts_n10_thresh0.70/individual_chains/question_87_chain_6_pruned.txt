Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem says I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester) and an aromatic-halogen bond (so there's a halogen attached to the ring, like Cl or Br). I need to look at the 1H NMR data and pick the correct option.

First, I should break down the structure. The ring is 6-membered, aromatic, and di-substituted, meaning two substituents are attached. The total carbon count is 8. Let's calculate: the benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must add 2 carbons. But wait, di-substituted implies two substituents, each possibly containing multiple carbons. Wait, 6 + substituents = 8. So substituents add 2 carbons in total. Hmm, but each substituent can't have more than one carbon, because that would exceed the total. Wait, maybe one substituent is a -OCH3 (but that's only one carbon), or another group. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester.

Wait, wait, wait. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group, so one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group. Also, there's an aromatic-halogen bond, so another substituent is a halogen. So substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

But wait, wait. Let me clarify: each substituent is a single group? So for a di-substituted benzene, each substituent is a single group attached to the ring.

So benzene has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. Wait, but wait, the carbonyl could be part of a larger substituent. Let's think. If the substituent is a ketone, that's just a carbonyl attached directly. But wait, that would be a substituent with one carbon (like a benzyl ketone?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acyl group, like an acetyl group, which is -COCH3. That would
