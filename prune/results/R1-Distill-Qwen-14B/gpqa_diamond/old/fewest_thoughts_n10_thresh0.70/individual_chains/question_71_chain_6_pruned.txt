Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says there are five exoplanets, all in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, the periods for each planet are:

Planet 1: 1 unit
Planet 2: 2 units
Planet 3: 2.5 units
Planet 4: 3.5 units
Planet 5:5 units

Wait, orbital period is the time a planet takes to orbit its star. The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star, right? And if they have the same albedo, then other factors like the star's luminosity and the planet's distance are the main things to consider.

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 + e) )^(1/2) ), but since the albedo is the same for all and assuming circular orbits (so e=0), the formula simplifies. Wait, but actually, the formula I recall is T = T_eff * (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:

T = T_earth * (P / P_earth)^( -1/3 )

Wait, but that's assuming that the star is the same as the Sun. Alternatively
