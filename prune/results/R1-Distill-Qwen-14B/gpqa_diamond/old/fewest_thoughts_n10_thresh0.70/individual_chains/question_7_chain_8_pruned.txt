Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The question is asking at what energy a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe would be limited by this process. The options are given in GeV units, so I'll need to figure out the right calculation.

Hmm, I remember that when two particles collide, their combined energy has to meet certain conditions. In this case, the reaction is gamma-gamma annihilating into an electron-positron pair. The equation is γγ → e+ e-. I think this is related to pair production. Oh right, pair production requires that the combined energy of the two photons is enough to create the rest mass of the electron-positron pair.

Wait, but wait. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV each, so together that's 1.022 MeV. But wait, since it's a pair, the total rest mass is twice the electron mass, so yes, 1.022 MeV. But wait, the problem is about the gamma-ray's energy. So the CMB photons are at much lower energy, around 1e-3 eV, as given.

So each CMB photon has energy E_photon ≈ 1e-3 eV. The gamma-ray's energy is E_gamma, which is much higher. So the process is when a high-energy gamma and a CMB photon combine to produce the pair.

But wait, for pair production to happen, the center-of-momentum energy must be at least 2*m_e*c^2. So the condition is that sqrt(s) >= 2*m_e*c^2, where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy.

But the center-of-mass energy squared s is given by the product of the two photon energies multiplied by (1 + cos(theta)), where theta is the angle between them. To get the maximum possible s, the photons are moving in opposite directions, so theta is 180 degrees, so cos(theta) is -1. Then (1 + (-1)) is 0, which would not be correct. Wait, no, wait: for the maximum energy, the photons are moving in the same direction? Or opposite?

Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the frame where one photon is moving in the +x direction and the other in the -x direction. Then, in the center-of-mass frame, their energies would add in a way that gives the maximum possible s.

Alternatively, the maximum possible s occurs when the two photons are moving in opposite directions. Because when you have two photons moving in opposite directions, their combined energy is such that the invariant mass is higher.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall the formula for the square of the center-of-mass energy when two photons collide. Each photon has energy E1 and E2, and their momenta are vectors. So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2.

Since photons are massless, E = |p| c, so the momentum vectors are p1 = E1/(c) * direction vector of photon 1, and p2 = E2/(c) * direction vector of photon 2.

So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 (d1) + E2 (d2))^2 c^2 / c^2.

Wait, maybe it's easier to calculate in terms of the energies and the angle between them. The formula for s is s = 2 E1 E2 (1 + cos(theta)), where theta is the angle between the two photon momenta. Because each photon's momentum magnitude is E_i / c, and the dot product is E1 E2 (cos(theta)) / c^2. So when you compute (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2, you get (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - ( (p1 c + p2 c) . (p1 c + p2 c) ) )

Which is (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - ( E1^2 + E2^2 + 2 E1 E2 cos(theta) ) ) 

E1 and E2 are in units where c=1? Wait, maybe I should use natural units where c=1. So, E1 = |p1|, E2 = |p2|. Then s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 + p2)^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( |p1|^2 + |p2|^2 + 2 p1 · p2 ) )

But |p1| = E1 and |p2|=E2. So,

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1^
