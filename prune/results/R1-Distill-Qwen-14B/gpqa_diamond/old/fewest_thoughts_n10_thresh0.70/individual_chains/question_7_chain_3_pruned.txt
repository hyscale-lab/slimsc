Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The process is gamma plus gamma going into electron-positron pairs. The question is asking at what energy the gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this process, given that the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV.

Hmm. I remember that high-energy particles can interact with the CMB, and their lifetimes are affected by such interactions. So, I think this is about the interaction rate determining the mean lifetime of the gamma-ray. The higher the energy, the more likely they are to interact, so their mean free path is shorter, limiting their lifetime.

Wait, the interaction cross-section probably plays a role here. The cross-section for pair production via CMB photons would depend on the energy of the gamma-ray and the CMB photon. Since the CMB photons are low energy, but the gamma-rays are high energy, their energies would be such that the product can produce an electron-positron pair.

I think the process is gamma + photon -> e+ + e-. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics.

So, the cross-section for this process must be calculated. I remember that the cross-section for pair production via CMB photons (or any photon) for a gamma-ray with energy E is given by some formula. Maybe it's proportional to (E_photon * E_gamma) / m_e^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the cross-section for this process is given by the Klein-Nishina formula or something related to photon-photon interactions.

Wait, actually, the cross-section for two photons (gamma and another photon) annihilating into e+ e- pairs. The formula I think is sigma = (8π/3) * (α^2 / (4π^2)) * (m_e^2 / (E1 E2)) * ln( ... ), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I think that for high-energy photons, the cross-section can be approximated as sigma ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 / (4 E_gamma E_CMB)) ) * something, but maybe I should think in terms of the threshold condition.

Wait, the threshold for pair production is when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass is 2 m_e c^2, but since we're in units where c=1, it's 2 m_e. But wait, the CMB photon is much lower energy than the gamma-ray.

Wait, the CMB photon has energy E_cmb ≈ 1e-3 eV, and the gamma-ray has energy E. To produce an electron-positron pair, the sum of their energies must be at least 2 m_e, but since the photons are so low energy, that condition probably isn't the limiting factor. Or is it?

Wait, no. The center of mass (CM) energy squared must be at least (2 m_e)^2. So, s = (
