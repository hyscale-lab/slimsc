Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about an aperture shaped like a N-sided polygon with all apothems of length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining vertically onto this aperture, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. And N is infinitely large. Oh, right, so when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle, right?

Wait, but wait. Wait, the apothem of a polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. So if all apothems are the same length 'a', then when the polygon becomes a circle, the apothem 'a' would be equal to the radius of the circle. Because in a circle, every point on the circumference is equidistant from the center, so the apothem becomes the radius. So the aperture is effectively a circular aperture when N is infinite. That makes sense.

So this problem is essentially about the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. The far-field diffraction pattern, or Fraunhofer diffraction. I remember that for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a series of concentric rings, but the central maximum is quite large, and the minima occur at specific angles.

Wait, what about the angular positions of the minima in a circular aperture? I think for the first minima, the formula involves the first zero of the Bessel function. Oh right, because the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is given by the Bessel functions. The intensity pattern has zeros where the Bessel function of the first kind of order zero, J0, equals zero.

But I'm a bit rusty on the exact positions. I recall that the first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs at an angle θ where J1(ka sinθ) = 0, but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, for the single-slit diffraction, the minima are given by sinθ = mλ/(d), but that's for a single slit, not a circle. 

Wait, for a circular aperture, the positions of the minima are found by solving J_n(k a) = 0, where n is the order, and a is the radius. Wait, but for a circular aperture, the primary maxima and the minima occur at specific Bessel function zeros.
