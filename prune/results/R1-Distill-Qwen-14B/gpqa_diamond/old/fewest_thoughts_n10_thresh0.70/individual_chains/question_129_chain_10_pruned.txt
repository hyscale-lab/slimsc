Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me try to walk through this step by step.

First, let's read the problem carefully. The reaction scheme goes like this:

Compound A → reacted with HCN → Compound B.

Compound B → reduced with H2 and Pd → Compound C.

Compound C → reacted with HNO2 → Compound D.

Compound D → elimination of an inert gas → Compound E.

Then, there are some hints and options given. The options are all possible structures for E, so I need to figure out the structure based on the reactions.

Looking at the hints, hint a) says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, right? So this reaction is a Wittig reaction. The product has a cyclopentane ring with substituents. Let me draw that structure to visualize it.

The product from the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, right? Because propan-2-yl is CH(CH3)2, but as a ylid it's CH2-C(CH3)=.

In the Wittig reaction, the ylide adds to a carbonyl group, forming an alkene. So compound A must have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to some substituents. The ylide is attacking the carbonyl, and the oxygen is leaving as part of the reaction.

So compound A is a cyclopentanone with substituents. Let's think—since the product has methyl groups at 1 and 2 and a substituent at 4, perhaps in compound A, the carbonyl is at position 4, and the ring has methyl groups at 1 and 2.

Wait, the product has substituents at 1,2, and 4. Let me imagine the cyclopentane ring. Positions 1, 2, and 4. So if the carbonyl is at position 4 in compound A, the Wittig would add a double bond from the ylide. Hmm, but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is at a different position.

Let me think about the Wittig reaction mechanism. The ylide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes O- which then leaves as part of the elimination. So the carbonyl group (C=O) is converted into a CH₂ group connected to
