Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to determine the suitable reagent A and catalyst B.

Hmm, so I remember that when amines react with carbonyl compounds under acid catalysis, it's typically an example of a condensation reaction, maybe something like a Schiff base formation. Wait, but in this case, the product seems to have a cyclohexylidene group attached. Let me think about the structure.

3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with one nitrogen, right? The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the substituent on the pyrrolidine is a cyclohexylidene methyl group. That suggests that the cyclohexyl group is connected via a double bond to the pyrrolidine.

Wait, so the structure would have a cyclohexene ring attached to the pyrrolidine via a methylene group (CH2) but as a double bond. So like, the pyrrolidine has a CH2 group that's connected to a cyclohexene ring. That would make the substituent a cyclohexylidene methyl group.

Now, what kind of reaction forms such a structure? I'm thinking about the possible reactions between amines and carbonyl compounds. Oh! Maybe it's an example of the Hantzsch dihydropyridine synthesis, but that's typically for forming 1,4-dihydropyridines. Or perhaps it's a Mannich reaction? Wait, no, the Mannich reaction involves an amine, a ketone, and an aldehyde. But another possibility is the formation of an imine or a Schiff base.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if compound A is an aldehyde, then maybe the reaction is forming a Schiff base with the amine.
