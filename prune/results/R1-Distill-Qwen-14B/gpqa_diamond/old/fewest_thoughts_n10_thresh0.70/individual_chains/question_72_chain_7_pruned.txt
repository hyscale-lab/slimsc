Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully. The problem involves a series of reactions leading to a final product, and I need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in that product.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I think I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is norbornane, a bicyclic structure. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, the structure has that bicyclic system with an ether oxygen attached to a tert-butyl group.

The first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. Wait, this sounds like an elimination reaction or possibly a substitution. Oh, but with two equivalents, maybe it's a di-elimination or di-attack. 

Looking at 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, each of those dibromomethyl groups is Br2C-. So, when treated with a base or a nucleophile, they can undergo elimination. Maybe it's an E2 mechanism. Since there are two such groups, perhaps each will lose a bromide, forming two alkenes. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the iodide replaces the bromide, but that seems less likely given the conditions.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of a base, like maybe the sodium iodide provides iodide ions, which are good nucleophiles. So maybe each of those di-bromomethyl groups undergoes a substitution, replacing Br with I, but that might not make sense here. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination, where each Br leaves, and a double bond forms between the adjacent carbons. That would mean that each of the two dibromomethyl groups would form a double bond, but wait, the starting material is already a diene. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So
