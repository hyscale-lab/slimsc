Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about finding the energy spectrum for a particle in a specific potential in two dimensions. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, potentials often lead to different types of equations, like the harmonic oscillator or something else.

Wait, so the potential here has two terms. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks like a standard harmonic oscillator potential because the potential for a 1D harmonic oscillator is (1/2) m ω² x², and ω² is proportional to k/m, right? So that part is like the radial part of a 2D harmonic oscillator.

The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Cos²θ reminds me of angular parts, perhaps related to the angular momentum or something in spherical coordinates. But wait, this is in two dimensions, but still expressed in polar coordinates (r,θ), I suppose θ is the angle in the plane, so 0 to 2π.

Let me think about the form of the potential. So V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, because 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ = (1/2)kr² (1 + 3 cos²θ). That might help in simplifying or recognizing the form.

In polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a particle is something like H = (-ħ²/(2m)) (1/r ∂(∂r)/∂r r + (1/(r²)) ∂²/∂θ²) + V(r,θ). So I need to plug in this particular V into that.

Wait, but perhaps this potential can be rewritten in terms of other coordinates or into a form that's easier to solve. Alternatively, maybe it's separable into radial and angular parts.

Alternatively, I've heard about effective potentials when dealing with angular parts. Let me think about how to separate the variables.

Wait, the potential V(r,θ) has a dependence on both r and θ. So, perhaps the Hamiltonian can be expressed in such a way that the θ part is an angular oscillator
