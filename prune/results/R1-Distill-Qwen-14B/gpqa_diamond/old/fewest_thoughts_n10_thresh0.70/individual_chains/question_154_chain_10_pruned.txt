Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which structure corresponds to the spectral data given. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown white solid from its spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to match the spectral clues to one of them.

Let me start by looking at the mass spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's also a peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, the molecular weight is 156, so the fragment at 158 is a bit confusing. Wait, maybe it's an isotope? Chlorine has a high mass number, so maybe there's Cl in the molecule. Let me think: Cl has a mass of about 35, so if the molecule has Cl, the molecular ion would have a certain isotopic pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the 158 is a fragment, not a molecular ion. Or maybe it's a result of some other process. I'll keep that in mind as I look at other data.

Next, the IR spectrum. There's a broad peak between 3500 and 2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually suggest either an -OH group (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or an amine. But looking at the options, I don't see any amine-containing compounds. So maybe it's an -OH group. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That peak is indicative of a carbonyl group. The 1720 region is usually associated with either a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids typically have a broader peak due to O-H stretching, but in the IR provided, the broad peak is separate from the 1720. Hmm, so perhaps it's a carbonyl group without a strong O-H, like an ester or acid chloride. Wait, wait, another thought: the broad peak could be from an -OH group, like in a phenol or a carboxylic acid, but the 1720 is a strong carbonyl. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the N
