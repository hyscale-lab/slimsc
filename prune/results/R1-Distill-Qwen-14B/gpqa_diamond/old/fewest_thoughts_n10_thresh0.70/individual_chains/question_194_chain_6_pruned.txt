Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). Right, so I need to consider all possible configurations of S1, S2, S3.

Each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I can list them all, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, since each S is either +1 or -1, the products S_i S_j will be +1 if the spins are the same, and -1 if different.

So, the energy E is -J times the sum of these products. Let me think about how to compute E for each state.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the number of states that have a particular value of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. That way, I can group states with the same energy together and compute the sum more efficiently.

Let me denote the sum as S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term S_i S_j is ±1, so S can range from -3 to +3, but wait, actually, let's think about it. How many possible values can S take?

Each term is either +1 or -1. So the sum can range from 3 (all +1) to -3 (all -1), but wait, no. Let me compute possible sums.

Wait, for three terms, the sum can be 3 (if all three products are +1), 1 (if two +1 and one -1), -1 (if two -1 and one +1), or -3 (all products are -1).

Wait, is that correct? Let's see: each product is +1 or -1.

Wait, the sum S can be:

- 3: all three products are +1.

- 1: two +1
