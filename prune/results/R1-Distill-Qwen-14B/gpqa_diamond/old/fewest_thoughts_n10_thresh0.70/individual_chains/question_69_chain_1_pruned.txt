Okay, so I've got this physics problem here from the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question involves particle decay, proper lifetime, and calculating some minimum resolution. Oh boy, I need to think this through step by step.

So, the problem states that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is tau_0, which is given as 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The question is asking what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The options are A to D, with various values in meters.

Wait, first, what's the proper lifetime? Oh right, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, we have to consider time dilation, right? So the observed lifetime (tau) would be gamma times tau_0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated using E = gamma * m c². Oh wait, the energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So E is the total energy of the particle, which includes its rest mass energy. Therefore, gamma must be E divided by m. Let me write that down.

Gamma = E / (m c²) → but wait, since E is given in GeV and m is also in GeV/c² (assuming), the c² will cancel out in units. So gamma is just E/m.

So E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let me do that calculation.

27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. So gamma is approximately 7.917. So the observed lifetime tau is gamma * tau_0. So tau = 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that.

7.917 * 8 = 63.336, so tau is 63.336e-16 s, which is
