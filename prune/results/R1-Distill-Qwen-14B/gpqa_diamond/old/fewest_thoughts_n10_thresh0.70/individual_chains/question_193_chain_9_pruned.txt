Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given a specific relation involving parallax. Hmm.

Alright, the question states that in a certain region of the sky, the number of stars varies with the parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula would be something like N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right! The parallax (plx) in parsecs is inversely proportional to the distance (r) in parsecs. So plx = 1/r. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Wait, so if plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. So I can substitute this into the equation for N. Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and since plx is 1/r, substituting gives N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's simplify that exponent. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

So the number of stars is proportional to r^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, wait, I think that's about the number per unit distance, or maybe the differential number. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of differentials.

Let me think again. The number of stars varies as r^5. So how does the number per unit distance change with r? Oh, wait, because if N is the number in a small range dr around r, perhaps the question is about dN/dr, the rate at which stars increase with distance.

Wait, no, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Hmm. Or perhaps it's simply how N depends on r, but considering that the number of stars depends on the volume, which goes with r^3. Oh, that's the usual case, but here the relation is different.

Wait, let's get back. The number of stars in a volume is usually proportional to the volume, which is
