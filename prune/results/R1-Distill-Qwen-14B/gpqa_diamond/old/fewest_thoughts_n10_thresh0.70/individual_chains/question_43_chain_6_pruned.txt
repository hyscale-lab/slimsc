Okay, so I have this IUPAC naming question about a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, I remember that the numbering in benzene rings starts at the functional group with the highest priority, and goes in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers.

Wait, right, the functional groups' priority order is important. So the substituents are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group. Oh, and there are some others too: ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Also, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are ortho to the nitrile.

First, let me list all the substituents:

1. Carboxylic acid (COOH)
2. Carbaldehyde (CHO)
3. Cyano group (CN)
4. Hydroxyl (OH)
5. Dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2)
6. Methoxy group (OCH3)

The ring is benzene, so it's a six-membered ring. Now, I think the substituents are arranged as meta to each other. Wait, the question says they are all meta to one another. Oh wait, the carboxylic acid, the carbaldehyde, and the cyano group are all meta to each other. So each of them is meta to the others.

Wait, no, maybe I misread. The question says: "a benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another." So each substituent is meta to the others. So, that would arrange them in a sort of triangle around the ring, each separated by two carbons? Or maybe in a meta arrangement, each being meta to the others.

Wait, but benzene has six positions. If three substituents are meta to each other, how does that work? Let me think: For a benzene ring, if substituent A is at position 1, then substituent meta to A would be at position 3 and 5. But if all three are meta, maybe each at 1,3,5 positions. Wait, but in that case, each is at position 1,3,5 (like in a symmetrical way). Alternatively, perhaps the three substituents are in such a way that each is meta to the others.

But the question also
