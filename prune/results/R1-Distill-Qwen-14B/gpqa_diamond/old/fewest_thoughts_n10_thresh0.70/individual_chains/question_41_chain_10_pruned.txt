Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

Alright, the question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. The glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is going in the same direction as the beam and the glass's motion. So the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Or wait, no, the question says the glass is moving toward the observer. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read that again.

Oh, the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Hmm, that's a bit conflicting. Wait, if the beam is moving in a certain direction and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, but also toward the observer. That might mean that the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is toward the observer. So, the glass is moving towards the observer, same as the light beam.

Wait, no, maybe I'm misreading. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Oh, perhaps the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is
