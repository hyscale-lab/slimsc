Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Hmm, let me read it again. So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But maybe that's not super relevant here.

The question gives me the equilibrium temperature ratios between the planets. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, that means Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by a factor of 1.4, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by 2.3. So, the temperatures are decreasing from Planet1 to Planet3.

Also, the mass ratios are given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So, Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is more massive than Planet3. So, masses are Planet1 > Planet2 > Planet3, but not by huge factors.

The question is asking about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. Specifically, by what factor is Planet3's period larger than Planet1's. They also mention that the albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. So, albedo isn't a varying factor here; it's fixed.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula, I think, is something like T = T_star * (L/L_sun)^(1/4) * (a/(1 AU))^-0.5, where a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, more accurately, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, maybe I have that mixed up.

Wait, no, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 + (1 - albedo)/4) )^(1/4) ), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The equilibrium temperature equation is:

T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s / (2a)) * ( (1 - a_p) / (1 + a_p) )^(1/4) )

Wait, no, maybe it's ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) in the numerator. Because the planet reflects some light (albedo a), so the absorbed is (1 - a), and the emitted is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Alternatively, another approach: the equilibrium temperature is given by the formula where the power received from the star equals the power radiated by the planet. So:

Luminosity from star at planet's distance: L * (R_star / (2a))^2, because the area is a sphere of radius R_star, and the planet intercepts a circle of radius R_star, but the power is spread over
