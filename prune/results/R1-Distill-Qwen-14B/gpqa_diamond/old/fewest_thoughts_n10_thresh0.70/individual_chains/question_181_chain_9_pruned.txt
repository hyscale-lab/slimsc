Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by understanding the question.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago, but all other reactions are still happening. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, it's flux band1 over flux band2.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch is the initial part where two protons collide, right? Then, there's the pp-II branch which involves the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle? Or wait, no, the CNO cycle is a different process altogether. Hmm, maybe I should get this straight.

Oh right! The proton-proton chain has two main branches. In the pp-I branch, two protons fuse into deuterium and release a positron and a neutrino. Then, in the pp-II branch, the deuterium nucleus fuses with another proton to form tritium, which then can either undergo another fusion (pp-III branch) to form helium-4 or go through other pathways.

Wait, when they say the pp-III branch stopped, what happens? The pp-III branch is one of the pathways in the proton-proton chain. So if that stops, the fusion process might be affected. But the question says all other reactions remained the same, so maybe other parts of the chain are still active.

Neutrinos are produced mainly in the pp chain. The majority of the solar neutrinos come from the pp-I branch, where the neutrinos are produced when a proton converts into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. But wait, I think the main neutrino emission is from the pp-I branch, and the pp-III branch is a minor contributor.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos from that branch would stop. But since other reactions are ongoing, the main pp-I and pp-II branches are still active, right? Or wait
