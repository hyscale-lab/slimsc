Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step.

Okay, the problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l = 1. So each electron has l₁ and l₂ equal to 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, that makes sense because when you couple two l=1 states, the possible total l values (l) can be 0, 1, or 2. Here, it's 2, which is the maximum possible, so that's the triplet state with maximum l.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z to be -ħ. So, we're looking for P(L₁z = -ħ and L₂z = -ħ). Since we're ignoring spin (the question says so), we're only considering the orbital angular momentum here.

First, I remember that the eigenvalues of L_z for each electron are m * ħ, where m can be -l, ..., l. Since l=1, each m can be -1, 0, +1. So for each electron, L_z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

The coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. I think this state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared (L²) and the z-component (L_z). But how does this relate to the individual L₁z and L₂z?

I think I need to express the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states of the individual states. Each product state would be |l₁,m₁; l₂,m₂>. So, the coupled state is a linear combination of these product states.

Wait, the coupled angular momentum states are formed by combining the two individual states. For two particles with angular momenta l₁ and l₂, the basis states are |l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂>. The coupled state |L, M> is a linear combination of these product states.

So, for |1,1,2,-1>, which is the state with total L=2 and M=-1. Let me think about the expansion of this state. How can two l=1 particles combine to give L=2 and M=-1.

The expansion coefficients can be found using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |1,1; 2, -1> would be a combination of the product states |m₁, m₂> where m₁ + m₂ = M = -1.

Wait, no, the state is |l₁, l₂, L, M>, so for each electron, their m₁ and m₂ must add up to M=-1.

So the possible (m₁, m₂) pairs that sum to -1 are (-1,0), (0,-1), and (1,-2) but wait, m can't be -2 because l=1, so m can only be -1, 0, +1. So the valid pairs are m₁ = -1
