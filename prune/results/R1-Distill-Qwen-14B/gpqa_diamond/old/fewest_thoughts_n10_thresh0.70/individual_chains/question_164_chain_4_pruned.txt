Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let's see what it's about. So, the question is asking about the mass of two systems, system_1 and system_2. The main thing here is figuring out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Alright, let's break down the information. Both systems exhibit eclipses, right? The periods are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. The period is the time between two primary eclipses, which I think relates to how long it takes the stars to orbit each other. So a longer period might mean they're farther apart, but I'm not entirely sure how that ties into mass.

Next, there are spectroscopic observations. These show radial velocity variations, which I remember are the Doppler shifts in the stars' spectral lines as they move toward or away from us. The amplitudes are given: system_1 has 10 km/s and 5 km/s for the two stars, and system_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. I think the radial velocity amplitude depends on the mass of the other star and the orbital period.

Wait, right, in a binary system, the more massive star would cause the smaller star to orbit it with a larger velocity. Oh wait, no, actually, the star with the smaller mass would have a larger orbit, hence a higher velocity because it's moving more. Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So the larger velocity amplitude would correspond to the less massive star.

So, in system_1, the two stars have velocities of 10 and 5 km/s. So the primary star (maybe the bigger one) would have a smaller velocity, right? Because if one is more massive, it doesn't move as much. So the 10 km/s star is less massive, and the 5 km/s is more massive? Or wait, I might be getting that backwards. Let me think. The star with the larger velocity is less massive because it's orbiting the more massive one. So for system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5. So 10 is higher, so that would be the less massive star. So the mass ratio would be (M1/M2), where M1 is the more massive star. So M1 would be the one with the lower velocity, M2 the higher? Wait, no, the mass is inversely proportional to velocity. So if M1 is more massive, then M1's velocity is smaller.

So the mass ratio (M1/M2) is (v2 / v1), because velocity is inversely proportional to mass when the orbital radius is the same. Wait, more accurately, from Kepler's third law, the mass of each star is proportional to the other's velocity times some function of the period. Let me recall the formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (2Ï€G / P)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )

Wait, but if we have a binary system, each star's velocity is proportional to the mass of the other. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, hence a smaller velocity. So the ratio of their
