Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about an unknown compound's identification using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question mentions that the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The data from each technique should give me clues about its structure and formula.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, a very broad peak could also be from an -OH group in something like a ketone? No, I think ketones don't have O-H. Oh wait, maybe an alcohol's O-H would be broader than other O-H groups. Or maybe it's a carbonyl group? No, the 1700 and 1650 regions are for carbonyls. Wait, the 3000 is probably O-H, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

Then, two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe conjugated double bonds. Wait, maybe it's an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Oh wait, aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹. So 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl like in an ester or maybe a conjugated double bond elsewhere.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, so that suggests there's an alkene or aromatic ring in the molecule. But since the FTIR doesn't show a strong peak in the 1450-1600 region (only 1700 and 1650), maybe the vinyl is part of a conjugated system, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak
