Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the percentage of a particular cobalt complex in a solution. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved here.

So, the setup is that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) provided are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I think these β values are for the complexes [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n increases with each β. So, β1 is for the first complex, maybe [CoSCN]^2+? Or maybe each β corresponds to adding another SCN-.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So I'm thinking that's the complex with two thiocyanate ions, which would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. So the species we're looking for is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. 

But wait, how do the stability constants relate here? I remember that the stability constant, β, for a complex [ML_n] is given by β = [ML_n]/([M][L]^n). So for each step, each βn represents the formation constant for the nth complex. So β1 is the constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- perhaps, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the charges wrong. Let me think: Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So [CoSCN]^+ would have Co^2+ + SCN^- → charge is 2 + (-1) = +1. So [CoSCN]^+ has charge +1. Then [Co(SCN)_2] would be Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → 2
