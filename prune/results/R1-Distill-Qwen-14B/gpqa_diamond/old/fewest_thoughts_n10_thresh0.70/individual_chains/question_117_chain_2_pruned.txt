Okay, I need to figure out which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Let's start by recalling what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they are not superimposable on their mirror images. This leads to the compound being able to rotate plane-polarized light.

So, the question has four compounds, and I need to check each one for chiral centers or other forms of stereoisomerism.

Let's go through each option one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, this seems a bit complex. Biphenyl rings connected at position 1, with substituents at 2 and 6 positions. The substituents are nitro groups and methyl esters. Wait, but if the substituents are all in the same positions on each ring, maybe there's a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, since biphenyls can rotate, maybe the configuration around the single bond allows for different stereoisomers. Oh, wait, but for a molecule to have optical isomers, it must have a chiral center or some form of stereoisomerism. Wait, in biphenyl systems, sometimes the arrangement can lead to cis and trans isomerism, but that's more about geometric isomerism, not optical. But can they have optical isomerism? I think if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So, in this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, for each ring, the substituents are on opposite sides? Or maybe the molecule is symmetrical, so it doesn't have a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the bridge between the two phenyl rings allows for some kind of asymmetry. Wait, but if the substituents are symmetrical, like if the nitro groups and esters are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, then the molecule would not be chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the two methyl esters are on the same side or opposite sides. Wait, the formula is dimethyl, so both ester groups are on the same side? Or perhaps the substituents are positioned such that the molecule is symmetrical. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about if this compound has
