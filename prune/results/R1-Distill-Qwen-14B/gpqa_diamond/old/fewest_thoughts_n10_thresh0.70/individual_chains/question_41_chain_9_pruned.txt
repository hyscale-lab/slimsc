Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, right? But that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the medium (the glass) is moving. So I guess I need to consider how the motion of the medium affects the observed speed of light.

Wait, but wait—Einstein's theory of relativity says that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of their motion. But this isn't a vacuum, it's glass. Oh, right, but in this case, the glass is moving. So maybe I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

So, the velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). Wait, let me make sure. If object A is moving at speed u relative to a medium, and the medium itself is moving at speed v relative to another frame, then the speed of the object relative to the other frame is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)), right?

Wait, but wait. Wait, in this case, the light is in the glass, which is moving. So normally, the speed of light in the glass is c/n. But that's when the glass is stationary. Now, since the glass is moving, maybe we need to apply the velocity addition formula to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Wait, but the light is moving with the glass, or not? Hmm. Let me think about frames. Let's say the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. Inside the glass, the light is moving at speed u = c/n, but in which direction?

Wait, the problem says the light beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the glass is moving towards the observer? Wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. The glass is moving in the same
