Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question. Let me read through it carefully and think step by step.

The question is about a bicistronic lox-Cre vector used to study a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The setup involves some transfection and mouse breeding, and the issue is that after using SOX10-Cre mice, there's no green signal observed under the confocal microscope. So I need to figure out why the GFP isn't showing up.

First, I'll try to understand the construct details. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) under the same promoter. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor has an IRES upstream, which typically allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed as a separate ORF from the same mRNA.

There are stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. So, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop with loxP, and the receptor has a stop with lox2272. Then, when Cre is introduced, which Cre variant does what? I remember that loxP is recognized by Cre, which excises the stop cassette. But wait, lox2272 is a variant of loxP that Cre can also recognize, but perhaps with a different recombination orientation.

Wait, when Cre is used, it causes the excision of the stop cassettes. So, in the presence of Cre, the ligand ORF is connected to mCherry because the stop is excised. Similarly, the receptor is connected to eGFP. So after Cre recombination, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, and the receptor as a fusion with eGFP.

But the question says that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in the wt background. They crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably under the control of SOX10 regulatory elements
