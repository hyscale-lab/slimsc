Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, let's try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll give it a shot.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different types of spaces, like spheres, hyperboloids, etc. The form of the metric might tell me what kind of surface we're dealing with.

So, the metric is written in terms of x and y, so it's probably in 2D, right? But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere makes me think of hyperbolic geometry. Oh, right! A pseudosphere has a constant negative curvature. But wait, I might confuse it with a sphere which has positive curvature.

Wait, the term 'pseudosphere' usually refers to a surface with hyperbolic geometry, like the tractricoid. But in the context of this question, perhaps it's a 2D space described by this metric. Let me analyze the metric.

So, the metric is conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of the flat metric (dx² + dy²). The conformal factor here is 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²). Let me rewrite that for clarity: the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y²
