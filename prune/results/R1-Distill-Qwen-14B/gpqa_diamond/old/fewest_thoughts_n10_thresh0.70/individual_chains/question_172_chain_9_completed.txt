Okay, so I have this physics problem about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let's try to break it down. 

The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, photosphere and LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies here. Right, in LTE, the distribution of energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I recall that the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature. The equation is something like (n2/n1) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). 

Wait, wait. Let me get that right. The ratio of populations n2 and n1 for two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. So if level 2 has higher energy, the number of particles in level 2 is less than level 1, right? Because higher energy states are less populated at lower temperatures.

In this problem, it's stated that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, does that mean n2/n1 is 2 for star_1 compared to star_2? Or maybe I need to think about how the excitation relates to temperature.

Wait, let's clarify. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So the number of atoms in that energy level is higher. So for star_1, the population of that level is twice that of star_2. So n1 (level) in star_1 is 2 times n2 (same level) in star_2? Or wait, perhaps I should define variables correctly.

Let me think: Let’s denote for each star, the population of the excited state as n. So, for star_1, n_1, and star_2, n_2. The problem states that n_1 = 2 * n_2.

But wait, the energy levels are the same for both stars, right? Because the problem refers to the same specific energy level in both. So the same ΔE applies to both.

Wait, actually, the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So for both stars, the same ΔE is considered.

So the Boltzmann equation for each star would be:

For star_1: n1 = N * exp(-E2/(k T1))
Wait, no. Wait, the Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, I might be getting confused. Let me write the exact formula.

Boltzmann distribution: For two energy levels E1 and E2 (E2 > E1), the ratio of the number of particles in E2 to E1 is given by (n2/n1) = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no, wait. The general form is n_i = C * exp( -E_i/(k T) ), where C is a normalization constant. So the ratio between two states is (n2 / n1) = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Right, so in our case, if star_1 has twice as many atoms in a certain energy level compared to star_2, let's assume that the ratio for each star is based on their own temperatures.

Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps the number in the higher energy level is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

Wait, but assuming that both stars have the same number of iron atoms, but that's not given. Hmm, perhaps the question is about the excitation in the same level, so maybe the ratio is between the same two levels for each star.

Wait, maybe it's better to write down the equations for both stars.

Let’s denote the energy levels as E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. The ratio for star_1 is (n1_2)/(n1_1) = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, the ratio is (n2_2)/(n2_1) = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T2) )

But wait, the question says that in star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that in star_2. But wait, perhaps the excited state is E2. So n1_2 is the number in E2 for star_1, and n2_2 for star_2.

Wait, maybe the statement is a bit ambiguous. It says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps for the same energy level, star_1 has twice the number of excited atoms as star_2.

Wait, but the same level. So, perhaps the ratio for each star is for the same level relative to another. Or maybe it's about the population of a certain level relative to the ground state.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is that the number in the specific level (E2) in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

So for star_1: n1_E2 / n1_E1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: n2_E2 / n2_E1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem states that the number in E2 for star_1 is twice that for star_2. So n1_E2 = 2 * n2_E2.

But wait, that's just for E2. How do n1_E1 and n2_E1 compare? Hmm, perhaps it's better to consider the ratio between the two stars for the same energy level.

Alternatively, perhaps because the problem is about the same energy level, but the excitation is higher. That is, the fraction of atoms in that energy level is higher in star_1. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the question states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps for the same energy level, star_1 has twice the number of atoms in that level. So n1 = 2 n2 for that level.

But wait, each star has their own n at that level. Let's say the level is E. So for star_1, the number is n1_E, and for star_2, it's n2_E. The problem states n1_E = 2 n2_E.

But according to the Boltzmann distribution, the number in a certain level depends on the temperature. So n1_E = (const1) exp( -E/(k T1) ), and n2_E = (const2) exp( -E/(k T2) ).

But wait, for each star, the number in level E is proportional to exp(-E/(k T)), but each star's normalization constant might be different.

But perhaps the ratio between the two stars can be considered. So n1_E / n2_E = [ (const1 exp(-E/(k T1)) ) / (const2 exp(-E/(k T2)) ) ]

Hmm, but the constants (const1 and const2) are the partition functions for each star, which would be different because T1 and T2 are different.

This could get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps assuming that each star's total number of atoms is the same? Not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the ratio of the populations for the same energy level in each star. So for star_1, the population is 2 times that of star_2 for the same level.

But without knowing the partition functions, that approach might not be straightforward. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the excitation levels is the same as the ratio of the Boltzmann factors. Let me think: the number of atoms in the excited state is proportional to exp(-E/(k T)), so for a given energy level E, n ∝ exp(-E/(k T)).

So if for star_1, n1 = 2 n2, then (n1)/(n2) = 2 = exp( -E/(k T1) ) / exp( -E/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to 2 = exp( E/(k T2) - E/(k T1) )

Taking natural log on both sides: ln(2) = (E/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm, that seems promising.

Because E is positive, and T1 and T2 are positive as temperatures.

So ln(2) = (E/(k)) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )

Wait, that's the same as ln(2) = (E/(k)) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) )

Because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, rearranging terms:

ln(2) = (E/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Hmm. So the equation we get is ln(2) equals (E/k) multiplied by (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But the problem gives E as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, wait, wait, that's interesting. Let me compute E/(k):

E/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So E/(k) is 1 K.

So substituting:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Hmm, so we can rearrange this as ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which can be written as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, that's exactly what we have. So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves two stars in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), where the number of iron atoms in a specific energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( n_2 \) and \( n_1 \) are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the populations in the same energy level are related by:

\[
\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}} = 2 = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying this ratio:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
