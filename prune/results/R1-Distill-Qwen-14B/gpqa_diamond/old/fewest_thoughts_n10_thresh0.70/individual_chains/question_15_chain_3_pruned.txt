Okay, so I have this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbit's orientation.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 orbits closer to its star because shorter period usually means closer orbit, right? Since orbital period relates to the distance via Kepler's third law.

The host stars have same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but same radius. Hmm, that might mean that the stars are different types, maybe Planet_1's star is a main-sequence star, and Planet_2's is a slightly evolved star, like a subgiant or something. But same radius, so their sizes are the same.

Transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit to the star. The probability is higher if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But I think the probability also depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the formula for the probability of a transit is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a, but I remember the exact formula being P = (R_star / a) ) * something else? Or maybe it's (R_star / a)^2 times another factor. Wait, no, perhaps the approximate probability is (R_*/a) where R_ is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

But wait, I think the actual formula for the transit probability is (R_* + R_p) / a * (1/(1 - e²))^½ ), where e is the eccentricity. But since both orbits are circular, e is zero, so it's just (R_* + R_p)/a. But since R_p is much smaller than R_*, maybe we can neglect it. So the probability is approximately (R_*)/a.

Wait, but wait, the exact probability is a bit more complicated. The transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Wait, no, I think it's more like (R_star / a) * (1/(1 - e²)) which, for e=0, becomes (R_star / a). Also, the probability is (R_*/a) multiplied by the solid angle factor. Or maybe it's (R_*/a) * ( (R_*/a) ) times another factor. Hmm, maybe I should look it up, but since I can't, I have to think.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is (R_*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but again, e=0 so it's just (R_*/a). Wait, no, perhaps the probability is (R_*/a) multiplied by a factor that depends on the alignment. Wait, no, the probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can be in front of the star relative to the viewing angle. So it's a function of the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, I think the formula for the probability is (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_p/R_*) ) ), but since R_p is much smaller, this is approx (R_*/a). So the higher the ratio, the higher the probability.

Wait, but wait, the actual probability is (R_*/a) * ( (R_* + R_p)/a ), but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, maybe better to think in terms of the geometry. The planet will transit only if its orbit is aligned such that the line of sight is within the plane. The probability is roughly (R_*/a) * (some
