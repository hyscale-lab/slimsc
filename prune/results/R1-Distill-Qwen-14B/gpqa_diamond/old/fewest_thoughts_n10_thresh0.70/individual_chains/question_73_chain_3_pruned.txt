Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The problem says: Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? In classical mechanics, relative velocity is u' = u - v, but at high speeds (like a significant fraction of c), we have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, because velocities don't just subtract normally when you're dealing with speeds close to c.

So the formula for relativistic relative velocity is (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Let me make sure I get that right. So astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut B at v = 0.5c. Wait, but wait—relative to what? Oh, I think the question is asking for the relative speed of one astronaut from the perspective of the other. So, say, what speed does astronaut A see astronaut B moving at? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, the problem says "relative speed" without specifying direction, but since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but using the relativistic formula. So the relative speed would be (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c²).

Let me compute that. So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c.

So numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So relative speed v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C
