Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles moving through a detector. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the setup is that particles are collided in the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time dilates and length contracts in special relativity. So gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). At high velocities, gamma gets large.

The key here is probably about how far the particles travel before decaying. Because the problem says these are fast-decaying particles. So, the ones that reach the detector's walls must have a longer lifetime from our perspective, or perhaps the distance they cover depends on their speed and lifetime.

Wait, the problem says that when gamma is 20, one third reach the inner walls. So, for two-thirds, the gamma must be higher or lower? Hmm. Let's think.

The particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance they can travel is the radius, which is 30 meters. So, the particles that reach the wall have to travel 30 meters before decaying. If a particle decays before reaching the wall, it doesn't contribute to the detection.

So, the probability that a particle reaches the wall depends on the product of its lifetime (from our frame's perspective) and its velocity. Because the lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame), and the velocity is a significant fraction of c, probably.

So, the average distance a particle travels before decaying is c * gamma * tau * beta, where tau is the proper lifetime, beta is v/c. So, the distance would be gamma * beta * c tau. If that distance is larger than 30 meters, the particle will reach the wall.

Wait, but in the current scenario, at gamma=20, one third reach the wall. So, the

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and detectors. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. Alright, the question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20 on average. 

Wait, the setup is that one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the inner walls of the detector. But the question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of them reach the inner walls instead? So I think I need to find a new gamma (Lorentz factor) that changes the fraction of particles reaching the detector walls.

I remember that in particle physics, the decay length is important. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. If the particle's speed is high enough, it has a longer decay length, meaning more particles will reach the detector's wall.

The decay length formula is something like L = gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime of the particle, c is the speed of light, and gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, beta is approximately 1, so beta is v/c ≈ 1.

So, in this problem, the initial condition is that with gamma = 20, only one third of the particles reach the inner walls. That implies that the decay length (L) is equal to the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. Because if the decay length is 30 meters, the particle has a 50% chance of decaying before reaching the wall. Wait, no, but the problem says that one third reach the wall. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the probability.

Wait, maybe the probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall is a certain value, and that relates to the decay length in some way. Oh right, the probability that a particle decays before time t is given by 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). But since the particles are moving at speed v, the time t is the time it takes to reach the detector wall, which is distance R/(beta c) = R/(c), since beta is ~1.

Alternatively, the proper lifetime is tau, so the particle's lifetime as
