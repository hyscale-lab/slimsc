Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

A light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The options are A to D, and we know the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in a medium and how it's affected when the medium is moving. Oh right, the index of refraction n is the ratio of c to the speed of light in the medium at rest. So in the glass, the speed would normally be v_glass = c/n. But in this case, the glass is moving, so does that affect the observed speed?

I think about this: when the medium is moving, the observer's frame is different from the medium's rest frame. So we probably need to use some sort of velocity addition formula, maybe from special relativity? Or is it just classical addition? Hmm, because the problem gives c as 1, perhaps relativistic effects are involved.

Wait, no. The index of refraction and the speed of light in the medium are usually based on non-relativistic considerations, but when the medium is moving, maybe the situation is more complex.
