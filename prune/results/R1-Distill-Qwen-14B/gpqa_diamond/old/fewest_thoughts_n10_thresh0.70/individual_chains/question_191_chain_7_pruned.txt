Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, cyclohexanone (a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 1). At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH. At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as isopropenyl, right? So that's CH2-C(CH2?), no wait. Let's see: propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH3)-. So the substituent is on carbon 2. So the structure at position 5 is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexane ring, with a double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl group on C2. So it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No,
