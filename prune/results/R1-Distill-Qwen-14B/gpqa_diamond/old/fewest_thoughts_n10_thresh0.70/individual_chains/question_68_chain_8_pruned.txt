Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * Sz. I remember that the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, and the energy levels depend on that. For a spin-1/2 particle, Sz can be +ħ/2 or -ħ/2.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the energy levels are E = -mu · B. Since mu is along Z, the energies are E_+ = -gamma*(ħ/2)*B and E_- = +gamma*(ħ/2)*B. Or wait, maybe I should double-check the signs. Oh right, the energy is -mu·B. So if mu is in +Z direction and B is +Z, then mu·B is positive, so E is negative. Yeah: E_+ = -mu B, but mu is gamma Sz, so E_+ = -gamma*(ħ/2)*B.

Then the field is turned off. Wait, when the field is off, the Hamiltonian is zero, right? Because the magnetic moment interacts with the field via the Hamiltonian H = -mu·B. So when B is zero, H=0, and the state doesn't change. But then another field is turned on along +Y. So now the Hamiltonian becomes H = -mu·B', where B' is along Y.

Wait, how does this affect the state? So initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz (since the field was along Z). Let's say it was in the |+z> state. Then, when the field is turned off, the state remains |+z> because there's no Hamiltonian to cause transitions. Then, when the field is turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian now is proportional to S_y.

Hmm, so the particle is in a state that's not an eigenstate of S_y. So
