Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2 based on the given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the metric is given as ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that denominator looks like 4 minus (x² + y²), which would be similar to the equation of a circle. Oh right, because x² + y² = r² gives a circle of radius r, so 4 is the square of 2. So the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which I guess means that the domain of x and y is such that 4 - (x² + y²) must be positive. Otherwise, the metric would become imaginary, which doesn't make sense. So x² + y² must be less than 4. That puts us on a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but this is a pseudosphere? Or a sphere? I remember that in general relativity, a pseudosphere is a type of spacetime with constant negative curvature. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe this is a 2-dimensional surface in a higher-dimensional space. Let me try to recall. Pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but in this case, the metric is in 2D, so maybe it's a 2-dimensional Lorentzian manifold? Or perhaps a Riemannian manifold if it's a sphere.
