Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct structure based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question provides FTIR and 1H NMR data for an unknown compound. There are four possible structures to choose from, labeled A to D. Let me read through the question again and note the key points.

The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. So, thinking about IR absorption, the broad peak around 3000 is likely due to O-H stretching. O-H groups in carboxylic acids, for example, show broad peaks because they're hydrogen-bonded. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ points to a carbonyl group (C=O), which fits with a carboxylic acid since they have a carbonyl. So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid functional group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data: several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule doesn't have any double bonds, or perhaps any double bonds are not present in the part of the molecule that's being observed. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see any double bonds in the structures provided. All are saturated, so that's consistent.

In the NMR, there are two specific complex splitting patterns mentioned. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, those are complicated splitting patterns, so they must be due to neighboring hydrogens with multiple neighboring groups.

Let me think about the splitting. A doublet of triplets suggests that a proton is next to another set of protons that are split into triplets. Wait, but each neighboring group can split the signal. So maybe each proton is next to two different sets of non-equivalent protons. Let me try to visualize that.

In NMR splitting, each neighboring set adds to the splitting. For example, if a proton is next to two different groups, each with n and m protons, the splitting would be (n+1)(m+1) etc. But in this case, the splitting is more complex, like a doublet of triplets of quartets. That suggests each proton is coupled with three different sets of neighboring protons, each with a different number of adjacent hydrogens, perhaps.

Wait, the first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let me parse that. A quartet is when a proton is next to 3 equivalent protons. A triplet is from 2 equivalent protons, and a doublet is from 1. So the splitting pattern would be something like a proton being split by three different
