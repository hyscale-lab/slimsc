Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. So, step one: trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide to form product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with pyridinium chlorochromate to form product 2. Finally, product 2 is treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-16-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature to form product 3. The question is asking how many carbon atoms are in product 3. The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out what each reaction does and what the structures of the products are.

Starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic compound with a benzene ring connected to a propenal group (CH₂=CH-CHO). The trans configuration means that the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite each other. So, trans-cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylpropenal.

Reaction 1: Treatment with methylmagnesium bromide (MeMgBr). MeMgBr is a Grignard reagent, which typically adds to carbonyl groups. So, the aldehyde group (CHO) in cinnamaldehyde will react with MeMgBr. Grignard reagents add twice to ketones, but aldehydes only add once because after the first addition, it becomes a secondary alcohol, which doesn't react further with Grignard reagents.

Wait, no, actually, I think that's wrong. Wait, no: Grignard adds to aldehyde once, giving a secondary alcohol. Because aldehydes have one R group (the benzyl group in this case) attached to the carbonyl carbon. Adding Me- gives R-CHO + MeMgBr → R-CH(O-MgBr)Me. Then, acid workup (like H3O+) gives R-CH(OH)Me. So product 1 would be (E)-3-phenylpropyl alcohol, but wait, more accurately, after Grignard addition, it's (E)-3-phenylpropanal's addition product?

Wait, perhaps I should draw this. Let me think: trans-cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? Wait no, wait. Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait.
