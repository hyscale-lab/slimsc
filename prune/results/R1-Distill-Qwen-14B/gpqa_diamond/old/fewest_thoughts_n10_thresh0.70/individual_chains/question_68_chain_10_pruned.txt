Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a spin-1/2 particle. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

Alright, the setup is that there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times S_z. The magnetic moment mu is aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Hmm, okay. So initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned along Z, so its spin is in the z-direction. Then the field is switched to Y, same strength. So the Hamiltonian must change from something involving S_z to something involving S_y.

In quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian changes, the state of the system can evolve over time, leading to oscillations in observable quantities. The question is about the frequency of oscillation in the average z-component of the moment.

I remember that for spin systems, the energy levels are quantized. For a spin-1/2, the possible eigenvalues are ±(ħω/2), where ω is the Larmor frequency. Wait, but Larmor frequency is typically given by gamma times B. So gamma B is the Larmor frequency, right? So ω_L = gamma B.

But wait, in the initial state, when the field was along Z, the system was in an eigenstate of S_z. So when the field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the system's state might change because the Hamiltonian now depends on S_y instead of S_z.

Wait, but how does the state change when the Hamiltonian changes? Oh, right, when the Hamiltonian changes suddenly, the state doesn't change instantaneously. So the system is in an eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian but becomes a superposition of eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.

So the initial state before the field change: the magnetic field is along Z, so the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu·B_initial. Since mu = gamma S_z, and the field is along Z, H_initial = -gamma B S_z.

Wait, actually, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, so the energy is proportional to S_z. So H_initial = -gamma B S_z.

The eigenstates of H_initial are the spin-up and spin-down states along Z, say |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So if the particle was in |↑⟩ initially, that's the eigenstate.

Then, the field is turned off, so the Hamiltonian becomes zero for an instant, but then a new field along Y is turned on. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu·B_final. Since B is along Y, this becomes H_final = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but wait. The general form for the Hamiltonian when a magnetic field is applied is H = -γ B S · n, where n is the direction of the field. So in the first case, n is along +Z, and after, it's along +Y. So H_final is proportional to S_y.

The system's state after the field switch is the same as
