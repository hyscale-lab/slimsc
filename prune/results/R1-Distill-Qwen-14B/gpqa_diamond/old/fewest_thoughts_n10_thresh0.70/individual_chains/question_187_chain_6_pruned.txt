Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and whether it can detect certain stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question says that a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So, I need to figure out which of these stars meet that criterion.

I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT. It’s designed for things like detecting exoplanets through the radial velocity method. But I'm not exactly sure about its exact capabilities, so maybe I should think about the factors that affect detectability.

Well, the S/N ratio depends on factors like the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the instrument's efficiency, and the noise sources like background noise or photon noise. But since the exposure time is fixed at 1 hour for all, I can probably focus on the apparent brightness of each star.

Wait, the apparent magnitude is key here because a higher S/N is easier to achieve with a brighter star. The formula for S/N is somewhat proportional to the square root of the number of photons detected. So, brighter stars (lower magnitudes) will have higher S/N.

Each star in the options has an absolute magnitude given. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 parsecs away. But their actual brightness (apparent magnitude) depends on their distance from us.

The formula to calculate apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is the distance in parsecs. Or wait, more accurately, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5, right? Because each 5 parsecs step increases the magnitude by 5. So yeah, that's correct.

So for each star, I can calculate their apparent magnitude based on their absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d). Then, compare that to see which ones are bright enough for S/N ≥10.

Wait, but how does apparent magnitude relate to S/N? I think that lower apparent magnitude (brighter) means more photons, so higher S/N. But I'm not exactly sure what the threshold is. Maybe I should find out the typical S/N for a given apparent magnitude when using a high-resolution spectrograph like ESPRESSO.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the flux received from each star. For stars with lower (brighter) apparent magnitudes, the flux is higher, leading to higher S/N.

But without knowing the exact S/N per magnitude, maybe I can recall that ESPRESSO works best with brighter stars. For example, I think it's optimized for stars with V magnitudes around 8 to maybe 15, but I'm not certain. Wait, wait, I should think more about the VLT's capabilities.

Wait, the VLT's telescopes are 8m each, and ESPRESSO is a spectrograph that combines light from up to four telescopes, but in this case, it's coupled with one 8m telescope. So, the collecting area is that of a single 8m mirror.

But I'm not sure
