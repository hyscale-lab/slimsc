Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that we have a mixture of two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 ratio. Their molecular formula is C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

The options are four possible pairs of compounds, all tetramethylbenzenes except for option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. So first, I need to figure out what each structure looks like and how their NMR would appear.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Each benzene ring has 4 degrees (since it's three double bonds plus a ring). So for C10H14, the degree of unsaturation is: 

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogens, it would be (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four DoU, which makes sense as one aromatic ring (3 DoU: three double bonds) and one from a ring (the benzene), so that adds up to four. Wait, noâ€” wait, benzene is three DoU (one ring plus three double bonds), so the fourth DoU would be another ring or a double bond or a triple bond. But the molecular formula is for each compound being C10H14. Wait, no, the mixture is two compounds each with that formula, or the mixture as a whole? Wait, the problem says the solution contains a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with formula C10H14. So each compound is C10H14.

Wait, each compound would be C10H14. Let me think about their possible structures. The options are all tetramethylbenzenes except C, which has diethyl. Let me confirm:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (so four CH3 groups in positions 1,2,3,4) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl and 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, diethyl would be -CH2CH2- groups attached. So that's different.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

So each of these has four methyl groups except for option C, which has diethyl. Wait, no, diethyl would be two ethyl groups on the benzene. So C10H14: Benzene (C6H6) plus four substituents. Let's see:

For tetramethylbenzene, the formula is C6H6 + 4*(CH3). So that's C10H10? Wait, no, wait. No, wait: Each methyl is CH3. So four methyl groups add 4*(3) H: 4*3 =12 H, but benzene has 6 H. So benzene plus four methyl is C6+4= C10, H:6 -4 (since each substitution replaces a H) + 4*(3) = 6-4=2 +12=14 H. So yes, that's C10H14. So each tetramethylbenzene would be C10H14.

But the diethylbenzene: Each ethyl is C2H5. So two ethyl groups add 2*(2 C)
