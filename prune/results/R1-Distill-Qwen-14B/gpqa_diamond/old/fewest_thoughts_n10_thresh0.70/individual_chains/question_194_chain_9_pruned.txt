Okay, so I've got this problem here about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. Hmm, right, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is e^(-βE), where β is 1/(kT).

Wait, let me think. So each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, how many possible states are there? Each has two options, so 2^3 = 8 states in total. I'll need to list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate the energy for each, then sum e^(-βE).

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Because each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. Let's see. The energy E is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair. So E depends on the number of +1 and -1 terms in that sum.

Let me think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each product S_i S_j can be +1 or -1, so the sum can range from -3 to +3, right? Let's find out how many states give each possible sum.

Alternatively, I can categorize the states based on whether the spins are all the same, two same and one different, etc. Let's see:

Case 1: All three spins are the same. So either all +1 or all -1. So there are 2 such states. For each, let's compute the sum.

If all are +1: S1S2 = 1, same for S1S3 and S2S3. So sum is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Similarly, all -1: each product is (-1)(-1)=1. Sum is 3. So for these two states, E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Case 2: Two
