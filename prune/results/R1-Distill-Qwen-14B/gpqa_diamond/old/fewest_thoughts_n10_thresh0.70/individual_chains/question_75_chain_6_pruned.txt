Okay, so I've got this question about a genetics experiment gone wrong, and I need to figure out why the protein isn't being overexpressed as expected. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They modified the gene's coding sequence by adding the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. Then they used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed. They looked at the construct's plus strand sequence and noticed something wrong.

So the question is, why isn't the protein being expressed correctly? The options are A, B, C, D. Let's go through each option and see which one fits.

First, I'll look at the provided DNA sequence to see if anything jumps out. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So that's good. Then it goes on with various codons. Let me think about possible issues.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Well, the problem is that they added the HA tag to the N-terminus. If there's a mutation in the HA sequence, maybe the tag isn't recognized. But wait, the main issue here is whether the HA sequence affects the reading frame or introduces a premature stop. If it's a missense, the protein might have a different amino acid but still be expressed. Unless the mutation prevented proper folding or recognition, but that's more about function than expression levels. The question is why the protein isn't overexpressed. So maybe A could be a reason, but I'm not sure.

Option B: The ribosome terminated translation early. That would happen if there's a premature stop codon. Let's check the DNA sequence. The sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. Wait, looking at the end: ...GCTGCTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA. The last few bases are TGA, which
