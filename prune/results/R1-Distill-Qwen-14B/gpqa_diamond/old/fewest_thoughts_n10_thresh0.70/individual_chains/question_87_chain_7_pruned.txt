Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data for a specific compound. Let me start by breaking down the question and then think through each step carefully.

The question says that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. So, wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons, right? So if it's di-substituted, that means two substituents are attached to the ring. But wait, the total carbon count is 8. So 6 from the benzene, 2 substituents, each substituent must add up to 2 carbons? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent has more than one carbon. Let me think.

Wait, di-substituted means two groups attached, but each could be a single carbon or more. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is a methyl group, but that would add two carbons each, making 6 + 2*1 = 8. No, wait, if each substituent is a methyl, that's 6 + 2 = 8. So that makes sense. Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, so one substituent is a carbonyl, and another is a halogen?

Wait, carbonyl could be a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something else. But since it's an aromatic ring, the substituents are likely attached as substituents. So perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone (C=O), and the other is a halogen, say Cl or Br.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like an acyl group. Wait, but the FTIR shows a peak for a carbonyl group, so that's one substituent. The other is an aromatic-halogen bond, so the other substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, I). So the ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl (like a ketone, maybe), the other is a halogen.

Wait, but wait, the ring has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6 carbons. Each substituent would contribute 1 carbon each, so 6 + 2 = 8. So each substituent is a single carbon. So one
