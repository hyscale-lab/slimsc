Okay, so I've got this problem here where an algorithm takes a DNA sequence as input and produces a number as output. My task is to figure out what the output would be for the input ACAGTGACC based on the examples given.

The examples are:
AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

Hmm, I need to find the pattern here. Let's see. DNA sequences are made up of the bases A, T, C, G. So maybe each base is being converted into a number in some way.

Looking at the first example, AGG gives 115. Let's break that down. AGG is three bases long. The output is 115. Maybe each base contributes a certain value. Let's see:

A is 1? Because if I take A as 1, G as something else. Wait, but let's check the second example to see if that holds.

The second example is TGCTGA -> 176. Let's see the length here: 6 bases. So 6 bases give 176.

Wait, perhaps each base is being converted into a number, and then summed. Let me think.

Let me assign each base a value:

A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Let me test this with the first example.

AGG: A=1, G=4, G=4. Sum is 1+4+4 =9. But the output is 115, which is way higher than 9. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe each base's value is multiplied by its position. Let's try that.

First example: AGG is positions 1,2,3.

A is position 1: 1 *1=1
G is position 2: 4 *2=8
G is position3:4 *3=12
Total sum: 1+8+12=21. Still not 115.

Wait, maybe each base corresponds to a digit in a number, but in a different base. Like, treating the bases as digits in a base-n number. Let's think about that.

In the first example, AGG is three bases. If each base is a digit in a base higher than 4, say base 5, then AGG would be:

A=1,
