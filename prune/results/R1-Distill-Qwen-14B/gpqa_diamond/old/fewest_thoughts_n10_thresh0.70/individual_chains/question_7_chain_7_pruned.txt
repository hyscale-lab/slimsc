Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and think through what I know.

The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The process is γγ → e⁺e⁻. I'm supposed to find the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the CMB photons are low-energy. But gamma-rays are high energy, so when a high-energy gamma interacts with a CMB photon, they could annihilate into an electron-positron pair. That makes sense because their combined energy should be enough to create the rest mass of the particles, which is about 1 MeV each, so two of them would make 2 MeV, but wait, actually the rest mass is around 0.511 MeV each, so 1.022 MeV total. But wait, the gamma-ray and the photon are providing the energy, so their energies need to add up to at least 1.022 MeV. But wait, that's for the pair production, but in this case, the process is annihilation, but wait, no, annihilation would produce gamma-rays, but here it's the opposite: two photons (gamma and another) annihilate into a pair. Oh, right, photon-photon annihilation into e+ e-.

So the problem is about the interaction rate of high-energy gamma-rays with the CMB. The lifetime is limited by this process, meaning that the gamma-rays cannot travel too far before interacting, so their mean free path becomes significant. So the energy threshold where the interaction rate becomes significant would determine the energy where the lifetime is limited by this process.

I think the approach here is to find the energy of the gamma-ray where the probability of interaction with the CMB photons becomes large enough that their lifetime is dominated by this process.

I remember that the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs depends on the energy of the photons. The cross-section is a function of the center-of-mass (CM) energy. The threshold for this process is when the CM energy is at least 2 * m_e c², which is about 1.022 MeV. So for two photons with energies E1 and E2, the CM energy squared s is given by (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2, but since photons are massless, their momentum is E/(c). So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 (since photons are moving in opposite directions for maximum energy?), wait, no, wait. Wait, the photons could be moving in the same direction or opposite.

Wait, to get maximum CM energy, the photons would have to be moving in opposite directions. So the total energy in the CM frame would be E1 + E2, and the total momentum would be (E1/c) - (E2/c) assuming opposite directions. So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2
