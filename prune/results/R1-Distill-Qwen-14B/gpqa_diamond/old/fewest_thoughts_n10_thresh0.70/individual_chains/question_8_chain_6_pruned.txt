Alright, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the question is about genes involved in resistance to a fungal disease in white lupine. They've done some experiments with knock-out mutants and double-mutants, and I need to interpret the results to find out the relationship between these genes.

Let me start by reading the problem again. So, there are three genes: G1, G2, G3. They created knock-outs (g1, g2, g3) and double-mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (wild-type) resistance.

The resistance data:
- g1: 75% of control
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Also, it's mentioned that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. So, I remember that transcription factors are proteins that help turn specific genes on or off by binding to nearby DNA. If a transcription factor is knocked out, the genes it regulates won't be expressed, which affects the phenotype.

The question is asking about the interaction between these genes. The options involve terms like transcription factor, pleiotropy, gene redundancy, and epistasis.

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of gene B's mutation can only be seen if gene A is functional. Alternatively, the pathway might have a certain order: if two genes are in the same pathway, the downstream gene's mutation might mask the effect of the upstream gene.

Let me think about how to approach this. I think the key is to look at the double-mutant phenotypes and see if there's an effect that can't be explained by additive effects. For example, if a double mutant has a more severe phenotype than the sum of the individual mutants, that might indicate something about their interaction.

Looking at the data:

The wild-type is 100% resistant. The single mutants:
- g1: 75% → so less resistant than wild-type. So, knocking out G1 reduces resistance by 25%. Maybe G1 is contributing positively to resistance.
- g2: 0% → no resistance. So, without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. That suggests that G2 is very important, perhaps a transcription factor as assumed.
- g3: 50% → so knocking G3 out reduces resistance by half.

Double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% → both mutations lead to no resistance.
- g1g3: 10% → even worse than either single mutant.
- g2g3: 0% → again, no resistance.

Hmm. Let's think about what each of these double mutants shows.

Since g2 is completely resistant (0%), that suggests that G2 is necessary for resistance. So, without G2, the plant is susceptible. So, G2's function is critical. Maybe it's a transcription factor that activates other defense genes. If G2 is not working, those downstream genes aren't expressed, leading to susceptibility.

Looking at the double mutants involving g2:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So, even when g1 is also mutated, the resistance is as bad as when only g2 is mutated. So, the presence of a g2 mutation masks the effect of G1. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the mutation in G2 is upstream, perhaps, and when it's not working, the effect of G1 doesn't matter anymore. So, G2 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Epistatic genes are the ones whose mutations mask the phenotype of other genes. So, if you have a mutation in G2, and you also mutate G1, the phenotype is the same as G2 alone. So, the mutation in G2 is epistatic over G1. Because G2 is upstream, maybe in the pathway.

Moving on. Consider g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So, when G2 is knocked out, adding G3 knockout doesn't change the phenotype. So, G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. Meaning that G2 mutation masks whatever effect G3 might have.

What about g1g3? Their resistance is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). Wait, so when both G1 and G3 are knocked out,
