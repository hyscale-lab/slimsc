Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are devices used to accelerate charged particles. Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, right? They use a magnetic field and an alternating electric field to accelerate particles.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of T1 = 950 MeV. Wait, wait, two accelerations? Or maybe it's accelerated twice? Or perhaps it's just a way of saying it goes through multiple stages? I'm a bit confused here.

The problem gives the voltage applied as U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data points are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

I think I need to figure out the number of times the proton circles around the synchrocyclotron before it reaches the desired kinetic energy.

First, I remember that in cyclotrons, the particles move in a circular path due to the magnetic field. The magnetic force provides the centripetal acceleration. The equation for that is qvB = mv²/r, so r = mv/(qB). But how does that help here?

Oh wait, the particles are accelerated by the electric field as they move. The synchrocyclotron uses an alternating voltage, which I think creates a varying electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field. The particles are accelerated each time they pass through the electric field region.

Wait, but in a cyclotron, the frequency of the electric field is synchronized with the rotation of the particles so they always enter the electric field when it's in the right direction to accelerate them. This is called the cyclotron frequency. The frequency ν is given by ν = qB/(2πm), where m is the mass of the particle.

But wait, the problem gives U(t) as a function of time with a frequency ν(α). Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. Oh, perhaps α is some parameter. Hmm, but maybe I can just treat ν as the cyclotron frequency.

Wait, the problem statement says the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(2πνt + Φ0). So the frequency of the voltage
