Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, each treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. We need to see how many peaks appear in each case.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA (meta-chloroperbenzoic acid) is a peracid, commonly used as an oxidizing agent in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation would typically form an epoxide from an alkene. So each of these alkenes, (E) and (Z), would react to form their respective epoxides.

Wait, but wait. The reaction conditions after mCPBA include aqueous acid. Oh right, after epoxidation, sometimes acid workup can lead to ring-opening of the epoxide. So what happens when an epoxide is treated with acid?

Epoxide ring opening under acidic conditions usually follows a certain mechanism. The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, a nucleophilic attack occurs by a water molecule (since it's aqueous acid). The nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized (that's the acid-catalyzed ring opening). 

Wait, but in the case of epoxides derived from alkenes, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the structure of the epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is trans, so the epoxide will have adjacent substituents on opposite sides. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene is cis, so the epoxide will have adjacent substituents on the same side.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the structure of oct-4-ene. It's CH2CH2 in the middle, but wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in positions 4 and 5, so the structure is CH2CH2 with two CH2 groups on each end. Wait, no, more accurately, it's CH2CHCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, no. Let me think again. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 with
