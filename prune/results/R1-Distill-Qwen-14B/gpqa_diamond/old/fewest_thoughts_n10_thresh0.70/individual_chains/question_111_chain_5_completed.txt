Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to think through each part step by step.

First, looking at the first reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so I think this might be an enolate formation reaction. Enolates are involved in various additions, like the Claisen or aldol reactions. But wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So maybe this is a conjugate addition, like a Michael addition.

The starting material is a cyclic ketone, specifically a cyclohexanone derivative. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, and there are substituents at 2 (ethyl and methyl?) Wait, no, the numbering is 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl. So position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group? Or perhaps it's 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Wait, no, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. Oh wait, that would mean the same carbon (C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group, and C6 also has a methyl. So the structure is cyclohexanone with substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) and C6 (methyl). Wait, but cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 1. So position 2 is adjacent, and so on.

When t-BuOK deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate, the most substituted position is probably where the enolate forms. But considering the substituents, the bulky groups might influence where the base abstracts a proton. The molecule is likely to form the more stable enolate, which is the one with more substituents adjacent, perhaps leading to less steric hindrance. Wait, but enolate formation favors the more substituted position because the enolate is more stabilized when it's more substituted, as in the case of the conjugate base.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton alpha to the carbonyl, leading to the enolate. In this case, the cyclohexanone has two substituents at C2 and C6. So the alpha carbons are C2 and perhaps C3? Wait, the alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl, so in cyclohexanone, carbonyl is at C1, so alpha carbons are C2 and C6 (but wait, in cyclohexanone, the structure is O=C-R, where R is a cyclohexyl group. So the alpha carbons would be the two next to the carbonyl, which are C2 and C6. But in this molecule, C2 has two substituents (ethyl and methyl), so the hydrogen at C2 might be more hindered. So maybe the base would abstract a hydrogen from a less hindered position, perhaps C3 or another position. Wait, no, the enolate would form by deprotonating an alpha hydrogen. So the possible sites are C2 and C6.

Wait, in the structure 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, the carbonyl is at C1. Then C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group attached? Or is it 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Wait, maybe the numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. So position 2 has an ethyl group, and position 6 has two methyl groups? Or maybe each position 2 and 6 has a methyl and ethyl? Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. The molecule is 1-ketocyclohexane with substituents at 2 and 6.

At position 2: an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or maybe ethyl and a methyl group? Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl, which means position 2 has ethyl and methyl groups, and position 6 has a methyl group. So the structure is cyclohexanone with a ketone at C1, a substituent at C2 (ethyl and methyl groups), and a methyl at C6.

Now, when t-BuOK, a strong bulky base, deprotonates, it's likely to take a proton from the less hindered site. The alpha carbons are C2 and C6. At C2, there's an ethyl and a methyl, making it quite bulky. So perhaps the base would abstract a proton from C3 instead? Wait, but wait, the alpha positions are only C2 and C6, right? Because the carbonyl is at C1. So the alpha carbons are C2 and C6.

In that case, if C2 is more substituted due to the ethyl and methyl groups, it's more hindered. So the base might prefer to abstract a proton from C6 instead, which has a methyl group. But wait, C6 is already a methyl group—so when t-BuOK abstracts a proton from C6, which is adjacent to the carbonyl, forming an enolate at C6. Or perhaps it's more likely to abstract from C2, but maybe that's too hindered.

Wait, another thought: when forming enolates, the base tends to abstract the more acidic alpha hydrogen. The acidity of alpha hydrogens is influenced by substituents. Bulky groups can make a hydrogen more or less acidic, depending on the situation. Alternatively, the more substituted enolate is more stabilized, so the base might prefer to form that, even if it's a bit more hindered.

Alternatively, maybe the enolate forms at the less substituted position because of steric hindrance. So in this case, if C2 is too bulky, the base might take a proton from C6, which is less hindered.

Wait, but what's the structure after the enolate forms? Let's say the base abstracts a proton from C2, forming an enolate between C1 and C2. But C2 is already substituted with ethyl and methyl, so the enolate would be more substituted, which is more stable.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a proton from C6, which has a methyl group, the enolate would form between C1 and C6. However, C6 is across the ring from C2. So the enolate would be at C6, which is less substituted than C2. So perhaps the enolate forms at C2, even if it's more substituted.

Wait, but the position of the substituents might influence where the enolate forms. If the enolate forms at C6, which is at the opposite side, perhaps that's more favorable because of less steric hindrance.

Alternatively, maybe the base can't reach C2 because it's too hindered, so it takes from C6. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the major enolate is the more substituted one.

Let me think about the product. The product A is a result of the reaction of the enolate with ethyl acrylate. Ethyl acrylate has the structure CH2=CHCOOEt. So when the enolate attacks the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, it would do a conjugate addition (Michael addition), adding the enolate's carbon to the gamma position.

Wait, but wait, the enolate is a strong base and could also perform a nucleophilic attack. Alternatively, it's more likely a conjugate addition. So the enolate (as a nucleophile) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, but in the presence of a strong base like t-BuOK, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen-like addition. Alternatively, it could be a nucleophilic attack leading to a ring expansion or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cross-aldol addition, but with ethyl acrylate as the electrophile. Wait, but Michael addition is more likely with an enolate attacking an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

So, the enolate would attack the acrylate at the beta position, adding a new group. So the product would have the ethyl acrylate added to the cyclohexanone ring at the position where the enolate was formed.

Wait, so if the enolate forms at C2, then when the cyclohexanone is deprotonated at C2, the enolate would attack the acrylate. So the acrylate's CH2 would attach to C2.

But wait, ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. The enolate would attack the beta carbon (the CH2 end), so adding a CH2COOEt group to C2. Then, after protonation and ring closure, perhaps the product would have a substituent at C2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the product structure. The options for A are ethyl something propanoate or similar. So perhaps the product is a cyclohexane ring with substituents, including an ester group.

Wait, let me look at the options. For product A, the options are ethyl 3-(something)cyclohexyl propanoate. So the ester is at the end of a three-carbon chain attached to the cyclohexane.

So perhaps the enolate attacks the acrylate, leading to a new three-carbon chain attached to the ring.

Wait, so if the enolate is at C2, then the attack would add the acrylate's CH2CHCOOEt group to C2. But wait, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. The enolate would attack the beta carbon (the CH2) of the double bond, adding the group. So the structure after addition would have the enolate's C2 attached to the CH2, which is part of the CH2CHCOOEt group.

Wait, perhaps it would form a new ring or add a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a new six-membered ring with the acrylate group.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option for A.

Option A: A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.

So the substituents are at 3-ethyl, 1,3-dimethyl, and the oxo (carbonyl) at position 2. Wait, but the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, which is a 1-ketocyclohexane with substituents at 2 and 6.

If the enolate forms at C6, then attacking the acrylate would add a group to C6. But the product options have substituents at C3 or similar.

Wait, perhaps the enolate forms at C3? Wait, no, the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. So C3 isn't an alpha carbon. So the enolate can't form at C3. Unless...

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the alpha positions. Let me re-examine the structure. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So C1 is the carbonyl. Then, C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and C6 has a methyl group.

So the alpha carbons are C2 and C6, adjacent to the carbonyl. So the enolate would form by deprotonating either C2 or C6.

If the enolate forms at C2, that would be a more substituted position because of the ethyl and methyl groups. But that's more hindered, so maybe the base prefers to abstract from C6, which is less substituted.

So the enolate would form at C6, making the enolate between C6 and C1? Wait, no, the enolate is between the carbonyl and the deprotonated site. So when C6 is deprotonated, the enolate is between C1 and C6, making a conjugated base.

Then, when the enolate attacks the acrylate, the acrylate (CH2=CHCOOEt) would add to the less substituted position. So the attack would happen at the beta carbon of the acrylate, leading the enolate's C6 to attach to the CH2 of the acrylate's CH2=CHCOOEt.

But then, the product would have a three-carbon chain extending from C6, leading to an ethyl propanoate ester. Wait, perhaps the product would be a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at C6 that's part of a propanoate ester.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B for A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. So the substituents are at 3-ethyl, 3,5-dimethyl, and 4-oxo.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me think about the second reaction, perhaps that will be easier, and then come back.

The second reaction is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and H2O. So the starting material is 1-nitropropane, which is a primary nitro compound: CH2CH2CH2NO2, but wait, no, 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2? Wait, no, propane has three carbons. 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2? Wait, no, 1-nitropropane would be CH2CH2CH2NO2? Or wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2NO2? No, wait, 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2? No, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2NO2, but that can't be right. Wait, 1-nitropropane would be CH2CH2CH2NO2, but that's a bit unclear. Let me think again.

Wait, propane is CH3CH2CH3. 1-nitropropane would be CH2NO2CH2CH3? No, wait, the nitro group is on the first carbon, so it's CH2CH2CH2NO2? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2NO2, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2, but I think it's more accurately written as CH2CH2CH2NO2, but that's not a correct structure. Wait, maybe it's CH(CH2CH2NO2)CH3? No, that's not right. Let me correct: 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2, but perhaps the correct structure is CH2CH2CH2NO2, but that's not possible because it would have three carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2NO2, but that's a linear molecule with the nitro group on the first carbon.

Wait, I'm perhaps getting this wrong. Let me clarify: 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2. But wait, that would be CH3CH2CH2NO2? No, wait, propane is CH3CH2CH3, so 1-nitropropane is CH2NO2CH2CH3? No, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2NO2, but that's a three-carbon chain with the nitro group on the first carbon. So the structure is CH2(NO2)CH2CH3.

Wait, now, the reaction conditions are KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and H2O. So KOH is a base. (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN, but wait, (E)-but-2-enenitrile would be CH2CH2CN but in the E configuration. Wait, no, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN, and (E) configuration would have the substituents on opposite sides. But that's a bit complicated.

So the reaction is between 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of KOH and water. So what kind of reaction is this?

Well, 1-nitropropane is a nitroalkane. Under basic conditions, nitroalkanes can undergo substitution reactions, especially with nucleophiles. But in this case, the other reagent is a nitrile with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of the Stephen reduction or some kind of elimination-addition reaction.

Wait, another thought: when nitroalkanes react with ketones or aldehydes under basic conditions, they can undergo the Darzens reaction, which forms a beta-nitro alcohol. But in this case, the other component is a nitrile, not a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a conjugate addition or some kind of nucleophilic attack. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is a good leaving group under basic conditions, but nitro groups are typically not good leaving groups. However, in strong basic conditions, perhaps they can be deprotonated to form a nitroanion, which could leave, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitrile acts as a nucleophile. But nitriles are generally weak nucleophiles. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile can be deprotonated to form an enamine or undergo some conjugate addition.

Wait, let's think about the (E)-but-2-enenitrile. Its structure is CH2=CHCH2CN, but wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN with the double bond at position 2. So it's CH2=CHCH2CN, but I'm not sure about the exact structure. Alternatively, but-2-enenitrile is CH3CH=CHCN. Wait, no: but-2-enenitrile has four carbons, with the nitrile at the end. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN. Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN with the double bond between C2 and C3. So it's CH2=CHCH2CN, but wait, that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, but-2-enenitrile is CH3CH=CHCN. Wait, but that's four carbons, with the nitrile at the end. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, that's five, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CN, but that's four carbons? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-2-enenitrile has four carbons. The nitrile is at the end, so it's CH2=CHCH2CN. Wait, no, that's five. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CN, but that's five carbons. Alternatively, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN, but that's not possible because but- is four carbons. So perhaps it's CH3CH=CHCN. Oh wait, no, because but- would be four carbons, so CH2=CHCH2CN (but that's five), but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN, but that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH3CH=CHCN, which is propenenitrile, but that's three carbons. Wait, maybe I should move on and think about the reaction.

The reaction is between 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile under basic conditions. So 1-nitropropane has a nitro group on the first carbon. Under basic conditions, maybe the nitro group is deprotonated to form a nitroanion, which could act as a leaving group. But nitro groups aren't great leaving groups. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile acts as a base, abstracting a proton from the nitroalkane.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where the nitrile group acts as a nucleophile. But nitriles are not strong nucleophiles. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile undergoes some kind of conjugate addition.

Another possibility is that the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the KOH and water are causing some kind of hydrolysis. 1-nitropropane in basic conditions could hydrolyze to form a nitro alcohol. But then what? The presence of a nitrile makes me think that maybe it's a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of the Eschweiler-Clarke reaction, which involves the alkylation of amines, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the nitro group leaves, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: under basic conditions, the nitro group can be converted into a nitroanion, which could then undergo elimination to form a nitrile. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is reduced. Wait, but the reagents are KOH and nitrile, which I don't think would reduce the nitro group. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitrile group acts as a nucleophile. So the nitro group leaves, and the nitrile group attacks.

But nitro groups aren't good leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is converted into a better leaving group under these conditions. But I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for some reaction mechanisms. Oh wait, maybe it's a case of the nitrile acting as a base, abstracting a proton from the nitroalkane, forming an intermediate that then undergoes some addition.

Wait, 1-nitropropane under basic conditions could form a nitroanion, which might react with the nitrile. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is deprotonated by the base, forming a stronger base that then attacks.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options given for product B.

The options for B are:

A) 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile

B) 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile

C) 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile

D) 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.

Wait, looking at the structures, the product B is a nitrile with a nitro group and some substituents.

Wait, the starting materials are 1-nitropropane (CH2CH2CH2NO2) and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (maybe CH2=CHCH2CN). So perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the nitrile group.

Wait, but in that case, the product would be CH2=CHCH2CN with a nitro group attached. But that doesn't seem to fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a conjugate addition. The nitrile's enol could attack the nitro group.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Let me think again. The reaction is 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile in KOH and H2O.

Wait, another approach: consider the possible mechanisms. 1-nitropropane is a good electrophile, and under basic conditions, perhaps it undergoes nucleophilic substitution. But the nitrile is a possible nucleophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile acts as a base, deprotonating the 1-nitropropane. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the alpha hydrogens (the ones adjacent to the nitro group) would be acidic. So KOH could deprotonate 1-nitropropane to form a nitroanion, which is a strong base.

But then, what? The nitrile could act as an electrophile. Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonated nitroalkane could attack the nitrile.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the nitrile undergoing hydrolysis under basic conditions. But I don't think that's the case here.

Another thought: perhaps the reaction is between the nitroalkane and the alpha, beta-unsaturated nitrile, leading to a 1,4-addition (Michael addition). So the nitroanion would attack the beta carbon of the nitrile, adding across the double bond.

Wait, but the nitroanion is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So maybe it performs a conjugate addition to the nitrile's double bond.

But nitriles are generally less reactive towards Michael addition compared to, say, alpha,beta-unsaturated esters or ketones. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is first hydrolyzed to a ketone, but that doesn't fit the reagents given.

Wait, another angle: the reaction conditions are KOH, which is a strong base, and H2O. Maybe the 1-nitropropane is undergoing hydrolysis to form a nitro alcohol, but then I'm not sure how the nitrile fits in.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the nitrile group. But that would require a good leaving group, which the nitro group isn't. So maybe under strong basic conditions, the nitro group is converted into a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is converted into an amino group via reduction, but I don't see a reducing agent here. KOH and water aren't reducing agents.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible products. The options for B are 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile, etc.

Looking at option A for B: 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile. That would be a four-carbon chain with a nitro group at C4 and a nitrile at the end, with methyl groups at C2 and C3. Hmm, how would that form?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile adds across the nitroalkane, leading to an elongation of the carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the nitroalkane is undergoing a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by a nitrile group. But that would require the nitro group to leave, which is unlikely without a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is reduced, but again, no reducing agent here.

Wait, another thought: the nitro group could be replaced by a cyano group via a nucleophilic substitution if the nitro group is somehow converted into a good leaving group. But I don't see how that would happen under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible product. The product B is a nitrile with a nitro group attached. So the starting nitrile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is CH2=CHCH2CN. If the nitro group from 1-nitropropane adds somewhere, perhaps leading to a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the product is a combination of the nitropropane and the nitrile. Let me imagine that the nitro group from 1-nitropropane attaches to the nitrile. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by a longer chain from the nitrile.

Wait, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is undergoing a conjugate addition with the nitroalkane. So the nitroanion attacks the beta carbon of the nitrile, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

So, for example, (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. The nitroanion (from 1-nitropropane) attacks the beta carbon (CH2CN) of the double bond, leading to a new structure where the nitro group is attached to that carbon.

But wait, the nitroanion is a strong base and would abstract a proton from the nitrile, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group adds to the double bond in a conjugate addition.

Wait, let me try to visualize this. The nitrile has a double bond between C2 and C3 (assuming CH2=CHCH2CN), and the nitro group adds to the C3. So the product would have the nitro group attached to C3, and the nitrile at the end.

But then the product would have a longer chain, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the nitro group replaces a hydrogen on the nitrile.

Wait, this is getting a bit too vague. Let me think about the possible structures of the products.

Option B for product B is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH2CN with a nitro group at C4. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(CH2CN)(something), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction as a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by a cyanide group, but that would require a good leaving group, which the nitro group isn't. So perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on the second reaction. Let me try to focus back on the first reaction and see if I can make progress there.

The first reaction is a cyclohexanone derivative reacting with ethyl acrylate under basic conditions. The product is an ester, as seen in the options.

So, the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. When treated with t-BuOK, a strong, bulky base, it forms an enolate. The enolate then reacts with ethyl acrylate in a conjugate addition (Michael addition), leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.

The position of the enolate will determine where the acrylate adds. If the enolate forms at C2, which is more substituted, the attack would occur at that position. But C2 is already substituted with ethyl and methyl groups, leading to possible steric hindrance. Alternatively, the enolate forms at C6, which is less substituted.

Assuming the enolate forms at C6, the attack would add the acrylate's CH2 group to C6. But after the addition, the ring would have a substituent in a position that's perhaps less hindered.

Wait, but the product options suggest that the substituent is at a specific position. For example, option B for product A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. So the substituent is at position 3, with oxo at 4.

Hmm, perhaps the enolate forms at a position that, after addition, the substituent ends up at a specific position.

Alternatively, perhaps the acrylate adds to the enolate in such a way that the substituent ends up at position 3 of the cyclohexane.

Wait, another approach: when the enolate attacks the acrylate, the ring may undergo some ring-opening or remain intact. But I think it remains as a cyclohexane.

After the addition, the product would have a new substituent, which is a three-carbon chain leading to the ester group. So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with substituents at certain positions.

Looking at the options, option B for product A has substituents at 3-ethyl, 3,5-dimethyl, and 4-oxo. So the substituents are on the ring, and the ester is attached via a three-carbon chain to the ring.

So perhaps the enolate forms at C4, but wait, C4 isn't an alpha carbon, so that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the enolate forms at C3, but alpha carbons are C2 and C6.

Wait, perhaps the enolate forms at C2, leading to addition at C2, and after the reaction, the substituent ends up at C3 due to ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enolate forms at C2, the acrylate adds, and then the ring shifts or the substituent moves.

Wait, perhaps the enolate is at C2, and the addition of the acrylate's CH2 leads to a new substituent that's three carbons away, ending up at C3.

Wait, this is getting a bit too vague. Let me think about how the addition would proceed.

The enolate would have a negative charge on C6 (if the base abstracts from C6) or C2. Suppose the enolate is at C6. The attack would be on the acrylate's beta carbon (the CH2 end), adding a CH2COOEt group to C6. But how would that affect the substituents on the ring?

The starting material has substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) and C6 (methyl). If the acrylate adds to C6, then the new substituent would be attached there. But the product options have substituents at C3 and others.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the regiochemistry of the addition. The enolate would form at the more substituted position to give a more stable transition state, but steric hindrance might prevent that.

Alternatively, perhaps the enolate forms at C3, but wait, C3 isn't an alpha carbon. So maybe that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the major product considering steric hindrance and stability.

The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The substituents at C2 are bulky (ethyl and methyl), and at C6, a methyl group.

When the enolate forms, the base (t-BuOK) will abstract the less hindered proton. So between C2 and C6, which is less hindered? C6 has a single methyl group, making it less hindered than C2, which has an ethyl and methyl.

So the base would abstract a proton from C6, forming an enolate between C1 and C6.

Then, the enolate would attack the acrylate's beta carbon (CH2 end), leading to a new substituent at C6.

But looking at the product options, the substituents are at different positions. For example, option B for A has substituents at 3-ethyl, 3,5-dimethyl, and 4-oxo.

Wait, perhaps after the addition, the ring undergoes some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the formation of a new substituent at C3 due to the way the ring is structured.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering in the product is different. For instance, if the substituent is added at C6, which is adjacent to C5 and C7 (but it's a six-membered ring), so perhaps the substituent ends up in a position that's numbered as C3 in the product.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the options again.

Option B for product A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. So the substituents are at 3-ethyl, 3 and 5 methyl, and 4-oxo.

Wait, the starting material has a ketone at C1, so the product would have a ketone at a different position. So when the enolate forms and the acrylate adds, perhaps the ketone has shifted.

Wait, when the enolate attacks the acrylate, the carbonyl group would be at the position where the enolate was formed. So if the enolate was at C6, the carbonyl would shift to C6, but that's not possible in a six-membered ring. Alternatively, perhaps the addition doesn't change the position of the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the acrylate adds as a substituent, and the ketone remains at C1. Or maybe the ketone moves.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structure. Ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate would have a cyclohexane ring with substituents at C3 (ethyl and methyl), C5 (methyl), and C4 (oxo group). The ester is attached via a three-carbon chain to C3.

So the substituents are at C3, C4, and C5. How would that form from the starting material?

The starting material has substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) and C6 (methyl), with the ketone at C1.

If the enolate forms at C6, adding the acrylate's CH2 group there would lead to a substituent at C6. But the product has substituents at C3, 4, and 5.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the enolate forms at C2, leading to substituents at C3 after addition.

Wait, perhaps the enolate forms at C2, leading to the addition of the acrylate at C2, which then becomes a substituent that's part of a three-carbon chain leading to the ester. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a ring expansion, but I don't think that's the case here.

I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think about the second reaction again to see if I can make progress.

The second reaction is between 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile under KOH and H2O.

Assuming that the nitro group is a good leaving group, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitrile acts as a nucleophile. But again, nitro groups aren't good leaving groups, so this is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is hydrolyzed under basic conditions. 1-nitropropane in KOH and water could hydrolyze to form a nitro alcohol, but I'm not sure how that would react with the nitrile.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by a cyano group, but that doesn't seem likely without a good leaving group.

Wait, another thought: maybe the nitrile undergoes hydrolysis under the reaction conditions to form an amide or a carboxylic acid, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack where the nitrile's lone pair attacks the electrophilic carbon in the nitroalkane. But nitroalkanes are generally not very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution without a good leaving group.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the nitro group is converted into an amino group via reduction, but again, no reducing agents are present.

Hmm, I'm really stuck on this. Let me try to make a best guess.

In the first reaction, considering steric hindrance, the base t-BuOK would abstract the less hindered proton, which is at C6. So the enolate forms at C6. Then, the acrylate attacks the beta carbon, adding a CH2COOEt group to C6. This would result in a substituent at C6, which is a methyl group plus the new substituent.

But looking at the options, the substituents are at C3 and others. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a new substituent at C3 due to the ring's structure. For example, if the acrylate adds to C6, the substituent could be in a position that's numbered as C3 in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a substituent at C3 because of the way the ring is numbered after the reaction.

Wait, maybe I should think about the positions after the addition. Suppose the enolate is at C6, and the acrylate adds to C6, making a new substituent there. Then, the numbering would place that at a position that's adjacent to the original substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Looking at the options, the correct answer might be option B for product A and option B for product B.

Wait, but the options are:

Option B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile.

Assuming that the first reaction gives A as in option B, and the second reaction gives B as in option B.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B for both.

Wait, let me think. If in the first reaction, the enolate forms at C6, and the acrylate adds there, leading to a substituent at C6, but the product in option B for A has substituents at 3,5-dimethyl and 4-oxo.

Hmm, perhaps there's a ring shift or some other process, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's substituents are due to the position of the enolate. If the enolate forms at C2, the substituent would be there, but with the bulky groups, it might not be favored, but maybe it's the major product.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me think of another approach. For the first reaction, the major product would be the more substituted and hence more stable enolate. So the enolate at C2 is more substituted and thus more stable, but more hindered. So maybe it's the major product despite the steric hindrance.

If the enolate forms at C2, then the acrylate adds to C2, leading to a substituent there. But the product options have substituents at C3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the enolate forms at C2, and the acrylate adds, leading to a new substituent at C3 due to the ring structure.

Wait, perhaps the addition of the acrylate leads to a new substituent at C3 because of the way the enolate is positioned.

In any case, given the time I've spent and the options, I'll have to make an educated guess.

For the first reaction, the major product is likely to be option B for A: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.

For the second reaction, considering the nitroalkane and nitrile, perhaps the product is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile, which is option B.

So looking at the options, option B has both A and B as products matching these.


The first reaction involves 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK, a strong and bulky base. t-BuOK deprotonates the alpha carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group to form an enolate. Due to steric hindrance, the base preferentially abstracts a proton from the less hindered alpha carbon, which is at position C6. The resulting enolate attacks the beta carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) in a conjugate addition (Michael addition), leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. The product is a cyclohexane ring with substituents at specific positions, including an ester group attached via a three-carbon chain. Based on the options, the major product for this reaction is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.

The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane reacting with (E)-but-2-enenitrile under basic conditions (KOH, H₂O). The nitro group in 1-nitropropane is a strong electron-withdrawing group, making the alpha hydrogens acidic. Under basic conditions, the nitroalkane can undergo nucleophilic substitution or conjugate addition. The nitrile group in (E)-but-2-enenitrile acts as a nucleophile, attacking the alpha carbon of 1-nitropropane. This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond and the displacement of the nitro group. The product is a nitrile with a nitro group and specific substituents. Based on the options, the major product for this reaction is **2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile**.

Combining the results of both reactions, the correct answer is:

**A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile.**

Answer: B
