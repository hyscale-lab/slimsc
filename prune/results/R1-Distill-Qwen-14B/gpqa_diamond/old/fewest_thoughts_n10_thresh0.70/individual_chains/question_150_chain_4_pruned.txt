Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted with a series of reagents. I need to find out what the final product is from the options.

First, I should analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR shows several peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet. A triplet around 9-10 ppm usually indicates an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but sometimes they can be downfield due to conjugation. Or maybe this is an aromatic ring with some substituents. Hmm, another thought: maybe it's an aldehyde. Because the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, aldehydes are usually a singlet unless there's coupling, which isn't common. Wait, or maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde, like in an enal? Or maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to an oxygen, like a ketone? No, wait, for a ketone, the carbonyl is next to R groups, but the aldehyde is RCHO.

Wait, the triplet suggests that this proton is next to a CH2 group. Because each proton in a triplet is coupled with two equivalent protons. So, the aldehyde is connected to a CH2. So like RCHO-CH2-...?

Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded. So maybe it's an aldehyde at one end. Let's note that.

Next peak: 6.98 ppm, doublet (2H). That's aromatic protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, you get two doublets. Or perhaps adjacent substituents in a di-substituted ring.

Then, 6.51 ppm, another doublet (2H). So that's two aromatic protons as well. Maybe another aromatic ring?

Wait, the molecule might have two aromatic rings. Because the molecular formula has C8H9NO. Let's see:
