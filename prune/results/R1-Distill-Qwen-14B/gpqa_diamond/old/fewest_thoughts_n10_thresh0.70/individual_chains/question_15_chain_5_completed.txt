Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They're using the transit method, which I remember detects planets when they pass in front of their star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness.

Both planets have been detected via the Radial Velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, but both have the same mass. Interesting. So mass-wise, they're equal.

Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 orbits its star faster. Oh, so it's closer to its star because orbital period is shorter. Kepler's third law comes into play here—closer planet, shorter period.

Both have circular orbits, which is good because that simplifies things. No eccentricity complications.

Now, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, why? Because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. Oh right, evolved stars can expand but maybe if Planet_2's star is slightly more evolved, but they ended up same radius. So same radius but different masses.

Wait, higher mass stars are usually larger, but here Planet_1's star is more massive but same radius as Planet_2's. That's interesting. So maybe Planet_2's star is a bit evolved but hasn't expanded much yet. Not sure, but the main point is same radius.

Now, transit probability depends on several factors. The key formula I remember is that the probability P is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (something else). Wait, the formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (sin i)^2, but wait, no, the actual formula is (R_p + R_s) / R_s, but wait, no, I think the transit probability is actually the ratio of the sizes squared multiplied by the impact parameter. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability, the geometric probability, is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)), but wait, no, that's the transit depth. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I think the geometric probability is actually (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (b)), where b is the impact parameter, but actually, no. Wait, no, the geometric probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the star's disk, multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned enough for a transit. Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (1 + (R_p / R_s)) ) / ( (a/R_s) ) ), but maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, I recall that the probability that a planet transits is (R_p + R_s) / (a), but that can't be right. Wait, no, that's the condition for a transit to happen, but the probability is when the orbital inclination is right. Oh, right, the transit probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (1 + (R_p / R_s)) ) / ( (a / R_s) ) ), but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our view) depends on the size of the star and the distance of the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is P = (R_p + R_s)² / (a (1 - e²)) ), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), it's P = ( (R_p + R_s) / a )².

Wait, no, that's the formula for the area of the transit, maybe. Alternatively, the geometric probability (the probability that a transit occurs, assuming random orientation) is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)) ), because the planet must be within the star's disk. So a is the semi-major axis. But wait, in terms of orbital period, a is related via Kepler's third law.

Wait, no, let me correct. The geometric probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's orbit that would cause a transit to the total possible area. Alternatively, I think the formula is (R_p / R_s)² * (1 + (R_p / R_s)) ) / ( (a / R_s) ) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for the standard transit probability formula.

Wait, I think the transit probability, geometric probability, is given by P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (1 + R_p / R_s) ) / ( (a / R_s) ) ) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 + (R_p / R_s)) divided by (a / R_s). Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the relative sizes and the orbital distance.

Alternatively, the transit probability can be approximated as (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s + R_p) / a ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use Kepler's third law to find the semi-major axis a for each planet and then compute the transit probability based on a and R_s and R_p.

Wait, the transit probability is given by the formula:

P = ( (R_p + R_s) / a )² * ( (1 + (R_p / R_s)) )² ?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should just recall that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits. The alignment factor is 1/(a/R_s), but actually, no.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. The formula I remember is P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a / R_s)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (R_s / a), because if a is larger, the probability is lower. So P ∝ (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s/a) ) = (R_p^2 R_s ) / (a R_s^2 ) ) = (R_p^2) / (a R_s ).

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let's think about the factors that influence transit probability.

The key factors are:

1. The size of the planet compared to the star: a larger planet relative to the star increases the probability of a transit because the area blocked is larger. So (R_p / R_s)² is a factor.

2. The distance of the planet from the star: if the planet is closer (smaller a), the transit is more probable because the orbital plane is more likely to intersect our line of sight. So a smaller a increases the probability. So the probability is inversely proportional to a.

Wait, so putting it together: P ∝ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a )

Wait, but actually, I think the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s) ), because a/R_s is the distance in units of the star's radius. So a/R_s is a measure of how far the planet is from the star in terms of the star's size. So if a is larger, the planet is farther away, making the transit less likely. So P is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a ), because a is in meters, R_s is in meters. So R_s/a is the inverse of a/R_s.

Wait, perhaps another way: the transit probability (geometric probability) is given by:

P = ( (R_p + R_s) / a )^2 * ( (1 + R_p / R_s) )

Wait, but I'm not confident. Maybe another approach is better.

Alternatively, since both planets have the same mass, but the question is about transit probability, which depends on their orbital distances and the sizes.

Let me think about Kepler's third law. The period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the mass of the star M by:

P² = (4π² / G(M + m)) ) a³

But since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, we can approximate M + m ≈ M.

So P² ∝ a³ / M.

Given that, for each planet, we can find their a.

Given that Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 / 3.

Let me assign some variables. Let P2 be the period of Planet_2, so P1 = P2 /3.

We know that for Planet_1, M1 = 2 * M2 (since its host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host). Wait, no: the question says the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host of Planet_2. So M1 = 2 M2.

So for Planet_1:

P1² = (4π² / G (2 M2)) ) a1³

For Planet_2:

P2² = (4π² / G (M2)) ) a2³

Divide the two equations to find a1 in terms of a2:

(P1² / P2²) = ( a1³ / a2³ ) * ( M2 / (2 M2) )

Simplify: ( (P2/3)^2 / P2^2 ) ) = ( a1³ / a2³ ) * (1/2 )

So (1/9) = (a1³ / a2³ ) * (1/2 )

Multiply both sides by 2: (2/9) = a1³ / a2³

Take cube roots: (a1/a2) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is approximately 0.606 times a2.

So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to its.

Now, transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a ), as previously thought.

Wait, so the formula I'm considering is P ∝ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a ) = (R_p^2 R_s) / ( R_s^2 a ) ) = (R_p^2) / ( R_s a )

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/R_s)) ), which is (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a ) = (R_p^2 R_s ) / ( R_s^2 a ) ) = (R_p^2) / ( R_s a )

Wait, but if that's the case, then for each planet, P = (R_p^2) / ( R_s a )

But both planets are Earth-like, so R_p is the same for both. So R_p is same. So P is inversely proportional to (R_s a ), because the denominator is R_s a.

So for each planet, P is proportional to 1/( R_s * a )

So let's compute R_s and a for each.

Planet_1 has R_s1 = R_s2 (since both stars have same radius).

a1 is approximately 0.606 a2.

So for Planet_1: denominator is R_s * a1 = R_s * (0.606 a2 )

For Planet_2: denominator is R_s * a2.

So the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 = (1/( R_s1 a1 )) / (1/( R_s2 a2 )) ) = ( R_s2 a2 ) / ( R_s1 a1 )

But R_s1 = R_s2, so this simplifies to (a2) / (a1).

We have a1 ≈ 0.606 a2, so P1/P2 = a2 / (0.606 a2 ) = 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 = 1.65 * P2.

Which means Planet_1 has a higher transit probability than Planet_2 by about 1.65 times.

So the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options: option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times, which doesn't match. So the correct answer should be C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which depends on the planet-to-star radius ratio and the orbital distance. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{R_s \cdot a}
\]

where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, \( R_s \) is the star's radius, and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

### Key Information:
1. **Planet Masses**: Both planets have the same mass.
2. **Orbital Periods**: Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2 (\( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)).
3. **Star Masses**: The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host star of Planet_2 (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)).
4. **Star Radii**: Both stars have the same radius (\( R_{s1} = R_{s2} \)).
5. **Orbital Distance**: Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the star's mass \( M \) by:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2, this gives:

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) and \( M_1 = 2M_2 \):

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to its star (\( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \)).

### Transit Probability Comparison:
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( R_s \cdot a \). Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_{s1} = R_{s2} \)), the transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1}{R_{s1} \cdot a_1} \div \frac{1}{R_{s2} \cdot a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.606a_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Conclusion:
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a higher probability of transiting (~1.65 times that of Planet_2).
