Okay, so I need to find the pH of this solution. Hmm, the problem is about mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide. Oh wait, I remember that mixing acids and bases can neutralize each other. So maybe I should first figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions and see what's left after neutralization.

Let me jot down the details. The volumes are 500 mL, 400 mL, and 300 mL for each solution. The concentrations are 0.1 M CH3COOH, 0.2 M HCl, and 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.

Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, right? So it doesn't dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, releasing H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

Hmm, so first I should calculate the moles of each component.

For CH3COOH: volume is 0.5 L, concentration 0.1 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.05 moles. But since it's a weak acid, I can't just take all of it as H+... wait, but when mixed with strong acid and base, maybe it's part of the neutralization?

Wait, let's think about the reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is an acid, HCl is an acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So when you mix acids and a base, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

So the OH- from the base will neutralize the H+ from the acids. But wait, which one is in excess?

Let me calculate the moles of H+ and OH-.

HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives 1 mole H+. So moles of H+ from HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it contributes some H+ but not all. But wait, when you mix all these, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. But since CH3COOH is weak, maybe it's more efficient to first consider the strong acid and the base.

Wait, but wait, Ba(OH)2 is a base, so every mole gives 2 moles OH-. So moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

Now, the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. HCl contributes 0.08 moles H+. CH3COOH contributes some H+. Let me think: since CH3COOH is a weak acid, in the presence of strong acid and a strong base, maybe the weak acid doesn't dissociate much. Or perhaps it's negligible compared to the strong acid and base. Hmm, but I might need to consider it.

Wait, maybe it's better to calculate all the H+ and OH- first, see which is in excess.

So total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles. From CH3COOH: I'll say x moles (but I don't know x yet). Total OH-: 0.18 moles.

So the OH- will react with H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the available H+ is 0.08 (from HCl) + x (from CH3COOH). The OH- is 0.18.

So let's see: 0.08 + x = ?

If 0.08 + x > 0.18, then excess H+ will be (0.08 +x -0.18). Otherwise, excess OH-.

Wait, but I don't know x yet. Because CH3COOH is a weak acid, its dissociation is not complete. So in the presence of other H+ ions, perhaps the dissociation is suppressed? Or maybe not, because the other H+ is from a strong acid.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed by considering the strong acid and strong base first, then see how much of the weak acid contributes.

So total H+ from HCl is 0.08. CH3COOH is 0.05 moles.

Ba(OH)2 contributes 0.18 moles OH-.

So, the OH- will react with H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

So the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, which is 0.08 moles. Then any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid. How much H+ does it contribute? In a solution, its dissociation is given by Ka. The Ka for acetic acid is around 1.8e-5. But in this case, since we have a lot of H+ from HCl, which is a strong acid, the presence of H+ will suppress the dissociation of CH3COOH. So perhaps the CH3COOH doesn't contribute much H+ beyond what's already present.

Wait, another approach: the total H+ from HCl is 0.08, and the OH- is 0.18. So after neutralization, the OH- will consume all the H+ from HCl (0.08), leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Then, these 0.10 moles of OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH. How much H+ does CH3COOH contribute?

CH3COOH has 0.05 moles. But in a solution with excess OH-, the CH3COOH will dissociate more, but perhaps not completely. Alternatively, since OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

Wait, wait a second. If we have OH- left, it would react with any available H+ from CH3COOH.

But the reaction is OH- + H+ → H2O. So, the 0.10 moles of OH- will neutralize 0.10 moles of H+ from CH3COOH.

So the CH3COOH has 0.05 moles. If 0.10 moles of OH- are present, which is more than 0.05, then all of the CH3COOH will be deprotonated, and the remaining OH- will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but CH3COOH is 0.05 moles, so it can donate up to 0.05 H+. So the OH- will take 0.05 H+ from CH3COOH, neutralizing it, and the remaining OH- is 0.10 -0.05 =0.05.

Wait, but wait: the initial OH- after HCl neutralization was 0.10. Then, OH- reacts with CH3COOH.

Each CH3COOH molecule can donate one H+ (since it's a monoprotic acid). So 0.05 moles of CH3COOH can donate 0.05 H+.

So the OH- will consume 0.05 H+ from CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

So total OH- after all reactions: 0.05 moles.

So the total volume of the solution is 500 +400 +300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38. So pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, that would be option A) 12.62.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because, when OH- neutralizes the H+ from CH3COOH, do I need to consider the dissociation of CH3COOH?

Wait another way: when you mix a weak acid (CH3COOH) with a strong base (OH-), the OH- will deprotonate the weak acid. So the reaction is OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So in this case, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. HCl gives 0.08 H+, which neutralizes 0.08 OH-; but wait, no, wait. Wait, when you mix H+ and OH-, they neutralize each other. So the H+ from HCl will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So the H+ from HCl is 0.08. OH- is 0.18.

So the neutralization between H+ and OH- would be:

H+ (0.08) + OH- (0.08) → H2O.

That leaves 0.18 -0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining.

Then, the remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH. Since CH3COOH is an acid, the OH- will deprotonate it.

So the reaction is OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05, so it can neutralize 0.05 moles of OH-.

So after neutralizing H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, the OH- left is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05.

So total OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L. So OH- concentration is 0.05 /1.2 = 0.041667 M.

pOH is -log(0.041667) ≈1.38. So pH is 14-1.38=12.62. So option A.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have mixed up the ions. Let me think again.

The initial H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. HCl is strong, so 0.08 H+. CH3COOH, which is weak, contributes some H+.

But when OH- is present, the H+ from HCl and the weak acid will neutralize the OH-.

So the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

So the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from the strongest acid, which is HCl. So 0.08 H+ from HCl reacts with 0.08 OH- from Ba(OH)2. That leaves 0.18 -0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Now, the remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH. How much H+ does CH3COOH contribute?

In pure water, CH3COOH would dissociate a little, but in the presence of excess OH-, the dissociation is driven to the right. So the CH3COOH would donate H+ until either the OH- is consumed or the CH3COOH is all deprotonated.

The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05. So it can donate 0.05 H+. The remaining OH- is 0.10. So 0.05 H+ will react with 0.05 OH-, leaving 0.05 OH-.

So total OH- left is 0.05, in 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05 /1.2 ≈0.04167 M. pOH is around 1.38, so pH is 14-1.38=12.62.

So the correct answer is option A) 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids and the base in the mixture. The solution contains:

1. **CH₃COOH (weak acid)**: 0.5 L × 0.1 M = 0.05 moles  
2. **HCl (strong acid)**: 0.4 L × 0.2 M = 0.08 moles H⁺  
3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base)**: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)₂ → 0.18 moles OH⁻ (since each Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 OH⁻ ions).

### Step 1: Neutralization between H⁺ and OH⁻
The strong acid (HCl) contributes 0.08 moles of H⁺, and the strong base (Ba(OH)₂) contributes 0.18 moles of OH⁻. These ions react as follows:

\[
\text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}
\]

- The 0.08 moles of H⁺ from HCl neutralize 0.08 moles of OH⁻, leaving:
  \[
  0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH⁻ remaining}.
  \]

### Step 2: Neutralization of Remaining OH⁻ with CH₃COOH
The remaining 0.10 moles of OH⁻ react with CH₃COOH, a weak acid. Each CH₃COOH molecule donates one H⁺:

\[
\text{OH⁻} + \text{CH₃COOH} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}.
\]

- CH₃COOH contributes 0.05 moles of H⁺, which neutralizes 0.05 moles of OH⁻.  
- After this reaction, 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH⁻ remain.

### Step 3: Calculate [OH⁻] and pH
The total volume of the solution is:

\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of OH⁻ is:

\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{moles of OH⁻}}{\text{volume of solution}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.
