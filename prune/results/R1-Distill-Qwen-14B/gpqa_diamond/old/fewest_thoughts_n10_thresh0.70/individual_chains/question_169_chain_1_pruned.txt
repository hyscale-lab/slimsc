Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about a nuclear decay process where two heavy nucleons of flavor A decay into two of flavor B and emit two lighter particles E and V. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It says the total energy spectrum of E is continuous with an endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is, how does the spectrum of E compare now?

Hmm, I remember that in beta decay, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because of the conservation of energy and momentum. But in that case, one of the decay products (the neutrino) carries away some energy. So the electron's energy varies depending on how much the neutrino takes.

Wait, in the original process, two E and two V are emitted. So maybe each E and V are like beta particles and antineutrinos or something? Or perhaps V is a neutrino, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

In the original decay, the E particles (like electrons or positrons) have a continuous spectrum because each can have varying energy, but the total energy and momentum must be conserved. The maximum energy Q is when the V particles take the least energy possible, maybe zero or their rest mass energy. But since V is emitted, perhaps they have some rest mass, so the E's can't all have maximum energy.

Wait, but wait. If the outgoing particles E and V are emitted in pairs, like two E and two V, maybe each E is paired with a V. So for each E, a V is emitted. If V has mass, then the energy available for each E would be limited. So the spectrum of E would be continuous up to some maximum Q, which is the total Q value of the decay divided by two (since each pair E+V would share the energy? Or maybe not; maybe all four particles share the energy. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think in the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So each E and each V are emitted, perhaps. So when considering energy
