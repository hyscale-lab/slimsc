Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these calculations, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters). It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I'm supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-, I think) in this solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, which is standard, so I don't have to worry about temperature affecting the K values.

Wait, wait. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? But I'm a bit confused because phosphate ions can have different forms depending on the pH. Oh, right, the phosphate ion exists in different forms: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

The problem gives me the Ka values for H3PO4 as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So each deprotonation step has its own Ka.

Looking at the salts provided, KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So that would contribute H2PO4^- ions to the solution.

The other salt is Na2HPO4·2H2O. Sodium phosphate dibasic, right? Its formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So this contributes HPO4^2- ions.

So in the solution, there are both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These are adjacent species in the phosphate ion's dissociation series. So I think this might form a buffer solution. Because a buffer is made from a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid.

In this case, H2PO4^- is the acid (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So the solution is a buffer solution.

The concentration of orthophosphate ions would be the concentration of HPO4^2-, I believe. So I need to find [HPO4^2-] in the solution.

To find the concentration of HPO4^2-, maybe I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Because a buffer solution's pH can be determined using that equation, and perhaps I can relate it back to the concentrations of the ions.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give me the pH. Hmm. Oh, but wait, maybe I can calculate the pH first because I know the concentrations of the acid and conjugate base. Then, if I can find the pH, I can find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, maybe I should first find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

So let's start by calculating the moles of each salt.

First, for KH2PO4. Its molecular weight is given as 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / Mw. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ approximately 0.007354 moles. Wait, let me compute that precisely.

1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007354 mol. So about 0.007354 moles of KH2PO4. Since each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-, the moles of H2PO4^- would be 0.0
