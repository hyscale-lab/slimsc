Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct major products for these two reactions. Let me take it step by step. 

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate under basic conditions, specifically with t-BuOK. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water to form product B. The options give possible structures for A and B, and I need to pick the correct pair.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one plus ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, which usually induces an elimination reaction, maybe an E2 mechanism. But wait, the starting material is a ketone. Oh, right! So, when a ketone is treated with a base like t-BuOK, it can undergo a conjugate addition or maybe a Claisen-like condensation. Alternatively, it might be a case for the Aldol reaction, but with a ketone and an ester. Hmm, or could it be a Michael addition?

Wait, ethyl acrylate is an acrylate ester, which is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So, the reaction might be a conjugate addition (Michael addition) where the enolate of the ketone attacks the beta position of the acrylate. But wait, the ketone here is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw its structure. The cyclohexanone has a methyl group at C2 and C6, and an ethyl at C2 as well. Wait, no, wait: the numbering is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, position 2 has an ethyl and methyl group? No, wait. Wait, 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl. Oh, no. The numbering is such that the carbonyl is at position 1. So, positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. So, the
