Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal structures, right? It's also called the trigonal crystal system sometimes. So, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

The given parameters are the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait. Wait a second, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms in the crystal structure. But in a rhombohedral crystal, each lattice point is a corner of a rhombohedron. Oh, right, the lattice parameter 'a' is the edge length of the rhombohedron, which is the interatomic distance here. So I can take a = 10 Angstroms.

The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. In a rhombohedral structure, all three angles are equal, so that's why they're all 30 degrees. Now, the problem is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance, d_hkl, is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the structure factor vector divided by the lattice constant. Wait, more accurately, the formula is d_hkl = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cosβ - 2kl cosγ ). Wait, no, wait. I might be mixing some terms here. Let me think about the Miller indices and the formula.

Oh right, for a general cubic system, the interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² ), but in non-cubic systems, this formula changes because the angles between the axes are not 90 degrees. So in a rhombohedral system, the formula becomes more complicated since the angles are all the same and less than 90 degrees.

The correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral (trigonal) crystal is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α ). Wait, because in rhombohedral,
