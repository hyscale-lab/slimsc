Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I need to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, I remember that the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So each state has a certain energy, and I sum exp(-βE) for each state.

But wait, with three spins, each can be +1 or -1. So how many possible states are there? Each spin has two possibilities, so 2^3 = 8 states total. Okay, that's manageable.

So I need to calculate the energy for each of these 8 states and then compute the sum of exp(-βE) for all of them.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the structure of the energy. The energy is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. So E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me factor that out.

Each term S_i S_j is +1 if the two spins are the same, and -1 if different. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be 3 (all same), 1 (two same, one different), -1 (two different, one same), or -3 (all different). Wait, let me make sure. Let me think of all possible combinations.

Wait, let's compute the sum for each possible state. Let's represent each state as (S1, S2, S3).

Case 1: All spins up: (1,1,1)
Sum: 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Case 2: Two up, one down. Let's say S3 is -1, others +1: (1,1,-1)
Sum: 1*1 + 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, no. Wait E is -J times the sum. So E = -J*(sum). So for sum=3, E is -3J. For sum=-1, E is J, because -J*(-1) = J.

Hmm, but wait for all possible two-up one-down states, how many are there? There are three such states: one where each spin is the 'down' one. So S1 down, S2 and S3 up; S2 down, others up; S3 down, others up.

So each of these three states has sum S1S2 + ... = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1= -1. So for each, E = J.

Now, case 3: One up, two down.

Wait, let's take S1 up, others down: (1,-1,-1)
Sum: (1*-1) + (1*-1) + (-1*-1) = (-1) + (-1) + (1) = -1. So E = J.

Wait, what about S1 and S2 up, S3 down? No, that's the same as case 2.

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute for each possible state.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the sum for each state and then group them by how many terms are same or different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the energy depends on how many pairs are aligned.

Wait, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is equal to (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²) ) / 2.

Wait, because (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. So ab + ac + bc = [ (a+b+c)^2 - (a² + b² + c²) ] / 2.

Each S_i is either +1 or -1. So S_i²=1 for all i. So the sum is [ (S1+S2+S3)^2 -3 ] / 2.

So sum S1S2 + ... = [ (S1+S2+S3)^2 - 3 ] / 2.

Hmm, that might be a useful way to compute it.

So the sum becomes [ (M)^2 -3 ] / 2, where M is the total magnetization M = S1 + S2 + S3.

What are the possible values of M? Each S_i is ±1, so possible sums:

When all three are 1, M=3.

Two up, one down: M=1.

One up, two down: M=-1.

All three down: M=-3.

So M can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

So let's compute the sum for each M.

If M=3: sum = [9 -3]/2 = 6/2 =3.

If M=1: [1-3]/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.

If M=-1: same as M=1, because (-1)^2 is 1. So sum is (-2)/2 = -1.

If M=-3: [9-3]/2 =3.

So the sum S1S2+... can be 3 or -1, depending on whether M is ±3 or ±1.

So for M=3 and M=-3, sum is 3; for M=1 and M=-1, sum is -1.

So the energy for each state is E = -J * (sum).

So when sum is 3, E = -3J.

When sum is -1, E = J.

Now, how many states correspond to each M?

M=3: only one state, all spins up.

M=-3: only one state, all spins down.

M=1: three states (each has two up, one down).

M=-1: three states (each has two down, one up).

So now, for all possible states, the energies are:

M=3: E=-3J → exponent is exp(β*3J).

M=-3: E=3J → exp(-β*3J).

M=1 and M=-1: E= J → exp(-β*J).

Wait, wait. Because E is -J sum, when sum is 3, E is -3J.

Wait, so the exponent is exp(-β E) = exp(3J β) for M=3, and exp(3J β) for M=-3? Wait no, because E is -3J for M=3 and E is 3J for M=-3. Wait wait: wait, earlier I said when M=3, sum=3, E=-3J. When M=-3, sum=3, E=-3J?

Wait, no. Let me recheck. M is S1+S2+S3. When M=3, all spins are up. Sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = 3. So E = -J *3 = -3J.

When M=-3, all spins are down: S1S2=1, because (-1)(-1)=1. So sum is 3, same as before. So E is -J *3 = -3J. Wait, that can't be right. Because when all spins are down, each product S_i S_j is 1 (since (-1)(-1)=1). So sum is 3. So E is -3J. So for M=3, E=-3J, and for M=-3, E=-3J as well.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because if all spins are down, S_i S_j = 1 for each pair, so sum is 3, E is -3J. So when M=3 (all up), E=-3J. When M=-3 (all down), E=-3J as well.

But earlier, when M=1, sum is -1. So E= J. Similarly for M=-1, sum is -1, E= J.

Wait, no. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, for M=1, sum of products is -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Same for M=-1: sum is -1 → E=J.

So the energies are:

- For M=3 and M=-3: E=-3J.

- For M=1 and M=-1: E=J.

Wait, but wait, when M=-3, you have all spins down, so each product is 1, sum is 3, so E=-3J.

So in this case, all states with M=3 and M=-3 have E=-3J. How many such states are there? Two: all up and all down.

And the states with M=1 and M=-1 have E=J. How many states? 3 +3=6 states.

So now, each state contributes a term of exp( -β E ) to the partition function.

So for the two states where E=-3J, each contributes exp(3J β ), because E is negative.

Wait, the exponent is -β E. So if E is -3J, then -β*(-3J)= 3J β.

So for these two states, each contributes e^{3J β}.

For the six states where E=J, each contributes e^{- J β}.

So the partition function Z is:

Z = 2 * e^{3J β} + 6 * e^{- J β}.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Z= 2 e^{-3Jβ}+6e^{Jβ} → no, because the first term is e^{-3Jβ}.

Option B: Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ} → matches our calculation.

Option C: Z= 2e^{2Jβ}+6e^{-2Jβ} → no, exponents are 2Jβ.

Option D: Z=6e^{2Jβ} +2e^{-2Jβ} → no.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To calculate the partition function \( Z \) for the given system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Energy Expression**:  
   The energy depends on the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \), which can take values \( 3, 1, -1, -3 \) depending on the alignment of spins. Using the relationship \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = \frac{(S_1 + S_2 + S_3)^2 - 3}{2} \), the energy becomes:  
   \[
   E = -J \cdot \frac{(S_1 + S_2 + S_3)^2 - 3}{2}.
   \]  
   The total magnetization \( M = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 \) can take values \( M = 3, 1, -1, -3 \). For each \( M \), the energy \( E \) is:  
   - \( M = 3 \) or \( M = -3 \): \( E = -3J \).  
   - \( M = 1 \) or \( M = -1 \): \( E = J \).

2. **Number of States**:  
   - For \( M = 3 \) or \( M = -3 \): Only 1 state each (all spins up or all spins down).  
   - For \( M = 1 \) or \( M = -1 \): 3 states each (two spins up and one down, or two spins down and one up).  
   Thus, there are 2 states with \( E = -3J \) and 6 states with \( E = J \).

3. **Partition Function**:  
   The partition function is the sum over all states of \( \exp(-\beta E) \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \).  
   - For the 2 states with \( E = -3J \): Each contributes \( \exp(3J\beta) \), so their total contribution is \( 2\exp(3J\beta) \).  
   - For the 6 states with \( E = J \): Each contributes \( \exp(-J\beta) \), so their total contribution is \( 6\exp(-J\beta) \).  
   Therefore, the partition function is:  
   \[
   Z = 2\exp(3J\beta) + 6\exp(-J\beta).
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing with the given options:  
   - **Option A**: \( Z = 2\exp(-3J\beta) + 6\exp(J\beta) \) → Incorrect, as the exponents are reversed.  
   - **Option B**: \( Z = 2\exp(3J\beta) + 6\exp(-J\beta) \) → Correct, matches the derived expression.  
   - **Option C**: \( Z = 2\exp(2J\beta) + 6\exp(-2J\beta) \) → Incorrect, exponents are \( 2J\beta \) instead of \( 3J\beta \) and \( J\beta \).  
   - **Option D**: \( Z = 6\exp(2J\beta) + 2\exp(-2J\beta) \) → Incorrect, exponents are \( 2J\beta \) and the coefficients are swapped.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.
