Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, rhombohedral crystal, right? I remember that rhombohedral structures have all edges equal and all angles the same, which is the case here with alpha, beta, gamma all being 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance... I think that refers to the lattice parameter 'a' in a cubic structure, but since this is rhombohedral, it's a bit different.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal structure. I remember the formula for interplanar distance, d_hkl, is given by 1/d = |h a + k b + l c| / (h² + k² + l² + ... something?), wait no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, no, the formula for d is a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ...)) but I might be getting it wrong because that's for a cubic system, I think. But since this is a rhombohedral, the formula must be adjusted for the angles.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d_{hkl} = (a)/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ))) ), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that might not be right. Rhombohedral systems have all edges equal, so a = b = c. But the angles are not 90 degrees, so the formula will involve cosine terms for those angles.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for d is given by (a) divided by the square root of (h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos γ). Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the signs. Let me think. In the case of a cubic system, all angles are 90 degrees, so the cosine terms would be zero, and the formula simplifies to a/sqrt(h²+k²+l²), which I remember.

In this case,
