Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on an experiment. The reaction involves using 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I have to figure out which option is correct.

Hmm, wait. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, I think. Oh right, it's often used in the Corey-Bakshi-Shibata (CBS) reduction, which is for epoxide openings. But wait, this reaction is heating for a day. Maybe it's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening? Or perhaps it's something else. Alternatively, another possibility is that the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction is some kind of ring-opening. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction here is the opening of an epoxide under basic conditions. Wait, but 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So perhaps it's used to deprotonate something, maybe in a conjugate addition or elimination.

Wait, the starting compound is X, and the product's NMR is given. So the product is the result of X reacting with this base. Let me think. If X is an epoxide, then the base might cause it to open. But another thought: maybe X is a carbonyl-containing compound, and the base is causing some kind of enolate formation, leading to a ring-opening or rearrangement.

Wait, but the product's NMR has specific signals. Let me look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR has:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): perhaps a methyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe an aromatic ring or an electronegative atom.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): another methyl, maybe adjacent to something like oxygen or another substituent.
- Then a set of doublets and so on in the aromatic region.

Looking at the 13C NMR
