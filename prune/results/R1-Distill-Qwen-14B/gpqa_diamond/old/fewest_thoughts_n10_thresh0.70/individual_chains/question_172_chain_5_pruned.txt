Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. The stars are in LTE, so I think that means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so the usual statistical mechanics apply.

I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the thermal energy of the photosphere. Specifically, the Boltzmann equation probably comes into play here. The Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states.

The Boltzmann factor is something like the probability of a particle being in a certain energy state. The formula is (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, since we're comparing two energy levels, let's say E2 is higher than E1 by delta E. So E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote this as ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J.

The ratio of the populations (number of atoms in each state) is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let's say n2 is the number in the higher level (E2) and n1 is the number in the lower level (E1) for each star.

For star 1, the ratio is n2_1 / n1_1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). Similarly, for star 2, n2_2 / n1_2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

But wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. Oh, wait, does that mean n2_1/n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2)?

Wait, no, I think the question says that the number of excited atoms in star 1 is twice that in star 2. So if the lower level is the ground state, and the higher is the excited state, then n2_1 = 2 * n2_2. Or maybe it's the ratio of the excited state populations. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio n2/n1 is twice as much in star_1 than in star_2.

I think the correct approach is to consider the ratio of the excitation in the two stars. Let's set up the equations.

For star_1:
n2_1 / n1_1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2:
n2_2 / n1_2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, it's possible that g2/g1 is the same for both stars because the same element
