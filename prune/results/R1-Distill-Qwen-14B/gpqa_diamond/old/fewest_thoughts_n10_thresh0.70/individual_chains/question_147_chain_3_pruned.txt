Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, it's a proton and an antiproton annihilating into two pairs of particles. Interesting.

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The given data is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass energy of A is 300 MeV. Oh wait, so m_A c² is 300 MeV. I remember that in particle physics, masses are often given in MeV/c², but here it's m_A c² =300 MeV, so m_A = 300 MeV/(c²). Noted.

So, first, I think I need to figure out the conservation laws here. Since it's an annihilation process, I should consider conservation of energy and momentum. But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps we can make some approximations. Hmm.

Wait, the antiproton is slowly moving. So its velocity is low, which probably means that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Because for protons, the rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², so if it's moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving but slowly. Or perhaps the system's initial momentum is considered? Hmm, maybe I should model the initial situation.

Wait, the system is p + p̄. The initial momentum would be the sum of the momenta of the proton and the antiproton. Since the proton is moving and the antiproton is moving, but perhaps in this case, the proton is at rest? Or maybe both are moving towards each other? Hmm, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it. So that the initial momentum can be approximated by just the antiproton's momentum.

Wait but in the reaction, the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻. So, four particles in total. But when particles are produced in pairs, perhaps they are moving in certain directions. I think that in such annihilation processes, the products are symmetric, so maybe the two A⁺
