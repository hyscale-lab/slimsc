Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by the process where it annihilates with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. The options are all in the ranges of GeV, which is way higher energy than typical CMB photons.

I remember that when high-energy particles like gamma-rays travel through space, they can interact with the CMB. In this case, the interaction is pair production: gamma plus a photon becomes e+ and e-. So, the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by how quickly it can lose energy through this process. When the mean free time for such interactions becomes comparable to the age of the universe, that's when the energy is significant.

I think the formula for the interaction rate (like the cross-section times photon density) would come into play here. The cross-section for this process probably depends on the energies of both photons involved. Since the CMB photons are low energy (1e-3 eV), and the gamma-ray is high energy, let's denote the gamma's energy as E.

The cross-section for pair production via photon-photon interaction is a bit tricky. I recall that the cross-section σ is proportional to the square of the logarithm of the energy ratio. The formula might look something like σ ∝ (log(E/ε))^2, where ε is the CMB photon energy. But wait, there's a threshold condition here. For pair production to occur, the combined energy of the two photons must be at least the rest mass energy of an electron pair, which is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. So, E_gamma * E_photon >= (0.511 MeV)^2, but since the photon energy is much lower, the condition is mainly that E_gamma must be above a certain threshold.

Wait, no, actually, the threshold condition for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair is when the sum of their four-momenta has enough invariant mass. Since the CMB photon's energy is ε, and the gamma's is E, the condition is E * ε >= (m_e c^2)^2 / c^2? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of energy units. The invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since the photons are moving in opposite directions (assuming head-on collision), their momenta are in opposite directions. So p_photon = ε/(c) (since for photons, E=pc). Similarly for the gamma, p_gamma = E/(c).

So the invariant s would be (E + ε)^2 - (E - ε)^2 (because they're moving opposite). Let's calculate that:

s = (E + ε)^2 - (E - ε)^2
= [E² + 2Eε + ε²] - [E² -
