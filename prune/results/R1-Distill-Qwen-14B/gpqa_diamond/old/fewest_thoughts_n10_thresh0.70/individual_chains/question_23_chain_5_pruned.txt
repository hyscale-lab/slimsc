Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a reaction between a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. The researcher used TLC and observed that the reactant spot decreased, with two new spots appearing. So, the reaction likely proceeded, producing two products.

The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that structure to visualize it. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is 3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. The substituents on the butenyl are at C2 and C2, so two methyl groups attached to the second carbon. So the structure is like benzene-O-(CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2) but wait, wait no. Wait, butenyl is four carbons. The structure on the oxygen is 1-yl, so it's O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, butenyl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond at 3. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait no, the butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl, which is CH2CH2CH=CH attached to the oxygen. Wait, wait, no. Let me correct: the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH=CH2, but wait, hold on, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, numbering starts from the point of attachment. So the 1-yl is the point of attachment, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be because with four carbons, the double bond would be between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4, which would be the last two carbons. So the structure would be CH2
