Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this question about rotavirus and the immune response in mice. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid and some got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability.

Hmm, what do I know about rotavirus and the immune system? Rotavirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis. When it infects, it typically starts in the small intestine. The initial immune response involves the activation of certain immune cells, maybe like dendritic cells or macrophages, which then present the antigen to T cells and B cells.

Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? They're specialized areas where immune responses are initiated, especially against pathogens that enter through the digestive system. So when the GFP-tagged proteins reach the Peyer's patches, that's where the immune cells are getting activated.

Now, the key part is that the variable heavy chain genes show high variability. Variable regions in antibodies are crucial because each B cell produces a unique antibody. The variability comes from the different ways the V, D, and J gene segments are combined during a process called VDJ recombination. Wait, but waitâ€”VDJ happens during the early stages of B cell development, like in the bone marrow. So does that process explain the variability here?

Wait, but the problem says they isolated the proliferating cells. Proliferation usually happens after activation. So after an antigen is presented, B cells in the lymphoid tissues (like Peyer's patches) get activated and start dividing. Once they're activated, they undergo a process called somatic hypermutation, which increases the diversity of the antibodies they produce. Oh, right! Somatic hypermutation occurs in the germinal centers during the later stages of the immune response, leading to affinity maturation.

So the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is likely due to somatic hypermutation. Because without this process, the initial antibodies would have less diversity, but after activation, the B cells undergo mutation, leading to more varied and specific antibodies.

Looking at the options:

A) somatic hypermutation: This seems to fit because it's the process that increases variability in B cell receptors during the immune response.

B) complement activation: That's more about opsonization and clearing pathogens, not directly about the variability in genes.

C) class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) but doesn't increase the variability in the variable regions themselves.

D) VDJ recombination: That's the initial process in the bone marrow, which sets the initial diversity but doesn't add more variability after the B cell is mature. Since the question is about the process happening after delivery, when the cells are already in the lymphoid tissue, this is probably not it.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The question involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice. The GFP-tagged proteins are observed to interact with the immune system, particularly at Peyer's patches, where the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating cells show high variability. This variability is a hallmark of processes that generate antibody diversity.

Rotavirus infection begins in the small intestine, and Peyer's patches are specialized lymphoid tissues in the gut where immune responses to such pathogens are initiated. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes observed in the proliferating cells suggests a process that increases antibody diversity. 

Among the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, leading to increased diversity in antibody variable regions. It fits the context of the observed variability and the stage of B cell activation in the lymphoid tissue.
- **B) Complement activation**: This process involves opsonization and pathogen clearance but does not directly contribute to antibody variability.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody produced but does not increase variability in the variable regions.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes initial diversity but does not explain the observed variability in mature B cells after antigen exposure.

Given the context of the immune response and the observed variability, the correct answer is **A) somatic hypermutation**, as it is the process responsible for generating the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes during the immune response.

Answer: A
