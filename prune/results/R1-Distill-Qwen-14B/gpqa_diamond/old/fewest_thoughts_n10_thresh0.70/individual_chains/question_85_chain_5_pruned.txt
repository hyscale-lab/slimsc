Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says there are two planets orbiting a star. Both have been detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star's mass is 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times, and Teff 6300 K. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth, while Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radius. Both have circular orbits, same albedo. We need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, Planet1 to Planet2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. The formula I remember is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Oh, but wait, since both planets have the same albedo, that term cancels out when taking the ratio. So I don't have to worry about that part.

So, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures would be sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1)) / (R_star/(2 a2)) ) )^0.5? No, wait. Let me get the formula right. The equilibrium temperature is proportional to T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a
