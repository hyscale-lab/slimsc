Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states that we have three solutions mixed together: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change for this reaction. 

Wait, the options are in different units, some in kcal and others in kJ. Oh right, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, so I'll have to be careful with the units when converting.

First, I need to figure out what reaction is happening here. HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So they should neutralize each other in a neutralization reaction. But since there are two acids and one base, I should probably calculate the moles of each and see which is the limiting reactant.

Let me break it down. Each acid will donate H+ ions, and the base will donate OH- ions. The neutralization reaction produces water and possibly some salt.

So, the acids are HCl and H2SO4. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+ ion. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic, right? So the first H+ dissociates completely, but the second might not, but for neutralization purposes, I think we consider both H+ ions. Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well; each mole gives two OH- ions because it's Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^-.

Wait, but in neutralization, the H+ from acids reacts with OH- from the base to form water. So, the total moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base will determine how much neutralization occurs.

So, let's calculate moles for each component.

Starting with HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one H+ → 0.1 mol H+.

Next, H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+ → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2. Volume is 200 mL → 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the reaction is between H+ and OH-: H+ + OH- → H2O. The total moles of H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So the OH- is the limiting reactant here because 0.2 < 0.28. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will be left over.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH-. So total available H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is limiting, only 0.2 moles will react, leaving 0.0
