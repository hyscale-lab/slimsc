Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about two planets orbiting a star. I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors—like the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the problem says both have the same albedo, so that part cancels out. That's one less thing to worry about.

The question gives me the star's mass, radius, and effective temperature. The star is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times the Sun, and Teff 6300 K. Both planets are detected via transit and RV methods. Their masses are 7 and 5 Earth masses, but I'm not sure if mass matters here since we're dealing with equilibrium temperature, which depends more on distance and albedo. But wait, mass might relate to the RV method's data—so maybe that's to find the orbital periods or distances?

Wait, the problem gives me the Doppler shifts from each planet. Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 0.04 Å. The forbidden line is at 6300 Å. Oh right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's movement from the planet's gravitational pull. The shift relates to the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The formula I remember for RV is v = (λ shift) / λ * c, but maybe I can use it to find the velocity semi-amplitude. The velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the star, as well as the orbital period and distance. But I'm not sure how to find the distance from that. Oh wait, the radial velocity method gives us the mass function, which depends on the planet's mass and the inclination of the orbit. But since the transit method was used, the inclination is probably close to 90 degrees, making the orbit edge-on, which means the RV measurements are more accurate because the Doppler shift is maximum.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) ) — wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Alternatively, I think the formula is K = ( (2πG) / (c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ). But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So, K ≈ ( (2πG) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ). 

But I don't know the periods or the distances, so maybe I can find the ratio of the velocities from the shifts. Because if both planets are around the same star with same inclination (since transit method implies i≈90), sin i is the same (1) for both. So, K1/K2 = (M1)/(M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3) / (P1/P2)^(1/3) ) — wait, no, because K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ). So if I can find the ratio of K, which is given
