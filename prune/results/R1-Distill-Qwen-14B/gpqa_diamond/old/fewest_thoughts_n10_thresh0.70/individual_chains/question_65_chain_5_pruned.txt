Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the problem is about.

The question has two separate reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B for each. Then I'll choose the correct option from the given choices.

Let me look at the first reaction:

1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, KH, and H+. So, what's happening here? I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember.

First, the structure of the starting material: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. The spiro here is [3.5], so one ring is 3-membered and the other is 5. The substituents are a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂, but wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-) and an -OH group on the same carbon.

So the molecule has a spiro structure with two rings: a three-membered ring (like cyclopropane) and a five-membered ring, connected at the same carbon which has a vinyl group and a hydroxyl group.

The reaction conditions are THF (tetrahydrofuran) as solvent, KH (potassium hydride), and then H+ workup. Wait, wait. I think that's a two-step process. First deprotonation, then perhaps an elimination or some kind of ring-forming.

Potassium hydride is a strong base, often used for deprotonating alcohols to form alkoxide ions. So, the hydroxyl group (-OH) on the spiro compound will be deprotonated to form an alkoxide (-O-).

But wait, the starting molecule is 1-vinylspiro... non-5-en-1-ol. So the OH is on the same carbon as the vinyl group. So when the OH is deprotonated to O-, that's a good leaving group if something happens. But wait, O- is not a great leaving group unless it's something else.

Wait, perhaps it's more about elimination. Once the O- is formed, maybe an E2 elimination occurs, where the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond and the departure of the alkoxide as O-.

But wait, the structure is 1-vinyl, so maybe the O- is adjacent to the vinyl group. So when the base abstracts a proton, perhaps leading to a conjugated diene or some ring formation.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is about forming a more stable structure, like a cyclic ether, but that doesn't seem right with the given conditions.

Wait, another thought: When alcohols are treated with strong bases like KH, they can form enolates if there's an alpha hydrogen. But the structure here is a spiro compound with an adjacent double bond. So perhaps the O- can attack a nearby carbonyl, but wait, the starting material doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, wait. KH is a strong base, but
