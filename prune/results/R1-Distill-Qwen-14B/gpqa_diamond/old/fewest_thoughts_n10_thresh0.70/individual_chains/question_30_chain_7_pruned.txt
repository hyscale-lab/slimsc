Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about dyes and the colors they absorb. Hmm, I remember that when materials absorb certain wavelengths of light, they emit others, and that's how colors work. But wait, let me think through this carefully.

The question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. I think that when a substance absorbs light, it emits the complementary color. Oh wait, or is it that the emitted light is from the energy gap when electrons drop back? I'm a bit confused. Let me break it down.

Energy of a photon is given by E = hc/Î», right? So if I know the energy, I can find the wavelength. Once I have the wavelength, I can figure out the color.

So E is 2.3393 eV. I need to convert that into joules because the constants are in SI units. Oh wait, I remember that 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So multiplying that by 2.3393 gives me E in joules.

Let me calculate that: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 = approximately 3.746e-19 joules. Hmm, wait, let me do that again. 2.3393 multiplied by 1.602 is about 3.746, right? So E=3.746e-19 J.

Now, Planck's constant h is 6.626e-
