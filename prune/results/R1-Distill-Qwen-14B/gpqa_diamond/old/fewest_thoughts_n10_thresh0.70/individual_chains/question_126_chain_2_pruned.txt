Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, each starting with different compounds. After both reactions are completed, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks each will show.

First, I'll try to break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one is a ketone at carbon 3. When reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol at the same position.

So, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → after LAH → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol?

Wait, but wait. The configuration—since LAH is a strong reducing agent, it does a conjugate reduction if possible, but in this case, the ketone is a single carbonyl group. So, the reduction would just go to the secondary alcohol. The stereochemistry at C5 is (S), but upon reduction, does that affect anything? I don't think so because the reduction is at C3. So the alcohol forms at C3, and the configuration at C5 remains S. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait another thing. The starting material is 5-methoxy, which is a substituent on C5. So the structure is:

O
||
C3-C-O-Me (on C5)

After reduction, the structure becomes:

CH2-CHOH-CH2-O-Me (but wait, the chain would be longer. Let me write it out.

Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-Me? No, wait, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2 CH2 C=O CH2 CH2 CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3
