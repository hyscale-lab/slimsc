Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about optical activity. Hmm, I remember that optical activity has to do with whether a compound has chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups, right? So, each compound in the list needs to be checked for that. Also, I think about other factors like if the molecule has a plane of symmetry or if it's meso.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, no. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe Cl is on C1, which is double bonded to C2. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but the configuration is Z.

But I'm more concerned about whether it has a chiral center. For a molecule to have optical activity, it must have a chiral center
