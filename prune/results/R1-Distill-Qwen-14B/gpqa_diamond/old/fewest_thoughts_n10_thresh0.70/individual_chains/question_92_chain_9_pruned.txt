Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to calculate the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. It looks like a long carbon chain with some double bonds and branching.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies. I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. But wait, how exactly? Oh right, the enthalpy of formation of a molecule is the change in enthalpy when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So I think it's calculated using the bond dissociation energies of the bonds formed and broken.

The formula I remember is: Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of reactant bonds) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds). Or was it the other way around? Oh wait, no. The enthalpy change is products minus reactants. So for the formation, we're forming the molecule from its elements, so we're breaking bonds in the reactants (elements) and forming bonds in the product.

Wait, the elements are in their standard states. So for carbon, it's graphite, and hydrogen is H2 gas. So the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the bond energies of the bonds formed in the molecule minus the bond energies of the bonds broken in the elements.

Wait, no, maybe it's the opposite. Because when you form a molecule, you're forming new bonds, so you have to consider the energy released (exothermic) when bonds form. So the formula is: Enthalpy of formation is equal to (sum of bond energies of bonds broken) minus (sum of bond energies of bonds formed). Or wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let's think in terms of bond energies. When you form a molecule, you're starting from the elements as they are. For example, carbon in graphite has C-C bonds, and hydrogen in H2 has H-H bonds. So to make the molecule, you break the bonds in the elements (which requires energy) and form the bonds in the molecule (which releases energy). So the
