Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question starts with compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting patterns can tell us about the neighboring protons. A triplet usually comes from two neighboring protons, like in a CH2CH3 group. So maybe that 6H triplet is from two equivalent CH3 groups attached to a CH2, like in an ethyl group. Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H suggests maybe another CH2 group, but wait, quartet comes from three neighboring protons. Oh wait, no, quartet is splitting into four peaks, which would mean three neighboring protons. Let me think: a CH2 group next to a CH3 would give a quartet for the CH2. So for the 4H quartet, maybe it's a CH2CH2 group? Or perhaps a cyclopropane? No, wait, maybe the structure is something like two ethyl groups. Because 6H as a triplet (maybe two CH3 groups) and 4H as a quartet (like a CH2 next to another CH2). Wait, but more accurately, if the quartet is for 4H, that suggests two equivalent CH2 groups. So maybe it's a cyclobutane ring?

Wait, cyclobutane with substituents. Let me think. So if compound A has NMR showing triplet (6H) and quartet (4H), perhaps it's a cyclopropane with ethyl groups attached? Or maybe it's a more substituted structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl ether? No, because diethyl ether would have more complex splitting, perhaps. Or maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative with substituents. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks downfield, so maybe it's all in the CH2 and CH3 regions.

Wait another thought: 6H as a triplet. That might be two equivalent methyl groups each attached to a CH2. So perhaps the structure is (CH2CH3)2CH2? No, that's not possible. Wait, maybe it's a cyclopropane with two ethyl groups attached
