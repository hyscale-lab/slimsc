Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product after a certain reaction. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are a formyl group (CHO) at position 2 and a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂ maybe?) at position 5. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the substituents are at positions 2 and 5, and the ring has a double bond at position 3 (cyclohex-3-ene). So, the structure would have the ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, right?

Wait, cyclohex-3-ene. So positions are numbered such that the double bond is between 3 and 4. Then, the substituents: at position 2 is a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5 is a vinyl group. Vinyl is CH₂CH₂? No, wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-. So the substituent at position 5 is a vinyl group, which is a CH₂CH₂ group with a double bond. Oh wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, so the substituent is attached to the cyclohexene ring via a CH₂ group, and then a double bond to the next carbon. So it's a substituent like -CH₂CH₂? No, wait, no. Wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is CH₂=CH- attached to the cyclohexene ring. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a formyl group on carbon 2 and a vinyl group on carbon 5.

The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, red phosphorus and HI... That rings a bell. I remember that when alkenes are treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's a reaction that typically adds to the double
