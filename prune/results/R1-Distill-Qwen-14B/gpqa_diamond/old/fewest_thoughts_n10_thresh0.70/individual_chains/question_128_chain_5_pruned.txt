Okay, so I've just started my new job at this structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The Principal Investigator gave me the amino acid sequence, and I have four plasmid options to choose from. I need to figure out which plasmid has the correct DNA sequence to produce this protein.

Hmm, I remember that when cloning a gene into E. coli, the plasmid needs to have the correct reading frame and appropriate promoters. Also, E. coli uses its own codon usage, so the plasmid should have the gene optimized for that. But wait, the question is about selecting the right plasmid from the options given. Each option has a DNA sequence, and I need to find out which one codes for the given amino acid sequence.

Wait, the given amino acid sequence starts with M, which is methionine, so the DNA sequence should start with ATG. Looking at the options, all start with ATG, so that's not helpful yet.

I think I should look for the presence of the correct start codon and the correct sequence of codons. Also, I should check for any stop codons in the middle because that would truncate the protein. But wait, the given options are DNA sequences, so I need to compare the DNA to the amino acid sequence.

The amino acid sequence is provided, so I can translate each plasmid's DNA into protein and see which matches. But that's a lot of work. Alternatively, maybe there are some key features I can look for.

Wait, the question is about choosing a plasmid that correctly encodes the Human P53 protein. The options might have slight differences, like maybe one has the correct reading frame and another doesn't.

Let me think about the structure of the DNA. The coding sequence should be in frame with the promoter and the ribosome binding site. BL21 strains are often used with plasmids that have an origin of replication compatible with E. coli, and the multiple cloning site (MCS) where the gene is inserted.

Looking at the options, each is a long DNA sequence. The plasmid likely contains the gene with the correct RBS, maybe
