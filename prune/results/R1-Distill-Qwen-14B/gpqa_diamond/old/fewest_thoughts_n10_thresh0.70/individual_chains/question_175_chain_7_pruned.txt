Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me think it through.

The question says we've got an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ. The maximum power is A. We're asked two things: what fraction of A is radiated at θ=30 degrees, and what the form of f is.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation, and the radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the source. Since this is spheroidal, it's probably an dipole or quadrupole type of radiator. Oh right, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is in the form of a doughnut or torus shape. The maximum radiation is perpendicular to the axis of oscillation, which here is the z-axis. So maximum power would be when θ is 90 degrees, but the question is about θ=30 degrees.

Hmm, but wait, the problem states that the maximum power is A. So the function f(θ) must be maximum at a certain θ. Let me think about how the radiation pattern looks for a dipole. The radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the formula for the power per unit solid angle, which I think is proportional to (sinθ)^2 or something like that. Wait, no, the dipole's radiation pattern is actually (sinθ)^2 in the far field, but wait, wait, no. Let me get this straight.

The power radiated by a dipole in the far field (which is the radiation zone) depends on the angle θ. The formula for the power per unit solid angle is proportional to (sinθ)^2 multiplied by some function of the frequency or wavelength. So the maximum occurs when sinθ is maximum, which is at θ=90 degrees. So at 90 degrees, sinθ is 1, which is the maximum. But in our case, the problem says the maximum power is A, so maybe that's the maximum over θ.

Wait, no, the question says the maximum is A. So the function f(θ) would have a maximum value of A. So, the question is, at θ=30
