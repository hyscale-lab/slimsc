Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a spin-half particle, which I remember is a particle with spin 1/2, like an electron. The state it's in is a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. Specifically, the state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. 

The question asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. I need to find this expectation value and pick the correct option from A to D.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation. For an operator O, it's ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. So I'll need to compute this for the given operator.

First, I should break down the operator into its components. The operator is 10σz plus 5σx. So, the expectation value will be the sum of the expectation values of each term.

Mathematically, that should be:
⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩

So I can compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately and then combine them.

Let me start with ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is a linear combination of σz eigenstates, this should be straightforward. The |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ states are eigenstates of σz with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. To find ⟨σz⟩, I can use the formula:
⟨σz⟩ = |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1)
where a is the coefficient of |↑⟩ and b is the coefficient of |↓⟩.

So, a is 0.5, so |a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. Similarly, b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 is (3/4) because (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. 

Wait, wait, 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3)/(4) = 0.75. So |a|^2 is 0.25 and |b|^2 is 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. This part is a bit trickier because σx is not diagonal in the σz basis. The eigenstates of σz are not the same as those of σx. So I think I have to compute this expectation value by expanding the states.

The Pauli X operator (σx) is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ for a state ψ is given by the inner product ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me represent the state ψ as a vector. Since |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], the state ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So, ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ψ† σx ψ. Let me compute that.

σx is:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

Multiplying σx with ψ gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so the dot product is:

(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5.

Each term is (sqrt(3))/4. So adding them gives (sqrt(3))/4 + (sqrt(3))/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660...

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.8660.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Oh, wait, wait: σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you multiply σx by ψ, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], you get [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then the inner product of ψ with this result is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = same as before, which is sqrt(3)/2. So that's correct.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.33.

Now, adding the two parts together: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = (-5) + 4.33 ≈ -0.67.

Wait, but wait, let me recalculate that. Because 10 times ⟨σz⟩ is
