Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. The question involves exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not entirely sure how that works, but maybe it's not super relevant here. The key part is that there are five planets in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

Wait, the question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I think that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, assuming it's a perfect black body. The formula I remember for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (L_star / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo) / ( (1 + e)^(1/2) ) ) * ( (a) / (a_earth) )^(-1/2) ), but since the albedo is the same for all planets, and since the problem states the orbits are circular (so e=0), that part simplifies. So the albedo is the same, so (1 - albedo) is a constant and cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. But since all the planets are around the same star, the L_star and other constants (like the star's temperature) are the same for all planets. So the only thing that changes is the distance 'a'—the semi-major axis. Since the orbits are circular, a is the same as the orbital radius.

Wait, but the orbital periods are given. How do I relate the orbital period to the semi-major axis? Oh, right, Kepler's third law. The law states that (P^2)/(a^3) is constant for a given star. So the ratio of the orbital periods squared is proportional to the ratio of the semi-major axes cubed.

So, for any two planets, (P2^2)/(P1^2) = (a2^3)/(a1^3). Which means (a2/a1)^3 = (P2/P1)^2. So a2/a1 = (P2/P1)^(2/3).

So the ratio of the distances between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3). Let me note down the orbital period ratios.

The periods are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for the five planets. So Planet_1 has P1=1, Planet_2 P2=2, Planet_3 P3=2.5, Planet_4 P4=3.5, and Planet_5 P5=5. So for Planet_2 and Planet_4, their periods are 2 and 3.5 respectively.

Wait, but the ratio of their periods is P4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75. So the ratio of their distances is (1.75)^(2/3). Let me compute that.

First, 1.75 is the same as 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). To compute this, I can take the cube root first and then square it.

Alternatively, I can compute the logarithm. Let me think numerically. 1.75^ (2/3) is the same as e^( (2/3) * ln(1.75) ). Let's calculate ln(1.75). 

I remember ln(1) is 0, ln(e)=1, e is about 2.718. 1.75 is less than e. So ln(1.75) is approximately 0.5596. Let me confirm: yes, because 1.75^1 ≈ 1.75, e^0.5596 ≈ 1.75. So 0.5596 times 2/3 is about 0.373. So e^0.373 is approximately 1.45, because e^0.35 is around 1.419, e^0.4 is about 1.4918. 0.373 is closer to 0.35 than to 0.4, so maybe around 1.44 or 1.45.

Wait, but maybe I can compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (7/4)^(2/3) as ( (7/4)^(1/3) )^2.

The cube of 1.913 is about 7, because 1.913^3 ≈ 7. So (7/4)^(1/3) is approximately 1.913/ (4^(1/3)). Wait, 4^(1/3) is about 1.5874. So 1.913 / 1.5874 ≈ 1.208.

Wait, no, that's not right because (a/b)^(1/3) = a^(1/3)/b^(1/3). So 7^(1/3) is about 1.913, and 4^(1/3) is about 1.5874. So 1.913 / 1.5874 ≈ 1.208. Then, squaring that gives approximately (1.208)^2 ≈ 1.459.

So the ratio a4/a2 is approximately 1.459. So Planet_4 is about 1.46 times farther from the star
