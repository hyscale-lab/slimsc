Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. So, the question is about an alien spaceship traveling at a very high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it will take for them to reach Earth from their own perspective. The options are A, B, C, D, with A saying they die before reaching, and others giving different years.

Wait, right, this is a special relativity problem. Because when you're moving at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation comes into play. So, from the astronaut's perspective, the time experienced (proper time) will be less than the time observed from Earth.

First, I think I need to find the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, do I know that? Oh, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years.

The speed of the spacecraft is 0.99999987c. Let me calculate the time it would take from Earth's frame of reference. Time is distance divided by speed. So that would be 163,000 ly / 0.99999987c. Since distance is in light-years and speed is a fraction of c, the time in Earth years would be roughly 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years. Wait, that's a lot.

But wait, the astronaut's own experienced time would be different because of time dilation. The proper time (tau) is given by the Earth time multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma's inverse. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is so close to c, gamma would be a large number.

Let me calculate gamma. v is 0.99999987c. So v² is approximately (1e6 * 0.99999987)^2, but wait, maybe it's easier to compute 1 - v²/c². v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2. Let's calculate that. 0.
