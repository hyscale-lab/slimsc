Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed, meaning it's not a pure state.

The given density matrix ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, let me parse that. So each term is a projector onto |0> and |1> respectively. So when I multiply by 1/2, it's like averaging those two projectors. I think this is a diagonal matrix because |0> and |1> are the basis states.

Let me write it out in matrix form. The |0> state is [1; 0], so |0><0| would be a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the top left and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in the bottom right. Adding them together gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal, so [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiply by 1/2: [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So ρ is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal.

Now I'm supposed to find its geometrical position in qubit space. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, the density matrix can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere representation. But wait, the Bloch sphere is for qubits, which are pure states. Density matrices are more general, so their representation is in a higher-dimensional space, maybe the 3D space of the Bloch vector.

Wait, the Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by r = [x, y, z], where x = Tr(ρ X), y=Tr(ρ Y), z=Tr(ρ Z), and X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices.

Let me recall the Pauli matrices:
X = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So to find x, y, z, I need to compute the trace of ρ
