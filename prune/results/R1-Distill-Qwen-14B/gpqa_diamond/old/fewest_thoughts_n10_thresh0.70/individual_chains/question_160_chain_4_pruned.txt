Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

Okay, the question says the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon with all apothems of length 'a'. A monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining on it along the z-axis. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. Oh, right, and for small angles, tanθ is approximately θ.

Wait, so when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon tends to a circle. So maybe the problem is about circular aperture diffraction, but with some twist because it's a polygon.

Wait, but wait, the polygon's apothem is given as 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. In a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is related to the radius (R) of the circumscribed circle. For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a = R * cos(π/N). So for a polygon with very large N, the apothem 'a' would approach R, because as N increases, cos(π/N) approaches 1. So in the limit as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius R = a. Because a = R * cos(π/N) ≈ R*(1 - (π^2)/(2N^2)) ... but for N very large, cos(π/N) ≈ 1. So R is approximately a.

So the problem reduces to a circular aperture with radius R = a. Now, when a plane wave hits a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern. The central spot is the brightest, and then there are rings of varying intensities.

Wait, but the question is about the minima. In single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at certain angles. But wait, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a series of rings, and the minima are the points where the intensity drops to zero between the rings. So the first minima after the central maximum are at a certain angle.

Wait, no—wait, actually, I'm getting a bit confused. For a single slit, the minima are given by a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer. But for a circular aperture, the situation is
