Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the problem says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I think I need to calculate the moles of each acid and base and see what's left after neutralization.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each component. Moles are calculated as Molarity (M) multiplied by Volume (L).

For CH3COOH:
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't completely dissociate, but I'll get back to that after considering the other components.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate. Its molarity is 0.2 M, volume 400 mL or 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will contribute 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit releases two OH- ions. Its molarity is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH-, so total OH- moles are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, I need to see if the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. The total H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. Oh wait, but the HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes all its H+ immediately. The acetic acid is weak, so it doesn't contribute as much H+ right away. Hmm, but maybe when mixing, the strong acid will completely donate H+ first, and then any excess OH- from the base will neutralize some of the acetic acid.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the neutralization between the acids and the base. Let me think. The total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. So when I mix them, they will react: H+ + OH- â†’ H2O. So the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. How much is left after that?

The H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The OH- is 0.18. So OH- is in excess. The excess OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. That means after neutralization, there's 0.10 moles of OH- remaining.

Wait, but what about the acetic acid? Because acetic acid is a weak acid, it will try to donate some H+ as well, but since we have excess OH- after neutralizing the HCl, that OH- will react with the acetic acid. So let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should consider all H+ sources. The HCl gives 0.08 moles H+. The acetic acid is 0.05 moles, but since it's a weak acid, it doesn't release all of that as H+; it
