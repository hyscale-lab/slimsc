Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle and Pauli statistics. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

Alright, the question says it's about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that formula. Let me think.

The initial state is 1S0, which in the term symbol notation is (2S+1)L J. So for 1S0, S is 0 because 2*0 +1 =1. L is S in this case, but wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. Oh wait, no, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So 1S0 implies S=0, L=0? Because the L is written in spectroscopic notation, which uses letters: S=0, P=1, D=2, etc. So 1S0 would be S=0, L=0, J=0.

Wait, no. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1) L J. So 1S0 means 2S+1=1 → S=0, L=S? No, wait, the L is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. So if it's S, that's L=0. So initial state is S=0, L=0, J=0.

So the initial state is spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, so total angular momentum J=0.

Now, the NN system emits a particle X, so the final state must consist of the NN in some state and the particle X.

The question says that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So the isospin T is 0.

Pauli statistics requirement: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is 0, so 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2. Which implies S + L +1 must be even. So S + L must be odd.

So for the NN state after emission, S
