Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But maybe that's not super important for this particular question. The focus is on their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and we need to find the ratio of their orbital periods, specifically Planet3's period compared to Planet1's.

The given ratios are the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So, T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. Wait, no, that's the ratio of Planet1's temperature to Planet2's, right? So T1 is 1.4 times T2. Or wait, actually, the way it's worded: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." So maybe it's T1/T2 = 1.4, meaning Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by that factor. Or maybe it's the other way around. I should be careful. Because if the ratio is 1.4, it's about which one is in the numerator.

Similarly, the mass ratios are given: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. So M1/M2 = 1.15 and M2/M3 = 1.35. So M1 is a bit more massive than M2, and M2 is more than M3.

The question is about the orbital periods. The albedo is the same for all three, 0.3, which is similar to Earth's. That probably affects the equilibrium temperature, which is given.

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature. It's T = [(L (1 - a)) / (16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the orbital distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since all planets have the same albedo, it'll cancel out in the ratios. So the temperature ratio squared would relate to the inverse of the square of the distance ratio, but wait, the temperature depends on the fourth root of the distance. Wait, the formula simplifies to T ∝ (L / D²)^(1/4). So T is proportional to (1/D²)^(1/4) = 1/D^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/√D.

Wait, alternative approach. The equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)} ) * (1 - a)^(1/4), where T_star is the star's effective temperature. But maybe I should think in terms of proportionality. So T is proportional to (1 / sqrt(D)), assuming the star's luminosity is
