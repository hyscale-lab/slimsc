Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments, and I'm a bit rusty on my epigenetics, but let's try to think it through. I'll start by breaking down the problem.

The question says that they did a ChIP-seq using an antibody against the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells. The sample was fixed with PFA (paraformaldehyde) alone. Then they aligned everything and called peaks. But when they used PFA plus DSG (which I think is dithiothreitol), the peaks disappeared. So the question is where these peaks are likely to be found.

Hmm, I remember that PFA is a crosslinker. It's commonly used in ChIP experiments to fix proteins to DNA so that during the sonication step, the DNA-protein complexes are sheared into small fragments. But wait, I've also heard that sometimes a second crosslinking agent is used, like DSG or formaldehyde. Oh wait, no, wait. PFA is typically used for crosslinking, but sometimes other agents are used as well, especially for certain types of proteins or in tricky situations.

I think DSG is a protein-protein crosslinker. So when you use PFA alone, you fix DNA-protein interactions. But with PFA plus DSG, you're also crosslinking proteins to proteins. So perhaps when you use DSG, it leads to more extensive crosslinking between proteins, which might affect the ChIP efficiency.

Wait, but how does this affect the ChIP peaks? Let me think about what the peaks represent. ChIP-seq peaks are regions of the genome where the transcription factor is bound. So if the peaks are disappearing when using DSG in addition to PFA, it suggests that the antibody isn't pulling down the DNA regions as effectively when more crosslinking is done.

Wait, but why would that be? I'm a bit confused. Let me think more about how crosslinking works. PFA is a fixative that crosslinks proteins to DNA, making them more resistant to washing away during the ChIP process. DSG, on the other hand, is a thiol-based crosslinker that crosslinks proteins to each other. So if you have a situation where the transcription factor is part of a larger complex, using DSG might stabilize those interactions more.

Wait, but wait. The problem is that the peaks disappear. So
