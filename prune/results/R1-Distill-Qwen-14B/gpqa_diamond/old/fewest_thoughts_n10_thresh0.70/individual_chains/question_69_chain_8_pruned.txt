Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime is important for figuring out how far they travel before decaying. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. 

Let me break down the problem. The decay is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are various lengths, so I think the answer has to do with the distance the particle travels before decaying, which is called the decay length.

Wait, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving at high speeds, we have to consider time dilation. The lifetime observed (t) would be longer than τ₀ by a factor of gamma (γ), which is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals the total energy divided by the rest mass energy, right? Because E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). But since we're working in units where c is considered to be 1 (like when using GeV and seconds), maybe I can ignore c for now.

So, E is 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41... Well, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 times 8 is 27.28. Oh, wait, 3.41 * 7.9 ≈ 27. So γ is approximately 7.9, maybe a bit higher. Let's calculate it more accurately. 27 / 3.41 = approximately 7.915? Let's say around 7.92.

So the lifetime t is γ * τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. So t ≈ 7.92 * 8e-16 = 6.336e-15 seconds.

But wait, the decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. So distance L = v * t. But I need to find v, the velocity. Alternatively, since we have gamma, maybe I can find beta (β = v/c) because beta is related to gamma through the equation γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²).

Wait, another approach: the velocity can be found using beta = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Because from gamma, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma squared). Let me calculate that.

Gamma is about 7.92, so gamma squared is about 62.7264. 1/gamma squared is about 0.01594. So 1 - 0.01594 is 0
