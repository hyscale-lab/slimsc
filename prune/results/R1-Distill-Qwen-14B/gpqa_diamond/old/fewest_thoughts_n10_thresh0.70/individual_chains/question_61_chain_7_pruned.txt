Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product. Let's take it step by step because I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene. Let me go through each step carefully.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1. Wait, HNO3 and H2SO4 as a mixture... Oh right, that's a nitrating mixture. Benzene undergoes nitration here. The nitration of benzene typically occurs at the meta position if there's a directing group, but wait, benzene itself is activated, so the nitration would add a nitro group. Benzene without any substituents would get the nitro group in the meta position, but wait, noâ€”actually, the first nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene, which is para to the nitro group when more substituents are added, but in this case, it's the first substitution, so it's just nitrobenzene. Wait, no, nitration of benzene would add a nitro group in a single position, but for benzene, the nitration produces a single product, nitrobenzene, which is a mono-substituted product. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, but wait, nitro group is a meta-directing group. So when benzene is nitrated, the nitro group is attached
