Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, let's see. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies. Oh right, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The formula I think is something like: Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies broken) - (sum of bond energies formed), but wait, no, wait. I think it's the other way around. Because when bonds are broken, you're putting energy in (endothermic), and when bonds form, you're releasing energy (exothermic). So maybe the formula is sum of bond energies of reactants minus sum of bond energies of products. Or maybe it's the opposite when considering formation.

Wait, the standard approach is to calculate the enthalpy change as the sum of the bond energies of the reactant bonds minus the sum of the bond energies of the product bonds. But wait, no, that's for reactions. For formation, maybe it's the sum of the elements' bond energies minus the molecule's bond energies. Because the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when elements combine to form the compound.

So for the compound, each atom comes from its standard state. For carbon, the standard state is
