Okay, so I have this physics problem about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with different multiples of E, where E is given as pi^2 hbar^2/(2mL^2).

Hmm, I remember that for a particle in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of each particle is E_n = (n²) * E, where E is the base energy unit as given. So each particle's energy depends on their quantum number n.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So, each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n and the spin.

Since the particles are fermions, each can't have the same n and spin. Wait, but for spin-1/2, each particle has two possible spin states: up and down. So, for each n, we can have two particles with different spins.

The system is four particles, so we need to fill the energy levels according to the Pauli exclusion principle.

Let me think about how the ground state would look. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration.

In a 1D box, the lowest energy is n=1. Since we have two spin states, we can have two particles in n=1. Then the next level, n=2, can also hold two particles. So, for four particles, the first two would be in n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two in n=2 (again, opposite spins). So for four particles, the energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, but each particle's energy is (n²)E. So each particle in n=1 contributes E, and each in n=2 contributes 4E.

So the total ground state energy is 2E (from two n=1) + 2*(4E) (from two n=2). Wait, no, wait a minute. No, each particle is in a state, so the total energy is the sum of each individual's energy.

Wait, but for four particles, in the ground state, the first two fill n
