Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But wait, this isn't a standard case because there are three solutions involved.

The problem gives me the volumes and concentrations of HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let me jot down the data:

- HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M
- H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? And HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids. So when they react, they should completely dissociate. 

I think the first thing I need to do is figure out the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, see which one is in excess because the neutralization will depend on that.

Let me calculate the moles for each:

For HCl: HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+. Volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

For H2SO4: Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, but since it's diprotic, each mole gives two H+ ions. So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+, so total H+ is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base Ba(OH)2: It's a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, comparing H+ and OH-:

H+ total is 0.28 moles.

OH- is 0.2 moles.

So OH- is the limiting reactant. That means all the OH- will react, and there will be some excess H+ left.

The neutralization reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O, right? And the enthalpy change for this is the heat released, which I think is based on the amount of H+ and OH- that react.

Wait, but in the case where there's excess H+, because H+ is in excess, the total reaction will consume all the OH-, and the leftover H+ won't contribute to the neutralization. 

So the amount of
