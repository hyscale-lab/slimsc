Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Okay, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, okay, so first, I should probably break down the given information. So, initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. That's a huge amount, but it's given as rest-mass energy, so E=mc².

When the nucleus splits, it forms two fragments. Let me denote the rest masses as m1 and m2. The problem says one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say m1 = 2 * m2. Or wait, wait, more precisely, one is twice the other. So, maybe m1 is the more massive one, so m1 = 2 m2.

But wait, the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Since m1 = 2 m2, substituting that in: 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99/3) M ≈ 0.33 M. So m1 would be about 0.66 M.

Wait, but the initial rest mass was M, and after fission, the sum is 0.99 M. That suggests that some mass is converted into kinetic energy, which is the case in fission as per Einstein's equation. So the mass defect would be M - 0.99 M = 0.01 M. That 0.01 M would be converted into kinetic energy and any binding energy, but in this case, the problem is only considering the two fragments, so perhaps the kinetic energy comes from that mass defect.

But wait, when the nucleus is at rest, the total momentum should be conserved. Since it's initially at rest, the total momentum of the two fragments

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I remember that when a heavy nucleus undergoes fission, it splits into two smaller nuclei, and energy is released. But wait, the question is about the difference between the correct kinetic energy (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. Interesting.

Let me read the problem again. The initial nucleus has a rest mass M, rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. It splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. So if the other is mass m, the first is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh, right, because in fission, the total mass usually decreases because energy is released, but here the sum is 99% of M, so the rest mass after is less than before. So the initial rest mass is M, and the combined rest mass is 0.99 M.

Wait, but the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. Then, the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 0.99 M c². Let me calculate that: 0.99 * 300 GeV is 297 GeV. So the rest mass after is 297 GeV, and the initial was 300 GeV. So the mass difference is 3 GeV, which probably gets converted into kinetic energy and other forms like binding energy, but the problem is about kinetic energies.

The fragments are two: let's say mass 2m and m. So 2m + m = 3m = 0.99 M. So 3m = 0.99 M => m = 0.33 M. So the two masses are 0.66 M and 0.33 M. But wait, the problem says in terms of rest-masses, so their rest masses are 2m_rest and m_rest, right?

Wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so when it splits, the two fragments will move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after must be zero. So the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for the two fragments. Since
