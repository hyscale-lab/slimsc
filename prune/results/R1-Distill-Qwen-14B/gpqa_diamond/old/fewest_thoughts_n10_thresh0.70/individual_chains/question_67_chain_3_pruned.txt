Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about two electrons in p orbitals. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. So each has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1, since p orbitals have l=1. But wait, the state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit off because for two particles, the maximum possible total angular momentum l is l1 + l2, which would be 1+1=2. So l=2 here, that makes sense.

The quantum numbers are |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So l1 is 1, l2 is 1, total l is 2, and m is -1.

They ask about the joint probability of measuring L1z and L2z both as -ħ. Okay, so each Lz is measured for the two electrons, and we want the probability that each gives -ħ.

Wait, orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are l, and the z-component is m. For a single p orbital, each electron has Lz = mħ, right? Because m can be -l, ..., +l. So for l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So, for each electron, Lz eigenvalues are -ħ, 0, +ħ.

So when they're in a coupled state, the total m would be the sum of each m_i. But wait, in this coupled state, the m is -1. So m_1 + m_2 = -1.

But we're being asked about the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1. Because L1z eigenvalue is -ħ, which would imply m1 is -1. Similarly for m2.

Wait, m1 + m2 = -1 in the given state. So if m1 is -1, then m2 has to be 0. Or if m1 is 0, m2=-1, etc. But what about both being -1? That would sum to -2, which is not equal to the total m of -1. So that's impossible.

Therefore, the state |1,1,2,-1> cannot have both m1 and
