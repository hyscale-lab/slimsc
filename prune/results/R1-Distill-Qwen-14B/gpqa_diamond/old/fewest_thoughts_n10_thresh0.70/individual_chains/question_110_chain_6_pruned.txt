Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let's see. The key here is to determine the apparent V magnitude of each star because both spectrographs have different brightness limits.

First, I need to remember the brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the question says ESPRESSO observes stars with V magnitude brighter than 17. So that means any star with V mag less than or equal to 17 is observable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, stars must have V mag ≤16.

So each star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and ≤16 (so HIRES can see it). Wait, no, wait. No, wait. The problem says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, V ≤17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So V ≤16. So for both, the star must be ≤16 mag. Because if a star is 17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES cannot. So for both, the star needs to be ≤16 mag.

Wait, let me clarify that. The question is which stars can be detected by both. So a star can be seen by both only if it's within both brightness limits. So the brightness limit is the 'brighter than' a certain magnitude. So for ESPRESSO, anything with V mag <17 can be observed. But wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a magnitude of 16 is brighter than 17. So for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag ≤17 can be observed. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V mag ≤16.

So a star visible to both must have V mag ≤16. Because if it's 17, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't (
