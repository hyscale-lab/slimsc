Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a mass attached to a spring, and it oscillates with a certain frequency. But this is relativistic, so I guess I need to consider how relativity affects the motion.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass. The options involve equations with c, the speed of light, so I know that relativistic effects are significant here. Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the maximum velocity occurs when all the energy is converted from potential to kinetic. But in relativity, energy isn't just the classical (1/2)mv², right?

Let me think. In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't the same as in classical mechanics. The total energy of a particle is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². So maybe the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, but relativistically, how does that work?

Wait, the problem says it's a 1D oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential is (1/2)kA², since at maximum amplitude x=A, the potential is maximum. At that point, the kinetic energy should be zero, right? But when the mass passes through the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed can be found using energy conservation: (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA² => v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait the options here have the relativistic versions.

So this is a relativistic oscillator, so energy can't be treated the same way. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, no, the total energy in relativity is gamma mc², which includes the rest mass. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all its energy is potential, and when it's at the equilibrium, all is kinetic.

Wait, in the potential, the potential energy is (1/2)k x
