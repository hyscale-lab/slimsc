Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in various organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical activity arises from the presence of chiral centers, which are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So each compound listed here, I'll need to check if it has any chiral centers and whether it's actually chiral because sometimes compounds can have multiple stereocenters but be meso compounds, which are achiral.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, this is an alkene. The structure is Cl attached to carbon 1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl and another substituent. But wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl, two Hs, and the double bond. On C2, it's CH2CH2? Wait, but for a double bond, the geometry (Z or E) affects the arrangement but not the presence of chiral centers. So I don't think any chiral centers here. Because for a carbon to be chiral, it needs four different groups. Let's see: C1 has Cl, two Hs (since it's but-1-ene), and the double bond (to C2). But wait, the double bond is to a CH(CH3) or something else? Wait, structure: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(R)=CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait.
