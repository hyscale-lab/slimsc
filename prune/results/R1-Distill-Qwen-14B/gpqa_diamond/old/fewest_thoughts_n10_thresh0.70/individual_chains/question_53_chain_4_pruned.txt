Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester group peaks, so that's a hint about the functional groups present. Then, the 1H NMR has six signals: two aromatic H's, two vinyl H's (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two CH3 groups. No CH2 signals. The options are four different formulas.

Hmm, let's break this down. The compound is an aromatic ring with two substituents. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents could be in positions like para, ortho, or meta. But I think the NMR will help determine that.

The FTIR indicates an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl (C=O) and an O-C-O bridge. So the structure likely includes an ester functional group attached to the aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR:

1. Aromatic H's: two signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the possible splitting could be if the substituents are para or ortho. But wait, if it's para, the aromatic protons would be two sets (each pair equivalent), but if ortho, maybe more signals. Wait, noâ€”if substituents are para, the ring is symmetric, so each H pair is equivalent, giving two signals for each pair. Wait, a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions would have two sets of equivalent H's. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: if the substituents are in the para positions, then the ring is symmetric. So each substituent is opposite the other. The aromatic Hs would be in two equivalent sets. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the Hs adjacent to each substituent are equivalent, leading to two sets of aromatic protons. So the 1H NMR showing two aromatic signals suggests that the substituents are para to each other, each with two Hs. Wait, but if the substituents are para, each substituent is on opposite carbons. Let me visualize: substituent A and substituent B are opposite each other. The ring's Hs would be in two sets of two each. So each set would be a doublet or something else, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic Hs. That makes sense for para substitution.

2. Vinyl Hs: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are usually from double bonds, like in an ester group. Wait, ester groups typically have carbonyls and an ether linkage. Oh, wait, maybe the substituent is an ester group attached to the benzene. For example, something like an aryl ester. Alternatively, maybe it's an acyl group attached via an oxygen, like an aryl acetate or similar.

Wait, the vinyl Hs are probably from a double bond adjacent to the ester group. So perhaps the substituent is an ester group attached to the benzene ring, and the ester has a double bond. Alternatively
