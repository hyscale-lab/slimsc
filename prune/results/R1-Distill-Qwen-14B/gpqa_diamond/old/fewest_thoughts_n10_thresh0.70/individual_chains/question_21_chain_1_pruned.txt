Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It's asking about two parts: A and B.

Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is about which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

Hmm. I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a shift of electrons, leading to different structures. For example, in carbonyl compounds, tautomerism typically involves the movement of a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon. So, if a compound can't undergo such a shift, it won't show tautomerism.

First, looking at benzoquinone. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups, right? Wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a cyclic di-ketone. So, it's O=C6H4=C=O. I think benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism, but wait, maybe not. Because for tautomerism, you need adjacent alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. So, each ketone is on a carbon that's adjacent to another ring carbon. Wait, but do those carbons have hydrogens?

Wait, benzene rings are all spÂ² hybridized. So in benzoquinone, each ketone is on a carbon that's connected to two other ring carbons. So, each ketone is on a carbon that's attached to two other carbons in the ring. So, those carbons (the ketone carbons) are each attached to two other carbons and an oxygen. So the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. Wait, no, that's not right. Benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone, so the two ketone groups are at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring.

Each of those ketone carbons is attached to two ring carbons and an oxygen. So, the carbonyl groups are on carbons that are connected to two other ring carbons. So,
