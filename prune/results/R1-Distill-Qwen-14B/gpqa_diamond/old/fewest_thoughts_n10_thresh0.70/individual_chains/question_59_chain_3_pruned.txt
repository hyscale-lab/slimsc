Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on buffer solutions and neutralization reactions, but I'll try to work it out.

The problem says we're mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Oh wait, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But in this case, there are more than just two solutions; three. So I need to figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions, and see if there's any excess after neutralization.

First, let me calculate the moles for each component. Moles are calculated as concentration (M) multiplied by volume (in liters).

Starting with CH3COOH. It's a weak acid, so it will donate H+ ions, but maybe not completely. But wait, when mixed with a base, the acid will react with the OH- from the base. So the first step is to find out how much H+ comes from each acid and how much OH- comes from the base.

So for each solution:

1. CH3COOH:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Concentration is 0.1 M. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

2. HCl:
400 mL is 0.4 L. 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, providing 0.08 moles of H+.

3. Ba(OH)2:
300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; each formula unit releases two OH- ions. So moles of OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when mixing,
