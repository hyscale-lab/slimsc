Okay, so I have this physics question about Maxwell's equations and how they change in a universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole. Hmm, that's interesting because in our universe, magnets can't have isolated poles—they always come in pairs. I remember that's called the law of magnetic poles or something like that.

Wait, Maxwell's equations have four parts, right? Let me think. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère-Maxwell Law: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

So, in our universe, the second equation says that the divergence of B is zero. That's because there are no isolated magnetic charges—so the magnetic field lines form closed loops, no start or end. But in this alternate universe, magnets can have isolated poles. So, does that mean the magnetic field can start and end at these poles?

Oh right! If a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Wait, in our case, the divergence of B is zero because the "magnetic charge" density is zero. But if isolated poles exist, then there would be a magnetic charge density. So the equation would change.

So in that universe, Gauss's Law for magnetism would be ∇·B = ρ_m / something, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So that equation definitely changes.

But what about the other equations? Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law. Let me think. Faraday's Law relates the curl of E to the time derivative of B. If B's divergence is non-zero, does that affect Faraday's Law? I don't think so. Faraday's Law is about the curl, not the divergence. So Faraday's equation probably remains the same.

Then, Ampère's Law: it's about the curl of B. It's related to the current density and the time derivative of E. Since Ampère's equation involves the curl of B, and in our universe that curl is related to the current plus displacement current. If the divergence of B changes, does that affect the curl? Hmm. Wait, the divergence and curl are separate operations. So, the equation that Ampère-Maxwell Law describes might not change. Or wait, maybe another equation would change.

Wait, wait, the other options presented in the question. Let's look at the options again.

Option D says: The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. Wait, the curl of B is Ampère's law. So in our case, Ampère's law is about the curl. So if the divergence of B changes, but what about the curl?

Wait, in our universe, if the divergence is zero, that's one equation. The curl of B is the Ampère-Maxwell law. If the universe allows for magnetic monopoles, then the divergence of B would not be zero, but the curl of B would still be something else.

Wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the Maxwell equations are modified. Let me recall:

In the presence of magnetic monopoles, two of the Maxwell equations change. The original equations are:

∇·B = 0 → becomes ∇·B = μ_m ρ_m (where μ_m is some magnetic permeability term for monopoles)
∇×E = 0 → becomes ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - something?

Wait, no. Wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the modified Maxwell equations are:

∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)
∇·B = ρ_m / ε₀ (or similar)
∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m (something like that)
∇×B = μ₀ (J_e + ε₀ ∂E/∂t) + something?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think. In the standard equations, Faraday's Law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic currents, then maybe Faraday's Law would have an additional term.

Alternatively, I remember that when magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations get modified. One is the divergence of B becomes proportional to the magnetic charge density. The other is the curl of E becomes proportional to the magnetic current density plus the time derivative of B.

Wait, so in our universe, the curl of E is just -∂B/∂t. But if there's a magnetic current (like current flowing in a magnetic circuit), then Faraday's Law would include a term for that. So the equation for Faraday's Law would change.

So, the two equations that change would be:

1. Gauss's Law for magnetism: ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (or something)
2. Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m (maybe)

Wait, but Ampère's Law (curl B) would also change? Or maybe not. Let me think. Ampère's Law in our universe relates the curl of B to the current plus displacement current. If magnetic monopoles exist, perhaps the curl of B would involve the magnetic current, or maybe another term.

Alternatively, perhaps both Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law are modified.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again about the Maxwell equations when magnetic monopoles exist.

In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀ → same as before.

2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m → so the divergence of B is not zero anymore.

3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m → so Faraday's Law now includes a term for the magnetic current.

4. ∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e → wait, no. Wait, Ampère's Law in the presence of magnetic monopoles would have a term for the magnetic current. Or is it that Ampère's Law remains the same, and another equation changes?

Wait, perhaps the correct modified equations are:

∇·B = ρ_m (where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density)
∇×E = - (∂B/∂t) - J_m (if J_m is the magnetic current density)

And Ampère's Law might become:

∇×B = μ₀ (J_e + ε₀ ∂E/∂t) + something else?

Wait, I'm not getting the exact form right. Let's think about it more carefully.

In our universe, the equations are:

∇·E = ρ/ε₀

∇·B = 0

∇×E = -∂B/∂t

∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

If we have magnetic monopoles, two of these equations change. The second equation becomes ∇·B = ρ_m (like Gauss's Law for B). The third equation, which is Faraday's Law, would change because if B has sources, then the induced E fields would be different. So, Faraday's Law would now include a term for the magnetic current. So, that equation changes.

Wait, so in that case, the equations that change are Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law. So in the options, which ones are these?

Looking at the options:

Option C: The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field.

Wait, the 'circulation of the magnetic field' is the curl of B, which is Ampère's Law. 'Flux of the electric field'—I'm not sure what that refers to. Gauss's Law for E is the flux of E, which is about divergence.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me list each equation and see which change.

In the problem statement, the question is which Maxwell's equations are different in a universe with isolated magnetic poles.

The original Maxwell equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ → same.
2. ∇·B = 0 → changes to ∇·B = something else (like ρ_m)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t → may change, depending on if magnetic current exists.
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t → does this change?

Wait, I think if magnetic monopoles exist, Faraday's Law (∇×E) and Ampère's Law (∇×B) would both change. Because:

- Faraday's Law would have a term for the magnetic current, which is a source for E.
- Ampère's Law would have a term for the electric current and maybe another term for the magnetic flux?

Wait, actually, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations become symmetric. So, the equations for E and B become more similar. So, Faraday's Law would have a term for the time derivative of B and also for the magnetic current. Ampère's Law would have a term for the time derivative of E and the electric current. Or perhaps, Ampère's Law remains the same, but another equation changes.

Wait, perhaps the correct modified equations are:

∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m

∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m

So, that's two equations that change. So, which options are these?

The options are about which of Maxwell's equations are different. Let's look:

Option A: Only the divergence of B → that's one equation.

But in reality, two equations change.

Option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So that's Faraday's Law and Gauss's Law for B. So that would be two equations changing. So that's option B.

Option C: Circulation of B and flux of E? I'm not sure. Circulation of B is Ampère's Law. Flux of E is Gauss's Law for E, which remains the same.

Option D: Divergence and curl of B. Wait, the curl of B is Ampère's Law, which in our universe is ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. If magnetic monopoles exist, Ampère's Law would have an additional term, perhaps. Or maybe not. Wait, does Ampère's Law change when you have magnetic monopoles?

Wait, no. Ampère's Law in standard form is about how the curl of B relates to the current and displacement. If you have magnetic currents, perhaps Ampère's Law would involve the magnetic current as well. So, Ampère's Law would change as well.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. In our universe, without magnetic monopoles, two Maxwell equations have zero divergence or curl. If magnetic monopoles exist, the two equations that change are Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law. So which two?

Wait, Gauss's Law for B (equation 2) and Faraday's Law (equation 3) would change, making option B correct.

But wait, another thought: in the presence of magnetic monopoles, both the divergence of B and the curl of E change. So which option corresponds to that?

Looking at the options:

Option B says the ones related to the circulation of the electric field (which is Faraday's Law, ∇×E) and the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B). So yes, option B would be the correct one, as both of these equations change.

Wait, but some sources say that when magnetic monopoles are present, both the divergence of B and the curl of E change. So the two equations that change are the second and the third. So the options that include both would be option B.

So the correct answer would be option B: the ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.


In a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles, the laws of magnetism would differ from our current understanding. Maxwell's equations describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, and their modification in such a universe can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇·B = 0), reflecting the absence of isolated magnetic charges. However, in a universe with isolated magnetic poles, magnetic charge density (ρₘ) would exist, and this equation would change to ∇·B = μ₀ρₘ, where μ₀ is a constant.

2. **Faraday's Law**: In our universe, Faraday's Law states that the curl of the electric field is equal to the negative time derivative of the magnetic field (∇×E = -∂B/∂t). In a universe with magnetic monopoles, an additional term would appear in this equation to account for magnetic current density (Jₘ), making it ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jₘ.

3. **Ampère's Law**: This law relates the curl of the magnetic field to the electric current density and the time derivative of the electric field (∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t). While magnetic monopoles would not directly modify this equation, the symmetry introduced by magnetic charges could indirectly affect it. However, the primary changes occur in the divergence of the magnetic field and Faraday's Law.

4. **Gauss's Law for Electricity**: This law (∇·E = ρ/ε₀) remains unchanged, as it pertains to electric charge density and is not directly affected by the presence of magnetic monopoles.

From this analysis, the two Maxwell equations that are modified in a universe with isolated magnetic poles are:

- The divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B), which changes due to the existence of magnetic charge density.
- The circulation of the electric field (∇×E), which gains an additional term for magnetic current density.

Thus, the correct answer is the option that includes both these modifications.

**Answer: B**
