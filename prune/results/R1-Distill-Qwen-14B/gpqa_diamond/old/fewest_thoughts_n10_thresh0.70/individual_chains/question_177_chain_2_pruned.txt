Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same goes for their masses; Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. The question mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law says that the wavelength where the emission is maximum is inversely proportional to the temperature. So λ_max * T = constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is the same, then T must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So they have the same temperature. Because Wien's law says λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if λ is same, T is same. So T1 = T2.

Now, the problem is about their luminosities. I remember the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to its radius squared times its temperature to the fourth power: L = 4πR²σT⁴. But since they're black bodies, that formula should apply.

So since R1 = 1.5 R2 and T1 = T2, let's plug that into the luminosity equation.

L1 = 4π*(1.5 R2)² * σ * T²⁴
L2 = 4π*R2² * σ * T²⁴

So the ratio L1/L2 would be ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / ( R2^2 ) = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2.

Wait but wait, what about the velocities given? The radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, I thought the velocities might affect something like Doppler shift or maybe the observed temperature? Because velocity could cause a redshift or blueshift. Oh wait, because if a star is moving towards us, it's blueshifted, moving away is redshifted.

Wait, the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the velocities affect the observed temperature? Because if a star is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted, making it appear hotter. Or if moving away, redshifted, appearing cooler. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which they're brightest are the same. So does that imply that their observed temperatures are the same?

So let's think about it. The emitted wavelengths are determined by their rest temperature, but if they're moving, their observed wavelengths would shift. The problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same, which
