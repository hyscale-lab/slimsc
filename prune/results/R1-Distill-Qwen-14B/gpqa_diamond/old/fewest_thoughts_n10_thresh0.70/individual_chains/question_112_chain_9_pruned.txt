Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, first, I need to normalize this state because quantum states must have a norm of 1. The next part is about calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. So, that's a 2x2 matrix because the state is in a two-dimensional space (spin-1/2 system, I suppose).

Wait, wait. Let me get the matrix right. For a 2x2 matrix, A would have zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. Because A_ij is ħ/2 when i != j. So, the matrix looks like:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Hmm, I think that's right. Oh wait, is it? Because for a spin-1/2 system, the Pauli matrices are 2x2, but this operator A doesn't look like a Pauli matrix. Let me think: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if I multiply that by ħ/2, it becomes [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], which is exactly what A is. So yes, operator A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix.

But wait, the eigenstates of Pauli X are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates for the spin in the x-direction. So the operator A must have eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, since A is a multiple of the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but here A_ij is ħ/2 times that. Let me calculate the eigenvalues
