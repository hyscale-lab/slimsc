Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

Alright, the problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So, each charge is twice the elementary charge, which is 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.204 x 10^-19 C. 

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, so I need to compute this.

Hmm, okay. So, the system consists of 13 charges. One is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Since the charges are identical, all 12 are the same. Wait, but wait: are the 12 charges all at 2 meters from P, or are they at 2 meters apart from each other? Wait, the problem says each of the 12 is constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So each is 2 meters away from P, but their positions relative to each other could vary. But maybe in this case, since we're looking for the minimum energy, the configuration that gives the minimum potential energy is when all the 12 are arranged symmetrically around P, like on a sphere. Because arranging them in a symmetric way would minimize the potential energy between them. But wait, the problem is about the potential energy of the whole system, including interactions between all charges.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. So I need to compute the potential energy of each of the 12 charges due to all the other charges, including the 13th.

Wait, but the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. Oh wait, no, because each pair contributes to the potential energy. But since potential energy is a scalar quantity, we need to sum all the pairwise interactions.

But wait, for a system of multiple charges, the total electrostatic potential energy is the sum of the potential
