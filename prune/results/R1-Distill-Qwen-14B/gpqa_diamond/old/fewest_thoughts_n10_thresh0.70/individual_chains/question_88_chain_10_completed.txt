Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some immune response process. Let's try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: They're tagging inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and giving them to mice orally. Through in vivo imaging, they see some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Then they isolate the fluorescent Peyer patches and look at the variable heavy chain gene, which shows high variability. The question is asking which process is happening.

Hmm, I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're specialized for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen. So when something is given orally, like these GFP-tagged proteins, the immune system there would probably process them.

The GFP is on the inner capsid proteins. Rotavirus is a virus that infects the small intestine. The capsid proteins are the outer shell, right? So the inner capsid would be the proteins that make up the core, maybe the VP6 protein? But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

When these tagged proteins are delivered via oral gavage, the stomach acid would break down some of them. So some GFP fluorescence is destroyed, but others make it through the mucus to reach Peyer patches. Peyer patches are where immune cells, like antigen-presenting cells, capture the antigens. Then, the antigens are processed and presented to T and B cells.

They isolated the proliferating cell population from the Peyer patches. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene shows high variability. Variable regions in antibodies are where diversity comes from, right? So high variability suggests that the cells are undergoing some process that diversifies their receptors.

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Wait, what do these processes do?

VDJ recombination is during the early stages of B cell development, where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to create the variable region of the B cell receptor. This happens in the bone marrow and generates the initial diversity.

Somatic hypermutation occurs during the immune response, especially in the germinal centers. It introduces point mutations in the variable regions, leading to affinity maturation of antibodies.

Class switching recombination changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), which involves recombination at the heavy chain locus, but doesn't change the variable region itself.

So the question is about high variability in the variable heavy chain sequences. If they're looking at variable regions, then VDJ would have already set that up during B cell development. But if they're seeing high variability in a population after an immune response, perhaps this is happening during the response itself.

Wait, but when a B cell is activated, it can undergo somatic hypermutation in the germinal centers. This process happens after the initial VDJ recombination. So when the B cells are proliferating, they're undergoing this hypermutation, leading to more diverse antibodies.

In this case, the Peyer patches would contain these activated B cells. The high variability in the variable heavy chain sequences suggests that the cells have undergone some process that increases diversity beyond what VDJ provides. So that's likely somatic hypermutation.

Alternatively, VDJ recombination is a one-time event when the B cell is developing. If they're seeing high variability in an immune response scenario, it's more about the ongoing process during the responseâ€”so A) somatic hypermutation.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins reach the Peyer patches, where they are processed by the immune system. The Peyer patches are isolated, and the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cell population are sequenced, showing high variability. This suggests a process that diversifies the variable regions of antibodies.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs during the immune response, particularly in germinal centers, where point mutations are introduced into the variable regions of antibodies, leading to increased diversity and affinity maturation. The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain sequences aligns with this process.
  
- **B) Complement activation**: This is a part of the innate immune response that targets pathogens for destruction but does not involve diversification of antibody variable regions. It is not relevant here.

- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the antibody. It does not explain the observed variability in the variable heavy chain sequences.

- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are combined to form the variable region. However, this process occurs before the immune response and is unlikely to explain the observed variability in the Peyer patches after antigen exposure.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain sequences is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response in germinal centers. This process diversifies the antibody repertoire and is consistent with the experimental observations.

Answer: A
