Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about epoxidation and what happens when you run the products on HPLC. Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used for epoxidizing alkenes. 

So the problem says there are two reactions. Reaction 1 starts with (E)-oct-4-ene. Reaction 2 starts with (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Both go to 100% completion.

Wait, what happens in each reaction? Epoxidation adds an epoxide group across the double bond. But wait, the reaction conditions after mCPBA are aqueous acid. Oh right, acid work-up. So that might lead to the opening of the epoxide.

Epoxide opening under acidic conditions typically proceeds via a protonation, leading to ring opening. The mechanism is that the acid protonates the less substituted oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then a carbocation forms, and the nucleophile (water, possibly) attacks.

But wait, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene will influence the structure of the epoxide and then the product after acid.

Let me think about each reaction separately.

First, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. The structure is CH2CH2 on either end, but wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Carbon chain is eight carbons. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5.

Wait, the structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait. No, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write it out properly.

Oct-4-ene is: CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. No, wait, wait, no, wait. No, that's not right. Each carbon in the chain. Carbon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't sound right. Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The exact structure might not matter as much as the stereochemistry and the result after epoxidation and acid.

When (E)-oct-4-ene
