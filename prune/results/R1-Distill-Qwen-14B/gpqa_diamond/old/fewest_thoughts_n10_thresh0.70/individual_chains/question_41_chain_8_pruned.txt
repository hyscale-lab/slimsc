Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer. And the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light is propagating through it. Since the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is also moving in that same direction, I need to calculate how fast the light is moving relative to the lab.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed in vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But here, the medium is moving. So I need to consider how the motion of the medium affects the observed speed of light.

In special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The velocity addition formula comes into play. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach here because light's speed
