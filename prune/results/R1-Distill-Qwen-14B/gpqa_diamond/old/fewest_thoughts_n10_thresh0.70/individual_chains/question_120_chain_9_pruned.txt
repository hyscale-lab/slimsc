Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I'm supposed to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with a different power of 1/plx.

Wait, what do I know about parallax? Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So the parallax is inversely proportional to the distance. A larger parallax means the star is closer.

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means their spatial density is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume of space is the same everywhere. Let me imagine a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr. The volume of this shell would be 4πd² dr. Since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume, so N = n * 4πd² dr, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I need to express this in terms of plx instead of distance. Since plx = 1/d, that means d = 1/plx. Let me see, so dr is the change in distance, but how does that relate to a change in plx?

Let me think about differentials. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, which implies that dr (change in distance) is the derivative of d with respect to plx. So dr = (d/d plx) (1/plx) d plx. Taking derivative: d/d plx (1/plx) is -1/(plx²). So, dr = (-1/plx²) d plx. The negative sign indicates direction, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, I can ignore the sign. So, dr ≈ (1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. The number of stars per unit parallax interval (
