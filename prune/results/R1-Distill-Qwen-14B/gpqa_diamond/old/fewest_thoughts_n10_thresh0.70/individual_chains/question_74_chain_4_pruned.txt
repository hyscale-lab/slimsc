Okay, so I'm trying to solve this decay probability problem. Hmm, let's think. The question is about radioactive decay, right? So I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law. Oh wait, but this question is about the probability of decay over a certain time.

Wait, the problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that the atom decays in the first 100 minutes after it's created. Now, we have 50 minutes passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. They're asking what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So that's from 50 to 200 minutes total, right?

Wait, no. Wait, no. The initial time is when they start monitoring. So the total time they're considering is 100 minutes for the 32% probability. Now, 50 minutes have passed since they started, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the remaining time they're asking is the next 150 minutes. So that's 50 + 150 = 200 minutes total from when it was created. But wait, the initial 100 minutes are the time frame for the 32% decay probability.

Wait, maybe I should model this with the decay equation. The decay probability, or the cumulative decay probability, is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time.

So, the given information is that P(100) =
