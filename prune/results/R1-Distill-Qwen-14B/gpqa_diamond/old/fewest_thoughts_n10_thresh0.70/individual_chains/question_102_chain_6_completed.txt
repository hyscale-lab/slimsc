Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why there's no green signal in the confocal microscope after crossing the mice. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, from the question, I know that a bicistronic lox-Cre vector was used. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one construct. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the ligand and receptor are both being expressed from the same vector.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, possibly for strong expression. The receptor has an IRES element upstream. IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry sites, which can drive the translation of the downstream gene without the need for a second promoter. So, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. The vector is bicistronic, so it must be designed to allow both the ligand and the receptor to be expressed. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP. Oh, but wait: the ligand is at 5', so it's first, then the receptor is after. So the vector probably has the ligand gene, then a stop cassette with loxP, then the IRES, then the receptor, and another stop cassette after the receptor.

Wait, the question says: between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP is a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So the vector is set up so that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing expression of the downstream genes.

Wait, but wait, I'm not so sure. LoxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase, which causes the excision of the DNA between them. So, the loxP-stop-loxP cassette is in front of mCherry. So the ligand is followed by this stop cassette, meaning that without Cre, the ligand's expression is blocked. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a lox2272-based stop cassette, which Cre can't act on unless it has the right lox sites.

Wait, but lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site. Cre can only act when it has two lox sites (either both loxP, or one loxP and one lox2272, but I'm not sure about the compatibility). I think that Cre can recognize loxP and lox2272 as different sites but may have some specificity.

But the vector is designed with the ligand and mCherry in the first part, after which is a stop cassette with loxP sites. Then comes the IRES, then the receptor, and then a stop cassette with lox2272 sites. So, without Cre, the ligand is expressed because the promoter is on, but the stop cassette would prevent mCherry from being expressed? Or wait, maybe the mCherry is part of the same ORF as the ligand, so when the ligand is translated, mCherry is part of that same protein. No, that doesn't make sense because the description says the ligand is fused to mCherry, so perhaps it's a fusion protein. But the stop cassette would prevent anything after that from being expressed unless Cre is there to excise the stop.

Wait, perhaps the vector is set up so that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing expression of both ligand (with mCherry) and receptor (with eGFP). So, in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent eGFP and mCherry from being expressed. Or maybe not, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. Then, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop in a loxP cassette. So, without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry (which is downstream of the ligand) isn't. Because the stop cassette would prevent it. Similarly, the receptor is after the IRES. The IRES allows for the translation of the next ORF, but the receptor is followed by a stop cassette with lox2272. So, without Cre, the receptor would be expressed, but the eGFP would not be.

Wait, no. The vector is bicistronic. So, I think the first gene is ligand fused to mCherry, and the second is receptor fused to eGFP. But the stops are between them. So, the CBA promoter drives the ligand, then after that is a stop cassette (loxP) followed by mCherry. Hmm, no, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop cassette, preventing its expression. Then the IRES would drive the receptor, and after that another stop cassette. Wait, I'm getting confused about the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is that the ligand is under CBA, and its ORF ends, then a stop with loxP sites. Then, the IRES element starts the receptor ORF, followed by a stop with lox2272 sites and then eGFP.

So, for the ligand to be expressed, the stop cassette must be removed. Cre would excise the loxP sites, allowing the ligand to be expressed. Similarly, for the receptor to be expressed, the lox2272 sites would need to be excised, but that would require a different Cre variant, perhaps, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, the vector is using lox-Cre. So, in the presence of Cre, the loxP sites are recognized and the stop cassette is excised, allowing the downstream gene (mCherry) to be expressed as part of the ligand. Similarly, the lox2272 sites would require Cre to excise, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the specifics of the vectors. Either way, the key point is that Cre is used to excise the stop cassettes, allowing both the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

Now, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. So, SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells.

So, the idea is that in the offspring, the Cre would be active in neural crest cells, leading to the excision of the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed. Then, when they look under the confocal, they should see either mCherry (red) or eGFP (green) fluorescence.

But they didn't see a green signal. So, the eGFP wasn't expressed. The question is why.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression; whether the proteins are secreted and act on other cells. But the absence of eGFP expression doesn't directly relate to paracrine versus other relationships. So this might not be the answer.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP construct stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent it from being on the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But why wouldn't it be expressed? Because the vector allows expression only when Cre is present. If the Cre is active, the construct should be expressed. But if it's stuck, perhaps the protein isn't being transported correctly. But the problem is about expression, not trafficking.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, what enhancers are present? The ligand is under CBA promoter, which might be sufficient. The receptor is under the IRES, which is part of the bicistronic setup. If the enhancer is missing, perhaps the expression isn't happening. But the vector was tested in primary astrocytes, and the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin. So, the expression was confirmed in vitro. So it's probably expressed in the cells, meaning the promoters are working. Therefore, this might not be the issue.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, wait, the vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette and then eGFP. If the stop cassette isn't excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette should be removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed as a fusion. If the stop cassette wasn't excised, then the receptor would be expressed but not eGFP. But how?

Wait, perhaps the construct is designed such that when the stop cassettes are removed, the receptor and eGFP are in the same reading frame, allowing them to be co-expressed as a fusion. But if the reading frames are not aligned (i.e., the stop wasn't correctly excised, or the cassette wasn't properly flanked), the eGFP might not be correctly expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the ORFs are not in frame, so even if the stop is excised, the eGFP isn't correctly expressed.

Wait, the question says that between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So the receptor's ORF ends, then the stop, then eGFP. So when Cre excises the stop, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF. If they're not in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed properly.

Wait, no, that's not right. The stop cassette would be in between them. So, when Cre excises the stop, the receptor's ORF would be followed directly by eGFP's ORF. So, the two would be in frame only if their start and stop codons are aligned correctly. If not, the eGFP might not be expressed or might produce a truncated protein.

So, in this case, if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed, resulting in no green signal.

But why would the eGFP be expressed only if the frame is correct? Because when the stop is removed, the reading frame continues into eGFP. So, if the receptor's stop codon is at a different frame than eGFP's start, then the eGFP won't be properly translated. That could prevent eGFP expression.

So, when they tested the Western blot, they saw signals proportional to actin. But wait, the Western blot was done on the primary astrocyte culture after transfecting the plasmid. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So, if the ligand and receptor are expressed, their antibodies would detect them.

Wait, but in the case of the mouse model, it's a transgenic construct. So, the Western blot in vitro would have shown expression if the vector worked. So, in the mouse, perhaps the Cre wasn't working, but in the question, they crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, which should provide Cre in neural crest cells.

But the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed. So, if the stop cassette after the receptor isn't properly excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But why wouldn't the stop cassette be excised?

Wait, the vector had loxP and lox2272 sites. Cre recognizes loxP, but not lox2272? Or can Cre work with lox2272? I think lox2272 is a variant that requires Cre but has a different recognition site. So, I think Cre can still cut lox2272, but perhaps it's directional.

Wait, another thing: the stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. If the Cre is present, it would excise both. But maybe the vector isn't set up correctly for both sites. Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 site isn't compatible with the Cre used, so the stop cassette isn't being excised, leaving the eGFP out.

Wait, but the vector is designed with a loxP stop before mCherry and a lox2272 stop before eGFP. So, perhaps the mCherry is only expressed when loxP is excised, and eGFP when lox2272 is excised.

But SOX10-Cre would express Cre in neural crest cells, which would excise both loxP and lox2272 sites. So, both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But if the IRES is driving the receptor, perhaps the IRES is only allowing the receptor to be expressed, not the eGFP. Wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So, the ligand is under CBA, then the stop cassette loxP. Then IRES, then the receptor, then stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe the IRES is between the ligand and the receptor. So, the CBA promoter drives the ligand, which has a stop cassette after. Then the IRES, which would allow the receptor to be expressed, perhaps with its own stop cassette. So, the ligand is expressed when Cre excises the loxP stop, and the receptor when Cre excises the lox2272 stop.

But in the mouse, if both stops are excised, then both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP would be expressed. But when they looked, only mCherry (red) would show, but the question is about eGFP (green).

Wait, but the question said that the construct is a bicistronic vector, so both could be expressed. But in the offspring, they only looked for green (eGFP). They didn't see any green.

Hmm. So, why wouldn't the eGFP be expressed? Let's think about each option.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that when the stop is excised, the ORF continues but is not in frame, so eGFP isn't expressed. So, that would explain lack of green.

But wait, the vector should be designed so that when the stop is removed, the ORFs are in frame. If they're not, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, leading to no signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the cloning process didn't ensure the correct reading frame, so even if the stop is excised, eGFP isn't translated.

In the question, after the vector is transfected into astrocytes, Western blot with antibodies against the overexpressed proteins shows signals proportional to actin. So, the proteins are being expressed in vitro. That suggests that the expression cassettes are working. So, in the mouse model, if the Cre is active, the same should happen.

But the problem arises in the mouse, not in the cell culture. So, perhaps in the mouse, the Cre isn't active in the right cells or the construct isn't properly excised.

Wait, but the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre. So, the Cre should be active in the neural crest cells, which are derived from the ectoderm, particularly in regions where SOX10 is expressed.

Wait, but perhaps the expression of the ligand and receptor is not under the control of the same promoter. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is under the IRES, which is probably also constitutive but dependent on the translation of the previous ORF.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the IRES for the receptor is not functional in the mouse, leading to no expression of the receptor and eGFP.

But the Western blot showed that expression was working in vitro, so the IRES should be functional.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being translated because of the vector design. The vector has the receptor followed by a stop cassette with lox2272, then eGFP. So, without Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed. But with Cre, the stop is removed, and eGFP should be expressed as part of the same ORF as the receptor.

But if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, leading to no green signal.

So, the most likely reason is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Another possibility is that the stop cassettes weren't properly excised because of the lox sites. But the vector was tested and worked in vitro. So, in the mouse, it's likely that the Cre is active, so the stops should be excised.

So, putting it all together, the lack of green signal is because the eGFP isn't expressed. The only option that directly addresses that is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't translated.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand fused to mCherry and a receptor fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites are present between the ligand and mCherry, and between the receptor and eGFP, respectively. Cre recombinase is expected to excise these stop cassettes, enabling expression of the downstream genes. The mouse model was crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, which should express Cre in neural crest cells, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed. However, no green signal (eGFP) was observed under the confocal microscope.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option refers to the functional relationship between the ligand and receptor but does not explain why eGFP is not expressed. The absence of fluorescence is related to expression, not the mode of action. This is unlikely to be the correct answer.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, it would prevent surface expression, but this would not explain why the construct is not expressed in the first place. The absence of fluorescence is more likely due to a failure in expression rather than trafficking. This is unlikely to be the correct answer.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is under the IRES, which should allow its expression. Since the vector was tested in vitro and showed expression, the enhancer or promoter elements are functional. This is unlikely to be the correct answer.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   The vector design allows Cre to excise the stop cassettes, enabling expression of the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP fusion proteins. If the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, the eGFP would not be properly translated, even if the stop cassette is excised. This would result in no green signal, making this the most likely explanation.

### Conclusion:
The absence of the green signal is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP not being in the correct reading frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP.
