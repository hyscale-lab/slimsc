Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the difference must be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Not sure.

Wait, let me think. When you have two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the uncertainty in their energies is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. To resolve them, the energy difference should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2, right? Because if the difference is smaller than the sum of their uncertainties, the lines would overlap.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain about this. Maybe it's the uncertainty in ΔE itself that matters. Hmm, perhaps another approach: the resolving power depends on the time measurement. The time over which you measure could determine the energy resolution.

Wait, maybe the energy difference should be on the order of ħ divided by the minimum time you can measure. So if the lifetimes are τ1 and τ2, the minimum time is the smaller of the two, perhaps. Or maybe the maximum? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, the problem is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So the energy difference needs to be detectable above the noise. So the minimum detectable ΔE would be around ħ divided by the measurement time. Wait, the measurement time—what's the measurement time here? The lifetimes are given as the lifetimes of each state, so perhaps the time available is the minimum of the two lifetimes, or the maximum?

Alternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in the energy measurement comes from the time you can observe the state. Let's say if you have a state with a shorter lifetime, the energy uncertainty is larger. So for E1, which has τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1. Similarly, E2 has ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, their spectral lines would overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.

So ΔE ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but let me calculate this. Let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

First, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But wait, the answer options are in eV, so I need to convert everything into eV.

I remember that 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, let's compute ΔE1: ħ / τ1.

τ1 is 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J.

Convert that to eV: 1.05e-25 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.55e-7 eV.

Similarly, τ2 is 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = (1.05e-34 J·s)/(1e-8 s) = 1.05e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.55e-8 eV.

So the sum ΔE1 + ΔE2 is approximately 6.55e-7 + 6.55e-8 = about 7.205e-7 eV.

So for the energy difference to be clearly resolvable, it should be larger than this sum. Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → much smaller than 7e-7, so not resolvable.

B)1e-11 → even smaller, same issue.

C)1e-4 eV → way larger than 7e-7, so yes.

D)1e-8 eV → about 10 times smaller than 7e-7, so not enough.

So the correct option should be C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I do the calculation correctly? Let me redo the calculations step by step.

First, compute ΔE1:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
τ1 = 1e-9 s
ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately (1.05457e-25)/(1.602e-19) = approx 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 =1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = (1.05457e-34) / 1e-8 = 1.05457e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05457e-26 / 1.602e-19 = approx 6.58e-8 eV.

Sum ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = approx 7.23e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than 7.23e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. That's way larger than 7.23e-7, so option C is sufficient.

Options A is 1e-9 eV, which is 0.000000001 eV → way smaller than 7.23e-7 eV. So not enough.

Option B is 1e-11 eV → even smaller than A.

Option D is 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is still smaller than 7.23e-7 eV.

So the correct answer is option C.


To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between them must be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties, which are determined by the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \geq \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

The energy uncertainty for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E_i = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_i}
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is the reduced Planck constant, and \( \tau_i \) is the lifetime of the state. The lifetimes are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
\]
Convert to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]
Convert to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 2: Sum of energy uncertainties
The total energy uncertainty is:
\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the options
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( 7.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 7.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
