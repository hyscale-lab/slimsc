Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and they decay into other particles. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles. Let's see, the given reaction is Pi(+) equals mu(+) plus nu. Oh right, Pi(+) is at rest, so that probably simplifies things.

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, what about the neutrino? I think neutrinos have very tiny masses, sometimes approximated as zero in these kinds of problems. So I guess we can take the neutrino's mass as zero. That might make the calculations easier.

So the problem is about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest before the decay, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum must still be zero because momentum is conserved. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That means their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but directions are opposite.

Let me think about the energies. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy is its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero.

So the total energy after decay is (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu. But since energy is conserved, this must equal 139.6 MeV. So equation one is 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu = 139.6.

For momentum, since the pion is at rest, the vector sum of the muon and neutrino momenta is zero. So their magnitudes are equal. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p. Then the neutrino has momentum -p. But since we can take the magnitudes, I can say p_mu = p_nu = p.

Now, the energy of the muon is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2. Wait, actually, in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics, the expressions simplify. So the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and neutrino's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_nu^2). But since m_nu is zero, the neutrino's energy is just p.

So putting it together, the total energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = 139.6 MeV.

Hmm, let me write that equation again: sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me denote m_mu as 105.7 for simplicity. So,

sqrt(p² + m²) + p = M, where M is 139.6.

I need to solve for p. Let me rearrange:

sqrt(p² + m²) = M - p.

Now, square both sides:

p² + m² = (M - p)^2 = M² - 2 M p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

m² = M² - 2 M p.

So, 2 M p = M² - m².

Therefore, p = (M² - m²) / (2 M).

Let me plug in the numbers. M is 139.6 MeV, m is 105.7 MeV.

M squared is (139.6)^2. Let me compute that: 139.6 *139.6. Let me approximate. 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is a bit less. 139.6^2 is (140-0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, m squared is 105.7^2. Let me compute that. 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and the cross term is 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.

So M² - m² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Then 2 M p = 8315.67 → p = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6) → 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's divide 8315 by 279.2.

279.2 times 30 is 8376, which is a bit more than 8315. So 29.8 would give 279.2 *29.8 ≈ 8315. So p is approximately 29.8 MeV/c.

Wait, but let's compute more accurately. 279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2*(30-0.2) = 279.2*30=8376, minus 279.2*0.2=55.84 → 8376-55.84=8320.16. Hmm, but that's a bit higher than 8315.67.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 8100 (approx) because 279 *30=8370, so 279.2 *29 = 279.2*(30-1)=8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

Wait, 279.2 *29 = 279.2 * (30-1) = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

So 8315.67 is 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87 MeV beyond that.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783. So p ≈29.783 MeV/c, approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

So p is about 29.78 MeV/c. But wait, let me do the division more accurately. 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2 *29 + 279.2 *0.8.

279.2 *29 = 8096.8 as before.

279.2 *0.8 = 223.36. So 8096.8 +223.36=8320.16.

But 8315.67 is less than that. So 29.8 gives us 8320.16, which is 4.49 MeV higher than 8315.67. So perhaps it's 29.8 minus a little.

Let me compute 8320.16 - 8315.67 = 4.49. So the excess is 4.49. Since each 0.1 in x gives 27.92 (279.2 *0.01=2.792, so 0.01 is 2.792). So 4.49 /27.92 ≈ 0.1606. So 29.8 -0.1606=29.6394. So p≈29.64 MeV/c.

But perhaps this is a more precise way: 8315.67 ÷ 279.2 = ?

Let me compute 279.2 × 29.64.

279.2 × 29 = 8096.8.

279.2 ×0.64 = let's compute 279.2 ×0.6=167.52; 279.2 ×0.04=11.168. So total 167.52 +11.168=178.688.

Adding 8096.8 and 178.688 gives 8275.488.

But we needed 8315.67. So 8315.67 - 8275.488=40.182.

So 40.182 / 279.2 ≈ 0.1438. So 29.64 + 0.1438=29.7838. So p≈29.78 MeV/c.

Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps I should just compute 8315.67 / 279.2 more directly.

Let me do this division step by step.

279.2 × 29 = 8096.8 (as before).

8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 = approximately 0.783.

So 29.783. So p = 29.783 MeV/c.

So the momentum of the muon is about 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the kinetic energy of the muon is the total energy of the muon minus its rest mass energy.

The muon's energy is sqrt(p² + m²) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let me compute that:

29.78^2 is approximately 887.0 (since 30^2 is 900, 29.78 is a bit less). Let me compute 29.78^2: (30 - 0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22^2 = 900 - 13.2 + 0.0484= 886.8484.

m_mu squared is 105.7^2 = 11172.49.

So 886.8484 + 11172.49 = 12059.3384. The square root of this is sqrt(12059.3384) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, wait because 109.81 squared is about 12059. So yes, that's correct.

So the muon's energy is 109.81 MeV. Its rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy K_mu is 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7, the neutrino must carry away some energy. So if the muon's KE is 4.11, the neutrino's would be 139.6 - 105.7 -4.11 = 29.79 MeV. But let's see:

Wait, let's recalculate. Because when I calculated p, I got about 29.78 MeV/c. Then the muon's energy is sqrt(p² +m²) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(887 + 11172) = sqrt(12059) ≈ 109.81 MeV. So K_mu is 109.81 - 105.7 =4.11 MeV.

And the neutrino's energy is p, which is 29.78 MeV. So the neutrino's kinetic energy is 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but in the options, the muon's KE is one of the numbers, and the neutrino's is the other.

Looking at the options:

Option D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That matches our calculation. So the muon's KE is approx 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's is approx 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but let me confirm that. Because when I did the p calculation, I approximated 29.78, which is about 29.8. And the muon's KE is 4.11, which is approximately 4.12 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the correct option should be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary positively charged pion (\(\pi^+\)) into a positively charged muon (\(\mu^+\)) and a neutrino (\(\nu\)). The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino's mass is approximated as zero. The goal is to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

### Conservation of Energy and Momentum
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion, \(E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu
   \]
   where \(E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}\) (total energy of the muon) and \(E_\nu = p\) (energy of the neutrino, since its rest mass is zero). Thus:
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. This implies the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta, so their magnitudes are equal: \(p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu = p\).

### Solving for Momentum \(p\)
Rearranging the energy equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = m_{\pi^+} - p
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\pi^+} - p)^2
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2m_{\pi^+}p + p^2
\]
\[
m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2m_{\pi^+}p
\]
\[
2m_{\pi^+}p = m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2
\]
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2m_{\pi^+}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c
\]

### Calculating Kinetic Energies
1. **Muon's Kinetic Energy (\(K_{\mu^+}\))**:
   The total energy of the muon is:
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}
   \]
   Substituting \(p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} = \sqrt{886.8484 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.3384} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
   The kinetic energy is:
   \[
   K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy (\(K_\nu\))**:
   The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:
   \[
   K_\nu = E_\nu = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. This matches **Option D**.
