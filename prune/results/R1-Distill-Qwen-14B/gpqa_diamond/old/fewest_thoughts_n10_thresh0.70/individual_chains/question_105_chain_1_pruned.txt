Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The situation causes the star's brightness to vary periodically because of rotation, similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (Rpl) relative to the host star (Rstar) to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

Hmm, okay. So the key here is to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots on the star to that caused by an exoplanet. The idea is that when the planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, the spots on the star cause a variation because as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, changing the observed brightness.

Wait, but in this case, the spots are cooler, so when they're facing towards us, the brightness would decrease. But the star's brightness is varying because of that. The exoplanet's transit would also cause a dipâ€”so the amplitude of that dip should be the same in both cases.

Wait, but for the planet, the dip is due to the planet blocking part of the star's light. For the star's spots, the dip is because the spots are cooler, so when they're on the side facing us (as the star rotates), the total brightness is a bit less. So the observed brightness variation would be similar to both cases.

But wait, what's the filling factor here? The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So 20% of one hemisphere is covered. But wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered, so the total coverage is 20% of the hemisphere? Or is it 20% coverage for each spot
