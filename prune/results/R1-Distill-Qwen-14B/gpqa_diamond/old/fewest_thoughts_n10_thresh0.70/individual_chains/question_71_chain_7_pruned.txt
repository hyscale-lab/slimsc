Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets. Hmm, let's see. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, mainly the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh wait, but they all have the same albedo, so that part cancels out.

The planets are in orbital resonance, and their periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 P2=2*P1, Planet_3 P3=2.5*P1, Planet_4 P4=3.5*P1, and Planet_5 P5=5*P1. Right.

But how does the orbital period relate to the distance? I think Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P² ∝ a³. Since all planets are in the same system, the star's mass is constant, so I can write (P₁²)/(a₁³) = (P₂²)/(a₂³) = ... and so on.

Wait, the formula is usually written as P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So the actual equation would be a³ = (G M * P²) / (4 π²). But since we're dealing with ratios, the constants will cancel out. So for each planet, a proportional to (P^(2/3)).

So the semi-major axis (distance from the star) of each planet is proportional to the cube root of the square of their orbital periods. Wait, no, more accurately, a ∝ P^(2/3), since a³ ∝ P² → a ∝ P^(2/3).

So, for two planets, Planet_i and Planet_j, their distances are a_i and a_j, proportional to (P_i)^(2/3) and (P_j)^(2/3).

But equilibrium temperature depends on the distance. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ), assuming the star's radius is R_star and the planet has an albedo of, say, A (but since all have the same albedo, it doesn't affect the ratio).

So the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. Because T_eq ∝ 1
