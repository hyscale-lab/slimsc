Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question about a synthesized peptidic compound. Let's see what the question is saying.

The setup: I'm analyzing a small peptide, and the 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly correct except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, so that's fine. But the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason for the duplicate peaks. Then, LC-MS analysis at elevated temp shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass.

Hmm. So the question is why there are these duplicate peaks in both NMR and LC-MS.

First, the NMR part. Two peaks for the same proton. But why? Since the shifts are similar, it's not a diastereotopic situation. Wait, diastereotopic protons would have the same shift if in a symmetric environment, but that's not the case here. Wait, or perhaps they are in a different environment, but it's the same alpha proton.

Wait, the coupling can't explain it. So maybe it's something else. The two peaks could be due to different conformations of the molecule? Or maybe they're from different stereoisomers.

Wait, but the integral is correct—each peak in NMR sums to 1H, so maybe it's the same proton in two different environments. But how?

Then, the LC-MS part: two peaks, same mass, same intensity. So it's two different compounds with the same molecular weight? Or maybe the same compound in different states, like diastereomers or enantiomers.

If it's a racemic mixture, enantiomers would have the same mass spec but would separate on a chiral column. But if the LC is using a regular column, they might elute together. Wait, but the question says LC-MS was run at elevated temperature. Maybe it's a reversed-phase HPLC. But enantiomers have same physical properties except for chirality. So in a normal HPLC column, they might not separate. Unless the column is chiral. But the question doesn't specify. Hmm.

Wait, but in the options, one is about enantiomers (B) and another about diastereomers (D). Let's think about each possibility.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. The NMR would have extra peaks for the precursor, but the question says the NMR is consistent except for those two peaks. So if it's a precursor, the NMR would show more than that, and the LC-MS would show a peak with a different mass. But in the question, the LC-MS has same mass as expected. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. If it's a racemic mix, the NMR would see each enantiomer as identical if the instrument can't tell the difference. Wait, wait—no. Wait, no, in NMR, enantiomers have the same NMR spectrum because they are mirror images. So the NMR would show only one set of peaks. Unless... Hmm. Unless the sample is a mixture and the NMR is acquiring something else. Wait, but the question says in the NMR, the two peaks are for the same alpha proton. So maybe the NMR is showing a different source of splitting, like something else, not enantiomers. But the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, which would be the same molecule if enantiomers, but if it's a racemic mix, they would either not separate or co-elute. Unless the LC conditions can separate them. Wait, but if the LC is a regular (non-chiral) column, enantiomers would co-elute, giving one peak. Only if the column is chiral would they separate. So if the LC shows two peaks, perhaps the sample is a mixture of diastereomers, not enantiomers.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not too familiar with this term. Maybe it's when during the formation
