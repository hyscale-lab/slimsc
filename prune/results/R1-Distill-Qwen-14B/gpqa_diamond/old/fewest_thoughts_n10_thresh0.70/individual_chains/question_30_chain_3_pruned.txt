Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the color of light it absorbs. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. So the dye emits light with a specific energy, and I need to find out which color it absorbs.

Wait, the question says the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. So I think this emission is related to the energy gap between the excited state and the ground state. Oh right, when electrons get excited, they drop back and emit energy. So the energy of the emitted light is related to the energy difference they lose.

But wait, the question is about the color the compound absorbs, not emits. Oh right, because when a compound emits light, it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon and then re-emits a lower energy one. So the absorbed light must have higher energy than the emitted.

So the energy of absorbed light should be higher than the emitted energy. Because the electrons go from a lower energy level to a higher one when absorbing, and then drop back down, emitting the lower energy.

So the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. Let me find the wavelength corresponding to that energy. The formula E = hc/lambda. So rearranged, lambda = hc/E.

Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 JÂ·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. But since we're dealing with eV, maybe there's a shortcut. Oh right, I remember that 1 eV corresponds to about 1240
