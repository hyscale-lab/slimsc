Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to involve some sort of branching and a carboxylic acid group.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But since the compound is a carboxylic acid (as one of the options has COOH), the broad peak is likely due to the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. That makes sense.

There's also a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which fits with the carboxylic acid group. So the presence of both broad and strong peaks confirms that the compound has a carboxylic acid functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, there are no double bonds in the structure. All the structures provided don't have double bonds, so that's consistent.

Next, the NMR has two specific signals:

1. A doublet of triplets of quartets.
2. A doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about splitting patterns. Each splitting comes from neighboring (adjacent) protons. So, the splitting "of quartets" might mean that a proton is next to a CH2 group (which has two protons), leading to a quartet. Wait, no, wait. The splitting in NMR is based on the number of neighboring non-equivalent protons. So, for a quartet, it's from a CH2 group (n=2, so n+1=3? Wait, no, wait, quartet is splitting into 4 peaks, which is n=3 neighboring protons. So, maybe a CH3 group adjacent?

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider each option's structure and predict their NMR splitting.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So, the structure is: 
- The carboxylic acid is at the end (CH2COOH).
- The adjacent carbon is CH2, then before that is C(H)(C2H5) on each side.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Here, the COOH is directly attached to a carbon which has two substituents: C2H5 and another CH2CH3 (from CH3CH2-).

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Here, the structure has two CH(CH3) groups attached to a central carbon, and then a CH2COOH. So maybe a geminal di-substitution.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
COOH is attached to a CH. The adjacent carbons are CH(CH3) groups.

Now, let me think about the NMR signals.

The problem mentions that none of the signals are vinyl, so I don't have to worry about double bonds.

In the NMR, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is more accurately described as a doublet of triplets and a triplet of doublets, but perhaps I'm misinterpre
