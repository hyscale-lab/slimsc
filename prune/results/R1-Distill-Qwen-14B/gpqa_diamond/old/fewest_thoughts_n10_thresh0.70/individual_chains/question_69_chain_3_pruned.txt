Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime is tau_0 = 8e-16 seconds. They're asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are various lengths in meters.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer if they're moving fast because of time dilation. Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. So from our lab frame, the lifetime would be longer.

So the formula for time dilation is tau = gamma * tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is gamma = E / m, right? Because E is the total energy and m is the rest mass. So in this case, E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV. Let me compute gamma.

Gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. So tau is 7.917 * 8e-16 seconds. Let me calculate that. 7.917 * 8 is about 63.336, so tau is 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Now, the particles Y⁺ and Z⁻ will move away from each other. The distance between them when they decay depends on their velocity. But to observe the decay, the bubble chamber's resolution needs to be good enough to distinguish the two particles, I think. So the minimum distance they need to travel apart is determined by their speed and the lifetime.

Wait, but the lifetime is the time they have to travel. So the distance each particle travels is v * tau. But wait, no. Because the lifetime is dilated, the particles have more time to move. So each particle's path length would be beta * c * tau, where beta is v/c.

Wait, but what's the velocity of X⁰? Because the energy is given. Alternatively, since gamma is known, beta can be found from gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Let me solve for beta.

We have gamma ≈ 7.917. So 1 - beta² = 1 / (gamma²) → beta² = 1 - 1/(7.917)^2. Let's calculate that. 7.917 squared is about 62.68. So 1/62.68 ≈ 0.016. So 1 - 0.016 is 0.984. So beta is sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.992. So v ≈ 0.992c.

So each decay product will travel a distance of beta * c * tau. Let me compute that. c is approximately 3e8 m/s. Tau is 6.3336e-15 s.

So distance per particle is 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s. Let me compute that: 0.992 *3e8 is about 2.976e8 m/s. Multiply by 6.3336e-15 s: 2.976e8 * 6.3336e-15 = ?

Let me compute 2.976e8 *6.3336e-15. 2.976e8 is 2.976 *1e8. 6.3336e-15 is 6.3336 *1e-15. Multiply 2.976 *6.3336 ≈ let's see:

2.976 *6 = 17.856, 2.976 *0.3336 ≈ around 0.992. So total approx 18.848. Then multiply the exponents: 1e8 *1e-15 = 1e-7. So 18.848e-7 meters. 18.848e-7 is 1.8848e-6 meters, or about 1.8848e-6 m.

Wait, but each particle moves that distance. So the total distance between Y and Z would be twice that, right? Because X⁰ was at rest in its frame, so when it decays, Y and Z go in opposite directions. So each would have moved that distance, so the separation is 2 * (beta c tau). So 2 *1.8848e-6 m = 3.7696e-6 m. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, no, because in the lab frame, the X⁰ is moving. Oh wait, no, the problem is about the decay occurring, and the distance between the products in the lab frame.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The main point is that for the decay to be observed, the two particles must have separated enough so that their tracks can be distinguished in the bubble
