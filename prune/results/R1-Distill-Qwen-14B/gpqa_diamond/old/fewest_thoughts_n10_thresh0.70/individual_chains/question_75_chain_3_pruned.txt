Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the Chinese hamster ovary cells. Let me start by going through the problem step by step.

First, the setup: The researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model to study the role of GADD45G in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a construct where the coding sequence is modified to include a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. They transfected this plasmid into CHO cells using Lipofectamine and are having trouble getting the protein to overexpress.

Looking at the problem, the possible issues are in the sequence provided. So, the plasmid's construct's plus strand sequence is given. Let's examine the sequence for any issues that might prevent proper translation or expression.

First, I should check if the sequence has a proper start codon and whether the reading frame is correct. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the standard start codon (methionine). So that seems okay.

Next, I'm looking for any in-frame stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) because if there's an early stop codon, the ribosome would terminate translation early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all.

Looking through the sequence, let's parse it in triplets, starting from the beginning.

The first few codons are ATG (start), TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), etc. So far, no stop codons.

I need to scan the entire sequence for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA in the coding sequence. Let me go through it methodically.

Looking at the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CC... etc.

Wait, wait a second. Let me write out the codons:

ATG - start
TAC - Tyr
CCA - Pro
TAC - Tyr
GAT - Asp
GTT - Val
CC A - Hmm, wait, I need to group them correctly. Let me try to split the sequence into triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAA GAA TCC GCC CGG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GC...

Wait, perhaps I should write it out more clearly. Let's split the entire sequence into groups of three nucleotides, starting from the first base after ATG.

Wait, the full sequence is:

So starting from the 5' end, the
