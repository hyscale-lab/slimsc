Okay, so I have this question about absorption lines in the Milky Way, and I'm supposed to figure out which part of the interstellar medium it's coming from. Hmm, let's think through this.

The question says observations are being made of structures about 2.1 gigaparsecs away. Wait, but the absorption line detected is about 3.9 micro electron volts. I remember that the energy of the absorption line is related to the temperature of the gas causing it. Oh right, the energy corresponds to the thermal energy of the electrons in the gas. The formula I think is E = k*T, where k is the Boltzmann constant. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact numbers.

So, the energy given is 3.9e-6 eV. Let me see: 1 eV is a lot of microvolts. So 3.9 micro-eV is 3.9e-6 eV. I think the Boltzmann constant k is about 8.617e-5 eV per Kelvin. So if I set E = k*T, I can solve for T.

Let me compute that. T = E/(k) = (3.9e-6 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K). Let me calculate that. 3.9e-6 divided by 8.617e-5 is roughly (3.9 / 86.17) approximately 0.045. So 0.045 K? Wait, that seems way too low. Oh wait no, wait,
