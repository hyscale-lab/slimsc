Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem describes a series of reactions starting with Compound A (C3H6), which is probably propene because that's a common compound with that formula. Let me outline each step:

1. Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. I remember that bromination of alkenes typically uses Br2 with a solvent like CCl4, leading to an dibromide. So propene (CH₂=CHCH3) would add bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

2. Reacting Compound B with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, which usually leads to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So the 1,2-dibromopropane would undergo dehydrohalogenation. Each elimination would remove H and Br, so we might get propene again, but wait. Wait, when you have vicinal dihalide and eliminate two molecules of HBr, you get an alkene. So with two Br's on adjacent carbons, elimination would form propene. So Compound C is propene again. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, propene has two structures: 1-propene (CH₂=CHCH3) or 2-propene (CH3CH=CH2)? No, wait for a second. Let me think. Oh, wait. The starting material is propene, which is CH₂=CHCH3. When it brominates, it adds Br across the double bond, so the structure becomes CH₂Br-CHBr-CH3. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a base, we'd eliminate both Br atoms. So the reaction would form an alkene again. Since both Br are on adjacent carbons, eliminating both would form the double bond between the same carbons, so back to propene. So yes, Compound C is propene.

3. Passing Compound C through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm, propene through red-hot iron... Oh, that's a dehydrogenation reaction. Iron in such conditions can cause dehydrogenation, removing
