Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about titrating diluted acetic acid with NaOH. We start with 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, then dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, okay. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so their reaction should be straightforward. The main steps I think I need to take are:

1. Calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution.
2. Determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach 25% titration and the equivalence point.
3. Find the pH at 25% titration using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or the ICE table method.
4. Find the pH at equivalence point, which involves finding the concentration of the acetate ion and using the Kb to find the pH.

Let me start with the first part: the diluted acetic acid concentration.

The initial volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we dilute it with 20 cm³ (0.02 L) water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So, using the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2:

C1 = 0.05 M, V1 = 0.02 L
C2 = (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, I need to find the volume of NaOH needed for 25% titration. Wait, 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the equivalence point volume.

But wait, let me think. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So let's find moles of acetic acid first.

Molarity (C) = moles (n) / volume (L). So n = C * V.

Original acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

So when diluted to 0.04 L, the concentration is 0.025 M, but same number of moles: 0.001 moles.

So for the equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed are same as moles of acetic acid: 0.001 moles.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M, so volume V = n / C = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =
