Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance to the galaxy is d = 10^10 parsecs. We need to find the order of magnitude of the black hole's entropy.

Wait, entropy of a black hole... Oh right, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon, and the constants are Planck's constant ħ, gravitational constant G, and Boltzmann's constant k_B.

So, first things first, I need to find the radius of the black hole's event horizon, then calculate the area from that.

The event horizon's radius is given by the Schwarzschild radius formula, R_s = 2 G M / c². But since we don't have the mass directly, maybe we can find it using the angular size and distance. Oh yeah, because θ is the angular size, which relates to the actual size via the distance.

The formula for angular size is θ ≈ size / distance. But since θ is in degrees, I should probably convert it to radians because the formula works better in radians. So, θ (in radians) ≈ θ (degrees) * (π / 180). 

Let me calculate θ in radians. θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me compute that: π is roughly 3.1416, so 3.1416/180 ≈ 0.01745. Multiply by 1e-17 gives about 1.745e-19 radians.

So, the size of the event horizon is approximately θ_rad * d. But wait, what's the distance d? It's given as 1e10 parsecs. Oh right, 1 parsec is about 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters.

So, the size (which is the diameter of the event horizon, I think) is θ_rad * d. Wait, wait, actually, the formula is θ ≈ R_event / d, so R_event ≈ θ_rad * d. But wait, I'm a bit confused. If θ is the angular size (like the apparent size), that would be the size of the diameter over the distance. So R is half of the diameter. Or wait, maybe the formula is θ ≈ R / d, where R is the radius. Because the angular size θ is approximately the ratio of the radius to the distance when the distance is much larger than the object (which it is here).

Wait, no, actually, the formula for the angular size is θ ≈ (size of object) / (distance), where "size of object" is the linear size, in the same units as distance. So if the event horizon radius is R, then the angular size θ is approximately R / d. So R ≈ θ * d.

Wait, but let me confirm. For small angles, θ (in radians) ≈ opposite side (size) / hypotenuse (distance). So if the object's size is, say, the diameter, then θ ≈ (2R) / d. But sometimes people use θ ≈ R/d, meaning they take the radius as the 'size' for the angle. Hmm, I need to clarify this.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2 G M / c², which is the radius, so the diameter would be 2 R_s.

Wait, let me think. The angular size θ is the apparent angle the event horizon makes at distance
