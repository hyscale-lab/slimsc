Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The process given is p plus anti-p annihilating into two A+ and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass energy of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, first, let's parse the problem. So, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. The antiproton is moving slowly. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, that probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe I can approximate its kinetic energy as negligible compared to its rest mass. But I'm not entirely sure yet. 

The mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. Wait, but protons have a rest mass energy of about 938 MeV, right? So if A is 300 MeV, that's less than a proton. So A must be some meson or something with lower mass.

Since this is an annihilation process, I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum. But in annihilations, I remember that the initial and final states must conserve both energy and momentum.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So the initial momentum might be dominated by the antiproton's momentum, but since it's moving slowly, maybe I can consider the system as approximately at rest? Hmm, but wait, no. The antiproton is moving, but the proton is probably at rest? Or maybe both are moving? I'm not sure. The question says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest. But that would depend on the frame. Alternatively, perhaps the center of mass frame is moving. Wait, but I'll have to think about this.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction happens in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. So the initial momentum would be the momentum of the antiproton, and the final momentum would be the momentum of the products. Since the products are four particles, but it's given as 2A+ and 2A-, so perhaps in the final state, the total momentum is the same as the initial.

Wait, but when they annihilate, the products are two A+ and two A-. Let me think: to make things simpler, perhaps in
