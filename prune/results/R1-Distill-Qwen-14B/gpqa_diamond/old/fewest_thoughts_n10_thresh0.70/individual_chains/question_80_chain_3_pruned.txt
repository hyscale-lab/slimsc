Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what the algorithm does based on the given examples and then apply it to the new input. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem gives two examples:

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

And I need to find out what ACAGTGACC gives from the options provided.

First, let me list out what each input is and their corresponding output. Maybe I can find a pattern or a rule that transforms the DNA sequences into numbers.

Looking at the first example: AGG is the input, and the output is 115.

AGG is a 3-letter DNA sequence. Each letter could represent a nucleotide: A, G, G.

Hmm, what could AGG translate to numerically? Let's think about the positions of each nucleotide in the DNA alphabet. A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4. Wait, no, actually, in DNA, the bases are A, T, C, G. So maybe assigning each a value: A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4.

So for AGG:
A = 1
G =4
G=4
So, maybe adding them up: 1 +4 +4=9. But that's 9, not 115. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's not just adding. Maybe it's considering each letter as a digit in a base other than 10. For example, perhaps base 5 or base 4. Let's see.

Wait, DNA has four nucleotides, so maybe base 4? Let's check. In base 4, each digit can be 0-3, but the nucleotides are A, T, C, G. Maybe A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3? Or another mapping.

Wait, if I assign A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4 as digits, but in base 4, digits can't be higher than 3. So that wouldn't work. Alternatively, maybe A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. Let's try that.

So for AGG:
A=0, G=3, G=3. So
