Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about organic chemistry reactions involving mCPBA and the resulting products. Then, the products are analyzed via HPLC, both standard and chiral columns. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the problem says that a chemist performs two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, and Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. Each is followed by aqueous acid, and both go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columns.

First, I need to figure out what each reaction does. mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which I remember is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used as oxidizing agents, especially in epoxidation of alkenes. So when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. Right, so both reactions are epoxidizing the alkenes.

Wait, but the starting alkenes are E and Z isomers. So, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. When each reacts with mCPBA, what happens?

Epoxidation typically occurs with the peracid adding across the double bond. The reaction is stereospecific, I think. The peracid attacks the less substituted end (if I recall correctly) because of the way the transition state forms. Also, the reaction of mCPBA with an alkene to form an epoxide occurs through a cyclic transition state, so the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the product.

Wait, wait. Let me think. For trans (E) and cis (Z) alkenes, when epoxidized with a peracid, the resulting epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene. So, the reaction would lead to different epoxides based on E or Z configuration.

Wait, but wait, no. For a given alkene, the epoxidation would give a single epoxide product because the peracid adds across the double bond in a way that forms a specific stereochemistry in the epoxide. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, epoxidation would give a certain epoxide, and for (Z)-oct-4-ene, another.

Wait, maybe it's the same epoxide
