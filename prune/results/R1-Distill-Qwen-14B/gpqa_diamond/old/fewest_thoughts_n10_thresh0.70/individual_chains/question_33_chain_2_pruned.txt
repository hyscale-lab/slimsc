Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, which I remember is a type of pericyclic reaction. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and the reaction is heated. The question is about identifying the exo product from the given options.

Hmm, wait, cycloadditions... [4+2] is the Diels-Alder reaction, right? So one molecule is the diene and the other is the dienophile. But wait, in this case, which one is the diene and which is the dienophile?

Furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups. Furan is a good dienophile, I think. Because in Diels-Alder reactions, electron-deficient dienophiles like maleic anhydride or other electron-deficient compounds react with electron-rich dienes. So, furan-2,5-dione has the two electron-withdrawing ketone groups which make it a good dienophile.

On the other hand, 2,5-dimethylthiophene... Thiophene is similar to furan but with a sulfur. Thiophene is aromatic, but does it act as a diene? Wait, the diene in Diels-Alder is typically a conjugated diene, but thiophene is a five-membered ring with a single double bond. Oh, wait, but if it's 2,5-dimethylthiophene, perhaps under heat it can open up or something? Or maybe it's acting as the diene when it's in a s-cis conformation.

Wait, no. The Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene with two double bonds (like 1,3-diene). Thiophene has a single double bond, so it can't act as a diene. Hmm, maybe I got this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps one of the other molecules can act as the diene.

Wait, furan-2,5-dione is a dienophile, so the other must be the diene. But 2,5-dimethylthiophene isn't a
