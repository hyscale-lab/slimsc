Okay, I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me break down each piece of information and see what I can deduce.

First, the FTIR data: there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So this suggests the compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak. Alternatively, an alcohol also has a broad peak, but maybe less so?

Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated or something else. Wait, or could it be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone? Because that would have a lower carbonyl peak due to conjugation—like around 1650? Or wait, maybe that's not right. Let me think. The typical carbonyl for a ketone is around 1700. An aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds (like in a carbonyl group) might have a peak around 1600, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic C=C stretch, but that's usually in the range of 1450-1600. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a C=C in something like a conjugated ester or a conjugated ketone.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. That makes me think maybe it's an ester or a ketone with a double bond nearby. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring, but wait, the FTIR didn't show a strong peak around 1500 which is typical of aromatic C-H bending. Wait, but the IR peaks were 1700 and 1650, which could be a conjugated carbonyl and an aromatic ring. Wait, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester or something with both a carbonyl and an aromatic ring. But wait, looking at the possible formulas, the options are all C6H something O and O2. Let's consider the molecular formulas.

The options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, the degrees of unsaturation might help. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

For option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.
Degrees of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So one degree: maybe a double bond or a ring. But wait, maybe two rings or a double bond and a ring. But the NMR shows vinyl H's, so that's a double bond. So one double bond and perhaps a ring?

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation = (14 -10)/2=2. So two degrees: maybe a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (14 -10)/2=2. Again, two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees: (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, perhaps a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so there's at least one double bond, which is one degree. So let's see.

Looking back at IR, strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So two carbonyl groups? Or one carbonyl and something else. Wait, another possibility: maybe the compound is an ester, which has a carbonyl (around 1700), and maybe another group. Or perhaps it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone? Or maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. The 1650 could be the conjugated double bond.

Wait, another thought: if there's a conjugated carbonyl, maybe the peak is lower. So if the carbonyl is at 1700, that's a typical ester or ketone. If there's a conjugated double bond nearby, the peak could be lower. But 1650 is a bit low for that. Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C stretch. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from a conjugated carbonyl, like an enone system.

In the NMR, vinyl hydrogens are present, so there's a double bond. So in the structure, perhaps an alkene is present. How does that fit with the IR data?

Wait, I should think about the possible functional groups. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is O-H, so maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids typically have a very strong, broad O-H peak, which might be the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else.

But then, the mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is a common mass for various fragments, such as (CH3)2CO (acetone) is 58. Wait, 45 is the mass for something else. Let me calculate possible fragments. 45 could be C3H7O? Or maybe C2H5O2? Or perhaps it's a fragment like (CH2)2O, but that's 44. Hmm, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: 45 is the molecular ion for C3H3O2 (which would be 45: 3*12=36 +3*1=3 +16*2=32 → 36+3+32=71? No, that's not right. Wait, wait, molecular weight of 45. So 45 could be C3H7O (3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16 → 36+7+16=59). No, that's more. Wait, I'm not getting this straight. Let me think of common fragments. 

M/z 45 could be (CH3
