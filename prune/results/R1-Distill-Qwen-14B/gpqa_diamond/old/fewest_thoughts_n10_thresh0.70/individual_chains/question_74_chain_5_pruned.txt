Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the scenario is that we have a single atom, and we're monitoring its decay. From previous experiments, the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. But wait, so far 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. Now, they're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky.

Wait, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and it doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Oh, right! That's the memoryless property of exponential decay. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay shouldn't affect the future probability. Or does it?

Wait, the question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So maybe they're using a decay constant based on that 100-minute period. Let me think about the formula for radioactive decay.

The general formula for the probability of decay is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. But wait, the probability that a nucleus decays in a time t is given by 1 - e^(-λt). So in the problem, at t=100 minutes, the probability is 32%, which is 0.32.

So, we can set up the
