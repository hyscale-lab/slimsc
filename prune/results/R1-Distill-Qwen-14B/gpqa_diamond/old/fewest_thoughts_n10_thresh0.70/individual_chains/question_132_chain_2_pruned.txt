Okay, so I've got this NMR question here and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum of a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with molecular formula C10H14 shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Each compound is C6H5 plus four methyl groups, which adds four CH3, so 6 + 4*1 = 10 carbons, and 5 + 4*3= 17 hydrogens. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. For benzene, C6H6. Each methyl is CH3, so four methyl groups would add 4*(3 H) = 12 H. So for each compound, it's C6H6 + 4CH3 = C10H18. But the molecular formula given is C10H14. So that's two less hydrogens, meaning each compound has two rings with substituents that cause de-shielding and perhaps some substitution that reduces H count. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. Let me compute the degree of unsaturation. For C10H14: Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2= 8/2=4. So four degreesâ€”could be one benzene ring (which is three, each ring or double bond is one) and maybe a double bond, but more likely, the benzene ring (which accounts for 3) and another ring or double bond. Hmm, but the compounds in the options are tetramethylbenzenes, which are substituted benzene rings. So each is a benzene with four methyl groups. So each has one ring (3), plus four substituents
