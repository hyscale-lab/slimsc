Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, let me draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The benzene ring has three substituents: an ethoxy group, a nitro group, and a tert-butyl group. The numbering is such that the ethoxy is in position 1, nitro in 3, and tert-butyl in 2. Wait, no, wait, benzene is a ring, so positions are relative. Let me clarify the numbering. Oh, wait, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the structure would have ethoxy in position 1, tert-butyl in 2, and nitro in 3. Hmm, or wait, the actual substitution pattern? Let me think: the formula is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, numbering the ring, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, substituents are at 1,2,3 positions. So, adjacent to each other?

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So substituents in positions 1, 2, 3 would mean they are meta to each other? No, because 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, so 1 and 3 are meta. So, the structure would have ethoxy in position 1, tert-butyl in 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro in 3 (meta to ethoxy, ortho to tert-butyl).

Now, the synthesis starts with benzene. So, I need to figure out the order of adding these substituents. Since the product has three substituents, the synthesis will involve three substitution reactions, possibly with some directing effects considered.

I remember that substituents on benzene can direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions based on their nature. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by activating or deactivating groups. Activating groups (like -OCH2CH3, ethoxy) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups (like nitro, NO2) are meta directors.

But wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The tert-butyl group is an activating (since it's an alkyl group) but bulky; it's a para director but can lead to more para substitution due to steric hindrance, so it's sometimes called a weak ortho/para director but tends to direct more to para because of its bulk.

Wait, no, I think the tert-butyl group is an activating, but it's a bulky group, so it's a strong para director because when the group is bulky, the ortho positions are harder to approach, so the
