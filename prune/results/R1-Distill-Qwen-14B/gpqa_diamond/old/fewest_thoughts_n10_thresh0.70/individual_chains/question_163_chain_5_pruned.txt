Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. Hmm, I need to figure out how much acid is needed and what the pH of the resulting solution is. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when a hydroxide reacts with a strong acid, it's a neutralization reaction. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think. So the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with HCl (a strong monobasic acid) to produce FeCl3, water, and maybe some H+ ions.

The reaction equation should be: Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. Wait, yeah, that makes sense because each HCl provides one H+ and one Cl-.

Next, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The problem states 0.1 grams. Let me calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is... Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, each O is 16, each H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Wait, more precisely, 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009358 mol.

Since the acid is monobasic and strong, each mole of HCl provides one mole of H+. From the reaction equation, the mole ratio is 1:3. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, 3 moles of HCl are needed.

So moles of HCl needed = 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.0028074 mol.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, meaning moles per liter. So to find the volume, I can use moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). Rearranged, Volume = moles / Molarity.

So volume of HCl needed is 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028074 L, which is 28.074 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³ which is really close. So maybe that's the volume needed.

But wait, the question also asks about the
