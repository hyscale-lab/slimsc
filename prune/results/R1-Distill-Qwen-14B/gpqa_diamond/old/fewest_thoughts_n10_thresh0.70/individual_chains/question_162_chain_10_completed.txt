Okay, so I've got this question about general relativity or differential geometry, I'm not exactly sure, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor defines the geometry of spacetime, but here it's probably a 2-dimensional space since there's only dx and dy.

Wait, pseudosphere... I think a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. So it's like the hyperbolic equivalent of a sphere. But wait, why is it called a pseudosphere? Oh right, because in some contexts, like in Minkowski space, a sphere can have imaginary radius, but here the radius is given as r=2, which is real. Maybe it's just a negatively curved surface.

Looking at the metric, it's written in terms of x and y. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, which might mean the metric blows up, like a singularity or event horizon. Wait, but for a sphere, the area is 4πr². Here, r is 2, so 4π*(2)^2 = 16π. But the options don't directly have that, so maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, the metric is given as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So this is in coordinates (x,y), probably in a conformally flat space because the metric is just a scalar function multiplied by dx² + dy². The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - (x² + y²)).

Wait, the area of a surface in 2D with this metric would be the integral over the surface of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, but since it's conformally flat, the area element is just sqrt(det g) dx dy, and det g is [32/(4 - (x² + y²))]^2. Wait, no, I think for a 2D metric g, the determinant is [g_{xx} * g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2]. But here, the metric is diagonal, so g_{xx}=g_{yy}=32/(4 - x² - y²) and the off-diagonal terms are zero. So det g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, wait, the area would be the integral of sqrt(g) over the region, but for a 2-manifold, the area is the integral of sqrt(det g) dx dy. But in this case, sqrt(det g) is [32/(4 - (x² + y²))]²? No, wait, sqrt(det g) would be sqrt([32/(4 - r²)]²) where r² = x² + y². That's 32/(4 - r²). So the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

Wait, maybe it's easier to switch to polar coordinates since x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So the area element becomes [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the area would be the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r from 0 to some maximum value. Wait, what's the domain of r here? The denominator 4 - r² can't be zero, so 4 - r² > 0 → r² <4 → r <2. So the radius is up to 2. But wait, the denominator also can't be negative, so r must be less than 2. So the surface is defined for r² <4, up to r=2.

Wait, but if the pseudosphere has radius r=2, then maybe the maximum r is 2, but in the metric, when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the area element becomes infinite. Hmm, that sounds like there's a singularity at r=2. But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, but in a pseudosphere, maybe it's a finite area?

Wait, let me think about the geometry. A pseudosphere of radius r has a certain area. I think the area of a pseudosphere (in hyperbolic geometry) is 4π r² (like a sphere) but wait, no, that's for a sphere. For hyperbolic space, the area is infinite, but wait, no, the pseudosphere is a finite surface. Or maybe it's a surface with finite area? Wait, no, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and it's an infinite surface. Wait, but in some models, like the Poincaré disk model, it's represented within a finite disk, but the actual area is infinite.

Alternatively, maybe in the metric given, the area is something else. Let's compute the integral.

So, the area would be integral (θ from 0 to 2π) integral (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Because the maximum r is 2, as beyond that, the denominator becomes zero or negative, but for r <2, it's positive.

So the area is 2π * integral from 0 to 2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32/(u)] * (-du/2) ) from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2). The limits reverse because when r=2, u=0.

So, 32 * (-1/2) ∫ [1/u ] du from 4 to 0 → 32*(-1/2)[ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but integrating from 4 to 0, so when we switch limits, the integral becomes positive, so it's 32*(1/2) ∫ from 0 to 4 [1/u ] du.

Wait, but wait, when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So substituting, the integral becomes:

32 * ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) → 32 * ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²).

Let me do substitution again.

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = ∫ (-du/2) / u = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

So evaluating from r=0 to r=2, which is u=4 to u=0.

So,

[ (-1/2) ln(0) ) ] - [ (-1/2) ln(4) ) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this integral diverges to infinity. So the area is infinite. So the area is +infinity.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer should be D.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional space. The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). 

### Step 1: Understanding the Metric
The metric is conformally flat, meaning it can be written as a scalar function multiplied by the Euclidean metric \( dx^2 + dy^2 \). The conformal factor is \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). Switching to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \( \sqrt{\det g} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \). Thus, the area element is:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

### Step 2: Domain of Integration
The metric is defined for \( 4 - r^2 > 0 \), which implies \( r < 2 \). Therefore, the integration over \( r \) runs from \( 0 \) to \( 2 \), and \( \theta \) runs from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \).

### Step 3: Computing the Area
The total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \( \theta \) gives \( 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

### Step 4: Evaluating the Radial Integral
Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2} \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{du}{2}}{u} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges as \( u \to 0 \), because \( \ln(u) \to -\infty \). Therefore, the area is infinite.

### Conclusion
The area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite. Among the options, the correct answer is:
