Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about particle annihilation. Hmm, let me see. The question is about the annihilation process p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, first, I remember that in particle physics, when particles annihilate, they convert into other particles. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The products are two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. So each A must have some mass, which is given.

But the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, right, "slowly" probably implies that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate its speed as non-relativistic, or perhaps just use conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, but wait, in annihilation processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. So the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton, assuming the proton is at rest. Because in high-energy physics, particles are often considered to be colliding head-on, but in this case, since it's stated that the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the proton is initially at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it.

Wait, but in this case, the initial system is a proton (maybe at rest) and an antiproton moving slowly. So the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton. Then, in the final state, we have four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. But wait, how does that work? Or perhaps the products are two A particles each with charge + and -, but maybe they are moving in such a way that the total momentum is conserved.

But wait, this seems a bit complicated. Let me think again. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. But perhaps A⁺ and A⁻ are each a single particle, so two of each, so four particles total.

Wait, but four particles with momentum? That might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the products are two particles each, but maybe it's a typo and it's supposed to be two A particles, but that doesn't make much sense either. Actually, the problem states 2A⁺ and 2A⁻, so four particles.

But given that the conservation laws must hold, maybe the problem is symmetric.
