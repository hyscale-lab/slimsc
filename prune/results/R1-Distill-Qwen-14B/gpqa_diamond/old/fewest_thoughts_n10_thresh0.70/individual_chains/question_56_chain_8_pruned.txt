Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, the question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions between energy levels are governed by the selection rules. The selection rules determine which transitions are allowed or forbidden based on changes in the quantum numbers n, l, and m.

Dipole transitions involve the emission or absorption of a photon, and the selection rules for dipole transitions are usually Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0 or ±1. Also, the principal quantum number n can change, but that's more about the energy levels.

The initial state here is |3,0,0>. So n=3, l=0, m=0. It's decaying to |1,0,0>, which is n=1, l=0, m=0. Wait, but that's a big drop. n goes from 3 to 1. So two dipole transitions? Because going from 3 to 1 in one step would require Δn = -2, but dipole transitions usually have Δn = ±1. So probably, the decay happens in two steps: 3 → 2 → 1.

So the first transition is from n=3, l=0 to maybe n=2 with l=1, since Δl must be ±1. Because initially l is 0, so it can go to l=1 (since +1) or l=-1, but l can't be negative, so only l=1.

So possible intermediate states are |2,1, m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1. Because m can change by 0 or ±1. So from m=0, the next m can be -1, 0, +1.

Now, the first transition is 3,0,0 → 2,1, m, and then 2,1, m → 1,0,0.

Wait, what's the second transition's selection rules? From the intermediate state, which is |2,1, m>, to
