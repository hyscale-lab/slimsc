Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to recall.

The problem says there's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as mu = gamma * S_z. Oh wait, S_z is the spin operator in the z-direction. So mu is proportional to the spin in the z-direction. 

Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. So the particle is in a magnetic field B along Z. Then, suddenly the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, and both have the same magnitude B. So the field changes direction from Z to Y. 

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So we're looking at <mu_z> oscillating over time, and we need to find the frequency.

Let me remember how spin precession works. The magnetic moment mu interacts with the magnetic field, and the torque causes the spin to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The energy levels of the spin in a magnetic field are quantized, right? The Zeeman effect.

Wait, but in this case, the magnetic field changes direction. Initially, the particle is in a state aligned with the magnetic field, so maybe it's in the eigenstate of S_z.

Wait, the initial state. Before the field is turned off, the field is along +Z. So the particle's spin is aligned with the field. So the state is |+z>, where S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, since for spin-1/2, S_z can be ± ħ/2. So mu_z is gamma * (ħ/2), assuming mu = gamma S_z.

When the magnetic field is turned off, the Hamiltonian changes. So initially, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu · B. But wait, the magnetic moment interacts with the field as H = -mu·B. Oh wait, but in the lab frame, the magnetic field is applied, so the Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S_z, because mu = gamma S_z.

Wait, let me think again. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the interaction energy is H = -mu · B. So H = -gamma S · B.

But when B is along +Z, H = -gamma B S_z. So the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies proportional to +gamma B and -gamma B.

But when the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian becomes zero. Then, another field is applied along +Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H' = -gamma B S_y. Because the magnetic field is now along Y.

Wait, no, wait. The initial mu is gamma S_z, so when the field is along Y, the interaction is H = -mu · B (B along Y), so H = -gamma B S_y. Because S_y is the component along Y.

Wait, but wait, the spin in the Y-direction is S_y. So the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian are the eigenstates of S_y, which are |+
