Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. Wait, I remember that quasars often show emission lines, like the Lyman-alpha line or something else. Oh wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm, but that's in the ultraviolet. But if the observed wavelength is longer, that implies redshift because the light has been stretched.

So if the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared, it's longer than the rest wavelength. Let me think about the rest frame. For example, if it's the Lyman-alpha emission line, rest wavelength 121 nm. If observed at 790 nm, then the redshift z would be (observed - emitted)/emitted. So (790 - 121)/121 = 669/121 ≈ 5.528. So z≈5.5. But wait, there are other emission lines too, like the Balmer series in optical. Oh wait, the Balmer-alpha line is H-alpha at 656 nm in the rest frame. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then z is (790-656)/656 ≈ 134/656 ≈ 0.204. Hmm, but that's a lower redshift. So which one is it?

Wait, the question says the peak is at 790 nm and that the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths. So maybe it's the Lyman limit or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Lyman series emission. Wait, but the Lyman-alpha line is 121 nm. If the quasar's emission in that line is observed at 790 nm, that would be a redshift of z = (790 - 121)/121 ≈ 5.5. But if the peak is in the near infrared, maybe the redshift is high.

Wait, but if the quasar's peak is in the near infrared, it could have a high redshift. So let's say that the emission line at 790 nm is from a rest frame line. Which rest line would
