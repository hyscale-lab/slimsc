Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down. 

The question involves two reactions, and then analyzing the products. The chemist uses TLC to monitor them, and after they're done, the products from both are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. We need to find out how many peaks appear in each, which depends on the structures of the products and whether they are chiral or not.

Let me first tackle each reaction separately.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the starting material is a ketone at position 3. The structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, the numbering. Wait, hexan-3-one means the ketone is on C3. So structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let's get this right. Hexan-3-one is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait, hexane is six carbons. Hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-CHO-C-CH2-CH3? Maybe I should write it as:

1 2 3 4 5 6

So, the ketone is at C3: so positions are 1, 2, 3 (C=O), 4,5,6.

So structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's 3-pentanone. Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one would have the ketone on
