Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. Hmm, let me read it again.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Oh wait, so it's in two dimensions, right? And I need to find the energy levels. The options are all expressions involving n_x and n_y, which I think are quantum numbers.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, especially central potentials, we often use polar coordinates because of the symmetry. But wait, this potential doesn't look like a typical central potential because it has a cos²θ term. Oh, that means there's an angular dependence in the potential. So the potential is actually dependent on the angle θ, which suggests that the problem doesn't have full rotational symmetry around the origin. Hmm, but maybe it's symmetric in some way.

Wait, cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Remember, cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So the potential becomes V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr²*(1 + cos 2θ)/2. Let me compute that.

Wait, 3/2 times (1/2) is 3/4. So V(r,θ) becomes (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos 2θ. Wait, combining the terms without cos: (1/2 + 3/4) kr² = (5/4)kr². So V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos 2θ. Hmm, maybe that's a better way to write it.

Wait, but how does this potential affect the system? I think it might be separable into radial and angular parts. Let me think about the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian for a particle in 2D polar coordinates is H = (-ħ²/(2m)) (∇²) + V(r,θ). The Laplacian in 2D polar coordinates is (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) ) + (1
