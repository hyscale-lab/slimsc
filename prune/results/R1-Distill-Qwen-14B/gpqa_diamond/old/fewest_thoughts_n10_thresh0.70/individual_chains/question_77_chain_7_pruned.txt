Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two reactions: one using BuLi and then H+, and another involving heat, which is probably a Cope rearrangement. Hmm.

So let's break it down. The first reaction is with (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. I think that's a benzene ring with a substituent, which is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl group. Wait, maybe I should draw that structure. So the benzene has a methylene group (CH2) attached. That CH2 is connected to an oxygen (O), which is connected to another group. The other group is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. Let me see: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- attached at the first carbon. So the group is CH2=CHCH2CH3 but wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl, so the structure is OCH2-(but-2-en-1-yl with a methyl on C3). Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me write it correctly.

But-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but correct structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait that's but-1-en-3-yl? Maybe I should clarify. The structure of but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- attached at the first carbon. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, wait. Let's think again: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2- but that

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about two different reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B from each. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different products for A and B.

First, I'll look at the first reaction. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene, and the reagents are BuLi followed by H+. So I need to figure out what happens in this scenario.

I remember that BuLi is a strong base, usually used as a deprotonating agent, especially for compounds with acidic hydrogens. The structure given has an ether linkage: the benzene ring is connected to an oxygen, which is attached to a methyl group and a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, let me draw that out.

The structure is (Ph-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2?), no, wait. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the 1-yl would be the end with the double bond. So the substituent is CH2-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, maybe I should think again. The structure is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl benzene. So the benzene has a substituent which is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me clarify:

The group is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl, which is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at position 2 and a methyl at position 3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but it's connected as the 1-yl group, meaning the substituent's attachment point is the first carbon. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- but with a double bond. Wait, no, but 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH
