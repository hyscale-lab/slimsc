Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I don't think the masses are directly relevant here since the question is about elemental abundances using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width, a method used to determine the abundance of elements in stellar spectra.

The given data are the elemental abundances. For Star_1, the [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. 

Wait, what's the scale for these abundance ratios? Oh right, the [X/Y] notation represents the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_Sun. If it's positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun; if negative, less.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, we're looking for [Si/Star_2]_1 or something? Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is (n_Si in Star_1) / (n_Si in Star_2). So how do we find each star's silicon abundance?

Wait, but the problem gives [Si/Fe] for Star_1 and [Mg/Si] for Star_2. Hmm. Let me think.

First, let's parse all the data given.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that of the Sun.

And [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe/n_H)_Sun. So if it's zero, Star_1
