Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't permitted. Hmm... Let's try to break this down step by step.

So the question is about a system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The problem involves Pauli statistics and conservation laws, so I need to think about angular momentum, spin, and parity.

First, let me recall what the given information means. The initial state is 1S0. The notation is (2S+1)L(J), right? So for 1S0, that would be 2(0)+1=1, so S=0. L is the orbital angular momentum, which is 0 because it's S (spherically symmetric), and J is 0. So the initial state has total spin S=0, orbital L=0, and total angular momentum J=0.

Now, when they emit particle X, the final state of the NN system must satisfy certain quantum number conditions. The problem states that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, what's T? Oh, right, T is the isospin. Since the initial state is 1S0, which I think is a singlet state, so T=0. But the problem says the final NN state has T=0 as well. So T(NN) is 0.

So according to the condition: T= S + L +1 mod 2. Since T is 0, this equation becomes 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. So 0 ≡ S + L +1 (mod 2). Which implies that S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So their sum must be odd.

But wait, the final NN state's S and L—their sum has to be odd. So the total spin S and orbital angular momentum L of the NN system must add to an odd number.

Wait, but wait: in the problem statement, it's written as T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So it's S + L +1 mod 2 equals T. So when T is zero, S + L must equal 1 mod 2.

So S + L must be odd.

Now, the particle X is emitted. Let me think about the angular momentum. The initial system has L=0, so when it emits X, which has angular momentum l, then the orbital part of the NN system (let's denote it as L') must satisfy angular momentum conservation.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial =0. The emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l (the lower case letter in the options, like S, P, D, F correspond to l=0,1,2,3). So the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission is L_NN = l, because angular momentum is conserved. Or wait, not exactly, because when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum is carried away by X. So the change
