Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method looks at the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star move. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both are in circular orbits. The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for #2. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. So the shift in wavelength is proportional to the star's velocity caused by the planet. The formula for Doppler shift is something like delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, right? But maybe I don't need to get into that because the shifts are given in the same units and same spectral line, so the ratio of shifts would be the same as the ratio of velocities.

So the velocity amplitude (K) of the star due to the planet is what we're looking at. Since the two stars have the same mass, and both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), I think the K velocities would be proportional to the planet's mass and the inverse of the star's mass. But wait, both stars have the same mass, so the K for each would depend on the planet's mass, which is the same for both. Hmm, wait no, the problem says both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so same mass. So the K velocities would be the same? But the shifts are different. That can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The RV method measures the star's velocity. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p^3 sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 - eÂ²)) ) * ( (1 day) / (P * (1 + M_p/M_* )) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's not the exact formula. I think a simpler approach is needed. The
