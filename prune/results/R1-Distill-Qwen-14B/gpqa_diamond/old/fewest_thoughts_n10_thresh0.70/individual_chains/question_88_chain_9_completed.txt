Okay, so I've got this question about immunology, I think. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about an experiment involving rotavirus tagged with GFP. They gave the mice oral gavage, so that's delivering something into the stomach, probably. When they did in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Then they found fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated proliferating cells. They sequenced the variable heavy chain gene and saw high variability. The question is asking which process is happening.

Hmm, I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? They're specialized for sampling antigens in the gut. Rotavirus is a virus that infects the gut, so this makes sense.

The GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins probably act as antigens. When these antigens are taken up by the Peyer patches, the immune cells there process them. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests that something is causing the diversity in the antibodies produced.

So, the process that leads to high variability in the variable regions of antibodies is likely some kind of diversification. Somatic hypermutation comes to mind. I think that's the process where B cells introduce mutations into their immunoglobulin genes, especially during the germinal center reactions. This increases the diversity of antibodies so they can better recognize pathogens.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me think.

Option B is complement activation. Complement is involved in targeting pathogens for destruction, but I don't see how that would lead to variability in the heavy chain genes. It's more about marking the pathogen for destruction via opsonization or creating inflammation.

Option C is class switching recombination. That's when the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) changes. It doesn't change the variable regions, just the class. So the variable heavy chain sequence wouldn't have high variability because of class switching.

Option D is VDJ recombination, which is the process during B cell development in the bone marrow. It's how the variable, diversity, and joining regions are combined to create the initial diversity of the B cell receptor. But once the B cell is mature and activated, somatic hypermutation adds more diversity beyond what VDJ provided, especially in the variable regions.

In the question, the variable gene shows high variability, which suggests that something beyond the initial VDJ recombination is happening. Because VDJ is already done by the time the B cell leaves the bone marrow, but during an immune response, especially in the germinal centers, B cells undergo somatic hypermutation. This process introduces point mutations, increasing the diversity of the antibodies.

So the high variability in the variable heavy chain must be due to somatic hypermutation. That would be option A.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence imaging reveals that some GFP is destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), are identified, and proliferating cells within these patches are isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene of these cells shows high variability.

Peyer patches are specialized for antigen sampling in the gut, and the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene suggests a process that increases antibody diversity. Somatic hypermutation is the process by which B cells introduce mutations into their immunoglobulin genes during germinal center reactions, leading to increased diversity in the variable regions of antibodies. This aligns with the observed variability in the experiment.

Other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **Complement activation (B):** This process marks pathogens for destruction but does not directly increase variability in antibody variable regions.
- **Class switching recombination (C):** This changes the class of antibody (e.g., IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable heavy chain sequence.
- **VDJ recombination (D):** This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes initial diversity but does not account for the additional variability observed in this experiment.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is best explained by somatic hypermutation, which occurs during the immune response in germinal centers.

Answer: A
