Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. N is the normalization constant, which makes sense because the state should be normalized. The normalization N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)).

The non-Gaussianity measure here uses relative entropy. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait a second, relative entropy is usually a measure of how different two states are. But when calculating non-Gaussianity, I remember that sometimes people subtract the relative entropy between the state and the most Gaussian state, which would be a Gaussian state closest to it. Oh, right, because Gaussian states are the "simplest" in some sense, so the non-Gaussianity is how much the state differs from the best Gaussian approximation.

But in this problem, it's given that tau is the Gaussian state's density matrix. So, maybe the relative entropy here is being used as a measure of how non-Gaussian rho is relative to tau. Alternatively, perhaps tau is the completely mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not entirely certain.

The task is to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

Wait, but when I look at phi = -pi/4, let's compute sin(2phi). 2*(-pi/4) is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So, sin(2phi) = -1.

Let me compute N first. N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha^2)). Alpha is 0.5, so 2 alpha squared is 2*(0.25)=0.5. exp(-0.5) is about 0.6065. So, sin(2phi) is -1, so 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Then N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is [cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>]/N. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the state becomes [0.7071|0.5> - 0.7071| -0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Wait, but |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states. So the state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions can be highly non-Gaussian, especially when the superposition is symmetric. This is the Schrödinger cat state, which is a classic example of a non-Gaussian state.

But to compute the relative entropy, I need rho and tau. Rho is the density matrix of |psi>, which is a pure state, so rho is |psi><psi|. Tau is the reference Gaussian density matrix. Hmm, but which Gaussian state is tau? Because the reference could vary; it's not just any Gaussian, but perhaps the closest Gaussian to the state in question.

Wait, but the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (nG) is often defined as the relative entropy between the state rho and the best approximating Gaussian state tau. So to compute del_b, I need to find tau such that it's the Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy with rho. But wait, the problem gives me tau as the reference Gaussian, so maybe I don't have to compute tau; it's given as part of the formula.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that "tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state". So I don't get to choose tau; it's given. But wait, no, in the problem statement, the formula is given, but tau is any reference Gaussian. So perhaps the question is using a specific tau, perhaps the Gaussian state that is the closest to the given state.

Alternatively, perhaps tau is the thermal Gaussian state,
