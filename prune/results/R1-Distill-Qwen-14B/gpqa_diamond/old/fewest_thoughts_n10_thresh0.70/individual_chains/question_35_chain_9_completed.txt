Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that angular momentum operators have certain properties, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a big role in that.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, which is denoted as A_y. The matrix representation of A_y is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

Wait, I think S is similar to the Pauli matrices. Oh right! The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me recall their forms. Oh yeah, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S must be σ_y. So, A_y = c * σ_y.

Since c is h/(4π), let's compute it. Wait, but I might not need the exact numerical value yet. Let's think about the eigenvalues of A_y. 

The operator A_y is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix multiplied by a constant can be found by finding the eigenvalues of σ_y first. Since σ_y has eigenvalues ±i, when we multiply by c, the eigenvalues of A_y become c*(±i). So substituting c= h/(4π), the eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * i and -(h/(4π)) * i.

Wait, but that would make the eigenvalues purely imaginary. So the real parts would be zero, and the imaginary parts would be ±h/(4π) times i. Wait, but the question is about the statements given in the options. Let me check the options.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, no, that doesn't align. Because our calculation shows the eigenvalues are purely imaginary (since σ_y has eigenvalues i and -i). So the real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are ±(h/(4π)).

Wait, but none of the options mention real parts being zero. Let me look again at the options.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that might not fit either, unless maybe I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-express the setup.

The operator A_y is given by c multiplied by S, which is σ_y. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±i. So when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues become (h/(4π)) * i and -(h/(4π)) * i.

So the eigenvalues are pure imaginary numbers, right? So, the real part is zero, and the imaginary part is ±h/(4π).

Looking at the options, none of A or B match that. Because option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which is way bigger. Option B's imaginary parts are 1/2, which doesn't fit unless h is something. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of h-bar, but the problem states c as h/(4π). Wait, perhaps I'm confusing Planck's constant.

Wait, the intrinsic angular momentum for a muon would be for spin-1/2 particles. So the spin angular momentum S is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. But wait, wait, the problem says A is the Y-component, so Ay = c * S. But S is a 2x2 matrix. Hmm, maybe S is the spin operator? Wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, their eigenvalues are ±ħ/2.

Wait, maybe I should think about the operator A_y in terms of the spin angular momentum. The spin component S_y would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But the problem's operator is A_y = c * S, where S is σ_y. So perhaps in this case, A_y's eigenvalues would be c * (±1), since σ_y's eigenvalues are ±i. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, σ_y's eigenvalues are i and -i. So when multiplied by c, it's c*(i) and c*(-i). So the eigenvalues are ±i * (h/(4π)).

Wait, but the eigenvalues of A would be purely imaginary numbers. So their real parts would be zero, and the imaginary parts would be ± h/(4π). So looking back at the options, none of the options say that. Let me read the options again.

Option A: Im parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because in our case, the real parts are zero.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, perhaps if h is taken as h-bar? Wait, no, in the problem, c is h/(4π), which is ħ/2, since ħ = h/(2π). So c = (h/(2π))/2 = ħ/2. So c is ħ/2.

Wait, σ_y has eigenvalues ±i, so A_y = c * σ_y. So eigenvalues are c*(±i), which is (ħ/2)*(±i) = ± i ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, with real part zero and imaginary parts ± ħ/(2) times i.

Wait, but the question's options don't have any real parts except options B, which mentions real parts. So perhaps option B is not correct because its real parts are non-zero. So maybe the correct eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

Wait, but the options don't directly address this. So perhaps this line of thought is leading me to consider options C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Hmm. Let's think about angular momentum algebra. In quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of L_x can be eigenfunctions of L^2, because L^2 commutes with L_x. Similarly, L^2 commutes with all components. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it's also an eigenfunction of A^2. But what about Az? Well, [Ay, Az] = iħ A something? Wait, angular momentum components don't commute. So if a function is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's not necessarily an eigenfunction of Az. So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Which makes sense, because A^2 commutes with Ay, but Az doesn't. So option C could be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, the basis functions are typically the eigenvectors. Any matrix's eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so I think that's correct. But wait, the statement is not entirely clear. Wait, the basis functions of the operator are the eigenvectors. So any operator's eigenvectors form a basis. So option D is correct? Or perhaps not, because while the eigenvectors form a basis, not all basis functions are necessarily eigenvectors unless the operator is diagonal in that basis.

Wait, Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and it's diagonalizable because it's a Pauli matrix multiplied by a constant. So its eigenvectors form a complete basis. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions of the operator. So option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So that would be correct. But wait, if the operator is diagonal in its eigenbasis, then yes, the eigenvectors form the basis.

Hmm. So between C and D, I'm a bit uncertain.

Wait, the question is about the statements made during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So which statement is correct.

Let me think again about option C. If φ is an eigenstate of Ay, can it also be an eigenstate of A^2 and not of Az? Well, A^2 is the square of the angular momentum operator. Since [Ay, A^2] = 0, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A^2. But Az and Ay don't commute, so eigenstates of Ay aren't eigenstates of Az. So option C is correct.

So looking at the options, the correct statement would be C or D.

Wait, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. If the operator is represented in its eigenbasis, then yes. But the matrix given in the problem isn't necessarily in its eigenbasis. Wait, the matrix S is σ_y, which is in the standard basis. So the eigenvectors of Ay are not the standard basis vectors, but another set. So the eigenvectors would form an orthonormal basis for the space, but perhaps the given matrix isn't in that basis. So option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which I think is correct. Because any operator's eigenfunctions (if they form a basis) can serve as the basis for the operator.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Let me reevaluate the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. As I reasoned before, this is correct because A^2 and Ay commute, but Az and Ay don't.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's correct because any set of eigenvectors for a Hermitian operator forms an orthonormal basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator's matrix.

Wait, but option C's first part is correct, so perhaps option C is a correct statement.

Now, looking back at the options, option C is correct. So which is the right answer.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors explicitly.

A_y is (h/(4π)) times the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute the eigenvalues.

The matrix A_y = c * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix is:

[ (h/(4π)) * (0 - λ) , (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*(i)       , (h/(4π)) * (0 - λ) ]

The determinant is:

[ (-λ c) * (-λ c) ) - ( (-i c) * (i c) ) ] = 0.

So:

(λ^2 c^2) - ( (-i)(i) c^2 ) = 0.

Simplify: (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So the equation becomes λ^2 c^2 - (1) c^2 = 0 → c^2 (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

Since c is not zero (h is non-zero), λ^2 =1 → λ = ±1.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, no, I think I messed up the determinant calculation. Let's recompute.

The matrix A_y is:

Row 1: 0, -i c
Row 2: i c, 0

So the eigenvalues are found by solving det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

Which is:

| -λ     -i c     |
| i c     -λ      |

Determinant: λ^2 - ( (-i c)(i c) ) = λ^2 - ( (-i^2) c^2 ) → since i^2 = -1, so (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c^2 = ( (-i^2) ) c^2 = (1) c^2.

So determinant: λ^2 - c^2 = 0 → λ^2 = c^2 → λ = ±c.

Ah, yes, that's correct. So the eigenvalues are ±c, which are real numbers, not imaginary. So earlier conclusion was wrong because I thought S had eigenvalues i and -i, but that's not the case when multiplied by a scalar.

Wait, that's a crucial mistake I made. So the eigenvalues of A_y are ±c, which are real. So c is h/(4π), so eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

Wait, that would make the eigenvalues real, not imaginary. So looking back at the options, which one aligns with this.

Option A: Im parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because we have real eigenvalues.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, but let's calculate c.

c = h/(4π). So if h is Planck's constant, then c is a small value, but perhaps in terms of h-bar (ħ = h/(2π)), c = ħ/(2). So c = ħ/2, which is a common value for spin-½ particles, since spin components have eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait, so the eigenvalues would be ±ħ/2. So, the real parts are ±ħ/2, and the imaginary parts are zero.

So looking at the options, none of the options directly say that except perhaps option B, which says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, and real parts ±1. But that would only be correct if ħ is assumed to be 1. So maybe the problem uses units where ħ=1. So c becomes (1/2), making the eigenvalues ±1/2. So in that case, the eigenvalues have real parts ±1/2 and imaginary parts zero. But the options don't mention zero imaginary parts.

Wait, looking back at the options again, none of the options directly state that. Let me read the options again.

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). That would be if eigenvalues are complex, but they are real. So this is incorrect.

Option B: The imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, if ħ=1, and c=1/2, then eigenvalues are ±1/2, which are real. So the real parts are ±1/2, and the imaginary parts are zero. But option B says the real parts are ±1, which is double that. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the eigenvalues. Let's compute the determinant again.

The matrix A_y is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]].

The characteristic equation is det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

So,

| -λ      -i c |
| i c      -λ |

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) c² )

But (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is λ² - (1 * c²) = 0 → λ² = c² → λ = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are ±c, which are real numbers. So their imaginary parts are zero.

So looking at the options again, none of the options directly mention that. So perhaps the right statement is about the eigenfunctions.

Option C: Eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As earlier, A² commutes with Ay, so eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But they are not eigenfunctions of Az because [Ay, Az] is non-zero.

So option C is correct.

Another thought: for spin-½ particles, the eigenstates of S_x are not eigenstates of S_z, which aligns with option C.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, this is true. So option D is also correct. But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the question says, which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation.

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, which one is among the provided choices.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct eigenvalues are real and have values ±h/(4π), which would have zero imaginary parts. Then, looking at the options, none of the A or B options fit that. So the correct statements must be C or D.

In the given options, option C seems correct. So the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix. The operator is given by \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_y \) matrix, which has eigenvalues \( \pm i \). When multiplied by \( c \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) become \( \pm c \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real numbers: \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). The imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are zero.

2. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real, not complex, and their imaginary parts are zero.
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and their imaginary parts are zero.
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While it is true that eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, the statement is less precise. The eigenfunctions are not necessarily the "basis functions" of the operator unless the operator is diagonal in that basis. Thus, this option is less accurate than Option C.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real: \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), with zero imaginary parts.
   - Option C is the most accurate statement, as it correctly describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
