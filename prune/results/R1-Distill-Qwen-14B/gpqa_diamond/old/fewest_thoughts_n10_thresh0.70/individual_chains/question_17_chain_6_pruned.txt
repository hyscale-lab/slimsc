Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've also given me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C.

Hmm, okay, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the formation constant (K) is given. The formation constant tells us how much the metal ion and EDTA will form the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So, if the Ca-EDTA complex is present, does that mean some of the calcium is tied up in the complex, and the free calcium concentration is what we need to find?

Oh right, when you have a complex ion like Ca-EDTA, the calcium is not free in the solution. The formation of the complex reduces the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. So the free Ca²+ concentration is what we're looking for.

The formula for the formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, I think I might have the exact expression wrong. Let me think. The formation constant (Kf) is defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

And the Kf expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But in this scenario, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, is the EDTA present as the free ion, or is it all complexed? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex
