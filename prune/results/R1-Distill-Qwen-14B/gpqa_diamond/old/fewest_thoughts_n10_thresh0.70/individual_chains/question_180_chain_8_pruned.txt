Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, so the question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And they have negligible mass, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy contributions or anything else except the electric potential energy.

So the setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. Oh, so point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system.

Wait, wait. The question is about the minimum energy. So I think I need to calculate the electric potential energy of this configuration. Because the system is isolated, so energy is conserved, and the minimum energy would be the potential energy when the charges are arranged in the way that gives the lowest possible energy, which is the configuration they're in now, right?

Wait, but let's think. The potential energy is related to the arrangement of the charges. Since the system is isolated, the charges can't move relative to each other because 12 are constrained. So maybe the energy is fixed in this setup. But the question is about the minimum energy, so perhaps I need to
