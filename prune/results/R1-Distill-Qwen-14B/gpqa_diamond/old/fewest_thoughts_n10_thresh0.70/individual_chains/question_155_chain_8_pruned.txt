Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue, and we're given the explicit form of the state as a column vector.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty of an observable is calculated using the standard deviation formula. So ΔP_z is the square root of the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z. That is, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, but first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for the given state. Oh, but wait, the state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, which should make things easier.

Wait, let me think again. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Since the basis is that of P_z's eigenstates, each component of this vector corresponds to the amplitude in each eigenstate of P_z.

Wait, what are the eigenvalues of P_z? Looking at the matrix given for P_z, the diagonal entries are hbar, 0, and -hbar. So the eigenvalues are hbar, 0, -hbar.

So the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z, each multiplied by their respective coefficients. The state vector's components are the coefficients in the eigenbasis of P_z. So the first component is -1/2, the second is 1/sqrt(2), and the third is -1/2.

So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I think it's the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, with weights being the square of the amplitudes.

Wait, no, more precisely, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of |c_i|^2
