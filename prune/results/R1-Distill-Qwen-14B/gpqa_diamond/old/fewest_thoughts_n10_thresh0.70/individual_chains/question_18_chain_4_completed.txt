Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the elemental abundances in two stars. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I guess the mass might not directly affect the problem here. The problem is about their elemental abundances as determined by the Equivalent Width (EW) method, which I remember is a technique used to measure the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere based on the strength of spectral lines.

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, the notation [X/Y] means the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or another way: [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the notation is [X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X/n_H)_sun. So the Sun's value is the one given. Right.

Wait, the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms (n_Si) in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So n_Si_1 / n_Si_2.

Let me break this down.

First, let's find [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) - log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) = 0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(n_Fe_1 / n_H_1) - log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) =0 → n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Wait, and for the Sun, n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5), because log(nFe/nH) = -4.5, so 10^-4.5.

So for Star_1, n_Fe_1 = (n_H_1) * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) = n_H_1 * 1e-4.5.

Similarly, to find [Si/Fe]_1, which is 0.3. So log(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

Wait, let me think again. The general formula is [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) - log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) =0.3.

Thus, log(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

I need to find n_Si_1 in terms of n_H_1.

Wait, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0. So n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun → n_Fe_1 = (n_H_1) * (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) = n_H_1 * 1e-4.5.

Similarly, for the Sun, n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun = ?

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) - log(same) =0? No, wait, actually, the [X/Y] for the Sun would be 0. So [Si/Fe]_sun = 0. So [Si/Fe]_1 being 0.3 means Star_1 has higher Si relative to Fe than the Sun.

Wait, but I don't have the [Si/Fe]_sun value. Oh, but the Sun's [X/Y] is zero by definition for log ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should first express n_Si_1 and n_Si_2 in terms of H and then compute their ratio.

Let me start with Star_1.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

So n_Fe_1 = n_H_1 * 1e-4.5.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si_1/n_Fe_1) - [Si/Fe]_sun.

But [Si/Fe]_sun is 0, so:

log(n_Si_1 /n_Fe_1) =0.3 → n_Si_1 = n_Fe_1 * 10^0.3.

But n_Fe_1 = n_H_1 * 1e-4.5, so:

n_Si_1 = (n_H_1 * 1e-4.5) * 10^0.3.

Hmm, 10^0.3 is approximately 2, since 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So about 2 * 1e-4.5 → 2e-4.5. But let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 10^0.3 = about 2. So 1e-4.5 * 2 ≈ 2e-4.5. But let's keep it as 10^0.3 for now.

So n_Si_1 = n_H_1 * 1e-4.5 * 10^0.3.

Now, let me work on Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(n_Mg_2 /n_H_2) = log(n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) → n_Mg_2 =n_H_2 * (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun).

For the Sun, n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun =1e-5, as given.

So n_Mg_2 = n_H_2 * 1e-5.

Now, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. So [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg_2 /n_Si_2) - log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) =0.3.

Thus, log(n_Mg_2 /n_Si_2) = 0.3 + log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun).

Hmm, but wait, I don't have the Sun's [Mg/Si] value. Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] would be [Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun - log(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun =0. So the Sun's [Mg/Si] is 0.

So [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(n_Mg_2 /n_Si_2)=0.3.

So n_Mg_2 = n_Si_2 * 10^0.3.

But we have n_Mg_2 = n_H_2 *1e-5.

So, putting together:

n_Si_2 = n_Mg_2 /10^0.3 = (n_H_2 * 1e-5) / 10^0.3.

So n_Si_2 = n_H_2 * 1e-5 / (10^0.3).

Now, I need to find the ratio n_Si_1 /n_Si_2.

n_Si_1 = n_H_1 * 1e-4.5 *10^0.3.

n_Si_2= n_H_2 *1e-5 /10^0.3.

So ratio: (n_H_1 /n_H_2) * (1e-4.5 *10^0.3) / (1e-5 /10^0.3) )

Simplify the numbers:

Let me compute the constants.

First, 1e-4.5 is 3.16e-5. Wait, 10^-4.5 is 3.1623e-5.

10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So 1e-4.5 *10^0.3 = 3.1623e-5 *2 ≈6.3246e-5.

Denominator: 1e-5 /10^0.3 ≈ (1e-5)/2 =5e-6.

So the constants part is (6.3246e-5) / (5e-6) )= (6.3246/5) * (1e-5 /1e-6 )= (1.2649) *10 =12.649.

So the ratio is 12.649 * (n_H_1 /n_H_2).

Wait, but what is n_H_1 /n_H_2? Hmm, the total number of hydrogen atoms depends on the star's overall metallicity and other factors. But wait, in stellar atmospheres, the hydrogen abundance is often taken as a reference. But wait, in the problem, each star's H is being used as a reference. So the number of H atoms (n_H) in each star is not given. But perhaps the ratio cancels out? Or maybe we need to find the ratio in terms of H.

Wait, but wait, the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So it's n_Si_1 /n_Si_2.

But in the expressions I have, n_Si_1 and n_Si_2 are both expressed in terms of n_H_1 and n_H_2. But without knowing the ratio of n_H_1 to n_H_2, I can't find the ratio of silicon atoms. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake because I'm missing something about the problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try another approach.

Wait, another way: Let's express the ratio (n_Si_1 /n_Si_2) in terms of the given data.

We have:

n_Si_1 = n_Fe_1 * 10^0.3.

But n_Fe_1 = (n_H_1) * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2:

n_Si_2 = n_Mg_2 /10^0.3.

n_Mg_2 = n_H_2 * (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun).

So putting it all together:

n_Si_1 = n_H_1 * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *10^0.3.

n_Si_2 = (n_H_2 * (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun)) /10^0.3.

So the ratio is:

(n_Si_1)/(n_Si_2) = [n_H_1 * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *10^0.3 ] / [ (n_H_2 * (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun)) /10^0.3 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [n_H_1 / n_H_2 ] * [n_Fe_sun /n_Mg_sun] * [10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ]

Wait, the [n_Fe_sun /n_Mg_sun] : since n_Fe_sun = 1e-4.5 *n_H_sun, and n_Mg_sun=1e-5 *n_H_sun.

So n_Fe_sun /n_Mg_sun = (1e-4.5 / 1e-5) )= 1e0.5 ≈ 3.162.

So [n_Fe_sun /n_Mg_sun] = 1e0.5.

So putting it all together:

Ratio = (n_H_1/n_H_2) * (1e0.5) * (10^0.6 )

Because 10^0.3 *10^0.3 =10^0.6.

10^0.6 is about 3.98, approximately 4.

So 1e0.5 is about 3.162.

So 3.162 *3.98 ≈12.57.

So ratio becomes (n_H_1 /n_H_2) * 12.57.

Wait, but I still have this (n_H_1/n_H_2) factor. How do I find that?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] values.

Wait, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so Fe abundance relative to H is solar. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

Wait, but what about the total H in each star? In the Sun, n_H is a certain value, but in the stars, how is it determined? Well, in stellar atmospheres, the H abundance is often taken as a reference, sometimes normalized so that the total hydrogen is a certain value. But perhaps in this problem, the H abundance in each star is the same as the Sun's, but that's probably not necessarily the case.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the ratio of H atoms is equal to the ratio of their total number of atoms, but I think that's not directly given. Wait, but for a star, the total number of atoms depends on its composition, but perhaps since the problem doesn't give more info, maybe the H abundance is the same in both stars? But that's not correct, as the stars have different abundances.

Wait, another thought: Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, the Fe abundance is solar. So for Star_1, n_Fe_1 = (n_H_1) * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) = n_H_1 * 1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg_2 = n_H_2 *1e-5.

But I don't see a direct way to relate n_H_1 and n_H_2. Hmm. Maybe the total number of hydrogen atoms in each star isn't needed because the ratio might cancel out somehow. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of silicon in each star relative to hydrogen, and then take the ratio of those.

Wait, let's compute n_Si_1 /n_H_1 and n_Si_2 /n_H_2, then take their ratio.

For Star_1:

n_Si_1 = n_Fe_1 *10^0.3 = (n_H_1 *1e-4.5) *10^0.3 → n_Si_1 =n_H_1 *1e-4.5 *10^0.3.

So (n_Si_1 /n_H_1) =1e-4.5 *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

n_Si_2 = (n_Mg_2 )/10^0.3 = (n_H_2 *1e-5 )/10^0.3 → (n_Si_2 /n_H_2 )= 1e-5 /10^0.3.

So the ratio (n_Si_1/n_Si_2) = [ (n_Si_1/n_H_1) / (n_Si_2/n_H_2) ] * (n_H_2 /n_H_1 )

Wait, that's getting more complicated.

Alternatively, the ratio (n_Si_1/n_Si_2) = [ (n_Si_1/n_H_1) / (n_Si_2/n_H_2) ] * (n_H_1 /n_H_2) )

Wait, because:

n_Si_1/n_Si_2 = (n_Si_1 /n_H_1 ) * (n_H_1) ) / ( (n_Si_2 /n_H_2 ) * (n_H_2) )) )

Which simplifies to ( (n_Si_1/n_H_1) / (n_Si_2/n_H_2) ) * (n_H_1 /n_H_2 )

Hmm, but that's the same as I had before. So unless I can find (n_H_1/n_H_2 ), I can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that both stars have the same H abundance as the Sun. That would be n_H_1 =n_H_sun, n_H_2 =n_H_sun. So (n_H_1/n_H_2 )=1.

But that's not necessarily correct because [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are given as 0, which means their abundances are the same as the Sun's relative to H. So H could be the same as the Sun's? Or maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the total H, since the ratio of Si in each star is relative to their own H. So if I compute n_Si_1/n_H_1 and n_Si_2/n_H_2, then their ratio would be (n_Si_1/n_H_1)/(n_Si_2/n_H_2) ) * (n_H_2 /n_H_1 ), but without knowing (n_H_2 /n_H_1 ), I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute the ratio of [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] to find the required ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the given data in terms of the Sun's abundances.

Wait, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si_1/n_Fe_1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But since [Si/Fe]_sun is 0, so log(n_Si_1/n_Fe_1)=0.3 → n_Si_1 =n_Fe_1 * 10^0.3.

And [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe_1 =n_Fe_sun*(n_H_1/n_H_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(n_Mg_2/n_Si_2)=0.3 → n_Mg_2 =n_Si_2 *10^0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg_2 =n_Mg_sun*(n_H_2/n_H_sun).

So n_Mg_2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2/n_H_sun).

But n_Mg_sun =1e-5 *n_H_sun.

So n_Mg_2 =1e-5 *n_H_2.

Putting it together:

n_Si_2 = n_Mg_2 /10^0.3 = (1e-5 n_H_2) / 10^0.3.

Similarly, n_Si_1 =n_Fe_1 *10^0.3 = (n_Fe_sun *n_H_1 /n_H_sun ) *10^0.3.

Now, the ratio n_Si_1/n_Si_2 is:

[ (n_Fe_sun *n_H_1 /n_H_sun ) *10^0.3 ] / [ (1e-5 *n_H_2) /10^0.3 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H_1 *10^0.3 ] * [10^0.3 / (1e-5 n_H_2) ) ]

= (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) * 1e5 * (10^0.3)^2 * (n_H_1 /n_H_2 )

Compute the constants:

n_Fe_sun =1e-4.5 *n_H_sun → so n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun=1e-4.5.

So substituting:

= (1e-4.5) * 1e5 * (10^0.6) * (n_H_1/n_H_2 )

Which is:

= (1e-4.5 +5 ) * 10^0.6 * (n_H_1/n_H_2 )

1e-4.5 +5 is 1e0.5, so:

= (1e0.5 ) * 10^0.6 * (n_H_1/n_H_2 )

1e0.5 is approx 3.162, and 10^0.6 is approx 3.98, so 3.162 *3.98 ≈12.57.

So the ratio becomes 12.57 * (n_H_1 /n_H_2 )

Wait, but without knowing (n_H_1/n_H_2 ), I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the total number of hydrogen atoms is the same in both stars. But that's not necessarily given. Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun, so n_H_1 =n_H_sun and n_H_2 =n_H_sun → their ratio is 1.

Wait, if that's the case, then n_Si_1/n_Si_2 ≈12.57.

Looking at the options, option B is ~12.6, which matches this.

But wait, let me double-check. I think I might have made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let me recompute the constants.

n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun =1e-4.5.

So, the constants part is:

(1e-4.5) * 1e5 * (10^0.6) = ?

1e-4.5 *1e5 =1e(5-4.5)=1e0.5= approx3.162.

Multiply by 10^0.6= approx3.98.

3.162 *3.98 ≈12.57.

So the ratio is 12.57 * (n_H_1/n_H_2).

If n_H_1 and n_H_2 are the same as the Sun, their ratio is 1, so the ratio of silicon atoms is 12.57, which is close to option B (~12.6).

So the answer should be option B.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition. The key steps are as follows:

### Step 1: Analyze Star_1
- **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: This implies that the Fe abundance relative to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Thus, \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \).
- **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: Using the definition of the abundance ratio:
  \[
  \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}}\right) = 0.3 + \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}\right).
  \]
  Since \([Si/Fe]_{\text{sun}} = 0\), this simplifies to:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}} = 10^{0.3}.
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot 10^{0.3}.
  \]

### Step 2: Analyze Star_2
- **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: This implies that the Mg abundance relative to H in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun. Thus, \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \).
- **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: Using the definition of the abundance ratio:
  \[
  \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}}\right) = 0.3 + \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}\right).
  \]
  Since \([Mg/Si]_{\text{sun}} = 0\), this simplifies to:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3}.
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot \frac{1}{10^{0.3}}.
  \]

### Step 3: Compute the Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe,sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot \frac{1}{10^{0.3}}}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} \cdot \left(10^{0.3}\right)^2.
\]

#### Step 4: Substitute Known Values
From the solar photospheric composition:
- \( n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-4.5} \),
- \( n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-5} \).

Thus:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}} = \frac{10^{-4.5}}{10^{-5}} = 10^{0.5}.
\]

Also, \( 10^{0.3} \approx 2 \), so \( \left(10^{0.3}\right)^2 \approx 4 \).

Substituting these values:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.5} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} \cdot 4.
\]

#### Step 5: Assume \( n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 1 \)
If we assume the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars (a reasonable assumption since the problem does not provide additional information), then:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.5} \cdot 4.
\]

Compute:
\[
10^{0.5} \approx 3.162, \quad 3.162 \cdot 4 \approx 12.65.
\]

### Final Answer
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.

**Answer: B**
