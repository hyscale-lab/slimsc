Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out what product 4 is after a series of reactions. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the reaction mechanisms, but I'll think it through.

First, the starting material is (R)-(+)-limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. It has a structure that's a bicyclic system with a double bond. Oh wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a specific configuration. The R configuration means it's the (+)-enantiomer, which I think is the one where the isopropyl group is on a certain side.

The first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen. So, that's hydrogenation. Since it's using Pd/C and hydrogen, it's probably a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The problem states that 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed, so it's adding H2 once. Limonene has a double bond, so hydrogenation would add hydrogen across the double bond, making it a single bond. So limonene, which is a bicyclic compound with a double bond, would become its hydrogenated form. Wait, limonene is bicyclic with a double bond in the ring. So after hydrogenation, the ring becomes fully saturated. So the major product 1 would be the hydrogenated limonene, which I think is called carvone or maybe another bicyclic alcohol? Wait, no, limonene is just a hydrocarbon. So hydrogenation would saturate the double bond. So limonene, which is a bicyclic monoterpene with a double bond, becomes a bicyclic monoterpene with a single bond.

Wait, limonene's structure is a bicyclic structure, something like menthane derivatives. Let me think: Limonene has the structure where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 of the cyclohexene ring. So when hydrogenated, that becomes a single bond, so the cyclohexane is fully saturated. So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene, which is called something else. Wait, limonene is (R)-(+)-, so the configuration would be retained in the hydrogenated product. So product 1 is the cyclohexane derivative with the same substituents as limonene but without the double bond
