Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, I should probably recall what Grubbs catalyst does. Grubbs is a type of transition metal catalyst used in olefin metathesis reactions. I remember that metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, when Grubbs is used, it typically induces olefin metathesis, which can result in ring-closing or ring-opening reactions, or maybe even cross metathesis if there's another alkene present.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. But since the molecule is symmetric in some way, maybe the enantiomers are identical upon certain reactions. Let me draw the structure to visualize.

3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pent-1-ene is five carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the parent chain is five carbons, double bond at position 1. So positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

So, structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene has five carbons in a row, double bond between C1 and C2. The substituent is at C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, wait, wait. Let me structure it correctly.

Wait, pentane has five carbons. For pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, that's 3-methyl if there's a methyl branch on C3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2
