Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, so the starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. I need to think about what reaction occurs when this reacts with hydrogen bromide (HBr). 

Wait, I remember that HBr is a typical reagent for acid-catalyzed bromination or maybe some addition reactions. The structure here has an ether group, right? The benzene ring attached to an oxygen which is connected to a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. So that substituent is an allyl-type group since there's a double bond.

Oh, right! When allylic ethers react with HBr, they can undergo a type of acid-catalyzed cleavage. I think this is similar to the pinacol rearrangement or maybe the acid-catalyzed addition to alkenes. Wait, or is it more like the dibromination of alkenes? No, wait, when HBr is present, it can add across double bonds, but in the presence of an ether, maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, another thought: the structure is an allyl ether. Allyl ethers can undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage. Let me think about the mechanism. So, in an allyl ether, the oxygen is connected to a CH2 group that's adjacent to a double bond. The structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, wait. The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-O-Ph-CH(CH2C(CH3)2)CH2? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

The substituent is: 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, but numbering starts from the end. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, but but has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH2? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think about but-3-en-1-yl. The
