Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction and the NMR data of the product.

So, the reaction involved is Compound X reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, what's that reagent? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a commonly used reagent in the epoxidation of alkenes. It's a base that helps in forming epoxides from alkenes, especially through the Prilezhaev oxidation, I think. So the reaction is probably epoxidizing a double bond in Compound X.

So the product is an epoxide. Let me think about the structure of the product. The NMR data is given for the product, so we can use that to figure out the structure of X.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet for 3H, so probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't cause splitting.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet, another methyl, maybe another group. Wait, but the molecular formula of X is C11H12O. Let me calculate the product's formula.

Epoxidation adds an oxygen, so Product would be C11H10O2 (since epoxide replaces a double bond, which is two H less, but adds an O and another two H? Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of starting material. Compound X has a double bond, which upon epoxidation becomes an epoxide. So the product would have one more oxygen than X. X is C11H12O, product would be C11H10O2? Let me check:

X: C11H12O → epoxidation: adds an O, so product is C11H10O2. Because when you form an epoxide from an alkene, you're replacing two H (from the double bond) with an O. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: an alkene has two less H than an alkane. So epoxidation replaces the double bond with an epoxide, which has two more oxygen but the same number of H? Hmm, no. Wait, an alkene is CH2=CH2, when epoxidized becomes CH2-O-CH2. So each CH2 becomes CH2-O-CH2, but actually, that's not accurate. Let me think again. For a simple ethylene molecule, C2H4, epoxidation gives C2H4O, which is ethylene oxide. Wait, no, ethylene oxide is C2H4O, but ethylene is C2H4. So, from ethylene to ethylene oxide, you add an O and no change in H. Because ethylene is C2H4, ethylene oxide is C2H4O. So for a general alkene, epoxidation would add an O without changing the number of H. So, X has formula C11H12O, product would be C11H12O + O → C11H12O2? Wait, no. Wait, X has formula C11H12O; if the product is from epoxidation, which adds an O, the product would be C11H12O2? Because X has one O, product adds another O. But wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. Epoxidation is the reaction where an alkene is converted to an epoxide. The general reaction is R2C=CR'2 → R2C-O-CR'2. So for each double bond, you add an O, and the number of H? Let me see: for ethylene (C2H4),
