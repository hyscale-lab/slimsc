Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that a supernova happens in our galaxy. Part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. We need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so we're dealing with two different reference frames here. The galaxy and the ejecta each consider themselves as rest (inertial frames). So this must be a problem involving special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction, because the speeds involved are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second because standard SI units might be easier. 60,000 km is 6e7 meters, so 6e4 km/s is 6e7 m/s. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 60,000 km is 6e4 * 1e3 meters = 6e7 meters. But the speed is 60,000 km/s, which is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. Wait, but the speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 6e7 is about 0.2 times the speed of light. So it's 20% the speed of light, which is a significant fraction but not super high. So relativistic effects may be noticeable but perhaps not extreme.

Wait, but the question says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the galaxy's frame of reference, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, right? Because in different frames, the relative speed is the same. Or is that not the case because of relativity? Hmm, no, wait. According to special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. So if frame S is the galaxy, and frame
