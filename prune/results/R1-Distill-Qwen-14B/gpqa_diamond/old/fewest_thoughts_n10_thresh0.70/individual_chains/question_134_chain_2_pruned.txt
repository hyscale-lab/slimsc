Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

So the question says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D, with different values.

I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The basic formula is H+ from acid reacting with OH- from base. But wait, since there are multiple acids and a base here, I need to figure out how they all react together.

Let me list out the substances:
- HCl is a strong acid and will dissociate completely, providing H+ ions.
- H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but since it's a diprotic acid, each molecule can donate two H+ ions. But wait, wait. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-?), no, wait, actually, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or is it H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- and then HSO4^- can donate another H+? Hmm, I think in dilute solutions, the first H+ is completely dissociated, but the second isn't. So each H2SO4 gives two H+ per molecule, right? Or wait, maybe in a strong acid like H2SO4, the first dissociation is complete, but the second is only partial. Wait, but for the purposes of neutralization, maybe we can assume that each H2SO4 provides two H+ ions. Or maybe not. Wait, no, wait. Wait, HCl is a strong acid and gives one H+ per molecule. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, the first H+ is completely released, but the second is only weakly. So, for dilute solutions, the second H+ is not fully dissociated. But in this problem, when calculating neutralization, maybe we
