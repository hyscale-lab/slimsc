Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the pion (Pi+) is at rest, and it decays into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV/c² and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's mass is probably negligible, like almost zero. So, considering that, how do I approach this?

Wait, when a particle at rest decays into two particles, their energies and momenta should be equal and opposite to conserve momentum. Since the pion was stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

But wait, neutrinos are leptons, so their rest mass is zero. So their energy should just be their momentum multiplied by c, right? Or wait, in particle physics, energies are often given in MeV, and masses in MeV/c². So momentum p in MeV/c. So for a neutrino, E = pc, but since we use units where c=1 in MeV and MeV/c², E = p. So the neutrino's energy is just its momentum.

So, the muon will have rest mass energy of 105.7 MeV. Its total energy would be gamma * m_mu * c², but again, in these units, it's gamma * m_mu. And its momentum is (gamma * m_mu * v)/c. Wait, but with c=1, it's gamma * m_mu * v. Alternatively, since for a muon, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So in units where c=1, E² = p² + m².

So, the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p_mu² + m_mu² ), and the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p_nu. But since the pion is at rest, the momenta are equal and opposite, so p_mu = p_nu in magnitude. Wait, but p_mu is in the opposite direction to p_nu? No, wait, since the pion is stationary, the
