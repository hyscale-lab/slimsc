Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a different reaction. The options are A, B, C, D, each with specific products. I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. Hmm, what kind of reaction is this? I remember that when you have a dienol or something with a conjugated diene, sigmatropic rearrangements can happen. Also, the question mentions that sigmatropic rearrangements are pericyclic, so maybe a [3,3] Cope or Claisen rearrangement is happening here.

Wait, wait, but looking at the starting materials. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine... that's like ethanamine where both hydrogens on the N are replaced with methoxy groups. So it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. But here, the substituents are on the nitrogen. So 1,1-dimethoxy would mean the amine is (CH3O)2NH. Wait no, ethan-1-amine is CH2NH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Actually, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have the structure: the amine is on carbon 1, and both hydrogens are replaced by methoxy groups. So the structure would be (CH3O)2CHNH2? No, wait, ethanamine is CH2CH3NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be OCH3 groups on the first carbon, which also has the amine. So structure is OCH3-OCH3-C-NH2? Wait, maybe it's CH2(OCH3)2NH2. But that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, maybe the molecule is
