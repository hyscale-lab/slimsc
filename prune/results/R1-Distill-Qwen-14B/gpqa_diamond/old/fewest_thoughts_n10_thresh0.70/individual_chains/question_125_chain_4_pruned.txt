Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that an isotropic potential means it's the same in all directions. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which I recognize as the harmonic oscillator potential. 

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. The options are A, B, C, D. I'll need to figure out both parts.

First, I think I should recall how the energy levels work for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. In three dimensions, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, which are non-negative integers. Oh wait, but wait a second—is that correct for 3D? Or is it in terms of the principal quantum number or something else? Oh, no, wait, for a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers.

Wait, I think the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers: n = nx + ny + nz. Wait, no, wait. Another approach: each direction contributes (nx + 1/2) ħω, so the total energy is the sum in each direction. So, the total energy would be (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. So E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as E = (N + 3/2) ħω, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z.

So the energy depends on the value of N, and each N corresponds to a certain energy level. The degeneracy (number of eigenfunctions with the same energy) for each N is (N+1)(N+2)/2, or wait—no, maybe it's (N+1)(N+2)/2? Or perhaps it's (N+1)(N+2)/2 for each N. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In three dimensions, each state is characterized by three quantum numbers: n_x, n_y, n_z. Each is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). The energy depends only on the sum N = n_x + n_y + n_z. For a given N, the number of states (eigenfunctions) is the number of ways to write N as the sum of three non-negative integers, which is given by the combination formula.

The formula for the degeneracy is (N+2 choose 2) = (N+2)(N+1)/2. So for each N, the number of states (eigenfunctions) is (N+2)(N+1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For example, when N=0,
