Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me read the question again.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing different exoplanets. I have to choose which one has the highest density. The options for answers are A to D, each corresponding to the options a to d.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I understand each part correctly. Each option a to d describes a planet's mass and other characteristics. So I'll need to calculate or compare their densities.

Starting with option a: It says an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known, right? Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So I guess that's the same as Earth, so option a would have a density of 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's given directly. So the density is already 5.5. So this seems similar to Earth's density. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Does the mass and radius affect the density? Because density is mass divided by volume. So if mass is 2 Earth masses, then unless the radius is different, the density would be higher. But the question says the density is approximately 5.5, same as Earth. Hmm, that suggests that the radius is larger? Because mass increases but radius increases more, so density decreases. Wait, no. Let me think. Wait, density is mass/volume. Volume depends on radius cubed. So if mass is 2x, but radius is, say, cube root(2) times Earth's radius, then the volume would be 2 times Earth's volume. Then density would be 2M / 2V = M/V, which is Earth's density. So that would make sense. So option b's density is 5.5 as given. So that's the same as Earth's. So option b is 5.5.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density, right? Because if it's made of the same materials, the average density would be the same. So, same density as Earth, which is 5.5.

Wait, but wait a second. If the planet is larger, but same composition, does the density stay the same? Because for Earth, the density is an average. If you have a larger planet with same composition, the density might be the same. But wait, for example, if it's a larger planet, the core might be proportionally smaller, but perhaps for the same composition, the overall density remains the same. So, for option c, the planet has 5 Earth masses. Since density is mass/volume, and if it's same composition, then density is same as Earth. So 5.5 g/cm³.

Option d: A planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Same as above, so same density as Earth, 5.5 g/cm³.

Wait, but that can't be right, because that would mean all options except a have the same or a given density. But wait, no. Let me re-examine each option
