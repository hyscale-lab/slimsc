Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, each treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columns. I need to determine the chromatograms observed on both standard and chiral columns.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used in epoxidation of alkenes, especially in epoxidation reactions where the stereochemistry is important. Oh right, mCPBA is an oxidizing agent that reacts with alkenes to form epoxides. The reaction is typically an electrocyclic process, which I think involves the opening of the peracid followed by addition to the alkene.

Wait, but wait. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. Now, the geometry of the starting alkene (E or Z) will influence the structure of the epoxide. Let me think. For (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene, which structures are they?

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH3, but wait, that's not right. Wait, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. No, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3 but the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5. So (E)-oct-4-ene would have the higher priority groups on opposite sides, and (Z) would have them on the same side.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The epoxidation is stereoselective. For trans (E) alkenes, the epoxide would form with the oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a certain configuration. Wait, I think it's that the epoxidation occurs via a cyclic transition state, so the stereochemistry of the alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. mCPBA adds across the double bond in an epoxidation. The mechanism is such that the peracid adds to the double
