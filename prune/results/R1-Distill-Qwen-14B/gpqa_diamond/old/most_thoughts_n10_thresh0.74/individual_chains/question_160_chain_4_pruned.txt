Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining straight on it, and we're looking at the far field diffraction pattern. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. And they mentioned to use the small angle approximation where tan theta is approximately theta.

Hmm, first, I need to think about what the aperture does. Since it's a polygon with many sides (N approaching infinity), it's almost like a circle. Wait, but it's a polygon, so maybe it's more like a regular polygon with each side having the same apothem. Oh, wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? So for a regular polygon, all apothems are the same, which makes sense here.

When light passes through an aperture, diffraction occurs. The pattern observed is the Fourier transform of the aperture's shape. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot with minima at certain angles. The first minima for a circular aperture occur at an angle θ given by a sinθ = λ / 2. Because for a circle, the first minimum is when the path difference is λ/2. Oh wait, no, wait—the formula I remember is a sinθ = mλ, where m is the order. Wait, no, m starts at 1 for the first minimum. Wait, no, for single-slit diffraction, the minima are at a sinθ = mλ, where m is 1, 2, etc. So for the first minimum, m=1, θ = arcsin(λ/a). But that's for a single slit.

But wait, this is a polygonal aperture. So maybe it's a different scenario. Since N is very large, the shape is almost a circle. Then, perhaps the diffraction pattern would be similar to a circular aperture. But wait, no—wait. Wait, for a circle, the first minimum is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a, but wait, no, that's the first minimum in the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture. Or wait, wait—wait. No, wait, the single-slit diffraction's first minimum is at λ/a, but for a circular aperture, the first minimum is larger because of the nature of the
