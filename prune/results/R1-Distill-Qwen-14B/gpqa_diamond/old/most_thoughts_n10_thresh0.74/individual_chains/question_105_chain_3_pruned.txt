Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Only one hemisphere is spotted, so as the star rotates, the brightness changes, making the light curve vary periodically. This setup can mimic the presence of an exoplanet in terms of the brightness variation.

The question is asking: To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if there were no spots), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar)?

Hmm, I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets causes a dip in the star's brightness when the planet passes in front of it. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So, if a planet has radius Rp and the star has Rstar, the area ratio is (Rp/Rstar)^2. 

But wait, in this case, the star isn't being transited by a planet but has spots that cause a similar brightness variation. So I need to compare the brightness changes from the spots to those from a planet transit.

Let me think about the scenario without spots. If there's a planet, the light curve would dip by (Rp/Rstar)^2. But with spots, the star's brightness varies as the spots rotate into and out of view. The key here is to model the spot-induced brightness variation and set it equal to the planet-induced variation, then solve for Rp.

First, let me model the brightness variation due to the spots. The star's total brightness without spots would be L0 = 4πRstar²σTeff⁴. But when spots are present, part of the star's surface emits less light. The spots have a lower temperature (T_spot = 5000 K, since the star is 6000 K and the spots are 1000 K cooler).

The filling factor, f, is given as 20% (0.2). The filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. But wait, the spots are on one hemisphere, so during rotation, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots; when it's not, the spots are on the far side and don't contribute to the brightness dip.

Wait, no. Actually, the filling factor is the fraction of the entire surface covered by spots, regardless of rotation. Because the star rotates, the spots would come into and out of view. The maximum effect on brightness would occur when the maximum number of spots is facing the observer. So the brightness variation would be a sinusoidal-like change as the spots rotate in and out of view.

But how does the brightness variation due to spots compare to that of a planet transit?

Let me model each scenario.

Case 1: Planet transit.

The change in brightness (delta L) is the area of the planet relative to the star. Since the planet blocks some light, the dip is:

delta L_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star) * Lstar
= ( (π Rp²) / (4π Rstar²) ) * Lstar
= (Rp² / (4 Rstar²)) * Lstar

But wait, the actual dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2 because the area is proportional to radius squared. So, the fractional change is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Case 2: Star with spots.

The brightness change when spots are visible. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the side facing us, the star's overall brightness decreases. The variation in brightness depends on how much of the spotted area is visible as the star rotates.

But since the spots cover 20% of the star's surface, and they are on only one hemisphere, when the star rotates, the maximum effect is when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing us, and the minimum when it's facing away.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So regardless of rotation, the spots cover 20% of the surface. But when the star rotates, the fraction of the spotted area that is facing us varies sinusoidally.

Wait, no, actually, the fraction we see depends on how much of the spotted region is visible as the star rotates. Suppose the star is a sphere, and the spots are on one hemisphere. When the star rotates such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are fully visible, contributing their lower brightness. When the star is at a right angle, perhaps only a part of the spots are visible.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, when the star rotates, the spots move in and out of view. The maximum variation would occur when the spots are at the limb, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the observed brightness variation is a sinusoidal function with amplitude depending on the temperature difference and the area of the spots.

Alternatively, perhaps the variation is modeled as the spots covering a certain fraction of the star's disk as viewed from Earth. Since the star is rotating, the spots come into view and move across the disk.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the maximum change in brightness when the spots are transiting the line of sight. Alternatively, the change in brightness due to spots would be the same as the change due to a planet if the effective area blocked is the same.

Wait, no. Because when a planet transits, it blocks starlight. When a spot is visible, the star emits less light from that region. So the change in flux is due to the difference in brightness from the spot versus the surrounding area.

Let me think about the flux.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = σTeff^4.

Wait, no, the flux from a star is F = σTeff^4 multiplied by the surface area (4π Rstar²). But when part of the surface is cooler, the total flux becomes F = F0 - (fraction of area) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

Wait, more accurately, each part of the star emits according to its temperature. The flux from a blackbody is proportional to T^4 per unit area.

So the total flux when spots are present is L = L0 * (1 - f (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/Teff^4 )

Wait, no. Let me correct that.

The total flux without spots is L0 = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4.

With spots covering f (a fraction) of the surface, and the spots having temperature T_spot = 5000 K, the total flux is:

L = (1 - f) * L0 * (Teff^4 / Teff^4) + f * L0 * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)

Wait, no. Each part of the surface contributes F = σ T^4. So the total luminosity is the integral over the surface of F dA.

Without spots, L0 = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4.

With spots, the surface has two regions: the majority (1-f) with Teff, and f with T_spot.

So L = (1-f) * 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4 + f * 4π Rstar² σ T_spot^4

Thus, L = 4π Rstar² σ [ (1-f) Teff^
