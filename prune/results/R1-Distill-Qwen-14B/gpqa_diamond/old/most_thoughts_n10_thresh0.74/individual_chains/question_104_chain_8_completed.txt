Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The more massive the planet, the bigger the shift, I think. But wait, in this case, both planets have similar masses to Neptune, so maybe mass isn't the varying factor here.

The problem says the two stars have the same mass, similar to our Sun. Both planets are in circular orbits, which probably means the formula I use doesn't get complicated with eccentricity factors.

The key data points are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period?

I recall that the RV method's Doppler shift depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (though if we're comparing two planets, perhaps inclination is the same or cancels out?), the orbital period, and the mass of the star. Since both stars have the same mass, that should be a constant in our comparison.

The formula I think is something like the semi-amplitude of the RV (K) is proportional to ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) )) ) ... wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^2 * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (c * (P/(2π))^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is way less than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, e is zero here because the orbits are circular. So the formula simplifies to something like K being proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) / (P^(1/3)). 

Wait, maybe more accurately, the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (c * (P/(2π))^(1/3)) )

But since e is zero, sin i is the same for both (assuming the same inclination, but if i is 90 degrees for both, which is typical when we detect them, then sin i is 1. So perhaps K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)) )^(1/3)? Wait, maybe I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for K is approximately:

K = ( (v * (M_p) sin i) ) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) ) )

But I think I might have it wrong. Let me think of it another way. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the following equation:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c³) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G P )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) c )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a proportionality. Since the problem says the stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, but the Doppler shifts are different. So the shift K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3)) ), but wait, let me think.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But let me consider the proportionality. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, and assuming sin i is the same for both (maybe we can assume i is 90 degrees, so sin i=1, and same for both), then K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. Let's write the formula as:

K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But in this problem, M_p is the same for both planets (Neptune-like), and M_star is the same for both stars. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. So if K increases, the period decreases, and vice versa.

So, K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is 7. So K2 > K1, which would imply that P2 is less than P1. Wait, no, wait: because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 is bigger than K1, then P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, let me rearrange. Let me write K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So P ∝ 1 / K^(3).

So for Planet #1: K1 = 5 milliA, Planet #2: K2 =7 milliA.

So P2 = (K1 / K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, but wait. Wait, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = (some constant) * (1/P1^(1/3)), and K2 = (same constant) * (1/P2^(1/3)).

So K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) )

So (K1/K2) = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3)

Then, (P2 / P1 ) = (K1 / K2 )^3.

So P2 = P1 * (K1 / K2 )^3.

But wait, in our case, K2 is bigger than K1. So K1/K2 is less than 1, so P2 is less than P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1.

Wait, but the problem is asking: How many times is the orbital period of Planet #2 longer than that of Planet #1?

That is, they want to find (P2 / P1).

Wait, no, wait: the question is, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So they're asking for (P2 / P1). But according to the above, P2 is smaller than P1. So the ratio would be less than 1.

Wait, but let me recheck.

If K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So P2 = P1 * (K1 / K2 )^3.

So P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3.

So substituting K1 =5, K2=7.

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So that's about 0.36 times. So the orbital period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, about a third of planet #1's.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times, meaning it's shorter. So the answer would be ~0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but the question says "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's about 0.36 times as long. So the answer is approximately 0.36, option A.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, i.e., 

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}.
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3.
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
