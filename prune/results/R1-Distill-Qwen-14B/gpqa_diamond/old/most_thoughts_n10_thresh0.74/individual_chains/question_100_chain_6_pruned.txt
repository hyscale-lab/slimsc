Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which statement about the products is incorrect. Let me try to walk through each step carefully.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 can be either propene (if it's an alkene) or propane. Wait, but wait, the formula C3H6. Let me think. Alkanes have the formula CnH2n+2. For n=3, that's C3H8. So C3H6 is either an alkene (propene) or an alkyne (propyne). But propyne is C3H4, actually. Wait, no, wait. Propyne is CH3-C≡CH, which has 3 carbons and 4 hydrogens? Wait, no, wait, that's not right. Let me recount. Propyne is HC≡C-CH2? No, wait, propyne is actually CH3-C≡CH, which is C3H4. Oh, wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, which is C3H6. So compound A must be propene.

So compound A is propene (C3H6), which undergoes bromination in CCl4. Bromination of alkenes in CCl4 is a typical addition reaction. Propene would add bromine across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3). Wait, but wait.
