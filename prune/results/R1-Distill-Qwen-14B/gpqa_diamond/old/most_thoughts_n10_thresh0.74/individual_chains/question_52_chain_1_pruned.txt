Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Hmm, the question is about a star with certain characteristics when it has and doesn't have dark spots on its surface. The main point seems to be about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Wait, when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So we're looking for the ratio of (level1/level2) without spots to when it has spots.

First, I need to remember what determines the ratio of populations in different energy levels. Oh right, that's the Boltzmann equation. The ratio depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the two levels. The formula is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between level 2 and level 1, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the spots cause the overall photospheric temperature to drop. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is lower. The spots make 40% of the surface cooler, bringing the overall Teff down from 6000K to 5500K.

The photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann equation applies locally. But wait, the star's surface isn't uniform when it has spots. The spots are cooler regions, and the rest is at a higher temperature. But the question says that when examining the ratio, the overall ratio decreases when spots are present. So how does this affect the average ratio?

Wait, the star's photosphere is a mix of spotted and unspotted regions when it has spots. But if the spots are cooler, then the average ratio of Ti atoms in the two levels would be a mix of the ratios from different regions.

But wait, the problem is about the ratio when the star has spots, versus when it doesn't. So when the star doesn't have spots, the entire surface is at 6000K. When it has spots, 40% is cooler (I guess the spots are at a lower Teff, like maybe 5000K? Wait, the problem
