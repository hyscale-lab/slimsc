Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when things go really fast, close to the speed of light, you can't just use regular old Newtonian mechanics. I think I need to use special relativity here. 

The question is asking for the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. Let me break this down.

First, the problem states the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so both are moving in the same direction. That means the relative velocity isn't just the difference of their speeds because that would be too simplistic, especially at high speeds.

I think I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula for their relative speed. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me plug in the numbers. So v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed v_rel is (0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c, which rounds to 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have that as their relative speed. So that's a start.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, which includes kinetic energy. Wait, but wait, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of their rest energies and their kinetic energies. But wait, actually, the total energy E is the sum of each astronaut's total energy (gamma * m c²).

So for each astronaut, calculate gamma, multiply by their mass, and sum them.

Let me calculate each gamma:

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So their energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So their energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Total energy E = 2.5 + 3.464 = approx 5.964 mc². Let me check the options:

Option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches closely. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower.

Wait, but wait, are these the total energies including rest mass energy? Because each astronaut's rest mass energy is mc². Let me think again.

Wait, the rest energy is mc². So for the first astronaut, 2m, rest energy is 2mc², and with gamma 1.25, their total energy is 2.5 mc². Similarly, the second is 3m, so rest energy is 3 mc², and gamma makes it 3.464 mc².

Adding those gives 5.964 mc². So option C's E is 5.96 mc², which is what I calculated. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B has E=4.96 mc². Hmm, why would that be? Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The problem says "the total energy of the system." Oh, wait, but in the system's rest frame, the total energy would be the sum of their energies in that frame. But wait, no, the problem is about each astronaut's own energy, summed up. Or perhaps the question is considering the center of momentum frame? Or maybe it's the total energy from each as observed in the same frame.

Wait, the problem states that both are moving in the positive x-direction, but from whose perspective? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we're considering each astronaut's energy from the same frame, perhaps the lab frame where the astronauts are moving.

Wait, but when the problem says "the total energy of the system," I think it's the sum of their energies as measured in the same frame. So that's what I did earlier.

So the sum is 5.96 mc², which is option C. So relative speed is 0.14c and E is 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing these results with the options:

- **Option C**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\) — matches the calculations.
- **Option D**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5mc^2\) — does not match the energy calculation.
- **Option B**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1c\), \(E = 4.96mc^2\) — does not match either the relative speed or energy.
- **Option A**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 1.1c\), \(E = mc^2\) — does not match.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
