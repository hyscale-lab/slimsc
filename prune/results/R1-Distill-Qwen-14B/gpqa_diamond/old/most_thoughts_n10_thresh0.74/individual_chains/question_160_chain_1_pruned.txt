Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Okay, the question is about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. All apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light (wavelength λ) falls on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large, using the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with diffraction patterns, the shape of the aperture determines the pattern. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a certain angle, but here it's a polygon. But wait, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. So maybe this is a limit approaching a circular aperture.

Wait, but the problem says N is infinitely large, so the shape becomes a circle. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ=1.22λ/(π a), I think. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, the diffraction formula for a circular aperture is the Bessel function, and the minima occur where the Bessel function J1 has its zeros. The first minimum is at θ where J1(k a sinθ) =0. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317, so that gives θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(π a) ? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the formula I remember is a sinθ = (m + 0.5) λ / (π a) ? No, maybe not. Let me think again. The condition for the m-th minimum in a circular aperture is that the Bessel function J1 has its m-th zero. The first minimum (m=1) is at x = 3.8317, so x = a sinθ * (2π/λ) ? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the formula for the angular position of the minima in a circular aperture is given by sinθ = (mλ)/(π a), where m is the order. Wait, no, that's not right because the actual condition is that for the m-th minimum, a sinθ = (x
