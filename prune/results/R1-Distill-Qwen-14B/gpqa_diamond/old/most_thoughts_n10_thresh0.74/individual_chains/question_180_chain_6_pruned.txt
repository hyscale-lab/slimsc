Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm, so the setup is that there's a central charge fixed at P, and twelve charges each at a distance of 2 meters from P. Wait, but all the 13 are identical, right? So the central one has charge 2e, and the others also 2e each.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Oh, I remember that in electrostatics, the energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

Since all charges are the same, I can probably calculate the total energy by considering each pair once and then summing it all up. But wait, because each pair is counted twice if I'm not careful. Let me think.

Wait, the system consists of 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at 2m from P. So, the charges are at the same distance from P, but are they arranged in some symmetric way? Like all in the same plane or something? But I don't think that matters for the potential energy calculation because potential energy depends only on distances between each pair. So perhaps each of the twelve charges is placed at 2m from P, but the distances between them might vary. Oh wait, but in the problem statement, it says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So each of the twelve is at 2m from P. But the distance between any two of them might not
