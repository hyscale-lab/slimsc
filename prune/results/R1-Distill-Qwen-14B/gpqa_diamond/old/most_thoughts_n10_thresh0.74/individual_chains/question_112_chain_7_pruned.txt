Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Hmm.

Alright, the state vector is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector can be written as a linear combination of basis states. So, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-component of the spin operator, which I think is S_z. The eigenvalues for those should be ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively, or wait, actually for spin-½ particles, the eigenvalues are ħ/2 for up and -ħ/2 for down. Wait, maybe I should confirm that. Oh right, yes, because the spin matrices for S_z are diagonal with entries ħ/2 and -ħ/2 on the diagonal.

But wait, the operator we're looking at isn't S_z. The question says the operator has a matrix representation where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So, the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix where A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2, and A_11 = A_22 = 0. That sounds familiar. Oh wait, that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So the operator A would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

So, the operator A is (ħ/2) * σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. The eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So the problem is to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalues associated with operator A when the state is |alpha>, and then find the average value of A in that state.

First, I think I need to normalize |alpha>. The question says it's proportional to the given vector, so the actual state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but we need to find the normalization constant.

The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the moduli of the coefficients. So |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because |a + ib|^2 = a² + b². Similarly, |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Alright, now to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>. Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2)σ_x, its eigenvalues are (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1). So when we measure A, the possible outcomes are ħ/2 and -ħ/2, with probabilities given by the squares of the amplitudes of |+x> and |-x> in the state |alpha>.

But wait, how do I express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>? Alternatively, I can compute the components of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

The eigenstates of σ_x (and hence A) are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So, to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I can express |alpha> as a linear combination of these.

Let me denote |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>. Then, the probabilities will be |c_+|² and |c_-|².

So, substituting |+x> and |-x> into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7 )

Expressed as:

(1+i)|up> = (1+i) [ sqrt(2) |+x> + sqrt(2) ( |up> - |down> ) ??? Wait, maybe it's better to write |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Since |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

Then,

a |+x> + b |-x> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) 

= [ a + b ] |up> / sqrt(2) + [ a - b ] |down> / sqrt(2)

But from |alpha>, the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) for |up> and (2 -i)/sqrt(7) for |down>.

So equate the coefficients:

[ a + b ] / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)

[ a - b ] / sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Now, I can set up these two equations:

(1) a + b = (1+i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

(2) a - b = (2 -i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Let me add and subtract these equations to solve for a and b.

Adding (1) and (2):

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Simplify the numerator: 1 + i + 2 - i = 3 → so 2a = 3 sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → a = (3/2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Similarly, subtracting (2) from (1):

2b = [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Compute the numerator: 1 + i -2 + i = (-1) + 2i → 2b = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

So b = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Then, the coefficients a and b are:

a = [3 sqrt(2)] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

b = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, let me compute |a|² and |b|².

First, compute |a|²:

a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

So |a|² = [9 * 2 ] / [4 *7 ] = 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64 (as in option A) or 0.61 (option D). Hmm, but the problem is to find the probabilities, which would be |a|² and |b|².

Wait, wait a second. Because |alpha> is already normalized (since we divided by sqrt(7)), the sum of |a|² + |b|² should be 1.

So let me compute |a|² and |b|².

Compute |a|²:

a = 3 sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) → |a|² = (9 * 2) / (4 *7) )= 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Compute |b|²:

b = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) → let me compute numerator and denominator.

The numerator is (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2). The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] * (sqrt(2))^2 → (1 +4)*2=5*2=10.

Denominator is (2 sqrt(7))² = 4 *7 =28.

So |b|²= 10 /28 =5/14 ≈0.357142.

Wait, but 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, which makes sense since it's normalized.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first part is about the probabilities, which are 9/14 and 5/14. 9/14 is approximately 0.6428... which is 0.64 as in option A. Or 5/14 is approx 0.357, which is about 0.36 as in option A.

Wait, but option A says 0.64 and 0.36. That would match. So the first part of the question, the probabilities, would be 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

But wait, let me double-check. Because in Quantum Mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in the state vector.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute this using matrix methods. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: find the probability by using the operator's eigenstates and projecting |alpha> onto them.

Since operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, as I mentioned before. The eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So to find the probability of measuring ħ/2, compute |⟨+x | alpha ⟩ |².

Similarly for |-x> it's |⟨-x | alpha ⟩ |².

So let's compute these inner products.

⟨+x | alpha⟩ = [ ⟨up| + ⟨down| ] / sqrt(2) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

Compute numerator: (1+i +2 -i) =3 → so this is 3/(sqrt(14)).

So |⟨+x | alpha⟩ |² = (3)^2 /14 =9/14 ≈0.6428, same as before.

Similarly, ⟨-x | alpha⟩ = [ ⟨up| - ⟨down| ] / sqrt(2) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) 

Numerator: (1 +i -2 +i) = (-1 +2i)

So this is (-1 +2i)/(sqrt(14))

The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

So yes, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which match the first part of option A, which says 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7.

So the average value is the expectation value of A in state |alpha>, which is ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

So ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2) ⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is a normalized state, this is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x.

But σ
