Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, so the question is about finding the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let me read it carefully.

Alright, the setup: It's an isolated system with 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges can be calculated by considering the potential each charge contributes to the others. Since all the charges are the same, the calculation should be manageable.

Wait, the problem says it's an isolated system. So energy-wise, that might not affect the calculation because we're just looking for the potential energy between them. But I'm not 100% sure about that.

So, the 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of those 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge. But what about the interactions between the 12 charges themselves?

Ah, right. The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. Since the 12 charges are all at the same distance from the fixed charge, maybe we can compute their contributions in a structured way.

Wait, but for an isolated system, I think the potential energy is considered as the work done to assemble the charges one by one, bringing each from infinity to their positions. So each charge's placement affects the potential energy of the others.

But wait, in this problem, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps their positions are fixed once the 13th is placed. Hmm, but the 12 are all at a fixed distance from P, but are they arranged in some way? Like, are they all on a sphere around P? Or what's their configuration?

Wait, the problem doesn't specify
