Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out what product 4 looks like. Let me take it step by step because I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

First, the starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Wait, no, more accurately, it's a cyclic monoterpene with a structure that's a bicyclic system, right? Oh wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a specific structure. Wait, no, limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene. No, no, wait. No, waitâ€”wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, I think. Let me think. Oh right, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic structure with a cyclohexene ring and a methyl group. Its structure is like a cyclohexene with a specific substituent arrangement.

Wait, (R)-(+)-Limonene has the structure where there's a cyclohexene ring. The substituents are a methyl group and an isopropyl group. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring, with a methyl at one position and an isopropenyl group adjacent. Wait, no, limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene, but perhaps I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene. Let me visualize: (R)-limonene would have a specific configuration. Oh, wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)cyclohexene structure. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group on carbon 1 and an isopropenyl group (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2?) Wait, no, the isopropenyl group is actually CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, but I think the structure is a substituted cyclohexene. Let me try to sketch it mentally. The structure of limonene is a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group on carbon 1 and an isopropenyl group (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2
