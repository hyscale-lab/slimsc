Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a chemist does two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II. Then, after workup, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Let me first look at Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. Typically, LAH reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one would become hexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5.

When LAH reduces this, the ketone (at C3) will become an alcohol. So the product should be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol? Wait, but wait, stereochemistry might change. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent; when it reduces a ketone, it does so with inversion of configuration if it's a cyclic structure, but for a simple ketone, it's a planar carbonyl, so the nucleophile (H-) comes from either side, leading to racemization, right? But wait, the starting material is a single enantiomer, (S) configuration. So when it's reduced, the OH group will form. Since the starting carbonyl is planar, the addition can happen from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, wait, no, wait: the starting material is a chiral center already. Let me clarify.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Its structure is: CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? Or wait, maybe I should draw it.

Structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: 

It's CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3 but wait, chain is longer. Let me count the carbons. Hexan-3-one is (CH₂)₂CO-(CH₂)₂CH3. But with a methoxy group at position 5. So numbering from the ketone as position 3, the chain is:

1   2   3       4   5   6
CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH₂CH₂CO(CH2)2CH3. Let me structure it properly.

Actually, hexan-3-one is CH₂CH₂CO-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. So, the ketone is on carbon 3. The substituents on the ketone are CH₂CH₂ (from the left) and CH₂CH₂CH3 (
