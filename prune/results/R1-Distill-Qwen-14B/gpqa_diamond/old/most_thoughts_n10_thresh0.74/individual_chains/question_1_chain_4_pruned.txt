Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. 

Similarly, for the second state with Δt2 = 1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. 
Convert to eV:
1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.59e-8 eV.

Now, the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of these two, right? Because each state has its own uncertainty. So ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = (6.59e-7 + 6.59e-8) eV. Let me compute that: 6.59e-7 is 65.9e-8, so adding 6.59e-8 gives 72.49e-8 eV, or about 7.25e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait a minute. Alternatively, maybe I should think about whether it's the sum or the maximum of the two. Hmm. I think when two states are close, the overall uncertainty would be the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because each contributes an uncertainty in their own energy measurement, so the total uncertainty when comparing the two would be the sum.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 (ΔE) needs to be larger than this total uncertainty. So ΔE > ΔE_total ≈7.25e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way smaller than 7e-7. So no.
B) 1e-11 → even smaller.
C) 1e-4 → that's 0.0001 eV. Which is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 7e-7. So this would work.
D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6 eV. Also smaller than 7e-7.

Wait, wait. 7e-7 is
