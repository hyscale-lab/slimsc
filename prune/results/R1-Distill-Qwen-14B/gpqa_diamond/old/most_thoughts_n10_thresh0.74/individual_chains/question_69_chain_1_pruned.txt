Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed in the bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are various lengths, so I think this has to do with the distance the particles travel before decaying.

Wait, right, when particles are moving at high speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So the lifetime τ in the lab frame is gamma times τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle.

Gamma (γ) is equal to E/mc², right? Oh wait, E here is the total energy of the particle. So E is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately... let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87. 3.41*8=27.28. Oh wait, 3.41*7.9 is close to 27. Let's compute this accurately. 3.41 *7 is 23.87. 27 -23.87=3.13. 3.13/3.41 is approximately 0.918. So 7.918? Wait, 3.41 *7.918 is approximately 27, yes. So gamma is around 7.918.

So then, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ * τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. Multiply that by 7.918: 8e-16 *7.918 ≈ 63.34e-16 seconds, or 6.334e-15 seconds.

Now, the particles are moving at some speed, so the distance they travel before decaying is beta * gamma * c * tau_0. Wait, no, wait. The lifetime in the lab is gamma tau_0, so the distance is v multiplied by the lifetime. But v is beta c. So the distance L is beta * c * gamma tau_0. Alternatively, since gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta²), but maybe there's a better way.

Wait, another approach: The mean path length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0. But how do I find beta? Because beta is v/c. And from gamma, we can find beta.

Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), so 1 - beta² = 1/gamma². So beta squared is 1 - 1/gamma². Gamma is about 7.9
