Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. So, the general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, I think it's (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0 since there's no halogen mentioned, and N is 1. So plugging in: 2*8 is 16, plus 2 is 18. Minus H (9) is 9, so 18-9=9. Then plus N (since it's +1?), wait no, the formula is (2C+2 - H - X + N)/2. So 2*8 +2 =18. Minus 9 is 9. Minus X (0) is 9. Plus N (1)=10. Divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a ring and some double bonds or something. 

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm triplet, 1H. That seems like an aldehyde proton. Because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Triple of integration 1. So maybe an aldehyde group.

6.98 ppm doublet, 2H. Aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted? Like in a benzene ring with substituents that cause splitting into a doublet.

6.51 ppm doublet, 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. Wait, if it's a doublet, perhaps another set of aromatic protons, maybe adjacent to substituents. Or maybe it's a coupling with something else.

6.27 ppm broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, broad suggests maybe exchange or something. Could be -OH protons, but wait, that's usually a singlet. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton, but that's more around 5-6 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative group or part of an aromatic ring but in a different environment.

3.66 ppm doublet, 2H. That's a quartet or doublet. 2H might be a CH2 group adjacent to something else. Maybe an oxygen? Like an OCH2 group or something. Or maybe a CH2 attached to another CH2, but that's less likely. Or perhaps an -O-CH2- structure.

Putting this together, perhaps the compound has an aldehyde group. The triplet at 9.72 ppm suggests that the aldehyde proton is coupling with two others. Wait, a triplet might mean two neighboring protons. So maybe the aldehyde is at the end of a chain with two adjacent protons. Like CH2-CHO?

Wait, but looking at the 3.66 ppm doublet (2H), that could be a CH2 group. If it's a CH2 next to another group, maybe an oxygen. Let me think: perhaps a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2-?

Wait, let's try to draw a structure. So, an aldehyde group (CHO) at one end, perhaps. Then a CH2 group (maybe OCH2). Let me think about the other NMR signals. The aromatic signals suggest two benzene rings, maybe. Because the aromatic signals are split into two doublets, each 2H. So perhaps two para-substituted benzene rings.

Wait, the NMR shows 6.98 (d,2H), 6.51 (d,2H). That could be two substituents on a benzene ring, each with two protons. Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene attached to another group. Or perhaps, the molecule has two benzene rings attached via a central chain.

Wait
