Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the question is about binary star systems. There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are given as 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. 

Then, they did spectroscopic observations. The radial velocity (RV) variations for system_1 are sinusoidal with amplitudes 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. We have to consider the mass of each system as the sum of the two stars.

Hmm, I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The RV method relies on the Doppler effect, where the stars orbit a common center of mass, causing them to move towards or away from us, which we observe as shifts in their spectral lines.

Wait, each star's velocity is related to the mass of the other star. Oh right, Kepler's third law comes into play here too, which relates the orbital period and the masses of the stars.

So let me think. The formula for the mass function relates the velocity amplitudes to the masses. The mass function is (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ), where i is the inclination of the orbit. But wait, in eclipsing binaries, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. So we can probably ignore the inclination factor here, because it's nearly edge-on.

Alternatively, I remember that for a spectroscopic binary, the more massive star moves more slowly, and the less massive star moves more quickly. Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So the velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass. So the more massive star has a smaller velocity.

Wait, system_1 has velocities 10 and 5. So one star has a higher velocity (10) and the other lower (5). So the star with 10 must be the less massive one, because it's moving more. So the masses are inversely proportional to their velocities, assuming same orbital separation. But wait, the orbital period comes into play as well.

Wait, let's think about Kepler's third law. The formula is (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a^3, where a is the separation. But in binary stars, the velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) are related to the masses and the orbital parameters.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K1 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Similarly for K2:

K2 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M1 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Since sin i is approximately 1 for eclipsing binaries, we can ignore it.

So combining K1 and K2, we can notice that K1/K2 = M2 / M1

Because K1 = (M2 sin i) / (M1 + M2)^(something) * ... wait, let me think again.

Wait, from the equations:

K1 = ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * ( M2 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Similarly,

K2 = ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * ( M1 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

So when we take the ratio K1/K2 = M2 / M1.

That makes sense because the more massive star would have a lower velocity.

So in system_1, K1 is 10 km/s, K2 is 5 km/s. So K1/K2 = 2 = M2/M1.

Wait, that would mean M2 is twice M1. So the mass ratio is 2:1.

Wait, wait, but in system_1, the two stars' velocities are 10 and 5. So K1=10, K2=5. So K1/K2 = 2. So M2/M1 = 2. So M2 is twice as massive as M1.

So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2, K1 is 15, K2 is 10. So K1/K2 = 15/10 = 1.5 => M2/M1 = 1.5 → M2 = 1.5 M1.

Wait, but wait—wait, in system_2, which star is which? I think the larger velocity is for the less massive star. So in system_2, K1=15, K2=10. So K1 is for the star with higher velocity.

So K1/K2 = 15/10 = 3/2. So M2/M1 = 3/2 → M2 = 1.5 M1.

Wait, but in system_2, the total mass would be M1 + M2 = M1 + 1.5 M1 = 2.5 M1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again: For system_1, K1 is 10, K2 is 5
