Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. I need to find the momentum of that photon so that the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, the model being used is the non-rigid rotor model, right? But wait, I think the non-rigid rotor is also known as the rotational-vibrational coupling model or something like that. Oh, but the question mentions "quantum rotation-vibration model," which probably accounts for both rotation and vibration of the molecule.

So, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state usually refers to the lowest energy state. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the ground state is n=0 for vibration and probably certain quantum numbers for rotation. I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify: for a diatomic molecule, the quantum state is a combination of vibrational and rotational states.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But since this is a non-rigid rotor model, maybe we also consider the vibrational energy levels. Oh wait, the non-rigid rotor is actually the same as the rotational-vibrational model, which includes both rotation and vibration.

Wait, but the question specifies the quantum rotation-vibration model. So,
