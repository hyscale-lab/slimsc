Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. Let me think through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches. The broadness suggests it might be an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, another option could be an ether, but ether O-H isn't as strong. So, I'm thinking either alcohol or carboxylic acid. But the broad peak here is very broad, which is more typical for a carboxylic acid because the O-H in carboxylic acids is more acidic and has a broader and stronger absorption.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak; that typically corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. But wait, in carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700. But wait, the IR of carboxylic acids also have a broad O-H around 2500-3300. So, if there's a peak at 1650, that might be another carbonyl group or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Alternatively, 1650 could be an conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, or maybe an amide. Hmm, but the options don't include nitrogen, so amide is probably out.

Looking at the 1H NMR: several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like CH2=CH-. So the compound has a double bond, maybe an alkene. Also, the presence of vinyl protons suggests that there's a double bond in the structure.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment at m/z 45. Let me think about what fragments give m/z 45. 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH3 (dimethyl ether?), but wait, no, 45 is also the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 45 (12*2 + 1*6 +16= 24+6+16=46? Wait, no. 12*2 is 24, H6 is 6, O is 16, so 24+6+16=46. So maybe not. Hmm. Oh wait, another possibility: the fragment could be from a more complex molecule. Let me think about common fragments. Another fragment at 45 could be (CH2)2O, which is not a common one. Alternatively, perhaps a ketene group? Wait, maybe it's a CH3CO group. Let me compute: CH3CO has a molecular weight of 43 (12+1*3) + (12 + 16) = 15 + 28 =43. No. How about a CH2=CHâ€“ group? That's 28. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule
