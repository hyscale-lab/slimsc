Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again. 

The question is: If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system. The options are A, B, C, D with various expressions.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let's think. So, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. Since the sphere is grounded, electrons can move freely, right? So when you bring a charge q near the sphere, the charges on the sphere will rearrange. 

But wait, since the sphere is conducting and grounded, any induced charges would adjust until the potential on the sphere's surface is the same as the ground. Oh, right, because the conductor is at the same potential as the ground when it's grounded.

So, the sphere's potential will be zero because it's grounded. But wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the sphere is a conductor, so its potential is the same everywhere on its surface. And since it's grounded, that potential is the same as the ground's potential, which is typically considered zero. So the sphere's potential is zero.

But the charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of the sphere. So the system consists of charge q and the conducting sphere. I need to find the potential energy of this system.

Wait, potential energy between two charges? Or is it the
