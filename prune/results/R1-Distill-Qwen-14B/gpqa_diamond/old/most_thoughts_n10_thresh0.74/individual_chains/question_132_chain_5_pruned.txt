Okay, so I have this NMR question to solve. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum has two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are various tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me check the degrees of unsaturation. For C10H14, the formula is C10H14. The degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2 =4. So four degrees: probably one benzene ring (3 double bonds, so 3 degrees) and one more, perhaps a methyl group or something else? Wait, no, benzene is 4 degrees (three double bonds and a ring). Oh wait, no, the benzene ring is three double bonds plus one ring, which is four degrees. So yeah, four degrees.

So each compound is a disubstituted benzene, maybe with multiple methyl groups. Wait, let me think about the structures. The options are all tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has diethyl groups. Let me think about each option.

The 1H NMR shows two singlets at ~6.7 ppm. For aromatic protons, that area is typical of protons that are deshielded, maybe in a para position or in a meta arrangement. But wait, in substituted benzene rings, the number of unique protons depends on the substitution pattern.

If the aromatic region has two singlets, that suggests each compound contributes one singlet. So each compound has only one type of aromatic proton. Because in a 1:1 mixture, each contributes equally. So each compound in the mixture has a single set of equivalent aromatic protons, which would appear as a singlet.

So which structures among the options have only one type of aromatic proton?

Let me consider each option:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl would be a benzene with four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. That's adjacent positions. Let me imagine the structure. So positions 1,2,3,4 are all methyl. So looking at the ring, that leaves positions 5 and 6. But wait, if four are methyl, the other two are H.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the ring has symmetry. For 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the positions 1,2,3,4 are adjacent, so the substituents are in a square-like arrangement. But that would make the ring symmetric, so the remaining positions (5 and 6) would be equivalent. Are the aromatic protons in the
