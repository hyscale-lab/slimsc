Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about rotavirus and the immune response. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

So, the question says that GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice orally. They observe that some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid and some are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Then, they look at the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate proliferating cells. The variable heavy chain genes show high variability. The question is, which process is happening here.

Hmm, I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are a site where immune responses to enteric pathogens like rotavirus are initiated. The inner capsid proteins are probably antigens. When the mice are given these antigens, their immune system should respond by producing antibodies.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes... Wait, the variable regions of antibodies are crucial for recognizing specific antigens. The production of diverse antibodies from a limited number of genes is due to processes like somatic hypermutation and VDJ recombination.

Wait, VDJ recombination happens during the generation of the initial diversity in B cell receptors in the bone marrow. It's the process where the V, D, and J segments are combined. But once the B cells are activated, they undergo further diversification through somatic hypermutation, which introduces point mutations in the variable region. This increases the diversity of the antibodies produced, allowing for better affinity to the antigen.

In this scenario, the cells are isolated from the Peyer patches, which are in the gut. B cells in the Peyer patches are probably activated by the rotavirus antigens. Once activated, these B cells undergo proliferation and then differentiate into plasma cells or memory cells. During this phase, the B cells undergo somatic hypermutation to increase the diversity of their antibodies. This explains the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

So looking at the options: 

A) Somatic hypermutation: This would lead to increased variability in the antibody genes, which matches the observation.

B) Complement activation: This is part of the immune response, but it doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of the antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't increase the variability in the variable regions.

D) VDJ recombination: That's during the initial B cell development in the bone marrow, not in the secondary lymphoid organs after antigen exposure.

Therefore, the process taking place here is somatic hypermutation.


The question involves analyzing the immune response to GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus in mice. The experiment shows that some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus, but fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, and the isolated proliferating cells exhibit high variability in their variable heavy chain genes. Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are critical for initiating immune responses to enteric pathogens. The observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that diversifies antibody repertoires.

Among the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in activated B cells and introduces point mutations in the variable region of the antibody genes, increasing diversity. This matches the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: While it is part of the immune response, it does not directly contribute to variability in the variable regions of antibodies.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of the antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not increase variability in the variable regions.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during the initial development of B cells in the bone marrow and establishes the primary diversity of B cell receptors, not the additional variability observed in this experiment.

Given that the experiment involves activated B cells in secondary lymphoid organs (Peyer patches) after antigen exposure, the process responsible for the observed variability is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
