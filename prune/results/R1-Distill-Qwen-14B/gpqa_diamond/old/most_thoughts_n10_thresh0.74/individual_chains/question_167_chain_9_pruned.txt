Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). They're asking for the non-Gaussianity (nG) when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

I remember that non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. Gaussian states are those that can be described by Gaussian statistics, like coherent states or squeezed states. Non-Gaussian states are more complex, like the Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states.

The problem mentions using the relative entropy measure, which is defined as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Here, rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, I think the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (or sometimes called quantum relative entropy) is calculated between the state in question and the closest Gaussian state. But wait, maybe I should think again. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state here is the maximum entropy Gaussian state that matches the first and second moments of the non-Gaussian state. Because the relative entropy between the state and a Gaussian might not be the same as the best possible Gaussian approximation.

Wait, another thought: for the relative entropy approach, the non-Gaussianity is sometimes defined as S(rho) - S(τ), where τ is the Gaussian state that is the "closest" to rho in terms of relative entropy. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is chosen as the one that shares the same first moments (like the mean photon number) and the same second moments (covariance matrix) as the non-Gaussian state. Because Gaussian states are completely determined by their first and second moments, so matching those would give the closest Gaussian approximation.

So, the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate the density matrix rho for the given state |psi>.
2. Find the reference Gaussian state tau, which matches the first and second moments of rho.
3. Compute the von Neumann entropy
