Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: What's the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant K_Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions. So when Ca-EDTA is in solution, it's a complex ion, probably something like CaY^2- where Y is the EDTA part.

Wait, I think EDTA has a structure that can bind metal ions, and the complex formation is described by a formation constant, Kf. Oh right, Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The given K_Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. So Kf is 5e10. That's a pretty large number, meaning the complex is very stable.

The solution has 0.02 M of this complex. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. But we need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

I think when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. So the dissociation reaction is CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). And since Kf is large, the extent of dissociation is very small, so we can approximate that the concentration of the complex remains almost 0.02 M, and the concentration of the dissociated ions is very low.

So let's denote the dissociation as x. So if the complex dissociates, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so big, x is going to be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Solving for x. Let's rearrange:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10)
x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 → Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13. So x squared equals 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, right? So 4e-13 is 4x1e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2 *1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute it numerically. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 2e-6.5 is equal to 2 * 1e-6.5. Since 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1
