Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a solution that's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options given are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

First, I need to think about the structure of each compound. The molecular formula is C10H14. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C10H14, the formula is CnHm. Degree of Unsaturation is (2n +2 -m)/2. So for n=10, m=14: (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation which would be one benzene ring (3 double bonds, which is 3 DoU) and one from a double bond or a ring. Wait, but benzene already accounts for 3 DoU. So the remaining one must be from another ring or a double bond. But the compound is aromatic, so I think it's the benzene ring with substituents, so maybe two substituents that are methyl groups or ethyl groups, but wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me check each option's structure.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, the molecular formula for tetramethylbenzene would be C8H10. But wait, the given formula is C10H14. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, wait, wait, maybe I messed up. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the molecular formula for tetramethylbenzene is C8H10. So each compound in the mixture is C10H14. So perhaps the substituents are not methyl groups but something else. Wait, looking at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: that's four methyl groups on benzene. So benzene (6 carbons) plus four methyl (each CH3, so 4*1=4 carbons) gives C10? No, wait 6+4=10 carbons. Oh wait, the molecular formula would be C10H14? Let me think. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl group is CH3. So adding four methyl groups: each adds a CH3, so 4*(CH3) = 4*C, and for hydrogen, benzene has 6 H. Each methyl adds 3 H, but since they're substituting on the benzene, each replaces one H. So each methyl adds 2 H (3 added - 1 removed). So four methyl groups add 4*(3-1) = 8 H. So total H is 6+8=14. So the formula is C10H14. Oh okay, that makes sense. So each tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring, making C10H14.

Other options: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene — same as above. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would also have four methyl groups. The fourth option is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Diethyl would be two ethyl groups. Let's see: each ethyl is C2H5. Benzene (6C) + two ethyls (4C) gives 10C. Hydrogen: Benzene is 6 H. Each ethyl is C2H5, but when attached as substituents, each ethyl would have 5 H (since they're attached via one C). Wait, no, the ethyl group is CH2CH3. So when attached to benzene, it's -OCH2CH3? No, benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl adds how many H? Let's see: when benzene has an ethyl group, each ethyl is CH2CH3. So each ethyl contributes 2 (from CH2) + 3 (from CH3) =5 H, but wait, the benzene ring originally has 6 H. Each substitution replaces one H. So each ethyl group adds 5 H, but one is lost, so net 4 H per ethyl. So two ethyls add 8 H. So benzene's H:6, plus 8, gives 14 H. So molecular formula is C6 + 2*2 = C10, H14. So yes, that's correct.

So the diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The aromatic protons are singlets, which suggests that all the aromatic protons are equivalent. Wait, but in a benzene ring with substituents, having equivalent protons would mean certain symmetry.

But in the question, the aromatic region shows two singlets, each integrating in a 1:1 ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, the two singlets each have an integral of 2 H each because each compound contributes 2 H? Or wait, perhaps each compound has two aromatic protons, and each is equivalent, so their signals split into two, but in the mixture, they appear as two singlets.

Wait, let me think again. The 1H NMR shows two singlets in the aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each singlet must be integrating to 2 H for each compound. Because 2 H from each would add up to 4 H in the spectrum. But wait, no, each compound contributes a certain number of protons, and in a 1:1 mixture, each would have 1 equivalent in the solution. So if each compound has two aromatic protons, each would contribute 1 H each in the mixture. But wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the integral is 2:1:1 for the other signals. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the question says: two signals (two singlets) around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. So each singlet has an integral of 2 H, meaning each compound contributes 2 H. So each aromatic compound has two equivalent protons, each giving a singlet. So each compound must have only two unique aromatic protons, each as a pair. But wait, if a benzene ring has four substituents, perhaps in certain positions leading to equivalent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps each compound has two sets of equivalent protons, but in the NMR, each set is a singlet. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about each option's structure.

First, let's list each option's structure and their NMR expectations.

Option 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1,2,4,5. Let's imagine the benzene ring. Positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. Positions 4 and 5 are adjacent as well. So the structure would have methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. So the substituents are in a para arrangement? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me draw it mentally. Positions 1 (top), 2 (right), 4 (bottom), 5 (left). So the substituents are at 1,2,4,5. So the ring is substituted in a way that across from 1 is position 4, and across from 2 is position 5. So the substituents are four in a sort of "diagonal" fashion. Let me think about the symmetry. Are there any equivalent protons?

In 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are in a way that positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 4 and 5 are adjacent. So the substituents are across from each other? Wait, not exactly. Let me think: positions 1,2 are adjacent, and 4,5 are adjacent. So the substituents are in a sort of "para" arrangement but with two substituents in each of two adjacent positions. Hmm, perhaps the structure is symmetric. Let me think about the aromatic protons.

Wait, in tetramethylbenzene, some positions may not have any protons if they're all substituted. Oh wait, wait! If it's 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, then the substituents are at positions 1,2,4,5. So the remaining positions are 3 and 6, each of which has a proton. So each of these positions has a proton. Are these protons equivalent?

In 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the ring has substituents at 1,2,4,5. So positions 3 and 6 each have one proton. But is position 3 equivalent to position 6? Let's see. The molecule should have a certain symmetry. If we have substituents at 1 and 2, and at 4 and5, the molecule might have a mirror plane. For example, if you rotate the ring 120 degrees, are the protons in 3 and 6 equivalent? Alternatively, considering the substituents at 1,2,4,5, perhaps the ring is symmetric with a plane between positions 3 and 6, making those two protons equivalent. So that would give one singlet for the aromatic protons because both are equivalent. So the aromatic region would show a singlet integrating for two protons.

Wait, but the NMR shows two singlets. So each compound in the mixture must have two different sets of equivalent aromatic protons, each as a singlet. But then, each compound contributes two singlets, but the mixture has two in total. Hmm, perhaps each compound contributes one singlet, and the other compound contributes another, so together they show two singlets.

Wait, let me consider each compound.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

First compound: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl. So substituents at 1,2,3,4. The remaining positions are 5 and 6. So each of these positions has a proton. Are the protons at 5 and 6 equivalent? Let's see. The substituents are in positions 1,2,3,4. So the ring is heavily substituted. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6, and position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1. Are 5 and 6 equivalent? I think in this case, perhaps not. Because the substituents on the ring create a dihedral angle that makes 5 and 6 not equivalent. So each of their protons would be in different environments, leading to two separate signals. So this compound would have two doublets or something, but if all aromatic protons are equivalent, perhaps not. Wait, wait, if all the aromatic protons are equivalent, perhaps it's not the case. Alternatively, maybe each compound has two different sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the substitution pattern.

In 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So the ring looks like this:

Positions:

1 (methyl)
2 (methyl)
3 (methyl)
4 (methyl)
5 (H)
6 (H)

So 5 and 6 each have a proton. Are these two protons equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. The substituents are in positions 1,2,3,4, which is a contiguous block of four substituents. That leaves positions 5 and 6. Is there any symmetry that would make 5 and 6 equivalent? Let me imagine rotating the ring: substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So if I rotate the ring 180 degrees, substituting 5 and 6 would swap. But the substituents are at 1,2,3,4 – so the ring has a certain symmetry. Wait, maybe the ring has a plane of symmetry that runs between 5 and 6, making their environments equivalent. So the two protons (5 and 6) are equivalent, leading to a singlet for the aromatic region integrating for two protons.

Similarly, let's look at the second compound in option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. So positions 4 and 6 have protons. Are positions 4 and 6 equivalent? Let me see. The substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So position 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5, while position 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. Are these environments equivalent? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think about the symmetry. If the substituents are at 1,2,3,5, maybe there's a plane of symmetry that would make positions 4 and 6 equivalent? Alternatively, perhaps not. I'm not sure. 

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the number of aromatic protons each compound has. Each tetramethylbenzene has 6-4=2 aromatic protons. So each has two aromatic protons. So in the NMR, each would contribute a singlet if those two protons are equivalent. So, if each compound has two equivalent aromatic protons, their signals would each be a singlet. But in the mixture, each would be present at 1:1, so their two singlets would add up, each integrating for 2 H. So the NMR would show two singlets, each for 2 H, which matches the data.

So each compound must have two equivalent aromatic protons. So looking at each option, I can eliminate those where the aromatic protons are not equivalent.

So let's analyze each option.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

In the first compound, substituents at 1,2,3,4. The aromatic protons are at 5 and 6. Are they equivalent? Yes, because the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the center, making 5 and 6 equivalent. So their protons would be a singlet.

In the second compound, substituents at 1,2,3,5. The aromatic protons are at 4 and 6. Are 4 and 6 equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. 1,2,3,5 are substituted. Position 4 is next to 3 and 5, position 6 is next to 1 and 5. Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that makes 4 and 6 equivalent? Hmm, I'm not so sure. Let me think about the symmetry. If I rotate the ring 120 degrees, would 4 go to 6? I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe there's no symmetry that makes 4 and 6 equivalent. So the two aromatic protons would be in different environments, giving two separate signals. But that would mean that the second compound in option A would have two signals, but the first would have one. So in the NMR, the mixture would have (from first compound) one singlet (2H) and (from second) two singlets (each 2H?), but the question states two singlets, so that can't be right. Hmm. So option A might not be correct.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

First compound: substituents at 1,2,4,5. Aromatic protons at 3 and 6. Are 3 and 6 equivalent? Let's imagine the structure. The substituents are 1,2,4,5. So the structure has a symmetry. If I rotate the ring 180 degrees, substituents 1 and 5 swap, 2 and 4 swap. So positions 3 and 6 would also swap. So the aromatic protons at 3 and 6 are equivalent. So their signals would be a singlet.

Second compound: substituents at 1,2,3,4. Aromatic protons at 5 and 6. Are they equivalent? Yes, as discussed earlier, so a singlet.

So each compound contributes one singlet in the aromatic region. So the mixture would show two singlets, each integrating for 2 H. That matches the data.

What about the other signals? The question also mentions three signals at ~2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So these are likely from the methyl groups attached to the benzene rings.

In each tetramethylbenzene, each methyl is attached to the ring. But depending on their positions, the methyl groups may be equivalent or not. Let's think about each compound.

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5.

The substituents are arranged such that 1 and 5 are opposite each other, and 2 and 4 are opposite each other. So the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, as are those at 2 and 4. Wait, no, because substituents at 1 and 5 are each attached to positions that are across from each other. So the methyl groups at 1 and 5 would be in equivalent environments, so their protons would be a singlet. Similarly, methyl groups at 2 and 4 would be equivalent, so their protons would be another singlet. But wait, in this case, there are four methyl groups: two pairs. So in the NMR, you would expect two singlets for the methyl groups, each integrating for 2 H (since each pair contributes 2 H each). But the question states three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. So that's a problem. Because option B's first compound would have two methyl signals (each 2 H), and the second compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene) would have how many signals?

In 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents are 1,2,3,4. The methyl groups at 1,2,3,4. Are any of these equivalent? Let's see. The substituents are in positions 1,2,3,4. So positions 1 and 4 are across from each other, and 2 and 3 are across from each other. So methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So in the NMR, this compound would have two singlets for the methyl groups: each integrating for 2 H. So in the mixture, each compound contributes two signals. So the total would be four signals, but the question says three signals. Hmm, so this can't be. So option B might not be correct.

Wait, but the mixture has a 1:1 ratio of the two compounds. So for the methyl groups, each compound contributes its own set of signals. Let's say compound 1 has two methyl signals (each 2 H), and compound 2 has two methyl signals (each 2 H). So the total would be four signals, but the question says three. So option B is likely not the answer.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Wait, diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups. So let's see. First compound is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. So substituents at 1,2,3,5. The aromatic protons are at 4 and 6. Are they equivalent? I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure. If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then positions 4 and 6 each have H. Are these H's equivalent? Perhaps not, because the substitution pattern might not create symmetry between them.

The second compound is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Each ethyl group is CH2CH3. The substituents are at 1 and 4, which are para positions. So the ethyl groups are across from each other. So the methyl groups in each ethyl may be in an equivalent environment. But each ethyl has two sets of H's: the CH2 and the terminal CH3. Let's think about the NMR.

In diethylbenzene, the ethyl groups are at 1 and 4 positions. Each ethyl group's CH2 would be adjacent to the benzene, and the CH3 would be at the end. The CH2 groups are attached to the ring, so their H's would be as a quartet or triplet, depending on coupling. But wait, since the two CH2 groups are equivalent (due to para substitution), their H's would be a singlet. Similarly, the CH3 groups are also equivalent, so their H's would be a singlet. So diethylbenzene would show two singlets: one for the CH2 (each CH2 has two H's, but multiplied by two because there are two ethyl groups), and another for the CH3 (each CH3 has three H's, times two). Wait, no. For CH2 groups, each ethyl has a CH2 with two H's. Since the two ethyl groups are equivalent, their CH2 H's would be a singlet integrating for 4 H (2 H per ethyl, two ethyls). Similarly, the CH3 groups are each three H's, so together 6 H, but as they're on equivalent ethyl groups, their H's would be a singlet as well. So diethylbenzene would have two singlets: one at ~1.2 ppm (CH3) and another at ~2.6 ppm (CH2). But the question's other signals are at 2.2 ppm, which is lower than that. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 adjacent to the benzene is more deshielded and appears around 2.2 ppm.

In the diethylbenzene, the CH2 group would be adjacent to the ring, so their H's might appear around 2.2 ppm as a singlet. The CH3 groups would perhaps appear as a singlet around 1.2 ppm. So in diethylbenzene, the NMR would show a singlet at ~2.2 ppm (4 H) and another at ~1.2 ppm (6 H). But the question's other signals are three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. So in the mixture, perhaps the first compound contributes some singlets at 2.2 ppm, and the diethyl contributes some.

Wait, the first compound in option C is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. So four methyl groups on the benzene. Let's consider their symmetry. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. Are any of these methyl groups equivalent? Let's see. The substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the methyl at 1 is next to 2 and 6. Methyl at 2 is next to 1,3. Methyl at 3 is next to 2 and 4. Methyl at 5 is next to 4 and 6. Are any of these methyl groups in equivalent environments? It's a bit unclear. Let's think: perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are in similar environments, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent. Hmm, I'm not sure. If the substituents are in this arrangement, maybe there are two types of methyl groups. For example, methyl at 1 and 5 might be equivalent, and methyl at 2 and 3 might be equivalent. So in the NMR, this would give two singlets: each integrating for 2 H (since each pair contributes 2 H). Wait, but in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, substituents are at four positions, so four methyl groups. If there are two pairs of equivalent methyl groups, each pair would contribute a singlet. So this would give two singlets in the NMR, each integrating for 2 H.

In the diethylbenzene, as we thought earlier, the NMR would show a singlet for the CH2 (4 H) and another for the CH3 (6 H). But the question's other signals are three singlets at 2.2 ppm. So perhaps the diethylbenzene's CH2 would appear as a singlet at around 2.2 ppm (4 H), and the CH3 would be at another ppm. But the question says all three signals are at 2.2 ppm. So that can't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm misremembering. Diethylbenzene's CH2 protons are adjacent to the ring and are typically around 2.5-2.6 ppm, while the CH3 are around 1.2 ppm. So if the question's signals at 2.2 ppm are all from CH3 groups, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the other option is incorrect, and I should think differently.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

First compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl. As discussed earlier, the aromatic protons at 3 and 6 are equivalent, giving a singlet. The methyl groups: substituents at 1,2,4,5. Are any methyl groups equivalent? Let's see. Methyl at 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Methyl at 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Methyl at 4 is adjacent to 5 and 3. Methyl at 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. So, perhaps methyl at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and methyl at 2 and 4 are equivalent. So each pair would contribute a singlet. So the NMR would show two singlets for the methyl groups: one integrating for 2 H (from 1 and 5) and another for 2 H (from 2 and 4). So for the first compound, two singlets at 2.2 ppm.

Second compound: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's think about its methyl groups. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. Are any methyl groups equivalent? Let's see: methyl at 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Methyl at 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Methyl at 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. Methyl at 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Hmm, perhaps methyl at 1 and 5 are in similar environments, and methyl at 2 and 3 are in similar environments. So this would also give two singlets for the methyl groups (each integrating for 2 H).

So for the mixture of compounds D, each contributes two singlets for methyl groups. So in the NMR, you'd have four signals. But the question states three signals. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Maybe one of the compounds has three types of methyl groups, leading to three singlets.

Wait, in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, are there any methyl groups that are not equivalent? Let me think again. The substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So methyl at 1: adjacent to 2 and 6. Methyl at 2: adjacent to 1 and 3. Methyl at 3: adjacent to 2 and 4. Methyl at 5: adjacent to 4 and 6. Are any of these equivalent? Maybe methyl at 1 and 5 are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. Similarly, methyl at 2 and 3 are equivalent? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the symmetry is such that there are two different methyl groups. So each would be a singlet. So two signals for methyl.

Wait, but the question says three signals at 2.2 ppm, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps one compound has two methyl signals, and the other has one, but that adds up to three.

Hmm, maybe the diethyl groups contribute a single methyl signal. Wait, no, diethylbenzene has two CH2 and two CH3 groups, but they are each equivalent, so two signals.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the other signals.

The question says the three signals at 2.2 ppm are all singlets and in a 2:1:1 ratio. So their integrals are 4, 2, and 2 protons, respectively. Wait, because 2:1:1 adds up to 4. So the total for these signals is 4 H? Or wait, the question says in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the first peak is twice the others. So perhaps the first is 4 H, and the others are 2 H each.

So, for the methyl groups, if the two compounds contribute their methyl signals, perhaps one compound has two types of methyl groups (each with 2 H), and the other has one type (4 H), but that's not possible because each substituent has four methyl groups. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Let me think of which compounds would have methyl groups that would lead to three singlets.

Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene has two types of protons: the CH2 and the CH3. So in the diethyl compound, you'd have two signals at 2.2 and 1.2 ppm. But the question's other signals are all at 2.2, so perhaps the CH2 is at 2.2, and the CH3 is elsewhere. But the question says three singlets at 2.2. So that's not fitting.

Wait, perhaps another compound has some other groups. Let me think of option C again. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

In the tetramethyl compound, the methyl groups might have two sets: perhaps two pairs of equivalent methyl groups, giving two singlets. The diethyl would have one CH2 and one CH3. So in the NMR, the tetramethyl would contribute two singlets (each 2 H), and the diethyl would contribute one CH2 (4 H) and one CH3 (6 H). But the question says three signals at 2.2 ppm, so perhaps the diethyl's CH2 is at 2.2 (4 H) and the CH3 is elsewhere. But then the other two signals would come from the tetramethyl's methyl groups. So that would give three signals at 2.2 ppm (from tetramethyl's two sets and diethyl's CH2), but that would require the tetramethyl to have two signals at 2.2, and the diethyl's CH2 also at 2.2. So the signals would be: 4 H (from CH2), 2 H (from first methyl), and 2 H (from second methyl). So their ratio would be 4:2:2, which is 2:1:1. That matches the question's description.

Ah, that makes sense. So the three signals at 2.2 ppm are 4 H (CH2), 2 H (methyl group 1), and 2 H (methyl group 2), giving a 2:1:1 ratio when considering the 1:1 mixture.

So in option C, the mixture would consist of:

- 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: has two types of methyl groups, each contributing 2 H, as singlets. So their signals would be 2 H each, but in the mixture, each would be present at 1:1, so 2 H for each.

- 1,4-diethylbenzene: contributes a CH2 group (4 H) as a singlet. The CH3 groups would be elsewhere.

Wait, but the question says all three signals are singlets at 2.2 ppm. So if the diethyl's CH2 is at 2.2 (4 H), and the tetramethyl's two methyl groups are also at 2.2 (each 2 H), then the three signals would be 4, 2, 2, which is a 2:1:1 ratio when you sum them (but wait, 4+2+2=8 H, but the mixture is 1:1, so each compound contributes 5 H for the methyl groups? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the integration wrong.

Wait, each compound in the mixture is 1:1, so each contributes 5 H? Because the molecular formula is C10H14, but wait, each compound has four methyl groups (each CH3) so 4*3=12 H, but wait, no, because each substituent is a methyl, but the aromatic H's are 2 per compound. So each compound has 4*3 (methyl) + 2 (aromatic) =14 H. So each contributes 14 H. So in the 1:1 mixture, the total is 28 H.

The aromatic signals sum to 4 H (2 from each compound), so the remaining 24 H are from the substituents.

The question says three signals at 2.2 ppm, summing to 8 H (4 from diethyl's CH2 and 2 each from the tetramethyl's two types of methyl). But wait, 4+2+2=8? That would require each signal to be 4, 2, 2. But the ratio would be 4:2:2, which is 2:1:1 when simplified.

So in option C, the diethyl contributes a singlet of 4 H (CH2), and the tetramethyl contributes two singlets of 2 H each. So the three signals at 2.2 ppm would be 4, 2, and 2, which is the 2:1:1 ratio. That fits.

So that would mean option C is the correct one.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C's first compound has two equivalent methyl groups, but maybe that's not the case. Let me recheck.

In 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are at positions 1,2,3,5. Are any methyl groups equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. Maybe the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are symmetrically placed, making them equivalent. Similarly, methyl groups at 2 and 3 might be equivalent. So each pair would be a singlet. So for this compound, two singlets at 2.2 ppm (each 2 H). 

The diethylbenzene contributes a singlet at 2.2 ppm for the CH2 (4 H). So together, the three signals would be 4 (CH2), 2 (methyl 1), 2 (methyl 2), giving a ratio of 2:1:1. That matches.

In the aromatic region, each compound contributes a singlet. The diethylbenzene would have aromatic protons? Wait, no, diethylbenzene has substituents at 1 and 4 (ethyl groups). So the remaining positions are 2,3,5,6. Each of these positions would have a proton. Wait, no. Let me think: benzene has six positions. Substituents at 1 and 4. So positions 2,3,5,6 have H. Are these H's equivalent?

In 1,4-diethylbenzene, the structure is symmetric. Positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. So each pair would have the same chemical shift. So the aromatic region would show two singlets: one integrating for 2 H (positions 2 and 6) and another for 2 H (positions 3 and 5). But the question's aromatic region shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio, each integrating for 2 H. So the diethylbenzene would contribute two singlets, but the tetramethylbenzene would contribute one singlet. Hmm, but the question says that the aromatic signals are two in total, not four. So this would be a problem because the mixture would have three aromatic signals: two from diethylbenzene and one from tetramethyl. But the question says two aromatic signals. So option C can't be correct because the diethylbenzene would lead to more signals.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate.

If the mixture is 1:1 of the two compounds, each contributing their own signals. But the aromatic region shows only two signals. So diethylbenzene can't be part of the mixture because it would add more signals. Thus, option C is incorrect.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try another approach. Let's think about each option's NMR.

Looking at the options again, the correct answer must have two compounds where each contributes a single singlet in the aromatic region, and their methyl groups contribute three singlets at 2.2 ppm.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

First compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl. Methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, at 2 and 4 are equivalent. So two singlets.

Second compound: 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl. Methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So two singlets.

So the mixture would have four singlets for the methyl groups, which doesn't fit the question's three signals.

Option D is not correct.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl.

First compound: two methyl singlets.

Second compound: two methyl singlets.

Again, four signals. Doesn't fit.

Option A: 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5.

Each contributes two methyl singlets. So four signals. Not matching.

So the only option left is option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl and 1,4-diethyl.

But earlier analysis suggested diethyl would contribute two aromatic signals, leading to more than two in the mixture.

Wait, maybe the diethylbenzene has all its aromatic protons equivalent, giving a single singlet. Let me think about that.

In 1,4-diethylbenzene, substituents are at 1 and 4. The remaining positions are 2,3,5,6. Are any of these equivalent? Let me think. If the substituents are at 1 and 4, the ring has a plane of symmetry. So positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets: 2 and 6 (each with a H) and 3 and 5 (each with a H). So the NMR would show two singlets in the aromatic region. But the question says the aromatic region has two singlets. So if the mixture is 1:1 of diethylbenzene and another compound, each contributing one singlet, the total would be three aromatic signals, which contradicts the question. So option C can't be correct.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The correct answer must have two compounds, each contributing a single singlet in the aromatic region, and their substituents' protons must combine to give three singlets at 2.2 ppm.

Let me think about option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

First compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl): aromatic H's are 3 and 6, equivalent, so one singlet.

Methyl groups: 1 and 5 are equivalent; 2 and 4 are equivalent. So two singlets for methyl, each 2 H.

Second compound (1,2,3,5-tetramethyl): aromatic H's are 4 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. So the remaining positions are 4 and 6. Are 4 and 6 equivalent? Let's see. If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then position 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5, and position 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. Are these environments equivalent? I think not. So the aromatic H's would be two separate signals, which would lead to more than two signals in the aromatic region. So this can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the aromatic H's in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let me think again: substituents at 1,2,3,5. So the ring might have a symmetry that makes positions 4 and 6 equivalent. For example, if you mirror the ring across a plane, positions 4 and 6 swap. So their environments might be equivalent. So their H's would be a singlet. If that's the case, then the second compound would contribute one singlet in the aromatic region. So the mixture would have two singlets, which matches the question.

In that case, the methyl groups for the second compound (1,2,3,5-tetramethyl) would have their own structure. Let's see: substituents at 1,2,3,5. So the methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. Are any of these equivalent? Let's think: perhaps methyl at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and methyl at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So two singlets for methyl groups.

So in option D, the first compound has two methyl singlets (each 2 H), and the second has two methyl singlets (each 2 H). So four signals in the NMR, but the question says three. So option D can't be.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the other signals. The three signals at 2.2 ppm are all singlets and in a 2:1:1 ratio.

What if one of the compounds has three different types of methyl groups? That would add three signals. But I don't think any of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has a singlet that integrates to 4 H, and the other has two singlets each integrating to 2 H. So in the NMR, you'd have 4, 2, 2.

Which compounds would do that?

Looking back, 1,4-diethylbenzene has a CH2 group (4 H) and a CH3 group (6 H). If the CH2 is at 2.2 ppm and the CH3 elsewhere, then the diethyl would contribute a singlet at 2.2 (4 H). The other compound (tetramethyl) would have two singlets each at 2.2, contributing 2 H each. So the three signals would be 4,2,2, which is a ratio of 2:1:1. That fits.

But earlier, I thought the diethyl would add two more aromatic signals, which would make the total aromatic signals four. But the question says only two. So perhaps the diethyl doesn't have two aromatic signals.

Wait, in 1,4-diethylbenzene, the aromatic protons are at 2,3,5,6. Are any of these equivalent? Let's see. If substituents are at 1 and 4, then positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. So each pair would have the same shift. So the aromatic region would show two singlets: one for 2 and 6 (each with a H, so 2 H), and another for 3 and 5 (each with a H, so 2 H). So the diethyl would contribute two singlets. But the question's aromatic region has two singlets in total. So if the mixture is 1:1 of diethyl and another compound, each contributing one singlet, the total would be three, which is not possible. Therefore, option C can't be the correct answer.

This is really complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another thought: the 1H NMR shows two singlets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 H. So each compound in the mixture contributes one singlet of 2 H. So each compound must have two equivalent aromatic protons.

Which of the options' compounds have two equivalent aromatic protons?

Looking at each option:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl (aromatic H's at 5 and 6, which are equivalent) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl (aromatic H's at 4 and 6, which may or may not be equivalent). Wait, if 4 and 6 are not equivalent, then the second compound would contribute two signals, leading to more than two in the mixture. So option A is not correct.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 (aromatic H's at 3 and 6, equivalent) and 1,2,3,4 (aromatic H's at 5 and 6, equivalent). So each contributes one singlet. So the mixture has two singlets, which fits.

But the methyl groups would contribute four signals, which doesn't fit the question.

Option C: 1,2,3,5 (aromatic H's at 4 and 6, perhaps not equivalent) and diethyl (aromatic H's at 2,3,5,6, which would have two singlets). So the mixture would have more than two aromatic signals, which doesn't fit.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 (aromatic H's at 3 and 6, equivalent) and 1,2,3,5 (aromatic H's at 4 and 6, equivalent). So each contributes one singlet. So the mixture has two singlets, which fits.

Now, the methyl groups in option D would be:

First compound: two singlets, each 2 H.

Second compound: two singlets, each 2 H.

So the NMR would show four signals, which doesn't fit the question's three signals.

Wait, but the question says three signals at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps one of the compounds has a singlet that is 4 H. But how?

Wait, if one of the compounds has a singlet that integrates to 4 H, and the other has two singlets each 2 H, then the three signals would be 4, 2, 2, which is a ratio of 2:1:1.

Which compound could have a singlet integrating to 4 H?

Only if it has four equivalent methyl groups. But all the tetramethyl compounds have four methyl groups, but they are in different positions, so they are not all equivalent. However, in some structures, the methyl groups may be equivalent.

Wait, let me think: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. The substituents are arranged symmetrically such that all four methyl groups are equivalent? No, because they are in different positions. Wait, perhaps in this structure, methyl groups 1 and 5 are equivalent, and 2 and 4 are equivalent. So two singlets, each 2 H.

But if somehow, the four methyl groups are all equivalent, then a single singlet of 4 H. But that's not the case here.

Another possibility: perhaps one of the compounds has three equivalent methyl groups and one different. But I don't think any of the options have that.

Alternatively, maybe one of the compounds has two methyl groups that are each split into two, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about which option's methyl groups would produce three signals at 2.2 ppm.

Option D: each compound contributes two signals, so four in total. Doesn't fit.

Option C: diethyl contributes one signal (4 H), and the tetramethyl contributes two signals (2 H each). So three signals, which fits.

But the aromatic region would require the diethyl to contribute two signals, leading to more than two. So this can't be.

Hmm. Perhaps only option B works. Let me think again.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

Each compound contributes two methyl singlets.

So in the mixture, four signals. But the question says three.

This is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different angle.

Wait, the other signals are three in number, at 2.2 ppm, 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps one of them is from a different type of group, like ethyl CH2.

But diethyl would give CH2 at 2.2 and CH3 elsewhere. So if the diethyl is part of the mixture, its CH2 would be a singlet at 2.2, and the methyl groups from the other compound would contribute two more singlets.

So, for example:

- CH2 (diethyl): 4 H.

- Methyl group 1 (tetramethyl): 2 H.

- Methyl group 2 (tetramethyl): 2 H.

So the three signals would be 4, 2, 2, which is a 2:1:1 ratio. That would fit.

But, as before, the diethyl would contribute two aromatic signals, which would make the total aromatic signals four (each of the two compounds contributes one each, plus diethyl's two), but the question says two. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the aromatic signals for diethyl. Let me think again. In diethylbenzene, substituents are at 1 and 4. The remaining positions are 2,3,5,6. Are any of these protons equivalent? Let me imagine the molecule. Positions 2 and 6 are across from each other, as are 3 and 5. So protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and protons at 3 and 5 are equivalent. So the aromatic region would have two singlets: one for 2 and 6 (2 H), and another for 3 and 5 (2 H). So the diethyl contributes two singlets. 

So if the mixture is 1:1 of diethyl and another compound that contributes one singlet, the total aromatic signals would be three (two from diethyl, one from the other). But the question says two, so that's a no-go.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think of each option's NMR.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl (aromatic H's at 4 and 6: perhaps not equivalent, so two signals) and diethyl (aromatic H's at 2,3,5,6: two signals). So the mixture would have four aromatic signals, which doesn't match.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 (aromatic H's at 3 and 6: one signal) and 1,2,3,5 (aromatic H's at 4 and 6: one signal). So the mixture would have two aromatic signals. That fits.

Now, the methyl groups:

1,2,4,5-tetramethyl has two methyl singlets (each 2 H).

1,2,3,5-tetramethyl has two methyl singlets (each 2 H).

So the mixture would have four signals, but the question says three. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups are arranged in such a way that all four are equivalent. But that's not possible; they are in different positions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps one of the compounds has a methyl group that is split into two due to coupling, but in the question, all signals are singlets. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option C, despite the earlier confusion. Let me think. If the diethylbenzene's aromatic H's are in two equivalent pairs, each giving a singlet, then the other compound (tetramethyl) would have aromatic H's in one equivalent pair, giving a singlet. So the mixture would have three aromatic signals, which contradicts the question.

Wait, perhaps the diethylbenzene's aromatic H's are all in one environment. That would require all four H's to be equivalent, which is not the case. So that's unlikely.

I think I've exhausted all options. The only option that fits the aromatic region with two singlets is option D, but the methyl groups don't fit. Alternatively, option C, but the aromatic region doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the aromatic H's for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let me think: substituents at 1,2,3,5. The remaining positions are 4 and 6. Are 4 and 6 equivalent? Let me imagine the molecule: substituents are at 1,2,3,5. Let's number the positions as follows:

1: methyl
2: methyl
3: methyl
5: methyl
So positions 4 and 6 have H's. Are they equivalent? Let me consider the symmetry. If you rotate the ring 120 degrees, does position 4 move to 6? I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes 4 and 6 equivalent. For that, the substituents would need to mirror across that plane. If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then the plane of symmetry would have to reflect 4 and 6. Let me see: the substituents at 1 and 5 are across from each other. Similarly, substituents at 2 and 3 are adjacent. Hmm, perhaps that's not leading to a plane of symmetry that would make 4 and 6 equivalent. So their H's would be different, leading to two signals in the aromatic region. So the compound would contribute two aromatic signals.

So, in option D, the first compound contributes one aromatic signal (from 3 and 6), and the second contributes two (from 4 and 6). So the mixture would have three aromatic signals, which is more than the question's two. So option D is out.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is option C, despite the earlier confusion about the aromatic region. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the answer that fits the methyl signals and aromatic signals correctly.

Wait, going back to the initial question: the aromatic region shows two singlets, each 2 H. So each compound must contribute one singlet.

Which of the options' compounds have only one set of aromatic H's?

1,2,4,5: one set (3 and 6).

1,2,3,4: one set (5 and 6).

1,2,3,5: two sets (4 and 6).

1,4-diethyl: two sets (2,6 and 3,5).

Thus, only option B's two compounds contribute one each, leading to two signals in the mixture. But their methyl groups would contribute four signals, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option D, and I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has aromatic H's at 4 and 6 that are equivalent, giving one signal.

If that's the case, then option D's two compounds each contribute one aromatic singlet, leading to two in the mixture.

As for the methyl groups, each compound contributes two singlets. But the question says three signals. So perhaps one of the compounds has two singlets that are overlapping, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the diethyl's CH2 is also in the same region as the methyl groups, adding another signal.

Wait, I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer is option D.


The question involves determining which two aromatic compounds are present in a 1:1 mixture based on the provided ¹H NMR data. The molecular formula of both compounds is C₁₀H₁₄, and the spectrum shows two singlets in the aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm, 1:1 ratio) and three singlets in the alkyl region (around 2.2 ppm, 2:1:1 ratio). Each option consists of two tetramethylbenzenes or a tetramethylbenzene and a diethylbenzene. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Region (6.7 ppm):**
   - Two singlets are observed, each integrating to 2 H, indicating that each compound contributes one set of equivalent aromatic protons.

2. **Alkyl Region (2.2 ppm):**
   - Three singlets are observed in a 2:1:1 ratio, corresponding to 4 H, 2 H, and 2 H. This suggests one compound contributes a singlet integrating to 4 H, and the other contributes two singlets, each integrating to 2 H.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Patterns:**
   - Each compound must have a structure that allows for equivalent aromatic protons and methyl groups that produce the observed NMR signals.

---

### Final Answer:

**Answer: C**
