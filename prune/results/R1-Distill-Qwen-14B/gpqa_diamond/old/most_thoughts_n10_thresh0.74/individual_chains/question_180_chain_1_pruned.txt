Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. So they're just point charges, I suppose.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. And we need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, but I'll try to figure it out myself first.

Hmm, so I'm thinking this is about electric potential energy. Because when you have multiple charges, their potential energy depends on their arrangement. Since it's an isolated system, I think the energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Wait, but since the 13th charge is fixed at P and the others are all at 2 meters away, I can imagine this as the central charge with 12 others arranged around it. But wait, no, they're just all at 2 meters from P, but maybe not arranged in any specific way beyond that.

So the system's potential energy would be the sum of all the pairwise potentials. But maybe there's a smarter way to think about it.

Each of the 12 charges at 2m contributes potential energy with the central charge (the 13th one fixed at P). Also, the 12 charges at 2m must have potential energy among themselves. But wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, so maybe their mutual distances are variable? Or maybe they're all fixed at the same point 2m away. Hmm, that's unclear.

Wait, the problem says "12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So each of these 12 is at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other aren't specified. Oh, but the system is isolated, so maybe we have to consider all the interactions.

Wait, but the system
