Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the orbital distance.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which is found using the radial velocity (RV) method. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 is more massive—twice as massive as Planet_2's star. Oh wait, but the stars have the same size. Hmm, more massive stars can be larger, but in this case, their radii are the same. So maybe they are main-sequence stars, but the more massive one is perhaps a bit bigger? Or maybe one is evolved, like a subgiant or something. But the question says Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so Planet_1's host is probably a main-sequence star, maybe.

We need to find which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability of transit depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, I think the actual formula is R_star / a, because the planet's size is much smaller than the star. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_p/R_*)^2 )^(1/2), but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it approximates to (R_* / a) * something small. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1-e²))) ), but since the orbits are circular, eccentricity e is zero, so it's just R_* / a.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit (from the star) divided by the semi-major axis, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get the formula right.

I think the probability is given by (R_*/a) * (some function of the orbital inclination). Wait, but actually, the transit probability is the fraction of the orbit where the planet would pass in front of the star, which depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance. The formula is approximately (R_*/a) * (1 + R_*/(2a)), but when a is much larger than R_*, which it usually is, this simplifies to R_*/a. So the probability of transit is roughly proportional to R_*/a.

Wait, but another factor comes in: the inclination. The probability that the inclination is such that the planet transits is 1/(sqrt(1 + (a/(R_*) )^2 ))... Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a transit is (R_*/a) divided by (sqrt(1 - (b)^2)), where b is the impact parameter, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the probability is (R_* + R_p) / (a) * something else. Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_*)/(a) * (something like 1/(sqrt(1 - (R_*/a)^2))). Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe I should look up the formula, but since I can't, I'll try to think it through.

Wait, another approach: the probability that a planet transits is the ratio of the area of the circle (from the star's perspective) where the planet can be in front of the star, divided by the total area of the orbit. Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Alternatively, the transit probability is given by (R_*/a) * (1 + R_*/(2a)) ), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, I think the key factor is that the probability is proportional to (R_*/a) when the orbital distance is much larger than the star's radius, which is usually the case.

But wait, perhaps the correct formula is (R_*)/(a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - (R_* / a)^2)) ). But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the factors that affect it.

In this question, we have two planets around stars with same radii, but different masses. Let's focus on the factors affecting transit probability. Since both stars have same radius (R1 = R2), and the planets are same mass. But their orbital periods are different. The RV method gives the minimum mass, but since both have same masses, perhaps their semi-major axes are different.

Wait, the orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. The period P is given by (P^2) = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) ) a^3. Since the planets' masses are much less than their stars, M_* >> M_p, so we can approximate P^2 = (4π²/(G M_*)) a^3. So a^3 = (G M_* P^2)/(4 π²). So a is proportional to (M_* P^(2))^(1/3).

But wait, for Planet_1, its period is P1 = P2/3. Its star has mass 2 M2, because M1 = 2 M2.

Wait, let's compute the semi-major axes for both planets.

For Planet_1, period P1 = P2 / 3. Its host star mass is M1 = 2 M2.

So a1^3 = (G * M1 * P1²) / (4 π²) = (G * 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2) ) / (4 π²)

Similarly, a2^3 = (G * M2 * P2^2) / (4 π²)

So a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2 M2) * (P2² /9) ) ] / [ M2 * P2² ) ] = (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.

Thus, a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

Compute 2/9 = 0.2222. Cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.6. Let me compute more accurately. 0.6^3=0.216, which is close to 0.2222, so a1 ≈ 0.6 * a2.

Wait, wait, let me compute 2/9= (approx) 0.2222. The cube root is 0.2222^(1/3). Hmm, 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is very close. So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.
