Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, let me think. So, the question gives a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a later time t (t > tr, where tr is the time when the field was generated). 

I remember that when charges are moving, we have to consider both the scalar and vector potentials. The potentials are usually expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity. 

Wait, the scalar potential V is typically given by the Coulomb potential divided by some term involving the distance and maybe the velocity. Oh right! For a stationary charge, V is just (q)/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the point where we're measuring the potential. But when the charge is moving, things get a bit more complicated. I think you have to account for the retarded time or something like that.

Wait, but looking at the options, they don't seem to involve the position of the charge at time t, but rather at an earlier time tr. So I guess the formula accounts for the fact that the field at time t is due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr. 

I remember something about the scalar potential for a moving charge being the same as the static case but evaluated at the retarded time. Or maybe it's a bit different. Oh wait, no. The scalar potential for a moving charge is actually the same as the static case because it's a scalar and doesn't depend on direction, but the vector potential does depend on the velocity.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you have a time-varying charge distribution, the potentials can involve both the charge and current distributions. The vector potential comes from the current, which is due to the charge's motion.

Wait, the general expressions for potentials in the Lorenz gauge are:

V(r,t) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ (ρ(r', t')) / |r - r'| dt'
A(r,t) = (μ₀/(4π)) ∫ (J(r', t') × (r - r')) / |r - r'|² dt'

But for a point charge, ρ is a delta function at the charge's position, and J is the current density, which
