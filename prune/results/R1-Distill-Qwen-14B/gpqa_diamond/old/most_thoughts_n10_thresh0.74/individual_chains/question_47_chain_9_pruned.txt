Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2. There are four options given, and I need to use the provided spectroscopic data to figure out which one it is.

First, let me look at the data given. The IR spectrum has medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. I remember that strong absorption around 3400 usually indicates either an amine (N-H stretch) or an alcohol (O-H stretch). But the presence of two bands close together might suggest something else. Wait, another possibility is O-H from a carboxylic acid, but those are usually broader. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, which has N-H stretches. But amide N-H are usually in the range of 3300-3500 cm⁻¹, and they can have multiple peaks because of the different hydrogen bonding possibilities. Hmm.

The IR also shows a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a region where carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb. The exact position can tell me about the type of carbonyl. For example, a ketone is around 1715, an ester a bit lower, maybe 1735? Wait, wait, wait. No, wait, let me think. Esters and amides have different carbonyl stretches. Esters are around 1730-1740, maybe a bit lower. Amides are lower because of resonance, like 1680-1700. Wait, but wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me get this straight: Esters, ketones, and aldehydes are higher, like 1700s? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I think the order is: aldehydes and ketones absorb around 1700-1750, esters around 1735-1765, maybe a bit higher. Wait, no, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think. Actually, I've heard that esters typically have a strong peak around 1740-1750 cm⁻¹. Amides
