Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Then, there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

Hmm, okay, so both compounds have the formula C10H14. Let me think about the possible structures. The options are all tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes diethylbenzene. Wait, what's the molecular formula for each?

So each of the tetramethylbenzenes would have a benzene ring (C6H5) plus four methyl groups (each -CH3). So the formula would be C6H5-(CH3)4. Let me calculate that: C6 + 4 C = C10. For H: benzene is C6H5 (5 H), each methyl has 3 H, so 4 *3 =12. So total H is 5 +12 =17. Wait, but the molecular formula given is C10H14. So that doesn't add up. Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, benzene has 6 H, but when substituents are attached, the number of H changes. For example, in para-xylene, it's two methyl groups attached to benzene. Each methyl is CH3, so two of them would be 2*3=6 H from methyl. The benzene ring would have 4 H (since two positions are taken). So total H is 4 +6 =10. So for a mono-substituted benzene with one methyl, it's 5 H on benzene and 3 from methyl, so 8 H. But in the problem, each compound is C10H14. Let me compute.

So, each compound is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So the substituents contribute 4 C and 8 H (since 6 H are in benzene, and 6 +8 =14). Wait, no, substituent's formula: each substituent is a group attached to the benzene. Let's think about substituents.

Wait, if the molecular formula is C10H14, that's 10 carbons and 14 hydrogens. Benzene is C6H6. So the substituents contribute 4 C and 8 H (since 14-6=8 H). Each substituent would be a group that adds (4 C, 8 H). Let me see what that is.

Wait, each substituent is probably a methyl group. Because four methyl groups would contribute 4 C and 4*3=12 H. Wait, but 6 H from benzene plus 12
