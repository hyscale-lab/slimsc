Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and NMR spectroscopy.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, creating product 1. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction—probably an E2 mechanism—to form an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Hmm, does that change anything?

Well, if the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH could lead to dehydrohalogenation. But wait, each Br is on a different carbon, not adjacent. Oh, but adamantane has a diamondoid structure—a very rigid, cage-like structure. So the positions might allow for elimination even if they're not adjacent. Wait, no, elimination typically occurs when the halogens are on adjacent carbons. If the dihalide is 1,3, perhaps two eliminations can happen, but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: KOH in such conditions can lead to elimination, but sometimes if there's a possibility of forming a more substituted (more stable) alkene, that's favored. Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so the resulting product after elimination would be an adamantyl derivative with a double bond.

Looking at the product's NMR: there's a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably from an -OH group or maybe an ether. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxidation usually involves peracids. Or perhaps it's a diol? But the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Oh wait, maybe it's an elimination product. Alternatively, if it's a diol, maybe it's an vicinal diol—like an epoxide opening? But wait, no, because that would require an epoxide and acid or base. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When treated with KOH, each Br could be eliminated. But for each elimination, we lose HBr. If both Brs are eliminated, perhaps each adjacent to a bridgehead, but wait, that's a possibility.

Wait, another angle: the product is a light yellow solid. That makes me think of something like a ketone, perhaps. Because sometimes when elimination happens, you can form a carbonyl. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes. Oh, wait—maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a ring-opening or something else. Or perhaps it's a substitution followed by elimination.

Wait, another thought. When vicinal dihalides (1,2-dihalides) react with KOH, they form alkenes. But for 1,3-dihalides, perhaps two elimination steps could lead to the formation of a conjugated diene, but in adamantane, maybe the structure doesn't allow that. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated separately, but that would require each Br to lose a beta H. Hmm.

Wait, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the product after KOH treatment must have a carbonyl group. That suggests that the product is a ketone or an aldehyde. But given the starting material is a dihalide, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: when dihalides are treated with a base, sometimes they can form epoxides if the base is a strong enough base to abstract a proton and form an oxide. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is undergoing a double elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, perhaps it's a Hoffman elimination or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a double substitution, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The product 1 has an NMR with 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a region where -OCH2 groups appear, like in ethers or epoxides. But the IR is 1720 cm-1, which is more like a ketone. Wait, so maybe the 4.79 is an -OH group as in a diol. But wait, diols typically show broad peaks around 1-5 ppm, but maybe in a cyclic structure,
