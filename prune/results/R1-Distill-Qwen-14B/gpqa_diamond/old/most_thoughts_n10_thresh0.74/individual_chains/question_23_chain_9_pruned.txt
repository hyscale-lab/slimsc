Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's read through the question again and break it down.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, meaning the reaction was proceeding, and two new spots appeared, indicating two products.

I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they typically undergo an addition reaction, probably via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. The structure given is an ether where the oxygen is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl group is substituted with two methyl groups on the second carbon, so the structure should look like this: 

The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me draw that structure quickly. So, the butenyl group is four carbons, double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (if I count from the oxygen), but wait, actually but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4 of the butenyl chain. Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would mean the double bond starts at the third carbon. Wait, but wait, butene has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2 but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no. Let me think: The structure is CH2-CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph? No, wait. The correct structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph? Wait, no. Let me think again. But-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, but the numbering. Let me imagine the butenyl as four carbons. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So positions are 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH2? But that can't be right because the double bond can't be at position 3 in a four-carbon chain. Oh wait, but in butene, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but but-2-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, but-2-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: The butenyl group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph? Wait, but that would be a five-carbon chain, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be:

The structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C
