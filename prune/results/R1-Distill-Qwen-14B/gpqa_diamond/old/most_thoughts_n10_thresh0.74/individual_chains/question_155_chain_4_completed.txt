Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the uncertainty of P_z given a specific state. Hmm, I've studied some of this before, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to think through it.

The problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I remember that the uncertainty of an observable, like P_z, is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for this state.

Wait, the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are given in matrix form. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, I can probably work directly in this basis. So the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, which might make things easier because the matrix for P_z in this basis is diagonal. Let me check the matrix form of P_z given.

P_z matrix:
First row: ħ, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -ħ

So diagonal, yes. That means that when I apply P_z to a basis vector |ψ_i>, it just gives ħ_i times |ψ_i>. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ for the three basis states, let's say |1>, |2>, |3>.

The given state is a column vector ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ). Let me verify that this is a normalized vector. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.

Calculating:

( (-1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/√2)^2 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 ) = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 makes 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So the state is a linear combination of the basis vectors: |ψ> = a|1> + b|2> + c|3>, where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z in this state. Since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is just the sum of |a|^2 * (eigenvalue for |1>) + |b|^2 * (eigenvalue for |2>) + |c|^2 * (eigenvalue for |3>).

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalues are for each state. So |1> has eigenvalue ħ, |2> has 0, |3> has -ħ.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = |a|^2 * ħ + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

Calculating each term:

|a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So (1/4) * ħ.

|b|^2 is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. So 1/2 * 0 = 0.

|c|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So (1/4) * (-ħ) = - ħ/4.

Adding them: (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is 0.

Next, I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared is the same as the square of each eigenvalue because the matrix is diagonal. So the eigenvalues become (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2, which are all ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is |a|^2 * ħ² + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * ħ².

Which is (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4) * ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ) = sqrt( ( (1/2) ħ² ) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, so that's the uncertainty. Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Another approach: since the state is given, perhaps I should compute P_z acting on the state, then find the expectation. But since P_z is diagonal, it's easier as I did before, but just to confirm.

Alternatively, the matrix form of P_z is diagonal, so to compute the expectation, I can take the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by P_z, then multiply by the state vector.

But since the state is in the eigenbasis, it's easier to compute from the coefficients.

Wait, another thought: what if I compute it directly. Let's represent the state as a column vector: ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ† P_z ψ.

Which would be the sum over the elements. Since P_z is diagonal, each element is only non-zero at the diagonal.

So, the first element is (-1/2)* (P_z [1,1]) * (-1/2). Then the second element is (1/√2) * (P_z [2,2]) * (1/√2). Third element is (-1/2) * P_z [3,3] * (-1/2).

Wait, no. Actually, ψ† is the row vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]. When multiplied by P_z, which is diagonal with elements [ ħ, 0, -ħ ], we first get [ -1/2 * ħ, 1/√2 * 0, -1/2 * (-ħ) ].

Wait, no, actually, matrix multiplication is (ψ†) P_z is a row vector where each element is the product of ψ† and each column of P_z. But since P_z is diagonal, each column has a single non-zero element.

So, for the first element: (-1/2) * ħ.
Second element: (1/√2) * 0.
Third element: (-1/2) * (-ħ) = (1/2) ħ.

Then, when I multiply this row vector by ψ, which is a column vector, it's summing the products: [ (-1/2 ħ) * (-1/2) ) + (0) * (1/√2) + ( (1/2) ħ ) * (-1/2 ) ].

Wait, that would be: ( ( (-1/2) ħ ) * (-1/2) ) + 0 + ( (1/2) ħ * (-1/2) ) = ( (1/4) ħ ) + 0 + ( (-1/4) ħ ) = 0. Which matches my earlier calculation.

So, the expectation is zero.

Now, for ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z^2 is a diagonal matrix with entries (ħ^2, 0, ħ^2). So, the same approach as before.

Compute ψ† P_z² ψ.

Each diagonal element is squared.

So, ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

Multiply by P_z², which has diagonal elements [ ħ², 0, ħ² ]

So, ψ† P_z² is [ (-1/2) * ħ², (1/√2)*0, (-1/2)* ħ² ] = [ (-ħ²/2), 0, (-ħ²/2) ]

Multiply this by ψ: [ (-ħ²/2) * (-1/2) ) + (0) * (1/√2) + ( (-ħ²/2) * (-1/2) ) ]

Each term: (ħ²/4) + 0 + (ħ²/4) = ( ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 ) = ħ²/2.

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Thus, the uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$ ($\langle P_z \rangle$)
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The matrix form of $P_z$ is diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$. The squared magnitudes are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$ ($\langle P_z^2 \rangle$)
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the squared magnitudes:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$ and $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
