Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident about reaction mechanisms, especially with all these steps. Let me try to break it down.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage with multiple rings. So dibromine would be on carbons 1 and 3. When heated with excess KOH, that's probably an elimination reaction, maybe dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so E2 mechanism perhaps.

Wait, but with two bromines on adjacent carbons? Wait, 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are on carbons that are across from each other in the adamantane structure. So when KOH is used, maybe it abstracts a beta proton, leading to the elimination of HBr twice. So from each Br, perhaps forming a double bond each time. Wait, but wait—could it form a diene? Or maybe a ring expansion?

Hold on, the product is a light yellow solid. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm, which is around where an ether or an epoxide might be. Oh, wait, but wait, KOH and dibromide—maybe it's an epoxide formation? No, wait, epoxides are usually formed by peracids. Or, wait, maybe elimination leads to an alkene, and then something else.

Wait the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that suggests a ketone or an ester or maybe a carbonate. But with KOH and dibromides, maybe it's a formation of a ketone via elimination. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, each from adjacent carbons, that could form a conjugated diene? But then why the IR would show a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is removed, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl group. Wait, but how? For each Br, say, if elimination occurs, but that's usually for one Br. Wait, wait, maybe it's a double elimination. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH—could it undergo dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a vicinal dihalide would eliminate to form an alkyne, but that’s usually with metals like sodium. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the IR.

Wait, wait. Another thought: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes two elimination reactions, each losing HBr, perhaps forming a cyclohexene or something. But then, where is the carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe each Br is on adjacent carbons of a bridge, and elimination forms a bridged diene or something else. Alternatively, wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone. Because the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which could be adjacent to a carbonyl. Maybe it's a geminal diol that dehydrates to form a ketone.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think about the product. After KOH heating, the product is 1. So let's consider that.

If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, perhaps it forms an epoxide. But wait, an epoxide would have two adjacent oxygen atoms, but I'm not sure how that would form from KOH and two bromides.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a substitution. Wait, but with excess KOH, perhaps elimination is more likely.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me consider the IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So perhaps the two bromides undergo elimination, forming a ketone.

Wait, but how? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adam
