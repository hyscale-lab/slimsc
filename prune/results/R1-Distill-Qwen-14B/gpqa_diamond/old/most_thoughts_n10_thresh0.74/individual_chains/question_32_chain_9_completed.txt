Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons, so I think that's Li-6, right? Because Lithium usually has 3 protons, and with 3 neutrons, that makes 6 nucleons total.

Okay, so the problem is asking for the energy of the nucleus. I remember from my studies that the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by its rest mass energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0c². So I need to find gamma first.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So the formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). The speed v here is 0.96c, so let me plug that in.

Calculating that: v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². Let's compute 0.96 squared. 0.96*0.96 is 0.9216. So v² = 0.9216 c². Then, 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Taking the square root of 0.0784. Hmm, square root of 0.0784. Let me think: 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28.

Calculating that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me check: 0.28 * 3.5714 is about 1, right? 0.28 * 3 = 0.84, and 0.28 * 0.5714 is about 0.16, so 0.84 + 0.16 is 1. So yes, gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass of a nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, right? But wait, sometimes people use approximate mass values or the molar mass. Let me think: the atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.6605e-27 kg. But I might need the mass of Li-6 in kg to compute the energy in GeV.

Wait, but maybe there's a shortcut. The mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So each proton and neutron contributes roughly 938 MeV. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass energy would be 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So the rest mass energy m0c² is 5.628 GeV. Then, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by this, so 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV. Let me do that multiplication.

Wait, 3.5714 times 5.628. Let me break it down:

3 *5.628 =16.884
0.5714 *5.628 ≈ let's compute that: 0.5 *5.628=2.814; 0.0714*5.628≈0.403. So total is 2.814+0.403=3.217. So total E is approximately 16.884 +3.217=20.101 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 3.5714 *5.628 GeV.

Alternatively, 3.5714 is approximately 25/7, because 25 ÷7 is about 3.5714. So maybe I can compute 25/7 *5.628. Let me compute 5.628 *25 = 140.7, then divide by 7: 140.7 /7 = 20.1 GeV. So that's about 20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options: option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I account for the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus? Because using 6 *938 MeV is an approximation. The exact mass might be a bit different because the binding energy and other factors come into play, but I think for this problem, using 6 nucleons each at 938 MeV is acceptable.

Alternatively, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.017 atomic mass units. Let me check: 6.017 u. Let's compute that. 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.017 u is 6.017 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6 times 931.5 is 5589 MeV. 0.017 *931.5 is about 15.8355 MeV. So total is 5589 +15.8355 = 5604.8355 MeV, which is 5.6048 GeV. So m0c² is approximately 5.6048 GeV.

Then gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714286.

So E = gamma * m0c² = 3.5714286 *5.6048 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.5714286 *5.6048.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.6048 =16.8144

0.5714286 *5.6048.

Wait, 0.5714286 is approximately 4/7. Let me compute 4/7 *5.6048.

5.6048 /7 = 0.8006857. Multiply by 4: 3.202743.

So 16.8144 +3.202743 = 20.017143 GeV.

Hmm, so approximately 20.017 GeV. The options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So 20.017 is close to option C (20.132) but a little less. Wait, but perhaps my approximation for m0c² was a bit off.

Wait, let me get the exact mass of Li-6. Let's check: the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017293 u. So 6.017293 u *931.5 MeV/u = ?

6.017293 *931.5 = let's compute that.

6 *931.5=5589

0.017293 *931.5: 0.01 *931.5=9.315; 0.007293 *931.5 ≈ 6.8013. So total is 9.315 +6.8013=16.1163.

Total m0c² is 5589 +16.1163 =5605.1163 MeV, which is 5.6051 GeV.

So gamma is 1/(1 - (0.96)^2 )^0.5.

Wait, (0.96)^2 is 0.9216, so 1-0.9216 is 0.0784. sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857...

So E = 3.57142857 *5.6051 GeV.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6051:

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6051 = ?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0051 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.0182143.

So total is approximately 2.142857142 +0.0182143= 2.1610714.

So 17.85714285 +2.1610714 =20.01821425 GeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 20.018 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy? Did I do something wrong in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.6051 more accurately.

Another approach: Let's break it down.

3.57142857 = 25/7.

So 25/7 multiplied by 5.6051.

25 *5.6051 = 140.1275.

Then divide by 7: 140.1275 /7 =20.018214.

So E is approximately 20.018 GeV.

Looking back, the options are C)20.132 and D)21.419. So 20.018 is closer to 20.018, but the option C is 20.132. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is not 6.017293 u. Let me double-check that. I think the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017293 atomic mass units. Let me confirm from a table: yes, the standard value is around 6.017293 u. So that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should be using exact calculations without approximations. Let's compute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784).

What is sqrt(0.0784)? 0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.57142857...

Now, the rest energy is m0*c² =6.017293 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Let me compute that precisely.

6.017293 *931.5:

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.017293 *931.5 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.007293 *931.5.

Compute 0.007*931.5=6.5205.

0.000293 *931.5 ≈0.272 (since 0.000293 *900=0.2637, 0.000293 *31.5≈0.00924, total ~0.2729).

So 6.5205 +0.2729 ≈6.7934.

So 0.017293 *931.5 ≈9.315 +6.7934=16.1084.

So total m0c² is 5589 +16.1084=5605.1084 MeV, which is 5.6051084 GeV.

So then E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.6051084 GeV.

Let me compute this:

3 *5.6051084 =16.8153252.

0.57142857 *5.6051084.

Let me compute 0.5 *5.6051084 =2.8025542.

0.07142857 *5.6051084.

0.07 *5.6051084=0.392357588.

0.00142857 *5.6051084≈0.00799714.

Adding those: 0.392357588 +0.00799714≈0.400354728.

So 0.57142857 *5.6051084 ≈2.8025542 +0.400354728=3.202908928.

So total E is 16.8153252 +3.202908928=20.01823413 GeV.

So approximately 20.0182 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV. But wait, that's a bit higher than my calculation. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the relativistic mass correctly. Oh wait no, because in relativity, the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, which I think I did correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the gamma calculation is different. Wait, v is 0.96c, so beta is 0.96. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.57142857.

Wait, maybe I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1/(sqrt(0.0784)).

Wait, 0.0784 is exactly (0.28)^2, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 =3.57142857.

Hmm, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the rest mass calculation. Let me compute 5.6051084 GeV *3.57142857.

Wait, 5.6051084 *3 =16.8153252.

5.6051084 *0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is 4/7.

So 5.6051084 *4 =22.4204336.

22.4204336 /7 =3.202919086.

So adding 16.8153252 and 3.202919086 gives 20.01824428 GeV.

So approximately 20.0182 GeV.

Looking at the options, the only one in the vicinity is option C)20.132 GeV and option D is higher. Hmm, but 20.018 is about 20.018, but option C is 20.132. That's a difference of about 0.114 GeV, which is 114 MeV. That's a significant difference, so perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me check a more precise source. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017293275 u.

Wait, let me compute 6.017293275 * 931.5 MeV/u.

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.017293275 *931.5.

Compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.007293275 *931.5.

0.007 *931.5=6.5205.

0.000293275 *931.5 ≈0.000293275 *900=0.2639475, and 0.000293275*31.5=0.0092518625. So total is approximately 0.2639475 +0.0092518625=0.27319936.

So 0.007293275 *931.5 ≈6.5205 +0.2732=6.7937.

So 0.017293275 *931.5 =9.315 +6.7937=16.1087.

Total m0c²=5589 +16.1087=5605.1087 MeV=5.6051087 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6051087 GeV.

3.57142857 *5.6051087 = ?

Let me compute this with more precision.

Alternatively, perhaps using exact multiplication:

3.57142857 *5.6051087.

I can compute this as (357142857/100,000,000) * (56051087/10,000,000), but that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Let me try:

3.57142857 *5.6051087.

= (3 +0.57142857) *5.6051087

=3*5.6051087 +0.57142857 *5.6051087.

3 *5.6051087=16.8153261.

0.57142857 *5.6051087:

Let me compute 0.5 *5.6051087=2.80255435.

0.07142857 *5.6051087=?

0.07 *5.6051087=0.392357609.

0.00142857 *5.6051087≈0.00799714.

So 0.392357609 +0.00799714≈0.400354749.

So 0.57142857 *5.6051087≈2.80255435 +0.400354749=3.202909099.

So total E=16.8153261 +3.202909099=20.0182352 GeV.

So about 20.0182 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's about 0.114 GeV higher than my result. Why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the gamma. Let me recheck that.

v =0.96c.

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

(0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is actually higher than I thought. Let me check a precise table. Oh wait, perhaps I should consider that the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.017293275 u, which I used, so that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider the actual binding energy or the fact that the nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons with their own binding energies. But in this calculation, since we're using the atomic mass, which already incorporates the binding energy, I think that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a proton and 3 neutrons, but wait, Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons total. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, maybe the calculation wants the total energy including kinetic energy. Oh wait, but the total energy E in relativity includes rest mass energy plus kinetic. So yeah, E=gamma m0 c² is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is 20.132 GeV, which is option C. My calculation is about 20.018 GeV, which is about 20.018. The options have option C as 20.132, which is about 0.114 GeV higher. So perhaps I missed something in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.6051087 precisely.

Let me do it step by step.

3.57142857 *5.6051087.

Let me compute 3 *5.6051087 =16.8153261.

0.57142857 *5.6051087.

Compute 0.57142857 *5 =2.85714285.

0.57142857 *0.6051087.

Wait, 0.5 *0.6051087=0.30255435.

0.07142857 *0.6051087≈0.043293.

So 0.30255435+0.043293=0.345847.

So 0.5 *5.6051087=2.80255435.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to compute 0.57142857 *5.6051087 = (0.5 + 0.07142857) *5.6051087.

0.5 *5.6051087=2.80255435.

0.07142857 *5.6051087≈0.400354749.

So total is 2.80255435 +0.400354749=3.202909099.

So 3.57142857 *5.6051087 =16.8153261 +3.202909099=20.0182352 GeV.

Hmm, so that's precise.

Wait, maybe the problem uses the exact value of gamma. Let me compute gamma with more precision.

v=0.96c, so beta=0.96.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.571428571428571.

Wait, but perhaps using more precise numbers, like beta=0.96 -> beta²=0.9216, so 1 - beta²=0.0784.

But perhaps the exact value of gamma is 3.5714285714.

So perhaps I should compute 3.5714285714 *5.6051087 precisely.

So 5.6051087 *3.5714285714 =?

I can do this using decimal multiplication.

Let me write it as:

5.6051087
*3.5714285714
=?

But that's tedious. Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

5.6051087 *3.5714285714.

Let me approximate this.

Let me compute 5.6051087 *3.5714285714.

Approximate 5.6051087 *3.5714285714 as:

=5.6051087 * (3 +0.5 +0.0714285714)

=5.6051087 *3 =16.8153261.

5.6051087 *0.5 =2.80255435.

5.6051087 *0.0714285714 ≈5.6051087 * (1/14) ≈0.400365.

Adding all together:16.8153261 +2.80255435=19.61788045.

Plus 0.400365:19.61788045 +0.400365=20.01824545 GeV.

So about 20.0182 GeV.

Hmm, so option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher than my calculation. Perhaps the problem expects me to use a different value for the mass, like the mass of the nucleus being (3 protons +3 neutrons) without considering binding energy. Let's see:

Each proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3 protons: 3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons:3 *939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total:2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So m0c²=5.633511 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute that:

3*5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5*5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511≈0.40466.

So 2.8167555 +0.40466≈3.2214155.

Total E=16.900533 +3.2214155=20.1219485 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.122 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Ah, so perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the rest mass as the sum of protons and neutrons without considering binding energy. That makes the rest mass energy higher, which brings the total energy higher.

So in that case, the rest mass is 5.6335 GeV, multiplied by gamma 3.5714 gives E=20.122 GeV, which rounds to 20.122, very close to option C (20.132).

So the correct answer would be option C)20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a Li-6 nucleus traveling at 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 c^2 \) is the rest mass energy of the nucleus, and \( v = 0.96c \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( v = 0.96c \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Rest Mass Energy of Li-6
The rest mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.017293 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.017293 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5605.11 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6051 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Total Energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6051 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.6051 \approx 2.161
\]

\[
E \approx 17.857 + 2.161 = 20.018 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Refining the Rest Mass Energy
If the rest mass energy is calculated as the sum of individual protons and neutrons (without binding energy), the rest mass energy becomes:

\[
m_0 c^2 = (3 \times 938.272 + 3 \times 939.565) \, \text{MeV} \approx 5633.51 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Recomputing the total energy:

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}
\]

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.6335 \approx 2.264
\]

\[
