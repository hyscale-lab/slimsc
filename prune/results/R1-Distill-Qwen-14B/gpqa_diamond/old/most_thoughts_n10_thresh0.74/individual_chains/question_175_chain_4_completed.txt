Okay, so I've got this physics problem about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30°, and the possible form of f.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with a fraction and a λ dependence.

First, I remember that when a charge oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since this is spheroidal and symmetric along z, maybe the radiation pattern has some symmetry too. Probably, the dipole radiation comes into play because oscillating charges often lead to dipole-like radiation.

Wait, dipole radiation... I think the power radiated by a dipole varies with the angle θ. The radiation pattern for a dipole antenna is a classic example. The power radiated in a particular direction depends on the cosine of the angle. Oh right, for a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator (θ=90°) and minimum along the axis (θ=0° or 180°). The formula for the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (sinθ)^2, I think. Or wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh, no, dipole radiation has a pattern where the intensity is maximum at θ=90°, and it goes as sin²θ. But the actual formula for the intensity (which is the power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2, so the maximum is when sinθ is 1, which is θ=90°. So at θ=30°, what's the fraction?

Wait, the question says that the maximum power is A. So the maximum occurs where? If the function f is proportional to sin²θ, then the maximum occurs at θ=90°, where sinθ=1. So the maximum value is f_max = something. Then, the power radiated at 30° would be f(30°) = (sin30°)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. But wait, wait. Let me double-check. If the function f is proportional to sin²θ, then f_max is when θ is 90°, so f_max = some constant. So the fraction of A at θ=30° is f(30)/f_max = (1/4)/(1) = 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4.

But wait, the question says 'the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ=30°'. Oh, but wait, I might have confused something. Because the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. So maybe the total power is the integral of f(θ) over θ from 0 to π and φ from 0 to 2π. So if f is proportional to sin²θ, the integral becomes something like ∫∫ sin²θ sinθ dθ dφ. So integrating over φ from 0 to 2π gives 2π. Then, the integral over θ from 0 to π of sin³θ dθ. Let me compute that integral. The integral of sin³θ dθ from 0 to π is 4/3. Wait, wait, no: sin³θ is (1 - cos²θ) * sinθ. Let me make substitution u=cosθ, du=-sinθ dθ. So integral becomes ∫ from 1 to -1 of (1 - u²) (-du) = ∫ from -1 to 1 of (1 - u²) du. That's [u - (u^3)/3] from -1 to 1. At u=1: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. At u=-1: (-1) - (-1/3) )= -2/3. So the total is (2/3) - (-2/3) )= 4/3. So the integral is 4/3. So the total power (if A is the maximum) would be A = something, but wait. Alternatively, the total power is the integral of f(θ) over all solid angles. If f is proportional to sin²θ, then the total is proportional to ∫ sin²θ * dΩ, which is ∫0^{2π} ∫0^π sin²θ sinθ dθ dφ = 2π * (4/3) )= 8π/3. So the total power is (constant) * 8π/3. But A is the maximum power, which is when sin²θ is 1, so f_max is the maximum value of f, which would be (constant)*1. So the total power is 8π/3 times the constant, but the maximum is that same constant. So the fraction is f(θ=30°) / A = (1/4) / (1) )= 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4.

Now, for the second part: the form of f. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. From Maxwell's theory, the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to (acceleration)², but more importantly, the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So f is proportional to sin²θ.

But wait, the question says f is a function of λ and θ. So in the far field (radiation zone), the fields depend on 1/r, and the power (which involves the square of the fields) depends on 1/r². But the power per unit volume in the fields (like intensity) would be proportional to 1/r², but here we're talking about the power radiated per unit solid angle, which would be the intensity times the area, perhaps.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact dependence. Alternatively, for an oscillating dipole, the radiated power is proportional to (ω² q²)/(c^3), where ω is the angular frequency. The maximum intensity (maximum f) occurs at the equator, and the intensity is proportional to (ω² q^2)/(c^3 r^2) * sin²θ. But in terms of λ, since λ = c/(ω), ω = 2π/c λ. So ω² would be proportional to 1/λ^2. So substituting, intensity is proportional to (1/λ^4) * sin²θ. So f ∝ sin²θ / λ^4. So the function f is proportional to sin²θ multiplied by 1/λ^4.

Looking back at the options, the second part is about the form of f. So f depends on sin²θ and 1/λ^4.

Wait, but the options give possible forms for f. The options are:

A) 1/2, λ^(-4)

B) 1/4, λ^(-3)

C) 1/4, λ^(-4)

D) 3/4, λ^(-6)

Wait, the first part is the fraction, the second is the dependence on λ.

So the function f is proportional to sin²θ and 1/λ^4. So the form would be something like k sin²θ / λ^4, where k is some constant. So the λ dependence is λ^(-4). So looking at the options, the λ dependence part is either (A) λ^-4, (B) λ^-3, (C) λ^-4, (D) λ^-6. So the form of f is λ^-4, which is options A, C.

We determined that the fraction is 1/4, so the first part of the answer is 1/4. Looking at the options, option C has 1/4 and λ^-4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The fraction is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to 1/λ^4. So option C: 1/4 and λ^-4.


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, which radiates at a wavelength \( \lambda \). The power radiated per unit solid angle in the radiation zone is a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), and the goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \), as well as the form of \( f \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern and Symmetry**:  
   The charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating, leading to dipole-like radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the angle \( \theta \), and the power per unit solid angle is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). The maximum power occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin\theta = 1 \).

2. **Fraction of Maximum Power at \( \theta = 30^\circ \)**:  
   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is given by the ratio of \( f(30^\circ) \) to \( f_{\text{max}} \). Since \( f \propto \sin^2\theta \), we have:
   \[
   \frac{f(30^\circ)}{f_{\text{max}}} = \frac{\sin^2(30^\circ)}{\sin^2(90^\circ)} = \frac{(1/2)^2}{1} = \frac{1}{4}.
   \]
   Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

3. **Form of \( f \)**:  
   The power radiated per unit solid angle in the far field depends on the wavelength \( \lambda \). For an oscillating dipole, the radiated power is proportional to \( \omega^2 \), where \( \omega = 2\pi/\lambda \). Substituting \( \omega \propto 1/\lambda \), the power per unit solid angle is proportional to \( 1/\lambda^4 \). Therefore, \( f \propto \sin^2\theta / \lambda^4 \), indicating that the form of \( f \) depends on \( \lambda^{-4} \).

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   The fraction of the maximum power is \( 1/4 \), and the form of \( f \) is proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \). Among the given options, only **C** satisfies both conditions.

### Final Answer:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), and the form of \( f \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \).

Answer: C
