Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through this step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The direction is arbitrary, lying in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I understand the setup. The operator P is a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. The problem asks for the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the operator for the spin in an arbitrary direction n is given by the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the direction vector. So the operator P would be something like (P_x, P_y, P_z) dotted with the unit vector n. That is, P = n · σ * ħ/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. But let me double-check that.

Wait, actually, each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given as ħ/2 times their respective matrices. So P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly for P_y and P_z.

So the operator for the component along direction n (which is in the x-z plane) would be P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, no, wait. The direction vector is arbitrary in x-z plane. So n could be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or something? Wait, no. Wait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then n_y should be zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² = 1. So the angle θ would be such that n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ? Or maybe n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ? I'm a bit confused about the conventions. Let me think: usually, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then φ would be zero or 180 degrees. Oh, wait, no. φ is the azimuthal angle. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π. So, θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x would be sinθ cosφ, but since φ is 0, cosφ is 1, so n_x = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, that makes sense because when θ=0, n is along z, when θ=
