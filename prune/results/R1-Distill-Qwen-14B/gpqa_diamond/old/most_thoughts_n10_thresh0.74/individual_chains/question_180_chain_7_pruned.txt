Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So, the elementary charge is e, which I remember is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each particle here has a charge of 2 * 1.602e-19 C, which makes each charge 3.204e-19 C. But wait, wait. Wait, the problem says 13 identical particles each with charge 2e. So each is 2e. Yep, so 2 times e.

Now, the setup: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 13th charge is at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So they form a sort of sphere around P, but since they're fixed at a distance, maybe it's like they're on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters. But wait, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, so it doesn't matter if they're moving around the surface, as long as they're all at radius 2 m.

We're asked for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm. So I think this is about calculating the potential energy of the system. Because the system's energy would depend on the arrangement of the charges, and in this case, we're given a specific setup.

Wait, so the system consists of these 13 charges. But one is fixed at P, and the others are all at 2 m from P. So how many interactions do we need to consider?

I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to bring each charge from infinity to their positions, considering the potential due to the charges already placed. But since all the charges are identical, we can compute this using combinations.

In the system, the 13th charge is fixed at P. Let's call this charge Q13. The other 12 charges, Q1 to Q12, are all 2e each and are located at 2 meters from P.

Wait, but how does each charge interact with others? Each of the 12 charges will interact with the fixed charge at P, and also with each other. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

But wait, the system is isolated, so maybe we can model it as the sum of all pairwise potentials.

The formula for the electric potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988e9 N m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

So, considering all pairs:

1. The 12 charges each interact with the fixed charge at P.

Each of these 12 charges is 2e, and the fixed charge is also 2e, since all are identical. So the distance between each of the 12 and Q13 is 2 meters.

So for each of the 12, the potential energy with Q13 is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m). So that's (k * (4 e²)) / (2) = 2k e².

Wait, but wait. Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, so each contributes to U with Q13. So there are 12 such interactions. So the total energy from these interactions is 12 * (2 k e²) )? Wait, wait,
