Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So the question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that each small part of the star is in equilibrium, so we can use things like the Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system. The formula I recall is something like the ratio of populations between two states. Oh right, for two energy levels E1 and E2, the ratio of the number of particles in E2 to E1 is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, both stars are dealing with the same energy levels, so g1 and g2 should be the same for each star, right? Because it's the same transition for both. So the ratio of populations would just depend on temperature. 

Wait, but the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, for star_1, the number of excited atoms (let's say N1) is twice that of star_2 (N2), so N1 = 2 * N2. Hmm, but wait, wait. Let me make sure. Oh, wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Does that mean the excitation level is higher, so more atoms are in the higher energy state?

Wait, actually, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, the number of excited atoms (in a specific level) is higher for star_1. So, ratio N1/N2 = 2. But wait, I need to think about how the excitation relates to the energy levels. Let's think: the energy levels are fixed. The population depends on temperature.

So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E)/(kT) ). The higher the temperature, the more likely the atoms are in higher energy states because the exponential becomes less suppressed.

The energy difference between the levels is given as Î”E = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that's actually the same as k_B (B
