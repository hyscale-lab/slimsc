Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the setup is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, and we're assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) in the photosphere.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in LTE, the populations of energy levels are determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations depends on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, n1 and n2, is given by:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

But wait, the problem gives us the effective temperature of the star when spots are present and when they aren't. But the spots themselves are dark, so they're cooler regions. So when the spots are present, the overall photospheric temperature changes. But wait, wait... I'm a bit confused. How does the presence of spots affect the overall photospheric temperature?

Wait, the star's surface isn't entirely covered by spots. So when 40% is covered, the overall effective temperature of the photosphere drops. So I think the spots are cooler regions, so the average temperature of the photosphere is lower when spots are present. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K instead of 6000 K.

So the effective temperature that we observe when considering the entire star is 5500 K when spots are present. But wait, wait. The photosphere's effective temperature, or is each region (spot and non-spot) contributing to the overall emission?

Wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the spots are cooler, so they lower the overall Teff. So the photosphere as a whole is at 5500 K when spots are present.

But wait, I'm a bit uncertain. Maybe the spots themselves are at a lower temperature, and the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. So when spots are present, the average of the entire surface is 5500 K. So perhaps the effective temperature is the average over the entire surface.

But wait, when the spots are present, the total flux (which determines the effective temperature) is lower. Because spots are cooler
