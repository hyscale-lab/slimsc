Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. The steps are: treatment with bromine, then heating with sodium hydroxide, then thionyl chloride and pyridine, followed by Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride. The final question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

First, I'll outline what each reaction does.

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2: I remember that cyclohexanone can undergo bromination, but the conditions matter. Adding bromine (Br2) typically leads to an addition reaction in ketones. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When you add bromine, I think it's a dihydroxybromination. Oh wait, no, that's for alkenes. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, wait, Bromine in a diethyl ether solution at low temperature? Hmm. Oh, right, I think that when ketones like cyclohexanone react with Br2, it's a halogenation via the enol intermediate. So the mechanism is enol formation, then bromide adds. So cyclohexanone would form 3-bromocyclohexanone? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the position. Let me think. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Enols form by removing an alpha proton to the carbonyl. So the alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. So in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at position 1. The alpha carbons are the two CH2 groups attached to C1. When the enol forms, Br2 adds across the double bond. So cyclohexanone would add Br across the enol, giving a dibromide. Wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, bromine adds to the enol. So when cyclohexanone forms an enol, the enol has a double bond between C1 and C2. So adding Br2 would add Br across that double bond, forming 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or maybe it's a bromohydrin formation? No, that's when you have water or another nucleophile. Wait, correct reaction: when ketones react with bromine, they undergo a halogenation to form a dibromide. So it's a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. So product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: maybe it's a substitution. No, bromine in such cases usually adds across the double bond. So maybe product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

2. Heating product 1 with NaOH: So product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Heating with strong base, NaOH. That sounds like an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a base, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So two elimination steps would form an alkene. Wait, but wait, if it's 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, elimination would remove both Br atoms and form a double bond between C1 and C2. So product 2 would be cyclohexene, specifically 1-cyclohexene, but more accurately, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond between two adjacent carbons.

Wait, but wait, cyclohexene can have two possible structures: 1,2-diene (cis or trans?), but in a ring, the double bond can be in any position. But since the starting point was 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, making cyclohexene with a double bond between those positions. So product 2 is cyclohexene.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: when two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination could form an alkene. So product 2 is cyclohexene.

3. Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine. Thionyl chloride is used to convert carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides, but wait, product 2 is cyclohexene. Wait, no, wait—product 2 is cyclohexene, which is an alkene. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Wait, wait, product 2 is cyclohexene. But then, treating that with SOCl2... Wait, SOCl2 typically reacts with OH groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But cyclohexene doesn't have an OH group. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me retrace. Step 1: cyclohexanone + Br2 → 1,2-dibromocyclohexane (product 1).

Step 2: product 1 heated with NaOH → elimination to form cyclohexene (product 2).

Step 3: cyclohexene treated with SOCl2 and pyridine. Wait, but cyclohexene is an alkene. What would happen then? Thionyl chloride usually converts alcohols to chlorides, but maybe in the presence of an alkene... Oh wait, perhaps I got product 2 wrong.

Wait, another possibility in step 2: when 1,2-dibromocyclohexane is treated with NaOH, maybe it's a substitution reaction? No, because NaOH is a base, and with vicinal dihalides, elimination is more likely. So product 2 should be cyclohexene.

Wait, but then step 3: cyclohexene with SOCl2. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps in step 2, the product is a diol. Wait, but that's when you have a dihalide and treat with water, not NaOH. Wait, no. Oh, wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening. Wait, when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, perhaps it's not an enol addition but a different reaction. Oh, wait, maybe it's a benzilic acid rearrangement? No, that's another thing.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a different reaction. Wait, when ketones react with bromine, another possibility is the formation of a bromohydrin. Wait, bromohydrin is when you add Br and OH across the carbonyl. Wait, but that's when the carbonyl oxygen is attacked. Wait, but that's for aldehydes and ketones, but typically, bromohydrin formation uses a base, like NaOH, but when using bromine without a base, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, perhaps I should look up what happens when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with Br2. Oh, right, I think cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form a dihydroxybromide. Wait, no, perhaps it's a bromination at the alpha position. So, maybe the product is 2-bromocyclohexanone. Wait, but that would require a substitution.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine, which is a dienophile, perhaps it undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction, but wait, the cyclohexanone isn't a diene. Alternatively, it's an electrophilic addition. For ketones, the reaction with bromine is similar to alkenes. So, the enol form of the ketone can react with bromine.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me consider that in step 1, the product is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Then, step 2 would be elimination to form cyclohexene. Then step 3, treating with SOCl2 and pyridine: but that's an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in step 2.

Wait, another possibility: when 1,2-dibromocyclohexane is treated with NaOH, perhaps it's a substitution, not elimination. Wait, but with two bromines, elimination is more likely because the base would abstract a beta proton, leading to the formation of a double bond. So product 2 is cyclohexene.

But then, step 3: cyclohexene with SOCl2. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about product 2. Maybe product 2 is a diol? No, that's when you have a dihalide and water. So with NaOH, perhaps it's elimination, not substitution. So product 2 is cyclohexene.

Wait, but then step 3: treating cyclohexene with SOCl2 and pyridine. SOCl2 is usually for converting alcohols to chlorides, but perhaps it can react with alkenes? Oh, wait, maybe it's a chlorination via addition. For example, adding Cl across the double bond. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product 2 is cyclohexanol? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the first step is wrong. Let's consider another approach. Maybe when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, it undergoes bromination at the alpha position, forming 2-bromocyclohexanone. Because the alpha carbons are more reactive. Oh wait, but how?

Wait, cyclohexanone has alpha hydrogens (on the carbons next to the carbonyl). Bromine can abstract a hydrogen, leading to a bromide. Wait, but that would require acid conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's an electrophilic addition. Hmm.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of what each step does in general.

The steps are:

1. Cyclohexanone → product 1 (with Br2)
2. Product 1 → product 2 (heated with NaOH)
3. Product 2 → product 3 (with SOCl2 and pyridine)
4. Product 3 → product 4 (with LiAlH(t-Bu)3)

The final product is product 4, and the question is about the number of chemically distinct H atoms.

Wait, perhaps the overall process is: cyclohexanone is brominated, then elimination forms cyclohexene, then some reaction to form a di-substituted cyclohexane, then reduction.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a di-substituted chloride, and then reduced to form a diol? But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial steps form epoxide? No, because bromine in a different solvent would form that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is an allylic bromination. Wait, but cyclohexanone isn't an alkene. So that wouldn't apply.

Wait, maybe the first step is a substitution. Cyclohexanone (a ketone) could undergo a nucleophilic attack, but I don't think Br2 is a nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed process.

Wait, maybe the first step is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group. But cyclohexanone's carbonyl is a ketone, and adding bromine would lead to a bromohydrin. So product 1 would be a bromohydrin: 2-bromo-cyclohexanol? No, wait, wait. Bromohydrin is when you add Br and OH across the carbonyl. So the product would be a diastereomer with Br and OH on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but how? Let me think: the carbonyl group (O=C-R) reacts with bromine (Br2) in a nucleophilic addition. The carbonyl oxygen would attack Br, but wait, bromine is a diatomic molecule. Oh, right, the bromohydrin formation involves the addition of Br and OH across the carbonyl. So the product would be a vicinal diol with a bromide. So in the case of cyclohexanone, adding Br2 would form 1-bromo-2-hydroxycyclohexane. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more likely to form a bromoalkane via substitution. But the carbonyl isn't a good leaving group. Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to proceed assuming that product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Then, step 2: product 1 (1,2-dibromocyclohexane) is heated with NaOH. That's a base, so elimination occurs to form cyclohexene. So product 2 is cyclohexene.

Step 3: treating cyclohexene with SOCl2 and pyridine. SOCl2 is typically used to convert carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides, but in the presence of alcohols, it can convert them to chlorides. But cyclohexene doesn't have an OH group. So maybe this is a different reaction. Oh, wait, perhaps the cyclohexene is undergoing some kind of addition with SOCl2.

SOCl2 can also react with alkenes. I think when alkenes react with thionyl chloride, they can form chlorides via electrophilic addition. So the double bond would react with SOCl2 to form a chloroalkane. For cyclohexene, adding SOCl2 would result in the formation of 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane. Wait, but then what's the role of pyridine here? Pyridine is often used to absorb HCl as a base, perhaps in the reaction.

Alternatively, maybe it's a chlorination via a radical mechanism, but that's less likely here.

So product 3 would be 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, step 4: treating product 3 with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)3), which is a strong reducing agent. Wait, but what's the structure of product 3? It's 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Wait, so product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane. Now, when this is treated with a strong reducing agent like LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which typically reduces esters, amides, nitriles, etc., but in this case, the compound is a vicinal dihalide. Hmm.

Wait, wait, another possibility: perhaps product 3 is an epoxide, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe product 3 is a di-substituted alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in step 3. Let me think again. When cyclohexene reacts with SOCl2, perhaps it forms a chlorinated cyclohexane. Alternatively, maybe it's used to make a cyclohexane chloride, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a chlorohydrin. But without an OH group, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the overall transformations. The initial compound is cyclohexanone. After the first step, product 1 is a dihalide. Then elimination gives an alkene. Then, what would happen when that alkene is treated with SOCl2?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of cyclohexene with SOCl2 and pyridine is an addition across the double bond, forming a chloride. So the double bond (C1-C2) would add two Cl atoms, making 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, step 4: product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane. Treating this with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. Wait, but LiAlH is a strong reducing agent. Typically, it would reduce esters, carboxylic acids, etc., but what about 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane?

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe the LiAlH is protonating something. Alternatively, maybe the Cl is a leaving group, and the reducing agent is causing some kind of elimination. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake earlier. Let me think of another possibility. Maybe the first step forms a ketone bromide, like 2-bromocyclohexanone.

Wait, but how? Cyclohexanone has alpha hydrogens. Maybe the bromine adds to the alpha position via some substitution. Wait, perhaps via the enolate.

Wait, if cyclohexanone is treated with Br2, perhaps it abstracts an alpha hydrogen, forming an enolate which then adds Br. So product 1 would be 2-bromocyclohexanone.

Then, step 2: product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with NaOH. That sounds like a substitution reaction. The NaOH would deprotonate the alpha position, leading to an enolate, which could attack the Br, leading to an elimination. Wait, but more likely, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But in a ketone, the leaving group (Br) is adjacent to the carbonyl, which is a good leaving group. Wait, but the carbonyl is an electron-withdrawing group, which would activate the C-Br bond for nucleophilic substitution.

So in 2-bromocyclohexanone, the Br is on the alpha carbon. Heating with NaOH would lead to an SN2 substitution, replacing Br with OH. So product 2 would be 2-hydroxycyclohexanone.

Wait, but wait, when you have a ketone and a substitution occurs, the product is a diol? Or just a secondary alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the base (OH-) abstracts a proton alpha to the carbonyl, forming an enolate, which then eliminates Br- to form an enol, and then tautomerizes back to the ketone. Hmm, but that doesn't add anything.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis of the bromide. So the Br is replaced by OH, making 2-hydroxycyclohexanone.

But wait, 2-hydroxycyclohexanone is not a stable compound because the OH is adjacent to the carbonyl, leading to possible elimination to form an enone. Alternatively, perhaps it would undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

But I'm not sure. Let me proceed.

Then, step 3: product 2 is 2-hydroxycyclohexanone. Treating this with SOCl2 and pyridine would convert the hydroxyl group (-OH) into a chloride (-Cl). So product 3 would be 2-chlorocyclohexanone.

Then, step 4: treating product 3 (2-chlorocyclohexanone) with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. Wait, LiAlH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces carbonyl groups. So the ketone (2-chlorocyclohexanone) would be reduced to an alcohol. So product 4 would be 2-chlorocyclohexanol.

Wait, but more accurately, the reduction would convert the ketone to a secondary alcohol. So 2-chlorocyclohexanol.

Now, the question is: how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4?

Let me visualize 2-chlorocyclohexanol. The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a chlorine atom on C2 and a hydroxyl group (-OH) also on C2. Wait, no, because the reduction of 2-chlorocyclohexanone would place the OH on C2. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring where the same carbon (C2) has both Cl and OH groups. Wait, but that would require that the Cl is on the same carbon as the OH. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait, the ketone is at C1, and the Cl is at C2. So when reduced, the ketone (C1) becomes a CHOH group. Wait, no, let me think again. 2-chlorocyclohexanone is cyclohexanone with a Cl on C2. So the structure is:

O=C-R, where R is a cyclohexyl group with Cl on C2.

When reduced with LiAlH, the carbonyl (C=O) becomes CH-OH. So the product would be 1-hydroxycyclohexane with a Cl on C2. Wait, but that would make the structure have the OH on C1 and Cl on C2.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this. The starting material is cyclohexanone: a six-membered ring with a carbonyl at C1. Then, product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone. Then product 2 is 2-hydroxycyclohexanone. Product 3 is 2-chlorocyclohexanone. Product 4 is the reduction of the ketone to an alcohol: so 1-hydroxycyclohexane with a Cl on C2.

Wait, no. Wait, the carbonyl group is at C1. So when it's reduced, the C=O becomes CH-OH. So the structure would be cyclohexanol with a Cl on C2. So the molecule is cyclohexanol, with Cl on the adjacent carbon (C2).

Wait, no. Let me correct that. 2-chlorocyclohexanone is a cyclohexane ring where the carbonyl is at C1, and there's a Cl substituent at C2.

So when reduced, the carbonyl (C1) becomes a CH2 group attached to an OH, making C1 a CH(OH) group. Wait, no. Wait, the structure of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is:

O=C-CH2-Cl (but in a ring). Wait, no, in the ring, it's O=C-C1 connected to C2, which has Cl.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of numbering. Let's say the carbonyl is at position 1. Then, the Cl is at position 2. So, when the ketone is reduced, the carbonyl carbon (C1) becomes a secondary alcohol: so C1 becomes CH(OH), connected to C2 which has Cl.

So the structure is a cyclohexane ring where C1 has OH and is connected to C2, which has Cl.

Wait, but that can't be right because in a ketone, the carbonyl is at C1, connected to two CH2 groups (since cyclohexanone is (CH2)5 connected in a ring with the carbonyl). But if the Cl is at C2, then the structure is O=C-C2Cl-(CH2)3-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to imagine the ring. So, C1 is the carbonyl carbon, connected to C2, which has a Cl atom. So, when the ketone is reduced, the C=O becomes a CH(OH) group at C1.

So product 4 would be a cyclohexanol derivative with Cl on C2.

Wait, but what does that imply for the structure of product 4? It's a cyclohexanol with a Cl on the adjacent carbon.

So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with an OH group on C1 and a Cl on C2.

Now, the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Let me imagine the structure: C1 has OH and is connected to C2 (which has Cl) and two other CH2 groups. Wait, no. Let me think in terms of the chair conformation.

Wait, in the cyclohexane ring, when you have substituents on adjacent carbons (like C1 and C2), the molecule can have axial and equatorial positions. But since the substituents are different (OH and Cl), the chair will have specific orientations.

But wait, product 4 is 1-hydroxy-2-chlorocyclohexane. Let me consider the structure. The molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an OH group on C1 and a Cl on C2.

Now, when looking for chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, I need to consider the symmetry in the molecule.

Let me number the carbons as follows:

C1: OH attached.

C2: Cl attached.

C3: ?
C4: ?
C5: ?
C6: ?

In a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and two CH2 groups (in the case of no substituents). But in this case, C1 has OH and C2 has Cl.

Now, the molecule may have some symmetry. Let's think about the substituents. The OH is on C1, and Cl on C2. So, the molecule is not symmetric. The substituents are on adjacent carbons, which breaks any symmetry.

So, the hydrogens on the ring can be categorized as follows:

- C1: has an OH, so no hydrogens here (since it's a secondary alcohol, the carbon is connected to OH, two other carbons, and another CH2 group).
Wait, no, wait. Wait, in cyclohexanol, the OH is on a CH2 group. Wait, no, cyclohexanol has a hydroxyl group on a carbon that is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So the structure is (CH2)5CH(OH)CH2, but arranged in a ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. In cyclohexanol, the structure is a six-membered ring with a hydroxyl group attached to one of the carbons. So, the OH is on a carbon connected to two other CH2 groups and two adjacent ring carbons.

But in product 4, the molecule is 1-hydroxy-2-chlorocyclohexane. So, C1 has OH, and C2 has Cl.

So, looking at the ring, the substituents are on adjacent carbons. So, the molecule is 1-OH, 2-Cl.

Now, the molecule's symmetry: is there any plane of symmetry? If the substituents are on adjacent carbons, the molecule might not have any symmetry, leading to more distinct hydrogens.

Alternatively, if the Cl and OH are on adjacent carbons, perhaps the molecule can't have any symmetry, so all the hydrogens are distinct.

Wait, but let me visualize the ring. The substituents are on C1 and C2. So, in a chair conformation, Cl on C2 could be axial or equatorial, and OH on C1 could be axial or equatorial. But regardless of that, the substituents on adjacent carbons would mean that the molecule has no symmetry.

So, each hydrogen on the ring would be in a different environment.

Wait, but maybe not. Let's see:

The ring has six carbons. Each carbon has two Hs (except for C1 and C2, which have substituents).

Wait, C1: OH substituent → no Hs.

C2: Cl substituent → no Hs.

So, the remaining carbons are C3, C4, C5, and C6.

Now, considering the substituents on C1 and C2, the structure is such that C3 is next to C2, and C6 is next to C1.

Carbons C3 and C4 are on the opposite side of the ring from C2 and C1, perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether the molecule is chiral. If the substituents on C1 and C2 are in such a way that they create a chiral center, then each position would have distinct Hs.

Wait, C1 has an OH, which is a substituent. C2 has a Cl. So, the molecule could be chiral if the substituents are arranged in a way that no plane of symmetry exists.

But regardless of chirality, the number of distinct Hs depends on the symmetry of the molecule.

Let me try to count the Hs:

C1: no Hs.

C2: no Hs.

C3: attached to C2 (which has Cl) and C4. So, the Hs on C3 are in a different environment than those on C5 or C6.

C4: attached to C3 and C5. But what about the substituents on C1 and C2? It's possible that C4's Hs are in a different environment than C5 and C6.

C5: attached to C4 and C6. Similarly, C5's Hs might be unique.

C6: attached to C5 and C1 (which has OH). So, C6's Hs are in a different environment.

So, each carbon (C3, C4, C5, C6) has two Hs each, but are they all distinct?

Wait, but perhaps the molecule has some symmetry leading to equivalent Hs.

Wait, another approach: imagine the molecule is 1-OH, 2-Cl in a chair conformation. If the Cl is axial on C2 and OH is equatorial on C1, would that symmetry lead to any equivalent Hs?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has no symmetry, making all Hs on the ring distinct.

But wait, the carbons adjacent to substituents (C3 and C6) might have different environments than the others.

Alternatively, perhaps C3 and C5 are equivalent, and C4 and C6 are equivalent.

Wait, let's think about the substitution pattern. The substituents are on C1 and C2. So, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C6, making C3 and C6 equivalent. But if the substituents are on adjacent carbons, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but maybe the molecule does have some symmetry. Let me think: if the substituents are on C1 and C2, and the ring is numbered such that C1 is adjacent to C6 and C2, and C2 is adjacent to C3 and C1.

If the substituents are such that there's a mirror plane through C3 and C6, then perhaps the Hs on C3 and C6 are equivalent, as are those on C4 and C5.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's symmetry is such that the Hs on C3 and C6 are equivalent, and those on C4 and C5 are equivalent.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's try to count the distinct Hs.

- C3: two Hs, each in a unique environment because they are next to C2 (Cl) and C4 (which is next to C3 and C5).

Wait, but perhaps the two Hs on C3 are in the same environment. Are they? If the substituents are arranged such that the two Hs on C3 are equivalent, then they would be considered the same.

Wait, in a chair conformation, if the substituents are axial and equatorial, the Hs on C3 could be in different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Hs on C3 are not equivalent, making them distinct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Another approach: product 4 is 1-hydroxy-2-chlorocyclohexane. How many distinct H environments are there?

- The OH is on C1, Cl on C2.

- The remaining carbons (C3, C4, C5, C6) each have two Hs.

Now, considering the substituents, the molecule is not symmetric. Therefore, each H on these carbons is in a unique environment.

Wait, but that's not correct because the molecule may have some symmetry.

Wait, perhaps C3 and C6 are equivalent because they are both adjacent to C2 and C1, respectively. Hmm, no, because C3 is adjacent to C2 (Cl) and C4, while C6 is adjacent to C1 (OH) and C5. So their environments are different.

Similarly, C4 is between C3 and C5, while C5 is between C4 and C6. So their environments are different.

Thus, each carbon (C3, C4, C5, C6) has two Hs, each in a unique environment. Therefore, each H is chemically distinct.

But wait, perhaps the Hs on C3 are both in the same environment. For example, if the two Hs on C3 are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, then they would count as one type.

Alternatively, perhaps C3 has two equivalent Hs, C4 has two equivalent Hs, C5 has two equivalent Hs, and C6 has two equivalent Hs. That would make four types (C3, C4, C5, C6) × 1 each, totaling four types. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, the options are 6, 8, 10, 7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, product 4 is 1-hydroxy-2-chlorocyclohexane. Let me count the Hs:

- C1: no Hs (OH substituent).

- C2: no Hs (Cl substituent).

- C3: two Hs.

- C4: two Hs.

- C5: two Hs.

- C6: two Hs.

Total Hs: 2+2+2+2=8. But are they all distinct?

Wait, perhaps some of these Hs are equivalent. For example, if C3 and C6 are mirror images, then their Hs could be equivalent, reducing the count.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes some Hs equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral, leading to all Hs being distinct. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another way: the molecule has four substituents (OH on C1, Cl on C2, and two Hs on C3, C4, C5, C6). So, each substituent's position affects the Hs.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is chiral, leading to all Hs being distinct. But that can't be right because, in a chair conformation, axial and equatorial Hs are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has some symmetry. Let me imagine the structure: C1 has OH, C2 has Cl. The ring is arranged such that the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetric, but the positions of the substituents could lead to some Hs being equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has four distinct types of Hs.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

The options are 6, 8, 10, 7.

Wait, if product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with substituents on C1 and C2, and the rest of the carbons have two Hs each, but some are equivalent.

Another approach: the molecule 1-hydroxy-2-chlorocyclohexane has how many distinct Hs?

Let me consider the chair conformation.

Assume that the OH on C1 is axial, and the Cl on C2 is axial as well. Then, the substituents are on the same face.

In this case, the axial positions on C3 and C6 would be on the same face as the substituents, but their Hs would be in different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are trans, leading to different environments.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the diastereomers. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is such that C3 and C6 are mirror images, leading their Hs to be equivalent.

But if the substituents are on adjacent carbons, the molecule would lack such symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric, leading to all Hs being distinct.

Wait, but how many Hs are there? Let's count:

C1: 0 Hs.

C2: 0 Hs.

C3: 2 Hs.

C4: 2 Hs.

C5: 2 Hs.

C6: 2 Hs.

Total: 8 Hs.

But are any of these Hs equivalent?

If all 8 Hs are in different chemical environments, the answer would be 8. But if some are equivalent, the count would be lower.

Wait, another approach: the molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the ring, making certain Hs equivalent.

If the substituents are on C1 and C2, perhaps the plane of symmetry is through C3 and C6, making their Hs equivalent.

In that case, C3 and C6 each have two Hs, but they are equivalent to each other. Similarly, C4 and C5 might be equivalent.

So, C3 and C6 would have two Hs each, but they are the same → 2 H types.

C4 and C5: each have two Hs, but they are the same → 2 H types.

So total H types would be 4 (C3, C4, C5, C6 as two types each?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a symmetry that makes the Hs on C3 and C6 equivalent, and those on C4 and C5 equivalent.

In that case, each pair contributes one type.

But C3 and C6 would each have two Hs, but if they're equivalent, that's two Hs in the same environment → one type.

Similarly, C4 and C5 would have two Hs each, but in the same environment → another type.

So, the Hs would be:

- C3 and C6: 2 Hs each, same environment → 2 Hs (count as 1 type).

- C4 and C5: 2 Hs each, same environment → another type.

Plus, the axial and equatorial Hs on C1 and C2 (but those carbons have no Hs).

Wait, but that can't be right because C3 and C6 would each have two Hs, but if they're in equivalent positions, their Hs would be the same.

So, for C3 and C6: each has two Hs, but they're identical → 2 Hs total, but same environment → 1 type.

Similarly, C4 and C5: each has two Hs, same environment → 1 type.

So, for the ring:

- C3 and C6: 2 Hs → 1 type.

- C4 and C5: 2 Hs → 1 type.

Thus, total H types on the ring: 2.

Plus, any Hs on the substituents? No, because substituents are OH and Cl, which don't contribute to H.

Wait, but where are the other Hs?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The molecule is 1-hydroxy-2-chlorocyclohexane, so the ring has six carbons, each with two Hs except C1 and C2.

Wait, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try to think differently.

The molecule's structure is cyclohexane with substituents on C1 (OH) and C2 (Cl).

The chair conformation would have the substituents in specific positions. If the substituents are axial, then the ring would have axial substituents. Alternatively, they could be equatorial.

But regardless, the key is to find the number of chemically distinct Hs.

If the substituents are on adjacent carbons, the molecule has no symmetry, leading all Hs to be distinct.

Wait, but that would mean 8 Hs, but that's not one of the options. Wait, the options include 8 (option B).

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer would be 8, but the options don't match.

Wait, wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

Product 4 is 1-hydroxy-2-chlorocyclohexane.

How many distinct Hs does it have?

C1: no H.

C2: no H.

C3: two Hs. Are they both the same? If the substituents break symmetry, they are different.

Similarly, C4: two Hs.

C5: two Hs.

C6: two Hs.

So, each of these has two distinct Hs, making 4 types for each pair (but perhaps some are the same).

Wait, perhaps each C3, C4, C5, and C6 have two Hs each, all in unique environments. So, 4 × 2 = 8 Hs, each distinct.

But that would make 8 distinct Hs, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some symmetry.

Wait, another approach: cyclohexane with two substituents on adjacent carbons (OH and Cl) is a disubstituted cyclohexane. The number of distinct Hs depends on the substituents' positions.

In such a case, the molecule typically has four sets of equivalent Hs: two on each substituent-adjacent carbon and two on the opposite.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the molecule has four distinct types of Hs on the ring, each type having two Hs. So 4 types × 2 Hs = 8 Hs, all distinct.

But that can't be right because in reality, some might be equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has four distinct types of Hs: C3, C4, C5, and C6, each with two Hs, but some are equivalent.

Wait, maybe C3 and C6 are equivalent in some way, leading their Hs to be the same. Similarly, C4 and C5 might be equivalent.

So, C3 and C6: each has two Hs, but they're the same → 2 Hs (1 type).

C4 and C5: each has two Hs, same → 2 Hs (1 type).

So, total H types: 2.

Wait, but that would only account for four Hs, which doesn't match the options.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps product 4 is not 1-hydroxy-2-chlorocyclohexane. Maybe I made a mistake earlier in the reaction steps.

Let me go back.

Alternative approach to the reaction steps:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

If product 1 is 1-bromo-2-hydroxycyclohexane (bromohydrin), then step 2 would be heating with NaOH, which could cause elimination to form cyclohexene.

Wait, but then step 3: cyclohexene treated with SOCl2 and pyridine.

If product 2 is cyclohexene, then step 3 would form 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then step 4: treatment with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. But what's the structure of product 4 after that?

Wait, 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane treated with a strong reducing agent.

Wait, LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a bulky reducing agent. It typically reduces esters and amides, but not alkanes. So, in 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, perhaps the LiAlH would abstract a proton adjacent to Cl, leading to elimination of HCl and formation of an alkene. But that would require a β-hydrogen, which is present.

So, perhaps product 4 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexene, but I'm not sure.

But wait, the question is about the number of chemically distinct Hs in product 4.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, and product 4 is the result of a reduction that doesn't affect the Cl atoms. Wait, but LiAlH typically doesn't reduce Cl.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about product 3.

Alternative pathway:

Step 1: cyclohexanone + Br2 → 1,2-dibromocyclohexane (product 1).

Step 2: product 1 + NaOH → cyclohexene (product 2).

Step 3: cyclohexene + SOCl2 and pyridine → 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane (product 3).

Step 4: product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → ?

Wait, LiAlH is a strong reducing agent, but what does it do to 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane?

Perhaps it doesn't react, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it reduces the C-Cl bonds, but I don't think that's common.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is a leaving group, and the reducing agent induces elimination, forming an alkene.

So, treating 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane with a strong base (like LiAlH) would eliminate both Cl atoms and form cyclohexene.

But that would mean product 4 is cyclohexene again, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, but cyclohexene has only one type of H, which isn't matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, and product 4 is a diol formed by hydrolysis, but that would require a different reagent.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider that the final product is a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps form a diol, and the final product is a diol with certain substituents.

Wait, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

2. 1,2-dibromocyclohexane + NaOH → cyclohexene.

3. Cyclohexene + SOCl2 → 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

4. 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane + LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → ?

Wait, perhaps LiAlH is a strong enough base to cause elimination, forming cyclohexene again. But that would not change the number of Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agent reduces the C-Cl bonds, but I don't think that's standard.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about product 3. Maybe when cyclohexene is treated with SOCl2, it forms a chloro compound but not a di-substituted one.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction of cyclohexene with SOCl2 forms a chlorohydrin, but that usually involves water. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of cyclohexene with SOCl2 forms a trichloride. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a chloroalkane with a single Cl.

Wait, perhaps when cyclohexene reacts with SOCl2, it adds Cl across the double bond, forming 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

So product 3 is 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

Then, product 4 is formed by treating this with LiAlH(t-Bu)3.

Wait, LiAlH is a strong reducing agent. What does it do to a dihalide?

Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. The AlH- would attack the C with Cl, leading to substitution.

But in a 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, substitution would occur at both C1 and C2.

Wait, but each substitution would require a good leaving group. Cl is a decent leaving group, but perhaps under these conditions, it's possible.

So, product 4 would be cyclohexane with two OH groups on adjacent carbons?

Wait, but that would require two substitutions. So product 4 would be 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexane.

But wait, that's a diol. Now, the question is about the number of distinct Hs in product 4 (the diol).

So, 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexane.

How many distinct Hs are present?

In the diol, the ring has OH groups on C1 and C2.

The structure would be similar to product 4 in the earlier scenario, but with two OH groups.

Wait, no, in this case, product 4 is 1,2-diol cyclohexane.

So, the structure is cyclohexane with OH groups on adjacent carbons.

Now, the number of distinct Hs.

Again, the molecule is 1,2-diolcyclohexane.

In this structure, each H on the ring is in a different environment, except perhaps for some symmetry.

Wait, but C1 and C2 each have an OH. So, the molecule is similar to the earlier case but with two OH groups.

So, the molecule would have even less symmetry, leading to more distinct Hs.

Let me count:

C1: no Hs (OH substituent).

C2: no Hs (OH substituent).

C3: two Hs.

C4: two Hs.

C5: two Hs.

C6: two Hs.

But without symmetry, each H is distinct. So 8 Hs, but some might be equivalent.

Wait, but 1,2-diolcyclohexane is a vicinal diol. Perhaps the molecule has some symmetry, such as a plane through C3 and C6, making their Hs equivalent.

In that case, C3 and C6 would each have two Hs, but they are equivalent → 1 type.

C4 and C5 would each have two Hs, but equivalent → 1 type.

So, total H types: 2 (C3 and C6) + 2 (C4 and C5) → 4 types, but considering each has two Hs, it's 4 × 2 = 8 Hs, but if their environments are identical, perhaps it's 4 types.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if the molecule has no symmetry, all 8 Hs are distinct. But that would make option B)8 the answer.

Wait, but the options include 8 as an option (B). So perhaps that's the case.

But wait, in the diol case, product 4 would have 1,2-diolcyclohexane, which might be more symmetric than the earlier case.

Wait, in 1,2-diolcyclohexane, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry between C3 and C6, making their Hs mirror images.

So, C3 and C6 would each have two Hs, but they're equivalent → 1 type.

Similarly, C4 and C5 would have two Hs each, but equivalent → 1 type.

So, two types of Hs: C3/C6 and C4/C5.

Plus, any other Hs?

Wait, but each of those pairs has two Hs, so 4 Hs in total, but that's not matching any of the options.

Hmm. I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for another approach or think about the correct answer based on the steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct product 4 is a secondary alcohol with a chlorine substituent on an adjacent carbon, leading to a total of 8 distinct Hs.

In that case, the answer would be B)8.

But earlier I thought the product might be a diol, leading to 8 Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, leading to 8 Hs.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the number of distinct Hs in product 4.

If product 4 is 1-hydroxy-2-chlorocyclohexane, then the substituents are on adjacent carbons, leading to 8 distinct Hs.

If product 4 is 1,2-diolcyclohexane, then the substituents are on adjacent carbons, leading to 8 distinct Hs.

In either case, the count is 8, which is option B.

But the options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

So, the correct answer would be B)8.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone, and the goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product (product 4). Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) to form 1,2-dibromocyclohexane (product 1). This occurs via electrophilic addition of bromine across the double bond of the enol intermediate formed from cyclohexanone.

2. **Product 1 + NaOH → Product 2**  
   Heating 1,2-dibromocyclohexane with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) results in an elimination reaction. The two bromine atoms are removed, forming a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. This produces cyclohexene as product 2.

3. **Product 2 + SOCl₂ + Pyridine → Product 3**  
   Cyclohexene reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) in the presence of pyridine. This reaction adds chlorine atoms across the double bond of the alkene, forming 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane (product 3).

4. **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**  
   Treatment of 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)₃), a strong reducing agent, leads to the replacement of the two chlorine atoms with hydroxyl groups. This forms 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexane (product 4), a vicinal diol.

5. **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**  
   - Product 4 is 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexane, a six-membered ring with hydroxyl groups (-OH) on carbons 1 and 2.  
   - Carbons 1 and 2 have no hydrogen atoms due to the hydroxyl substituents.  
   - Carbons 3, 4, 5, and 6 each have two hydrogen atoms.  
   - The molecule lacks symmetry because the hydroxyl groups on carbons 1 and 2 break any symmetry that might otherwise exist.  
   - As a result, all eight hydrogen atoms (two on each of carbons 3, 4, 5, and 6) are in distinct chemical environments.

Thus, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 is **8**.

**Answer: B**
