Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used with the VLT telescopes. High resolution usually means it can pick up detailed spectral lines, which is good for detecting things like exoplanets through the radial velocity method. But the question here is about detectability, specifically the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel after a certain exposure time.

The question states that a star is detectable if it has an S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out which of the stars a) to f) meet this criterion.

I think the key factors here are the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude) because fainter stars would result in lower S/N. Also, the distance of the star affects its apparent brightness. The formula for apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. Wait, no, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5. Yeah, that's right. Because the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), which simplifies to M +5 log d -5.

So each of the options provides the absolute magnitude (M) and the distance (d). Let's compute their apparent magnitudes.

Looking at the options:

a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a bright star. I recall it's the second brightest star in the sky, around magnitude 0.5. So its m is about 0.5.

b) Polaris. Polaris is a bit fainter, I think around magnitude 2.0. So m is about 2.

c) Star with M=15, d=10 pc. Let's compute m. 5 log10(10) is 5*1=5. So m=15 +5 -5=15. Wait, wait, no: M +5 log10(d) -5. d is 10, so log(10)=1. So 15 +5*1 -5 =15. So m=15.

d) Same M=15, d=200 pc. Log(200) is about 2.301. So 5*2.301=11.505. So m=15 +11.505 -5 = 21.505.

e) M=15, d=5 pc. Log(5) is about 0.69897. 5*0.69897≈3.495. So m=15 +3.495 -5=13.495.

f) M=15, d=50 pc. Log(50)=1.69897. 5*1.69897≈8.495. So m=15 +8.495 -5=18.495.

Wait, so the apparent magnitudes are:

a) ~0.5

b) ~2.0

c) 15

d) ~21.5

e) ~13.5

f) ~18.5

Now, I need to think about what the ESPRESSO spectrograph can handle in terms of magnitude. Since the question gives the S/N per binned pixel, I think I need to figure out how the S/N depends on the star's brightness.

From what I remember, the S/N ratio improves with the square root of the exposure time, but here the exposure time is fixed at 1 hour. So the S/N depends on the brightness (apparent magnitude) of the star. The fainter the star (higher m), the lower the S/N.

But how does the S/N scale with magnitude? I think the formula for S/N is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m), but wait, wait. The flux from a star is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m). The S/N is proportional to the square root of the flux (since photon noise dominates), so S/N ∝ sqrt(flux) = 10^(-0.2 * m).

Wait, let me make this more precise. The number of photons is proportional to the flux, which is F = F0 * 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)), where m0 is a reference magnitude. So for a star of magnitude m, the flux is F = F0 * 10^(-0.4 m).

The S/N ratio for an exposure time T is proportional to sqrt(F * T). Since T is fixed (1 hour), S/N ∝ sqrt(F) = sqrt(F0) * 10^(-0.2 m).

But I'm not sure about the exact relation. Alternatively, I think the S/N scales with 10^(-0.2*(m - m_ref)), where m_ref is some reference magnitude.

Wait, perhaps an easier approach is to find the S/N for a star of a certain magnitude based on the instrument's capabilities.

I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph with a high efficiency. Let me think about what magnitude range it can handle for a 1-hour exposure.

Wait, I think that ESPRESSO is designed to reach S/N levels of 100 per pixel for bright stars (like K=10) in an hour. But I'm not
