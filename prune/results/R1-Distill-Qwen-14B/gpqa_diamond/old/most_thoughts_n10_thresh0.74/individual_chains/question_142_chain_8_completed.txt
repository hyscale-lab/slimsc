Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. The options are A to D with different r vectors.

Alright, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. But here, ρ is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with a coefficient of 1/2. So this must be a maximally mixed state for a single qubit?

Wait, but what does that mean in terms of the Bloch sphere representation? Oh right! The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The maximally mixed state is at the center, which is (0,0,0). Because the density matrix is (I/2), which is the completely mixed state.

Let me double-check. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of Bloch sphere vectors. The density matrix is given by (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space (r_x, r_y, r_z) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if the density matrix is (I/2), that would imply that r is zero because (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So r would be (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the correct choice. The other options have non-zero components. For example, option B is (0,0,1), which would be the state |1><1| when r_z is 1, but here we have a mixture. So yeah, the density matrix is at the origin in the Bloch sphere, meaning option C is the answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a vector in 3D space, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. For the given density matrix, there are no off-diagonal terms, and the diagonal terms correspond to equal probabilities for the states \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \). This implies that the vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is zero, as the density matrix is entirely diagonal with no contributions from the Pauli matrices.

Thus, the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**A) r=(1,1,0)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to a non-zero vector in the Bloch sphere.  
**B) r=(0,0,1)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to the pure state \( |1\rangle \).  
**C) r=(0,0,0)**: Correct, as this corresponds to the maximally mixed state.  
**D) r=(1,1,1)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to a non-zero vector in the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
