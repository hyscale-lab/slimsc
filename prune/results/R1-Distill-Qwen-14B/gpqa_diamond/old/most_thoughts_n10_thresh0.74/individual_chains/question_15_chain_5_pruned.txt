Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting transiting planets. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest transit probability because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. 

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. Oh wait, the formula for the transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (a * sin i)), but more accurately, I think the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(1 - eÂ²))^(1/2) * (1 / (a (1 - e)) ), but wait, no, that's maybe not right. Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, no, for a circular orbit (e=0), the transit probability simplifies. I think the probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis) to the star's radius. But wait, actually, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance between the planet and the star, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p + R_s) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Hmm, no, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned enough for the transit. Oh wait, no, perhaps the transit probability is (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by something else.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up a few factors. Let me get this straight. The probability that a planet transits its star, assuming random orientation of the orbital plane, is approximately (R_s / a
