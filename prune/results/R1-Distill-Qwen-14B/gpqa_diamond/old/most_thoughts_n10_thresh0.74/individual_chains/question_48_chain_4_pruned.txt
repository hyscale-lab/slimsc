Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through each reaction and see what happens.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, with a six-membered ring and a ketone group. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a (C=O) group attached.

The first reaction is treatment with bromine (Br2), forming product 1. Hmm, what does bromine do to ketones? Oh right, I think this is a bromination reaction. Wait, but how? Oh wait, maybe it's an addition reaction. Wait, cyclohexanone can undergo various reactions. Oh wait, I think when a ketone reacts with Br2, it might be a halogenation, like the Prins reaction or maybe some kind of addition. Alternatively, I'm thinking about the possibility of the enol formation. Wait, ketones can undergo enolization under certain conditions. Oh, wait, maybe it's a diels-alder reaction? No, diels-alder is for dienes. Or perhaps it's an 1,2-addition. Wait, I think in acidic conditions, Br2 can add to the carbonyl. Wait, no, cyclohexanone is a ketone, so maybe it's an aldol reaction? Or perhaps it's a Michael addition? Hmm.

Wait a second, I think I remember that when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine in a
