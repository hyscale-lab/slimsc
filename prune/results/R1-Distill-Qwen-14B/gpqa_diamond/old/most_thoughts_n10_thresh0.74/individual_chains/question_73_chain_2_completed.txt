Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m moving at 0.6c, and the other has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed (v_rel) and the total energy (E). The options are A to D.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds at relativistic velocities, we can't just subtract them normally like in classical mechanics. Oh right, special relativity comes into play here. The formula for relative velocity in relativity is different. I think it's something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. So, the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), where u and v are their speeds. But wait, no, wait. Actually, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Because when they're moving in the same direction, you subtract the smaller velocity from the larger one. So for the astronauts, the first is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute that.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. That looks like option C or D, where v_rel is 0.14c. So that's the relative speed.

Now for the total energy. Hmm. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is given by the total energy formula E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute each astronaut's energy.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1.1547 * 3 is 3.4641. So E2 = approximately 3.4641 m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5mc², but that's lower than our calculation. So the correct total energy is about 5.96 mc², and the relative speed is ~0.14c.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
