Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives four options a to d, each describing different exoplanets. The options for answers are A to D, corresponding to the options given.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, density = mass/volume. But wait, how does the mass and radius (which relates to volume) affect the density?

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. So this planet would have the same density as Earth. Because if both mass and radius are same as Earth, density same.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and density approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Oh wait, they're giving the density here. So that's already stated—its density is 5.5, same as Earth. So that's the same as option a? Or wait, Earth's also 5.5. So option b's density is the same as Earth. But wait, its mass is 2 Earth masses. How does that affect the radius, and thus the volume? Wait, but the question is asking which has the highest density. So if option b's density is given as 5.5, same as Earth, then maybe it's tied with a.

Option c) A planet with same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Composition same, so same density? Because density is based on what it's made of. So if it's same composition, density should be same as Earth. So same as a and b. Wait, but if it's more massive, same density, then the radius must be bigger. Because volume depends on radius cubed. So let's think: Earth's radius R. Mass is proportional to density times volume, so M = (4/3)π R³ * density. If density is same, then mass is proportional to R³. So if the planet is 5 times Earth's mass, then R would be cube root of (5) times Earth's radius. Cube root of 5 is about 1.7, so radius is about 1.7 times Earth. So option c is a larger planet, same density as Earth.

Option d) Same composition as Earth but half
