Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, let me think about what I know. The question is about six different benzene derivatives reacting with excess bromine. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield.

Wait, so each of these substances undergoes an electrophilic substitution, and we're looking at how much of the para product is formed. The more the para product, the higher the weight fraction. But I need to arrange them from least to most, I think. Or wait, the question says arrange in order of increasing weight fraction of para-isomer. So that would be from the ones with the least para to the most.

Let me list the compounds first:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

So each of these is a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent directs the incoming electrophile (bromine) to certain positions. The nature of the substituent determines whether the ring is activating or deactivating, and whether the positions are ortho, meta, or para directing.

Wait, the substituents in each case:

1) CH3: methyl group, which is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
2) COOEt (ester group): deactivating, meta-directing because it's an electron-withdrawing group (since esters are like carbonyl groups attached to OR groups). Wait, but wait, esters are more accurately meta-directing because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So nitro groups are strong deactivating and meta, but esters are less deactivating but still meta.
3) Cl: deactivating, ortho/para. Chlorine is a bit tricky because it's an electron-withdrawing by inductive effect but donates electrons through resonance (since it's more electronegative, maybe the inductive effect dominates). So Cl is deactivating, ortho/para-directing.
4) NO2: strong deactivating, meta-directing. Nitro groups are meta directors because they withdraw electrons through resonance and inductive effects.
5) C2H5: ethyl group. Similar to methyl, it's an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
6) COOH: carboxylic acid group. Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. Because the COOH group is electron-withdrawing, it deactivates the ring and directs incoming electrophiles to meta positions.

Wait, but wait: for substituents with strong electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro, carbonyl, etc. They make the ring less reactive, but also direct where the substitution occurs.

So for each substituent, I need to determine the directing effect and whether it's activating or deactivating.

Let me list each substituent and their directing:

1. CH3: activating, o/p-directing. So substitution occurs more in ortho and para positions. But since the substituent is an activating group, the ring is more reactive than benzene, so the reaction is more likely.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So when the substituent is o/p-directing, the incoming Br can go to ortho, para, or maybe even meta if steric factors are considered, but mainly ortho and para.

But the question is about the distribution between ortho, meta, and para. For substituents that are o/p-directing, para is a possible position. For meta-directing, only meta is possible.

But wait, in the case of substituents that are o/p-directing, the major products are the ortho and para products. So the para isomer's fraction would be a certain percentage. The more activating the substituent, the higher the percentage of para? Or not necessarily? Because for more activating groups, the ring is more reactive, but how does that affect the ratio between ortho and para?

Wait, no. The percentage of para depends on the substituent's directing. For example, if a substituent is strongly o-directing, like a strong activating group, then the majority of the substitution is ortho, with some para. But for a substituent that's more p-directing, the ratio is higher in para.

Wait, but in the case of substituents like -CH3, which is o/p-directing, but more activating, the para isomer might not be the major one. Wait, no, in toluene, the para isomer is a major product, but the ortho is more due to steric hindrance. Wait, no, wait. When you have a substituent that's o/p-directing, the major products are ortho and para. But in toluene, the para isomer is actually
