Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. Okay, there are two compounds, A and B, each treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. The result is two different diketones. I need to find which starting materials A and B correspond to the given products.

The products are:

1. 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione.
2. 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.

Hmm, I remember that sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and HCl are involved in some kind of nitrosation or maybe a diazotization reaction. But wait, when alcohols are treated with HCl, NaNO2, and water, what happens? I think that might be related to the Stephen reduction or maybe the production of a ketone through some rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: Diazonium salts. Oh, right! The reaction of an alcohol with HCl and NaNO2 might lead to the formation of a diazonium salt, which can then undergo a reaction like hydrolysis to form a ketone. But wait, noâ€”alcohols can't form diazonium salts directly. Oh wait, maybe it's about the conversion of alcohols to ketones via the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction? No, that's for carboxylic acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up with the Fisher indole synthesis or something else. Alternatively, I've heard about the treatment of alcohols with HCl and NaNO2 in the context of the formation of nitrosobenzenes, but that's for aromatic compounds. Not sure about aliphatic alcohols.

Wait a second, the problem mentions that the treatment produces diketones. So each starting material must be producing two ketone groups. So, the starting material must have two alcohol groups or something that can form two ketones.

Wait, another approach: The reaction conditions include HCl, NaNO2, and water. This reminds me of the synthesis of ketones from alcohols via the Stephen reduction, but no, that's when you have a primary alcohol being converted into a ketone. Wait, no, the Stephen reduction typically involves an aldehyde or ketone with a diazonium salt. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I think sometimes the treatment of 1,2-diols (vicinal diols) with nitrous acid can lead to
