Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the quasar question here. Hmm, let's read it again. So, observations of a quasar are being made in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops a lot below that. I remember that in astronomy, the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm, but that's in the ultraviolet. Wait, but if the peak is in the infrared, maybe it's redshifted?

Redshift would mean the wavelength we observe is longer than the emitted one. So if the peak is at 790 nm, that's much longer than the usual optical wavelengths. Wait, I think visible light is about 400-700 nm. So 790 is near-infrared. So that must be a redshifted emission line.

But which line? The Lyman-alpha is 121 nm when emitted. If it's observed at 790 nm, the redshift z would be (790 / 121) - 1. Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.528. So z ≈ 5.528. Hmm, wait, no: wait, the formula is observed wavelength = emitted wavelength * (1+z). So 790 = 121*(1+z). So 1+z = 790/121 ≈ 6.5289. So z ≈ 5.5289. That's a high redshift.

Alternatively, maybe it's the Balmer series emission lines. For example, H-alpha is about 656 nm. But wait, the peak is at 790, which is longer than that. So if H-alpha is emitted at 656 nm, and observed at 790, then 1+z = 790/656 ≈ 1.204. So z≈0.204. But that's a much lower redshift, which would place it not so far away. But in that case, the drop in flux below 790 nm would be because of absorption features or something else.

Wait, but quasars usually have strong emission lines, and the Lyman-alpha forest is seen in their spectra when they're at high redshifts. So if the peak is at 790
