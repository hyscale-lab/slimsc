Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about nuclear decay and energy spectra. Hmm, I remember that in nuclear physics, when a nucleus undergoes decay, the products can have certain energy distributions. Let me think about what I know.

The original reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the E particles here have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. So, in beta decay, for example, the emitted electron has a continuous spectrum because the Q value is shared among the emitted particles and the recoiling nucleus. But wait, beta decay usually emits an electron and an antineutrino, right?

In the variant, two V particles are replaced by one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Now, M is massless, so it doesn't contribute to the rest mass—it's like a photon or a gluon maybe, but I don't think that's relevant here.

The question is about the energy spectrum of E now. In the original decay, the E particles had a continuous spectrum because their energies varied depending on how the total energy Q was divided among them and the other particles.

Wait, in the original case, since there are two E and two V particles, the energy could be partitioned in various ways. The E particles might have a range of energies because the total energy Q is distributed among all four emitted particles. That's why their spectrum is continuous.

But in the variant, we have two E particles and one M. M is massless, so its energy would be purely kinetic, I think. But wait, M is massless, so its rest mass is zero. So when you split the Q value, the M would carry away some energy, but since it's massless, all its energy is kinetic.

So the total energy available for E and M is still Q, I suppose. Let's think about energy conservation. The sum of the energies of 2E and M must be Q.

In the original case, each E and V particle shared the energy. So E's energy could vary. Now, with M, which is massless, it's a bit different. Since M is massless, its energy is just its kinetic energy, but in this case, how is it treated?

Wait, in cases where a massless particle is emitted, like a photon, you have to consider that the photon's energy is determined by the conservation laws. But in this case, M is a single particle, so the energies would be divided between the two E's and the M.

Wait, but in the original scenario, when you have two E and two V, they can share the energy in any way. So each E might have less energy, but when you have one M, perhaps the E's can take more, or maybe less?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the energy distribution. In the original decay, each E and V could share the energy. So, for example, each E could have some energy, and each V could have some. But since the V
