Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

So the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so if the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is coming towards it at 60,000 km/s, right? Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta. Oh, wait, no. Wait a second, I think I got that wrong. Because if the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy. But from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So the two frames are moving relative to each other at that speed.

The question asks: What distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame? So I need to find the distance in the Galaxy frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's time.

Wait, but to find the distance in the Galaxy frame, I probably need to know how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame. Because if there's time dilation, then the time experienced in each frame is different. Oh, right! Because the frames are moving relative to each other, there's time dilation due to special relativity. But wait, the problem says that both are inertial frames. So I should use the Lorentz transformation equations.

Let me recall the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where v is the relative speed between the frames.

Wait, here, v is 60,000 km/s. Let me calculate that in terms of the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So v is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2 times c. So v = 0.2c.

So gamma would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me calculate that. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98, because 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is very close. So gamma is about 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately. 0.96 is the denominator under the square root. Let me compute sqrt(0.96):

Hmm, 0.98 squared is 0.9604, as I thought. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798 (since 0.9798^2 = (0.98 -
