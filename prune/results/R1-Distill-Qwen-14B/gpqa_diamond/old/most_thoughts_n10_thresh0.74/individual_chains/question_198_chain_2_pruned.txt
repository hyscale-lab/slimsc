Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the stability constants of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes and determining the percentage of a specific blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species.

Hmm, let's see. The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I assume is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex because dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. Oh wait, but wait, Co can form complexes with different numbers of SCN-.

So, the stability constants (β) are for different complexes. Let me recall: the stability constant (formation constant) β_n is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n ligands. So, Co^2+ + n SCN^- <-> Co(SCN)_n^2−n+.

In this case, the complexes are CoSCN+, Co(SCN)_2^0, Co(SCN)_3^- (since 3 SCN would make charge 2+ -3*1= -1?), wait, no, wait. Wait, each SCN- is -1. So for Co^2+:

- n=1: Co(SCN)^(2+ -1) = Co(SCN)^+ → charge +1.
- n=2: Co(SCN)_2^(2+ -2) = Co(SCN)_2^0 → neutral.
- n=3: Co(SCN)_3^(2+ -3) = Co(SCN)_3^- → charge -1.
- n=4: Co(SCN)_4^(2+ -4) = Co(SCN)_4^2- → charge -2.

Wait, but the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each βn is for the complex with n thiocyanate ions.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the n=2 complex, Co(SCN)_2^0. So, we need to find the fraction of all Co species that are in the form where two SCN- are attached.

So, the approach is to calculate the distribution of Co among all possible complexes and find which fraction corresponds to the dithiocyanato form.

I remember that when dealing with multiple stability constants, the fraction of each species can be determined using the equilibrium expressions. The fraction f_n of each complex Co(SCN)_n^(2−n) is given by f_n = (β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n) / Σ (β_i [Co^2+][SCN^-]^i) for i from 1 to 4. Wait, no, wait. Because the complexes are hierarchical—each subsequent complex forms from the previous. So, the general approach is to consider all possible species and find their relative concentrations.

Wait, but I think the correct way is to model the system using all four possible complexes and the free ion, Co^2+.

Wait, but the free Co^2+ is present, and each complex is formed stepwise. So, the overall distribution depends on the β values and the concentrations.

So, the formula for the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (β_n * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n) / (Σ
