Okay, so I've got this question here about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, because parallax is the apparent shift in position when observed from different points in the orbit. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us. And the formula for distance in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax, like distance = 1/plx. So if plx increases, distance decreases, meaning the star is closer.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, if I have a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, does that mean their distances are uniformly distributed? Or their positions on the celestial sphere? Because parallax depends on distance. So if they're uniformly distributed in space, but in all directions, then the number of stars at a certain distance would depend on the volume of space at that distance.

Oh, right! The number density of stars in space would be uniform, but when you project onto the sky, the number depends on the volume element. Let me think about how the number of stars in a thin spherical shell depends on the radius.

The volume of a thin shell at radius r with thickness dr is approximately 4πr² dr. So if the number of stars per unit volume is n (constant), then the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π r² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since r = 1/plx, and plx is in arcseconds. Let me write that as r = 1/plx. So plx = 1/r.

I need to find the number of stars per unit plx. Let's say we take a small interval in plx, dplx. What's the corresponding interval in r? Since r = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, the negative sign just indicates the direction as plx increases, r decreases, which is correct. But for the magnitude, I can ignore the sign.

So, the number of stars in a dplx interval would be the number of stars in the corresponding range of r.
