Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electron scattering. Hmm, elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, phase shifts... Right, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the optical theorem or something like that. Oh wait, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed in terms of the partial waves. For each angular momentum l, you have a phase shift δ_l, right?

The formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts comes to mind. I think it's something like f(θ, φ) = (1/(2i)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{i 2δ_l} - 1 ) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, the incident beam direction is when the scattering angle θ is zero, right? Because the beam is along, say, the z-axis, and θ=0 would mean the particle scatters forward along the same direction.

But wait, along the incident beam direction, which would be θ=0. So I need to evaluate the imaginary part of f(0,φ). Let's think about the expression for f(θ, φ) at θ=0. The Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are known, right? Because P_l(1
