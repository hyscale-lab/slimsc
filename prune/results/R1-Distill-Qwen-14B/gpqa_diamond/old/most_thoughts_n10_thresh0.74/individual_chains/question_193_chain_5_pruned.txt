Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax^5). And we need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So parallax plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So plx = 1/d or d = 1/plx.

But the question is about the number of stars as a function of parallax. So N ‚àù 1/plx^5. Hmm, so when parallax increases, N decreases, which makes sense because closer stars have higher parallax, but you can see more of them? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, more stars would be in a larger volume if they are farther away. Oh, wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So higher parallax means closer. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, that's N = k / plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substitute that in. So N = k * d^5. Oh wait, that's because plx is 1/d, so 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So
