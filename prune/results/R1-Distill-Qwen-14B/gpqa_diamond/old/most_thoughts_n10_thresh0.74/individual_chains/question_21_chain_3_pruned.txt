Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by trying to understand each part of the question.

The question says that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are two types: constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different structures, like different connectivity, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like geometric or optical isomers.

The question is in two parts, A and B. Part A is asking which of the two compounds (benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) does NOT show tautomerism. Part B is asking which of the other two compounds (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism.

I think I need to tackle each part separately.

Starting with part A: Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different structures, usually involving the movement of a hydrogen and the reorganization of double bonds. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a ketone can tautomerize to an enol. So, the presence of adjacent double bonds and hydrogens can allow for such shifts.

Benzoquinone: I'm picturing a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is C6H4O2. It has two ketone groups. Depending on the structure, maybe it's 1,4-benzoquinone, which would have two carbonyl groups opposite each other on the ring.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This would be a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, each of these carbonyls is separated by a CH2 group. Wait, but in such a structure, are there any adjacent carbonyl groups that could allow for tautomerism? Let me think. For tautomerism, you typically need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. Also, in a cyclic structure like this, maybe there's some conjugation that allows for the movement of a hydrogen, leading to tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. Benzoquinone is a diketone. Depending on its structure, perhaps it can have some tautomerism. Alternatively, maybe not. Let me think about specific examples. I remember that 1
