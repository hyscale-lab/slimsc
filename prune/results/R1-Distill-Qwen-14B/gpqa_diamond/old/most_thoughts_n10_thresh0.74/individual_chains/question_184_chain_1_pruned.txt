Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I'll visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (-OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group (-NO2). So the substituents are at the 1, 2, 3 positions. Wait, position 2 is ortho to ethoxy (position 1), and meta to nitro (position 3)?

Wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering would be such that substituents are in the order of their priority based on the substituent's priority. Wait, no, I think the numbering is done to give the lowest possible numbers. So let's see.

Wait, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, the numbering goes 1, 2, 3. So, it's a tri-substituted benzene with these groups in adjacent positions? Because 1, 2, 3 are consecutive. Or are they in some other arrangement?

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the order of introducing substituents. Because when you add substituents to a benzene ring, the order in which you add them can affect the positions due to directing effects.

Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution. The directing effect of substituents depends on whether they are activating or deactivating, and whether they are ortho/para or meta directors.

Ethoxy group (-OEt) is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating group via the lone pairs on oxygen) and is an ortho/para director. Nitro groups are deactivating and meta directors. Tert-butyl group is a bulky, activating (since it's an alkyl group, which donates electrons via induction, but wait, no, wait: wait,
