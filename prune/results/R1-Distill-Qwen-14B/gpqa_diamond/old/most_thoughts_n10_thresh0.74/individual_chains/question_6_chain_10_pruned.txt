Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to break it down and see if I can figure it out.

The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.

Wait, I remember that in polar coordinates, sometimes potentials can be expressed in terms of r and θ. So the potential here has two terms: one that's purely radial, (1/2)kr², and another that's also radial but multiplied by cos²θ. So maybe this can be rewritten in a more manageable form.

I think I can factor out r² from both terms. Let me see: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Oh, right, because 1 + 3 cos²θ would make it 1 + 3 times the second term. Wait, wait, no, actually, the original is (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Yeah, so factoring out (1/2)kr², that's correct.

Wait, no. Let me check: (1/2) kr² times (1 + 3 cos²θ) would give back the original expression. So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ).

Hmm, maybe that's not the most helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can separate the potential into different components. Let me think: 1 + 3 cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Because cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that, 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ. That combines to (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize the form of the potential. Wait, the potential is a function of r and cosθ, which suggests that the system might have some angular dependence, perhaps leading
