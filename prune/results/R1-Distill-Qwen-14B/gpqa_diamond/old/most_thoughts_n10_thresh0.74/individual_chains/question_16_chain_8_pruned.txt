Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can think it through. The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. The options are A to D, with the numbers varying from 2 to 5.

First, I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has chiral centers, meaning the compound isn't superimposable on its mirror image. So the key here is to identify which of these compounds have chiral centers.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Hmm, this is an alkene with substituents. The configuration is Z. But wait, does that affect chirality? Chiral centers require four different groups attached to a carbon. In this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl, a methyl group, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw it. Structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2 (but-1-ene). C2 has a methyl group and two CH2 groups. Wait, no. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon of the double bond. So the structure is Cl-C double bond CHCH2CH3? Wait, no, but 2-methyl would be on the second carbon. So the molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

   No, more accurately, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the butene is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, that can't be right because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl on C1, and methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is Cl on the first carbon of the double bond. So the structure is Cl-C double bond CHCH2CH3, but with a methyl on C2. Wait, maybe it's Cl attached to the same carbon as the double bond. So the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the substituents on C1 would be Cl, two Hs (since it's a double bond, maybe?), and the adjacent carbon. Wait, maybe it's CHCl=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, but the position is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl, two Hs, and the double bond to C2. So for C1, the groups are Cl, H, H, and a double bond to C2. But wait, a double bond
