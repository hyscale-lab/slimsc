Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Hmm, wait, dark spots on a star are cooler regions, right? So when parts of the star are covered by these spots, the average temperature of the star decreases.

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They mention that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. And the question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

The transition between these two energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…. Oh, that's in the extreme ultraviolet or maybe near it. But I'm not sure if the wavelength itself is directly important here. Wait, since we're dealing with the ratio of populations in different energy levels, that's related to the Boltzmann equation, right?

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So, the ratio depends on the temperatures.

Wait, but in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is lower. So, the effective temperature is 5500 K instead of 6000 K when the spots are present. But wait, the spots themselves might be cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So, the effective temperature changes because the star emits less total flux when a part is covered by cooler spots.

But the photosphere's temperature... Wait, does the presence of spots lower the photosphere's temperature where the spots are? Or is the overall effective temperature just an average? Maybe the effective temperature of the star as a whole is lower, but the unspotted regions have the same
