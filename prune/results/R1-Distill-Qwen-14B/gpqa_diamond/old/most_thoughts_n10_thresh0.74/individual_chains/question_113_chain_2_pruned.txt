Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. So, I have an unknown compound, and I need to figure out its formula based on the given spectroscopic data. The options are all C6H something with O and maybe O2. Let me go through each piece of data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a broad peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak might be more indicative of a strong hydrogen bonding, which could be a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an -OH group in a different environment, like a phenol. But let me think about the other peaks. There are strong absorptions at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, ester, or maybe an amide. But the 1650 is a bit lower, which might suggest conjugation or maybe an aromatic ring. Wait, 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone next to an aromatic ring, or maybe an aromatic carbonyl group, or possibly an acid. 

Wait, the two carbonyl peaks could be from different functional groups. Alternatively, 1700 is a strong peak for a carbonyl, and 1650 might be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching, but those usually are around 1600). Or perhaps it's an amide or another type of carbonyl. Hmm. Let me think. Another possibility is that 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, maybe as in an acid where the carbonyl is at 1700 and the C-O stretch is around 1650? Or maybe it's an ester or something else.

Wait, another thought: 1700 is a strong peak for a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone or ester. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like a carbonyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring's C=C stretch, but those are usually around 1600. But
