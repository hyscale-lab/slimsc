Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, a spin-half particle in a certain superposition state. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator. Hmm, expectation values, right. I remember that the expectation value of an operator gives the average measurement outcome if you measured that observable many times on the same state.

The state given is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So that's a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states, which are eigenstates of σz. Oh right, σz is the Pauli z-matrix, and similarly, σx is the Pauli x-matrix.

The operator in question is 10σz +5σx. So I think I need to find the expectation value of this operator for the given state. Breaking it down, the expectation value of a sum is the sum of the expectations, so I can compute each part separately.

So the expectation value <10σz +5σx> is equal to 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes things easier. Now I just need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state.

Starting with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value for σz in this state should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

So the state is a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me compute ⟨σz⟩. The expectation value is calculated as the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So probability for |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. And for |↓⟩, it's |sqrt(3)/2|^2. Let me calculate that: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1). That would be 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is a bit trickier. I remember that σx has eigenstates that are the superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Oh wait, but in this case, the state is already given in terms of σz eigenstates. How do I compute the expectation value of σx in this state?

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is the inner product of the state with σx acting on the state, right? So let me write it out. The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So σx ψ would be 0.5 σx |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) σx |↓⟩.

Wait, what's σx acting on |↑⟩ and |↓⟩? I think σx|↑⟩ is |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ is |↑⟩. Because σx is the Pauli x matrix, which swaps the spin-up and spin-down states. So σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So applying σx to ψ gives: 0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩.

Now, the inner product ⟨ψ | σx | ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of ψ dotted with σx ψ. Since the coefficients are real (0.5 and sqrt(3)/2), the conjugate doesn't change anything. So expanding this out, it's:

⟨ψ | σx | ψ⟩ = (0.5)(sigma_x psi)_↑ + (sqrt(3)/2)(sigma_x psi)_↓ )

Wait, no, more precisely, it's the sum over the components. Let me think again.

Wait, the inner product is (0.5* ⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓| ) multiplied by (0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2 |↑⟩ ).

So expanding this, the terms would be:

0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑ | ↓⟩ + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↑ | ↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 * ⟨↓ | ↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) * (sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↓ | ↑⟩.

But ⟨↑| ↓⟩ is zero, and ⟨↓ | ↑⟩ is zero as well. So the cross terms disappear. The remaining terms are:

0.5 * 0.5 * 0 (because ⟨↑ | ↓⟩ is 0) 
+ 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * 1 (since ⟨↑ | ↑⟩ is 1)
+ (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 * 1 (since ⟨↓ | ↓⟩ is 1)
+ (sqrt(3)/2) * (sqrt(3)/2) * 0 (since ⟨↓ | ↑⟩ is 0).

So calculating these:

First term: 0.25 * 0 = 0.
Second term: (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/4) ≈ 0.4330.
Third term: same as second term, since 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is also sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.4330.
Fourth term: 3/4 *0 =0.

Adding them up: 0 + sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it exactly. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but wait—am I sure about this approach? Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for expectation value without expanding. Another approach is to compute ψ† σx ψ.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for expectation value of σx in a state. I recall that for a spin-½ particle, the expectation value of σx in a state |θ, φ⟩ is proportional to the x-component of the Bloch sphere vector.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps using the density matrix approach, but that might complicate things. Let me think again.

Another way is to note that σx can be written in terms of the basis vectors. Let me write down σx as a matrix. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you apply it to the state vector, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], you get [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state multiplied by the matrix times the state. Since the coefficients are real, it's the transpose.

So the state vector is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So σx |ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then the inner product ⟨ψ | σx | ψ⟩ is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) )

Which is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2*( sqrt(3)/4 ) ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but wait! Wait a second. Because the expectation value is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T ?

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly. The expectation value is the dot product of the row vector (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) and the column vector (sqrt(3)/2, 0.5). So:

0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = [ 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ] + [ (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 ] = twice (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2 * (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So yes, that's correct.

So going back to the original expectation value:

⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2 )

Calculating each term:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2 ) ≈ 5*(0.866) ≈ 4.33.

Adding them together: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205. So sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866025.

So 5 * 0.866025 ≈ 4.330125.

10 * (-0.5) = -5.

So total expectation value is -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.

Rounded to one decimal place, that would be -0.7.

Wait, but wait. The options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So the answer would be option C: -0.7.

But wait a moment. Let me double-check the calculation of the expectation value.

Wait, 10σz gives expectation 10*(-0.5) = -5.

5σx gives 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*(0.8660) ≈4.330.

Adding them: -5 +4.330 = -0.6699, which rounds to -0.7. So option C is -0.7.

So that should be the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) is a linear combination of these eigenstates, so the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2(+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2(-1).
\]

Calculating the probabilities:
\[
|0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) swaps \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), so \( \sigma_x |\uparrow\rangle = |\downarrow\rangle \) and \( \sigma_x |\downarrow\rangle = |\uparrow\rangle \). Applying \( \sigma_x \) to \( \psi \), we get:
\[
\sigma_x \psi = 0.5|\downarrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\uparrow\rangle.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is the inner product of \( \psi \) and \( \sigma_x \psi \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)(0.5) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right).
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 0.25 + 0.75 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the total expectation value
The total expectation value is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866).
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
10(-0.5) = -5, \quad 5(0.866) \approx 4.33.
\]

Adding them:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle \approx -0.7.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.
