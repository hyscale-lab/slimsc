Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because of the effects of special relativity. Newtonian addition of velocities doesn't work here. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is needed.

Wait, the formula for adding velocities, like when you have two objects moving at speeds u and v relative to a rest frame, and you want to find the speed of one as seen from the other. So the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). Or wait, which one is which? Let me think. If the two astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction, then from the perspective of the one moving at 0.6c, the other's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait, no. Wait a second. Wait, when you're calculating the relative speed, you have to think about which frame you're in. So, for object 1 (mass 2m) moving at u = 0.6c, and object 2 (mass 3m) moving at v = 0.5c in the same direction. So from object 1's frame, what is object 2's speed? Because they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). Wait no, wait, no. Wait, actually, if u is the velocity of the first observer, then the velocity of the second observer relative to the first would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Because u is the speed of the first, and v is the speed of the second in the same frame.

Wait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So, let me plug in
