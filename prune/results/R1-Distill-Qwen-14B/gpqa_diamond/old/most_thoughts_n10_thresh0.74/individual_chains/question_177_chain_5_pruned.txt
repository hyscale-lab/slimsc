Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given data is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, mass might come into play elsewhere, but maybe not directly for luminosity here. Let me think about what affects a star's luminosity.

The problem states that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Wait, the peak wavelength for a star's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, that's Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So 位_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. That's important.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so it's not moving towards or away from us much, or maybe it's just stationary relative to us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted; moving away, it's redshifted. But since we're dealing with the peak wavelengths, which were determined through spectroscopy, I think that the Doppler shift would affect the observed wavelength, but the actual emission peak (rest wavelength) is what's important for calculating intrinsic properties like luminosity.

Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. So their observed 位_max is the same, but their actual (rest) temperatures might differ because of the Doppler effect. Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. If Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed 位_max would be shorter (blueshifted), and if moving away, longer (redshifted). But the problem says their observed 位_max is the same. So Star_2 must have a Doppler shift that corrects for whatever intrinsic temperature difference there is.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the peak wavelengths are the same, so their
