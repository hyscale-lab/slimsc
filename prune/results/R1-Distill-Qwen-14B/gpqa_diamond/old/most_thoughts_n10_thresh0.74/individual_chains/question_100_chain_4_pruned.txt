Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and think step by step.

So, the question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 is propene because the molecular formula for propene is C3H6. Oh wait, wait, wait. Propene is C3H6, but another possibility is cyclopropane, but that's C3H6 as well. Hmm, but cyclopropane is a ring, so when it undergoes bromination, it's more likely to be an alkene because bromination of alkenes is a common reaction. So I think A is propene.

Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of CCl4. Oh, that's a typical bromination condition for alkenes. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) reacts with Br2 in CCl4, which is a non-polar solvent. The bromine adds across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3. When Br2 adds, it can add in a dibromide. The bromine adds across the double bond. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane: BrCH2CHBrCH3?

Wait, no. Propene structure is CH2-CH2-CH3, no, wait. No, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds, it would be anti addition. So the product would be trans dibromide, but the structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Wait, no, the addition across the double bond would give 1,2-dibromopropane, but the configuration depends on the addition. But regardless, the product B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and heat usually leads to elimination reactions. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When it reacts with alcoholic KOH, it's likely to undergo dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but there are two Br atoms. So which one leaves first? Wait, if it's 1,2-dibromopropane, then the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When treated with KOH, which is a strong base, it will eliminate HBr. So when
