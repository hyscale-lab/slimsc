Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about a star similar to the Sun. It has some dark spots covering one hemisphere, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The situation is such that when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness variations. The problem says that this setup can resemble an exoplanet causing similar brightness changes. But the main question is, if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet, what would its radius need to be relative to the star's radius to produce the same brightness variation amplitude.

Hmm, okay. So I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet transiting the star. Because when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, the spots modulate the brightness as they rotate into and out of view.

Wait, but in this case, the star has spots that are cooler. When the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, making the star appear dimmer because the spots are cooler. The same effect would happen if a planet transited the star, blocking some light. So the observed brightness variation should be similar in both cases if the area blocked is the same.

Wait, but the brightness variation due to spots is a bit different. Because when the spots are on the visible side, the star's overall brightness is lower. For the planet, it's just blocking the light, so it's a straightforward occultation. The variation in brightness for both cases would depend on the area blocked.

So, the amplitude of the signal (the change in brightness) depends on the fraction of the star's light that's blocked or the area that's cooler. Let's consider both scenarios.

First, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere (so 50% of the surface?), but the filling factor is 20%. Wait, wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. Oh, right, because a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So total spotted area is 20% of the hemisphere. So the total area of
