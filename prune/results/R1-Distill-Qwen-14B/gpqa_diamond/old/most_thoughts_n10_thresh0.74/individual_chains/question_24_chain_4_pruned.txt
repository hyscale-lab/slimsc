Okay, I'm going to try to solve this chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about some mixtures and hydrogenation reactions. Let me read it again and see what I can figure out.

So, we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Mixture Y is a result of a disproportionation reaction. Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, they give only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Z is a component of Y and is used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. Additionally, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.

Alright, I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Let me break this down. First, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. That suggests that X has compounds with double bonds, like alkenes or maybe conjugated dienes. But wait, the question says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So, probably, X has compounds with isolated double bonds, perhaps mono-olefins.

When X is treated with Pt when heated, it undergoes a reaction to form Y. The reaction is a disproportionation, which means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Common examples are reactions like 2 NO â†’ N2 + O2, but in terms of organic chemistry, I'm thinking maybe a diene undergoing some kind of change. Wait, wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids, so perhaps each component undergoes disproportionation on its own.

Wait, no. Since Y is formed from X via a disproportionation, perhaps the components of X are themselves undergoing decomposition into other substances. Alternatively, maybe each component in X is undergoing a reaction that changes its structure, leading to a different mixture.

But the reaction leads to Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y must not have any double bonds, or any unsaturated bonds that can react with bromine. So, Y probably consists of alkanes or maybe some other fully saturated compounds.

So, maybe X has alkenes, and Y has alkanes. But wait, when alken
