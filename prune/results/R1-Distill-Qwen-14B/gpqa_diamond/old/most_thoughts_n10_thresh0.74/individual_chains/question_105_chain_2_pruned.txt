Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When observed, the brightness variations due to rotation look like those caused by an exoplanet. The task is to find the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude. So, the question boils down to comparing the photometric signals from the spots and the planet.

First, I remember that the brightness variation (the dip in light when a planet transits the star) depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the dip in flux is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

Wait, but in this case, the star has spots. The spots are cooler and when they rotate into and out of view, they cause variations in the star's brightness. But the spots are on one hemisphere, so as the star rotates, the spots come into the line of sight and then go away. This would create a periodic dimming and brightening in the observations.

The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So 20% of one hemisphere is covered. But how does that affect the observed brightness variation?

I think the total area of the spots is important. The spots are on one hemisphere, but since it's only one hemisphere, when the star rotates, the spots will come into view. Let me calculate the area of the spots.

The area of a hemisphere is (2π R^2). If the filling factor is 20%, then the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2π R^2) = 0.4 π R^2. But wait, the star's radius is the same as the Sun, Rstar = R_sun.

Wait, but when the star rotates, let's say the spots are on the far side when the star is at a certain position. When it rotates so that the spots face us, we see the spots, which are cooler, so the brightness decreases. The maximum effect is when the spots are fully visible. So the change in brightness depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

Wait no, the spots are cooler. So when they're facing us, the star's brightness is lower because those spots are emitting less. So the observed flux change is a dip when the spots are in view.

But the question says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet. So normally, if the star didn't have spots, an exoplanet would cause a dip in brightness when it transits. The amplitude of the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2. But in this case, the star's spots cause a dip similar to a planet's transit.

So, we need to compute the maximum dip caused by the spots and set that equal to the dip caused by the planet. Then solve for Rp.

Wait, but wait, the spots are cooler, so the dip is due to the spots being less bright than the surrounding photosphere. Let me model this. The total flux
