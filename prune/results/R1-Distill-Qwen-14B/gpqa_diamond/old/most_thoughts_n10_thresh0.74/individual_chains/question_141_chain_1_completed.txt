Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is. 

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A) 4, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3.

Hmm. Wait, wait. 1-bromobenzene-2-d? I'm not entirely sure what that structure is. Let me break it down. Benzene has six carbons. The numbering starts at the bromine. So, if it's 1-bromo, then the bromine is at position 1. Then the -2-d must refer to something else. Oh, right, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene where the substituents are in positions 1 and 2. So, wait, 1-bromo and 2-d, but what's the d? Oh, wait, maybe it's di-substituted? Like, benzene with two groups: a bromine and another group? Or maybe it's a typo, and the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene, or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Wait, no, that might not make sense. Wait, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe the 'd' is a typo or shorthand. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as o-bromo-xylene? Or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, making it bromomethylbenzene in the ortho position.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene. Wait, the 'd' could stand for something else, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about a reaction with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia, which is a strong base. NaNH2 is a strong base, so it's often used for deprotonation. But what kind of protons? Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but that's more for aliphatic compounds. Alternatively, for aromatic rings with strong electron-withdrawing groups, the ring can be activated towards elimination or other reactions.

Wait, but benzene rings with substituents might undergo elimination if possible. Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of aromatic substitution, but more likely, since NaNH2 is a strong base, it's a deprotonation reaction.

Wait, maybe the molecule is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So, the substituents are bromine at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2. So, the structure is o-bromo-N,N-dimethylaniline. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the para and ortho positions.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think again. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, perhaps the benzene has a bromine at position 1 and a methyl group at position 2. So, it's o-bromotoluene. Hmm, that makes sense. Because 'd' could be a typo for 'methyl'? Or perhaps it's 2,4-dimethyl. But perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the structure is o-bromotoluene, so that it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene.

So, the starting material is o-bromotoluene. Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. What does that do?

I recall that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. In aromatic chemistry, when a benzene ring has a good leaving group and a strong base, it can lead to elimination, forming a double bond, perhaps forming a benzene ring with a substituent that's an alkene. But wait, benzene is already conjugated. Alternatively, if the substituent is in a position that allows for elimination, such as when there's a hydrogen adjacent to a leaving group, perhaps a benzyne intermediate is formed. Wait, but that usually involves two leaving groups. Like, for example, when you have 1,2-dihaloarenes, and the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a triple bond (like a benzyne), which can then undergo various reactions.

But in this case, the starting material is o-bromotoluene. So, it's a bromine in the ortho position to a methyl group. Wait, but that's not di-substituted with two leaving groups. So, maybe it doesn't form a benzyne. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group is adjacent to the bromine. Wait, in o-bromotoluene, the methyl is at position 2 and the bromine at position 1. So, the methyl and bromine are next to each other on the benzene ring.

Wait, but methyl groups are electron-donating, so perhaps the base (NaNH2) can abstract a proton from the methyl group adjacent to the bromine, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond. But wait, methyl groups have only three hydrogens, and they are all equivalent. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group (which is adjacent to the bromine), then elimination of HBr would occur, leading to a benzene ring with a CH2 group and a double bond. Wait, but benzene rings can't have double bonds adjacent unless it's part of the aromatic system. So, perhaps elimination would create a double bond within the ring, but that's already part of the aromatic structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. So, if the structure is o-bromotoluene (1-bromo-2-methylbenzene), and we treat it with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, what happens? Maybe the methyl group is deprotonated. But NaNH2 is a strong base, but the methyl group's protons are not very acidic. The pKa of a methyl proton is around 45, while NaNH2 is a stronger base (since NH2^- has a conjugate acid pKa around 35). Wait, so it's possible that it can deprotonate the methyl group, but perhaps it's not favorable. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton alpha to the bromine, leading to elimination.

Wait, but wait, methyl groups adjacent to a good leaving group (like bromine) may undergo elimination if the base is strong enough. So, in o-bromotoluene, the methyl is at position 2 and bromine at position 1. So, the methyl group is attached to the same carbon as the bromine? No, because in benzene, each substituent is on a different carbon. Wait, o-bromotoluene would have the bromine in position 1, and the methyl in position 2, which is adjacent (ortho) to the bromine. So, the structure would be:

Benzene ring:
1: Br, 2: CH3, and the other positions are H.

So, the methyl is at position 2, ortho to Br. Now, the base (NH2^-) might abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group. But methyl groups are not that acidic. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen alpha to the bromine, but wait, in this case, the methyl is the only substituent adjacent to the bromine.

Wait, but wait, when a strong base is used, perhaps it can abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to elimination of Br^- as a leaving group, but that would require the formation of a double bond. However, since the ring is already aromatic, perhaps that's not feasible. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton that's beta to the bromine, leading to elimination. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of aromatic substitution. Wait, but the bromide is a leaving group. So, perhaps the base abstracts a proton that allows for the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. But wait, benzene is already conjugated, so perhaps it's more about elimination leading to a ring contraction or expansion. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think of this as a dehydrohalogenation. So, if the H is abstracted from the methyl group, which is adjacent to the Br, then elimination would occur, removing H and Br and forming a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. But wait, in a benzene ring, the carbons are all spÂ² hybridized, so forming a double bond between C1 and C2 might not change much, as they already have double bonds in the ring. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps this reaction is a case of elimination to form a triple bond, leading to benzyne. But for that, usually two leaving groups are needed. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene would eliminate two HBr molecules upon treatment with a strong base to form benzyne. But in this case, it's only a bromine and a methyl group. So maybe that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about deprotonation leading to a ring expansion or some other rearrangement. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the methyl group is acting as a substituent that can undergo an elimination reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility of the methyl group undergoing elimination. So, the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group, making it a CH2 group. Then, the adjacent bromide leaves, resulting in the formation of a double bond between the carbon where the bromine was and the adjacent carbon. But that would mean the ring now has a double bond between C1 and C2. But benzene already has conjugated double bonds, so adding another might not be feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the ring remains aromatic, and this elimination leads to a loss of a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the product would be benzene with a CH2 group where the Br and CH3 were. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the Br is eliminated, and the ring becomes a double bond. But I'm not entirely clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but rather a nucleophilic substitution. But in aromatic substitution, the ring would need to be activated. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring, making substitution difficult. So SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) is possible only under certain conditions, like in strongly activating groups, but Br is deactivating. Hmm.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe it's used in a different context. Oh, wait, NaNH2 is often used in dehydrohalogenation of aliphatic compounds to form alkenes. Alternatively, it's used in the Birch reduction, but that's for benzene rings and involves different conditions. Wait, no, Birch reduction uses metals like Na and NH3, but maybe the conditions here are different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an elimination forming a benzene ring with a triple bond, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the methyl group is deprotonated, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which could then eliminate Br^-.

Wait, but if the methyl group is deprotonated, it becomes CH2^â, which could then push the Br^- out as a leaving group. Then, a double bond would form between C1 and C2, but since the benzene ring already has double bonds, perhaps the ring would adjust. Alternatively, perhaps the ring remains as it is, and a substituent becomes a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is styrene (vinyl benzene), but that would require the elimination of HBr from a benzene ring with a substituent. So, in o-bromotoluene, eliminating H and Br would give a double bond between C1 and C2, but in the benzene ring, that's already part of the conjugated system. So, perhaps that's not feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the product would have a substituent that's a double bond, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a CH2 group, but that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possibility that the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, 'd' could mean two methyl groups. So, the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. That would mean the bromine is at position 1, and methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4. So, the substituents are in the ortho and para positions relative to the bromine.

In this case, treatment with NaNH2 in ammonia would involve deprotonation. Where are the acidic hydrogens? Well, the methyl groups are attached to the benzene ring, so their hydrogens have a pKa around 45-50. NaNH2 is a strong base, with a conjugate acid pKa ~35, so it can deprotonate such positions. So, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from one of the methyl groups, leading to the elimination of HBr.

Wait, but in 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, each methyl is in positions 2 and 4. So, the methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4 relative to the bromine at position 1. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group at position 2, adjacent to the bromine, then elimination of HBr would occur, leading to a double bond between C1 and C2. Similarly, abstracting a hydrogen from the methyl at position 4 (which is para to the bromine) would lead to elimination of HBr and a double bond between C1 and C4. Wait, but C1 and C4 are not adjacent in benzene, so forming a double bond there isn't possible in the same way.

Wait, no. Benzene is a six-membered ring. Positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, positions 2 and 3, etc. So, position 4 is across from position 1 (para position). So, elimination between C1 and C4 would form a double bond across the ring, but that's not possible because they're opposite each other.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's number the positions as 1 (bromine), 2 (methyl), and 4 (methyl). So, positions 1, 2, and 4 are all occupied. Now, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group at position 2, which is adjacent to position 1 (bromine), elimination would occur between position 1 and 2, forming a double bond. Similarly, abstracting a hydrogen from the methyl at position 4 would require eliminating between position 1 and 4, but those are across the ring, so it's not possible to form a simple double bond there. So, perhaps only the methyl at position 2 can undergo elimination, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2.

But wait, if elimination occurs, the structure would lose H and Br, forming a double bond. So, the product would be 1,2-dimethylbenzene with a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, that's impossible because the benzene ring already has conjugated double bonds, so inserting another might disrupt the aromaticity.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the loss of Br and a hydrogen, forming a new double bond, but how does that affect the ring structure? Maybe it forms a cyclohexadienyl cation or something, but that's not familiar to me.

Wait, another angle: maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, like a Ullmann coupling, but that typically requires a copper catalyst and usually doesn't involve NaNH2. Alternatively, perhaps Grignard-like reactions, but that's usually with Mg, not NaNH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 is acting as a base to deprotonate the methyl groups, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a carbanion. But that seems unlikely without a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about dehalogenation. Eliminating HBr from a brominated aromatic compound. So, for example, if the ring has two substituents that allow for elimination, perhaps it forms a diene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual mechanism. So, NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. But in this case, perhaps it's acting as a base, abstracting a proton alpha to the bromine.

In o-bromotoluene (1-bromo-2-methylbenzene), the methyl group is at position 2, adjacent to the bromine. So, the methyl's hydrogens are adjacent to the Br. If the base abstracts one of these H's, then elimination of Br^- would occur, forming a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but in benzene, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons via double bonds. So, if we form a double bond between C1 and C2, that's already part of the aromatic system. So, perhaps the ring remains benzene, but without the Br and CH3 groups. Wait, no, elimination would remove H and Br, and form a double bond, but that's already present in the ring.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product would lose H and Br, resulting in a ring contraction or expansion. But I'm not aware of such a reaction.

Wait, perhaps the product is toluene, but that seems too simplistic. Or maybe the product is a benzene ring with a CH2 group where the Br and CH3 were, but that doesn't make sense because you can't have two substituents eliminated in that way.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination but instead leads to a substitution. But substitution on an aromatic ring typically requires the ring to be activated, which it's not because Br is a deactivating group.

Wait, maybe this is a case of dehydrohalogenation forming a benzene ring with a double bond substituent. Like, forming an alkene attached to the ring. So, if the bromine and methyl are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons, making a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, that would make sense. So, the starting material is o-bromotoluene (positions 1: Br, 2: CH3). If the base abstracts a hydrogen from the CH3 group (position 2), the adjacent Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. So, the product would be 1-vinylbenzene, which is styrene. But wait, styrene is usually called vinylbenzene, with the vinyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, but in this case, the vinyl group would be between positions 1 and 2. But benzene already has a double bond between 1 and 2 as part of the ring, so adding another might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the ring remains aromatic, but the substituent is a double bond.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think about another approach. Let me consider the possibility that the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, substituents at positions 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), and 4 (CH3). Now, when treated with NaNH2, which is a strong base, it may abstract a proton from one of the methyl groups adjacent to the Br (positions 2 or 4).

If the base abstracts a proton from the methyl at position 2, then elimination of HBr would occur, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. Similarly, abstracting a proton from the methyl at position 4 would form a double bond between C1 and C4. Wait, but C1 and C4 are across the ring, so perhaps only the position 2 is viable for elimination.

Wait, but if elimination occurs at position 2, the product would be 1,2-dimethylbenzene with a double bond between C1 and C2. But that's not possible because the ring already has a double bond there. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the loss of the Br and the methyl groups, forming a new structure. But that seems unlikely without a good leaving group.

Wait, maybe the reaction is more about the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbanion. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from a position that's not adjacent to the Br, leading to some rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the benzene ring itself. But aromatic protons are not that acidic, with pKa around 40, and NaNH2 is a strong enough base to deprotonate them, but that's usually under more forcing conditions. However, in this case, maybe it's possible. Deprotonating the ring would form a benzene anion, which could then attack somewhere else, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming a benzyn intermediate when two substituents are eliminated. But as the starting material only has one Br and two methyl groups, perhaps elimination can occur in two different ways, leading to two different products.

Wait, assuming the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the structure is:

- Position 1: Br
- Position 2: CH3
- Position 4: CH3

Now, treating with NaNH2, which is a strong base. The base can abstract a proton from either the CH3 at position 2 or the CH3 at position 4. Let's see:

1. If it abstracts a proton from position 2 (adjacent to Br), then elimination of HBr occurs, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and a CH3 at position 4.

But wait, the benzene ring can't form a double bond in that position because it's already part of the aromatic system. Alternatively, perhaps the ring remains aromatic, and the substituent becomes a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the product would be 1-vinyl-4-methylbenzene (styrene derivative). But I'm not certain about the structure.

2. Alternatively, if the base abstracts a proton from the CH3 at position 4, which is para to the Br, then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C4. But wait, in a benzene ring, C1 and C4 are across from each other, so forming a double bond between them would require a ring contraction or expansion, which is unlikely.

Hmm. So, perhaps only one elimination is possible, leading to one product. Or maybe two eliminations are possible, leading to two different products.

Wait, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and elimination occurs at position 2, the product would be 1,2-dimethylbenzene with a double bond between C1 and C2. But that's the same as styrene (vinyl benzene) with an additional methyl group at position 4. Wait, no, styrene has a vinyl group (CH2=CHâ), but in this case, elimination would result in a double bond between C1 and C2, making the substituent a CH2 group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is benzene with a double bond between C1 and C2 and a methyl group at C4. But that's structurally similar to 1-vinyl-4-methylbenzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the loss of the bromine and the methyl group, forming a new structure. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2, leading to elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the product would be 1-vinyl-4-methylbenzene. Similarly, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4, maybe the same product is formed because of symmetry, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, positions 2 and 4 are symmetric with respect to the Br at position 1. So, abstracting a hydrogen from either methyl group (positions 2 or 4) would lead to the same product because of the symmetry. Thus, only one product would form.

But wait, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2, elimination leads to a double bond between 1 and 2, leaving a methyl at position 4. Alternatively, if it abstracts from position 4, elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 4, but that's not possible because they're opposite each other in the ring. So, perhaps only one elimination is possible, leading to one product.

But wait, maybe the base can abstract a hydrogen from either position 2 or position 4, leading to two different products. But in this case, the structure would be symmetric, so the products would be the same, leading to only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2, leading to elimination and formation of a double bond between 1 and 2, resulting in a new structure. Similarly, abstracting from position 4 would form a double bond between 1 and 4, but that's not feasible. So, only one product is formed.

Wait, but perhaps there's another possibility. If elimination occurs at position 2, you get a product with a double bond between 1 and 2, and the methyl at position 4 remains. If elimination occurs at position 4, perhaps it's not possible because the base can't abstract a hydrogen from there (maybe it's not adjacent to Br). So, perhaps only one product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from either position 2 or 4, leading to two different products, but due to symmetry, they are the same.

Wait, but in 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the structure is symmetric across the Br. So, abstracting a hydrogen from position 2 and from position 4 would lead to the same product because of the mirror symmetry. So, only one product would form.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from either of the two methyl groups, but the resulting product would have the same structure because of the molecule's symmetry.

So, if elimination occurs at position 2, the product would be 1-vinyl-4-methylbenzene. Similarly, if elimination occurs at position 4, the product would be 1-vinyl-2-methylbenzene. Wait, but in the starting material, 2 and 4 are symmetric with respect to the Br at position 1. So, eliminating from position 2 would give 1-vinyl-4-methylbenzene, and eliminating from position 4 would give 1-vinyl-2-methylbenzene. Are these two structures different?

Wait, no. Because the molecule is symmetric, the products would be the same. Because when you eliminate from position 2, the vinyl group is at position 1, and the methyl is at position 4. Similarly, eliminating from position 4 would result in the vinyl at position 1 and methyl at position 2, but that's the same as the first product because the ring can rotate. So, the product would be a single structure: 1-vinyl-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Wait, no, because in each case, only one methyl remains. Wait, no, wait. If you start with 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene and eliminate H and Br from position 2, the product would have a double bond between 1 and 2, and a methyl at position 4. So, the structure would be 1,2-vinyl-4-methylbenzene, which can also be called 4-methylstyrene. Similarly, eliminating from position 4 would give 1,4-vinyl-2-methylbenzene, but that's not possible because of the ring structure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong again. Let me think about the positions. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the structure is:

Positions:
1: Br
2: CH3
3: H
4: CH3
5: H
6: H

Now, when the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2's methyl group, elimination occurs, removing Br and H, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. The product would then have a CH2 group at position 1 (since the Br is gone) and a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, elimination would form a double bond, so the substituent would be a vinyl group (CH2=CHâ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would be 4-methyl-1-vinylbenzene. Similarly, eliminating from position 4's methyl would give 2-methyl-1-vinylbenzene. But due to the symmetry, these two products are actually the same because the ring can be rotated 180 degrees, making 2-methyl-1-vinylbenzene the same as 4-methyl-1-vinylbenzene. So, only one product would form.

But wait, I'm not so sure. Let me imagine the structure. If the vinyl group is at position 1, and a methyl group is at position 2 in one case, and at position 4 in the other. But in reality, since the ring is symmetric, these two would be the same compound. So, only one product would form.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from either of the two methyl groups, leading to two different products because the resulting vinyl groups are in different positions. But I think due to symmetry, they're the same.

So, if only one product is formed, the correct answer would be B) 1. But wait, maybe I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product because of different possible elimination sites. For example, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and elimination can occur at either position 2 or 4, leading to two different products. But because of the symmetry, these two products are actually the same.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene (o-bromotoluene). So, only one methyl group. In that case, the base could abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the product would be 1-vinylbenzene (styrene) or more accurately, 2-vinyltoluene. But wait, toluene is methylbenzene, so if the bromine is eliminated, the product would be methylbenzene with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's the same as toluene because the methyl would be at position 2, and the double bond would be between 1 and 2. But then, the structure would have a methyl and a double bond on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but in that case, the product would be 1-vinyl-2-methylbenzene. But I'm not sure if that's possible because the ring would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl at C2. That would be a substituted styrene.

In any case, if the starting material is o-bromotoluene, elimination would lead to only one product, resulting in option B) 1.

Wait, but the question gives options up to 4. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms more than one product because of different possible sites of elimination or substitution. Let me think again.

Wait, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2 or 4, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond in either position, but due to symmetry, only one product forms. So, the answer would be 1 product.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from either of the two methyl groups, leading to two different products. But in reality, due to the molecule's symmetry, they are the same product. So, only one product.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to more than one product because the base can abstract a hydrogen from different positions, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene (o-bromotoluene), and the reaction leads to the formation of two products because the methyl group can lose a hydrogen from either side, leading to different products. But I don't think that's the case because the methyl group is symmetric.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that can undergo resonance, leading to multiple products. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a vinyl group, but the substituent can be in different positions, leading to multiple products. But in the case of o-bromotoluene, elimination would only lead to one product.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination. Maybe the base doesn't abstract the methyl proton, but instead abstracts a proton from the benzene ring, leading to a ring deprotonation. But that's not common.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that's more about joining two aromatic rings, which doesn't fit here.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently. The reaction is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. What is this solvent usually used for? It's a strong base and used for deprotonation. It's also used in elimination reactions, like forming alkenes from haloalkanes. So, perhaps in this case, it's an E2 elimination.

So, in the starting material, if there's a good leaving group (Br) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon that can be abstracted by the base, elimination would occur, forming a double bond.

So, for o-bromotoluene, the structure is Br at C1 and CH3 at C2. So, the base could abstract a hydrogen from the CH3 at C2, leading to elimination of Br^- and the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the product would be 1-vinylbenzene, which is styrene.

But wait, styrene is a benzene ring with a vinyl group (CH2=CHâ) attached. So, in this case, the product would be styrene, with the vinyl group at position 1.

But wait, that would mean the benzene ring has a double bond between C1 and C2. But that's already part of the ring's conjugated system. So, elimination in this case would require breaking the aromaticity, which is unlikely. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a double bond but instead leads to substitution. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination but instead leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbanion. But I'm not sure about the stability of that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility of forming a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbanion. But that's not a common reaction, and I'm not sure about the products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but as I thought earlier, the Br is an electron-withdrawing group, which makes the ring less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution. So, that's unlikely.

Wait, given all this confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to think that the reaction produces only one product. So, the answer is B) 1. But I'm not entirely confident.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNHâ in condensed ammonia solvent. The structure of the starting material is interpreted as 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, where the bromine is at position 1, and methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4. NaNHâ is a strong base, often used for deprotonation and elimination reactions.

In this case, the base can abstract a hydrogen from the methyl groups at positions 2 or 4. However, due to the symmetry of the molecule, abstracting a hydrogen from either position leads to the same product. Elimination of HBr occurs, forming a double bond between the carbon where the bromine was and the adjacent carbon. This results in the formation of 1-vinyl-4-methylbenzene (or equivalently 1-vinyl-2-methylbenzene, depending on the perspective), as the methyl group at the other position remains unchanged.

Although there are two methyl groups, the molecule's symmetry ensures that only one unique product is formed. Therefore, the reaction yields a single organic product.

Answer: B
