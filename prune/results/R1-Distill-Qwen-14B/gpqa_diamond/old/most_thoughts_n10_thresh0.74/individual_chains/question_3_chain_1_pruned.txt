Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about expectation values. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. So the question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx.

Wait, σz and σx are the Pauli matrices, right? So σz is the Pauli z-matrix and σx is the Pauli x-matrix. The expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems.

So for a quantum state |ψ⟩, the expectation value of an operator O is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. Right. So first, I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩. But maybe I can break this down into the parts. The expectation value is linear, so I can compute each part separately and add them.

So the operator is 10σz +5σx. Therefore, the expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Wait, I remember that for spin-½ particles, the expectation value of σz is the same as the expectation value of the spin in the z-direction. Similarly for σx.

But since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation values for σz should be straightforward. For σx, I think it's a bit more involved because the state isn't an eigenstate of σx.

Let me write down the state again. The state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Let me check if that's a normalized state. The sum of the squares of the amplitudes should be 1.

So square of 0.5 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which is 0.75. Adding them gives 1, so yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, for σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates, the expectation value of σz is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues for σz are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively. So the probability of |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and the probability for |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the σx part. Hmm. σx is a bit trickier because it doesn't share the same eigenbasis as σz. So I need to compute the expectation value of σx in this state.

The Pauli x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me write the state as a vector. |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1), so ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is the column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Now, σx is the matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

So when I compute σx |ψ⟩, I get [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then ψ† σx ψ is the inner product of ψ and (σx ψ).

So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. So the inner product is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5).

Calculating each term: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is sqrt(3)/4, and the second term is the same. So sum is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = [0.5 * sqrt(3)/2] * 2 = 0.5*sqrt(3).

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute each term:

First term: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4.

Second term: (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = (sqrt(3))/4.

Adding them gives (sqrt(3))/4 + (sqrt(3))/4 = (sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5*0.8660 ≈ 4.3301.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about another approach. Because sometimes when dealing with expectation values, I might have a formula or identity I can use.

For a spin-½ particle, the expectation value of σx in state ψ is 2 times the
