Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²(θ). Hmm, okay, I remember that potentials in two dimensions often allow us to separate the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts, which can simplify the problem.

Wait, so the potential has two terms: one that's just a function of r, and another that depends on r squared times cos squared theta. The first term, (1/2)k r², looks familiar—it's like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. Because in the radial part of a 2D harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2) m ω² r², but here it's just (1/2)k r². Maybe that part is similar to a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator.

The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. That seems a bit trickier. Cos squared theta suggests that the potential varies with the angle θ. I think this might be an anisotropic term or maybe part of a potential that depends on direction. But wait, in polar coordinates, the potential can sometimes be expressed in terms of angular variables, and if it's separable, that would help.

So, perhaps the total potential can be rewritten in a way that allows us to separate the variables r and θ. Let me see: V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let's factor out (1/2)k r²: that gives (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, because 1 + 3 cos²θ is 1 + 3*(cosθ)^2. Hmm, maybe that can be expressed in terms of something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the potential as a sum of terms that can be treated separately.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential can be rewritten as a combination of a radial term and a term involving the angular
