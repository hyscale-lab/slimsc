Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. So, there's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, right? They've built a super fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years. They want to get to Earth, so they're sending this astronaut who's 22 years old. The question is, from the astronaut's point of view, how long will the trip take?

Hmm. Wait, the options are about the astronaut's lifetime. So, I think this has to do with time dilation in special relativity. Because when you're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, time slows down relative to a stationary observer. But wait, what's the scenario here? The spacecraft is moving at a high speed towards Earth, so from Earth's frame, the time taken would be different from the astronaut's own frame.

Wait, the problem says, the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. That's extremely close to the speed of light. I remember that at speeds approaching c, time dilation effects become significant. So, I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut, which is the time measured in their own rest frame.

But wait, wait. How far away is the Large Magellanic Cloud from Earth? I think the distance is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. Let me think. Oh, right,
