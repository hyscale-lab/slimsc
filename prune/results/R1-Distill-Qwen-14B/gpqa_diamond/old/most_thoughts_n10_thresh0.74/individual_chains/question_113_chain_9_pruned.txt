Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let me start by breaking down each of the given data points.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak, right? And alcohols have a less broad but still significant peak. Another peak at 1700 cm-1 could be a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or aldehyde. Oh wait, but 1700 is more like a ketone or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. There's also a peak at 1650 cm-1. Hmm, that's around where conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents might absorb. Or could it be an amide? No, because the options don't have N. Maybe an ester or a conjugated ketone. Or perhaps an aromatic C=C stretching, but those are usually a bit lower in wavenumber, like around 1600. Wait, but 1650 could be an aromatic ring with substituents or maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, like an enone. Because conjugated double bonds have higher wavenumbers. So maybe there's a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond, like in something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's on a double bond, like in an alkene. So that suggests the compound has a double bond. Also, considering the FTIR, if there's a carbonyl group, maybe it's an ester or a ketone with a double bond nearby, so like an alpha,beta-uns
