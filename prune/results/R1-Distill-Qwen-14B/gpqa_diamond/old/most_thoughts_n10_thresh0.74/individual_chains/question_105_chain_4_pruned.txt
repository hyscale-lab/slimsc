Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the scenario is about a star similar to the Sun. The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that could be mistaken for an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The question is about finding the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as these spots do.

Hmm. So, the key here is to compare the change in brightness caused by the star's spots to that caused by a planet transiting the star. I remember that when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star.

But wait, the spots are a bit different. They're not blocking light; they're cooler regions, so they emit less light. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the star's overall brightness should decrease because a significant part of its surface is emitting less. But when it's not facing us, that hemisphere is on the other side, and the brightness should go back to normal.

So first, I think I need to calculate the change in brightness caused by the spots. Then, figure out what planet size would cause the same change in brightness.

Let me think about the star's brightness. The total luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. Since the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, R is R_sun. But when part of the star has cooler spots, the total emitted light changes.

The filling factor (f) is 20%, which means 20% of the hemisphere is covered in spots. Wait, but the star is a sphere, so the surface area is 4πR². But since only one hemisphere is spotted, the area of each hemisphere is 2πR². So, the area covered by spots is f * 2πR². The spots' temperature is Teff - 1000K, so 5000K.

Wait, no. The problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So Teff of spots is 5000K.

So the total luminosity from the star when the spotted hemisphere is facing us (which is the case when the maximum effect occurs) would be the normal luminosity minus the contribution from the spots plus the contribution from the cooler areas.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the change in brightness. So, the normal luminosity (L0) is 4πR²σ(6000)^4.

When the spots are visible, the luminosity (L_spots) is the normal L minus the area of the spots times the higher temperature (since spots are cooler, their contribution is less). Wait, no: the
