Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. The problem gives me the initial volumes and concentrations, and I need to find the pH at two points: 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

Alright, let's start by listing out the given data. I've got 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, I'm diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³, or 0.04 liters.

First, I think I need to find the new concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you dilute a solution, the amount of moles stays the same, right? So the initial moles of acetic acid would be the volume (in liters) multiplied by the concentration. That's 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles, so the new concentration is moles/volume. 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, I'm titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let me tackle the equivalence point first because that might be simpler. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid originally.

So the moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol (from before). Since NaOH is a strong base, it'll react with the acid in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, at equivalence, the NaOH will have neutralized all the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. Now, the solution will consist of the sodium acetate dissolved in the total volume.

What's the total volume at equivalence? The initial diluted acid is 40 cm³, and we're adding 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). The moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) is 0.001 mol, as all the acetic acid is converted.

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid), the solution will be basic. To find the pH, I need to calculate the hydrolysis of acetate ions. The reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Using the Kb expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x² / 0.02.

But wait, since Kb is very small (5.4e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate x² ≈ Kb * 0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M. That's [OH^-].

pOH = -log(3.29e-6) → log(3.29)=0.516, so pOH ≈5.484. So pH =14 -5.484 =8.516. Which is approximately 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A has 8.52 as the second value, and option D has 6.92, which is lower. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate the Kb.

Ka is 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So Kb = 5.405e-10 = x² / 0.02 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x=~3.29e-6. So [OH-] is ~3.29e-6 → pOH=5.484, pH=8.516. So about 8.52 for equivalence point.

So looking at the options, option A has 8.52 as the second value. So the equivalence pH is 8.52, which is option A. But let's wait, I'll check the 25% titration next.

At 25% titration, 25% of the total NaOH needed has been added. The total NaOH needed is 0.001 mol, so 25% is 0.00025 mol.

So, we have added 0.00025 mol of NaOH to the 0.001 mol of acetic acid. The reaction is 1:1, so the moles of acetic acid left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate ion formed would be 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus the NaOH volume added. Let's find the volume of NaOH added. Since concentration is 0.1 M, volume = moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L → 2.5 cm³. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So, the concentration of acetic acid is 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L. Let me calculate that:

0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. Approximately 0.01765 M.

Concentration of acetate is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, this is a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

1.85e-5 → log(1.85)=0.267, so pKa =4.733.

Wait, wait, 1.85e-5 → log(1.85) is about 0.267. So pKa = 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈0.3333.

log(0.3333)= -0.477.

So pH =4.733 -0.477=4.256. Approximately 4.26.

So at 25% titration, pH is about 4.26, and at equivalence, 8.52. That matches option A.


To solve the problem, we start by determining the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are calculated as:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.02 \, \text{L} \times 0.05 \, \text{M} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{New concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At the Equivalence Point:
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH, forming acetate ions. The moles of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point are equal to the moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The volume of NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At the equivalence point, the total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetate} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH at the equivalence point is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions, which is governed by the \( K_b \) value. Using \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} \):

\[
K_b = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

The hydrolysis reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

Using the expression for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{[\text{OH}^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \implies [\text{OH}^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-].
\]

Substituting \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \):

\[
[\text{OH}^-]^2 = (5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.08 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{[\text{OH}^-]} = -\log{(3.29 \times 10^{-6})} \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### At 25% Titration:
At 25% titration, 25% of the total moles of NaOH required have been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.25 \cdot 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ions} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + \text{Volume of NaOH added}.
\]

The volume of NaOH added is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH added}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.00025}{0.1} = 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate ions}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log{\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right)},
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log{(1.85 \times 10^{-5})} \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log{\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right)}.
\]

\[
\frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \approx 0.333, \quad \log{(0.333)} \approx -0.477.
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

### Final Answer:
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately **4.26**, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately **8.52**. These values correspond to **Option A**.
