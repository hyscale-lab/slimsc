Okay, I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, the question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. l is the total angular momentum quantum number, and m is its z-component.

The problem asks: If we measure the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z, what's the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ?

The options are A) 2/3, B) 1, C) 1/2, D) 0.

Hmm, okay. So, each electron is in a p orbital, which means each has l=1. Then, the total angular momentum is l=2 because when you couple two l=1 states, the possible total l values are 0, 1, 2. But in this case, it's 2. So the state is |1,1,2,-1>.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ. Each Lz eigenvalue for an electron in a p orbital would be mħ, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So, for each electron, L1z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ, same for L2z. But in the state provided, we are in a coupled state where the total L is 2 and m is -1.

Wait, what's the relation between the individual m's and the total m? The total m is m1 + m2 = M. So in the state, m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

But wait, the question is about measuring L1z and L2z. That is, their individual m values multiplied by ħ. So, if both are measured as -ħ, then m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. So, their sum would be -2, which is the total m for that case.

But in our state, the total m is -1. So the sum m1 + m2 = -1. But if
