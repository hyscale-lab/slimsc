Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, they tagged the inner capsid proteins with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability.

Wait, what's happening here. I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're clusters of lymphoid cells in the small intestine, right? They play a role in mucosal immunity. So when the GFP-tagged proteins from rotavirus reach the Peyer's patches, the immune cells there probably take them up.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes... that rings a bell. Variable regions of antibodies are crucial for recognizing specific antigens. So where does this variability come from? I think I remember something about B cells undergoing processes that diversify their antibodies.

Let's look at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This occurs in B cells after they have been activated, especially during the germinal center reactions. It introduces random mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptors, increasing diversity and affinity for antigens.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the immune response, where complement proteins tag pathogens for destruction or mark them for phagocytosis. Not directly related to variability in genes.

C) Class switching recombination: This is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG). It doesn't create new variable regions but changes the class, so it's about the constant region.

D) VDJ recombination: This is a process that happens during the development of B cells and T cells in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively. It uses variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments to create the diverse antigen receptors. But wait, isn't that during the initial development, not after an immune response?

So in this question, the GFP is taken up by the Peyer's patches. The cells there are likely B cells, maybe, that are getting activated by the rotavirus antigen. So the high variability in the variable regions suggests that each B cell is expressing a slightly different receptor. This would happen after the B cells are activated, during the germinal center phase, where somatic hypermutation occurs. So the process would be somatic hypermutation.

The other options: complement activation doesn't change the genes. Class switching is about changing the class of antibody, not the variable regions. VDJ recombination is more about the initial formation of the BCR, not the ongoing diversification after antigen encounter.

So the correct answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence from these proteins is observed in the Peyer's patches, which are specialized structures in the small intestine involved in mucosal immunity. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cell population isolated from these patches suggests a process that diversifies the antigen receptors expressed by immune cells.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in B cells during the germinal center reaction, introducing random mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptors to increase diversity and affinity for antigens. This matches the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the immune response but does not directly relate to the variability in gene sequences.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody produced by B cells (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not affect the variable regions of the heavy chain.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This process generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors during development in the bone marrow. However, it does not account for the ongoing diversification observed after antigen encounter.

The observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs after antigen activation and is responsible for further diversification of B cell receptors.

Answer: A
