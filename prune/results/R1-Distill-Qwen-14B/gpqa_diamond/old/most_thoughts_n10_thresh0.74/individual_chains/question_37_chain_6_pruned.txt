Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many 13C-NMR signals compound E has. Let's break down the reactions step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the starting material is propionaldehyde. I remember that propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. So, when propionaldehyde reacts with EDT (which I think is ethyl diethyl tin, a catalyst) and BF3, it's probably an aldol addition or some kind of condensation. Wait, no, wait—EDT is used in the Wittig reaction. Oh yeah, the Wittig reagent is usually made from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide, but here the conditions are with BF3 and EDT. Oh, right, BF3 is a Lewis acid that helps in generating the ylide. So the first step is forming a Wittig reagent.

So, propionaldehyde reacting with a Wittig reagent (from EDT and BF3) would form an alkene. So compound A is an alkene. The structure of propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The Wittig would add across the carbonyl, replacing the O with CH2. Wait, no—the general reaction is R2C=O plus the ylide gives R2C=CHPh3P=O or something. Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. Propionaldehyde has a carbonyl group. The Wittig reagent would attack the carbonyl, forming a double bond. So the product A would be CH2=CHCH2CH3? Wait, wait, no. Wait, propionaldehyde is propanal, so CH3CH2CHO. The Wittig would replace the O with a CH2 group, so the product would be CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, the propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The Wittig reagent (from EDT and BF3) would probably be a trialkyltin ylide. So when the carbonyl attacks, the oxygen becomes an oxide, and the R group from the ylide adds to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but the ylide's structure depends on what the starting reagent is. Since it's EDT, which is triethyltin, the ylide would be CH2CH2CH2 (but wait, that's for maybe a different starting material). Wait, maybe I'm confusing the reagents. The starting material is propionaldehyde
