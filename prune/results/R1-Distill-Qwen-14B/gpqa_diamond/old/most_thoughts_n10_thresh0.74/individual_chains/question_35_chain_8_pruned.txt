Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to spin matrices. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). I think I remember that the Pauli matrices have a specific form, and S here might be similar.

Wait, right! The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall their forms. Oh yes, σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix, σy. So Ay is c times σy.

Since σy is a Hermitian matrix, right? Because all Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So multiplying by a real constant, Ay should also be Hermitian. That means the eigenvalues of Ay should be real. Because for Hermitian operators, eigenvalues are real.

Wait the question says that. But the options suggest some have imaginary parts. Hmm, so perhaps some of the options are incorrect because eigenvalues of Ay should be real.

Wait, but wait. The operator Ay is c * σy. Let me write down σy:

σy = [[0, -i],
       [i, 0]]

So Ay = c * σy = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, so we're looking for a and φ such that this holds.

Wait, but σy has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the spin matrices S are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices, right? Because the spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ . So for σy, the eigenvalues are ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, but in our case, Ay is c multiplied by S, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me parse the problem again.

Oh, the question says Ay = c · S, and S is the 2x
