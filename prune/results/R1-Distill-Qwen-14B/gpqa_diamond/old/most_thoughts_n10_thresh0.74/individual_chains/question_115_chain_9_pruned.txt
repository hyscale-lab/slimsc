Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electrons, positrons, and photons. Hmm, let's read the question carefully.

So, the setup is this: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy and their directions are measured—one goes upper-right, the other lower-right. I'm supposed to find the angle between these two photons.

Wait, what do I know about electron-positron annihilation? Oh right, when an electron and positron annihilate, they produce gamma-ray photons. Since they have opposite charges, they would annihilate and produce at least two photons to conserve momentum, because the total momentum before must equal the total after.

So, first, I should figure out the initial momentum of the electron and positron. Because they're moving along the same line, the total momentum is just the sum of their individual momenta, considering direction.

The Lorentz factor (gamma) is given for each. The Lorentz factor is gamma = total energy divided by rest mass energy. For the electron and positron, their rest mass is the same, about 0.511 MeV. But since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta will be opposite in sign.

Wait, but wait: electrons and positrons have the same rest mass, but opposite charges. However, for momentum, direction matters. So let's model this.

Let’s denote the direction along the horizontal axis as the x-axis. The electron is moving from left to right, so its velocity is positive. The positron is moving from right to left, so its velocity is negative, or maybe the opposite? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving from left to right (positive x), the positron is moving from right to left, which would be negative x direction.

But wait, perhaps that's a confusion. Let me re-read: the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal, so positive x direction. The positron is moving from the right along the horizontal axis, so it's moving in the negative x direction.

So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Now, each has a Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor gamma is equal to E/(m c²), where E is the total energy. The momentum p is gamma m v, where v is the velocity.

Wait, but another way to write p is gamma m v. Alternatively, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and for high speeds, but perhaps it's easier to just compute the momentum in terms of gamma.

Wait, here's another approach. The momentum of each particle can be calculated using p = gamma * m * v, but I can also relate this to the total energy. Since E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², so p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c. But perhaps for this problem, using the fact that the momentum depends on gamma and the velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of relativistic momentum. The relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v. But I don't know the velocities directly, only the
