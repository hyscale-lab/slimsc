Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. 

The given data is: total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1 to β4 are 9, 40, 63, and 16. Wait, wait, stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands bound, right? Oh wait, no, sometimes they don't. Because each β is for a complex with n ligands. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 is Co(SCN)2, and so on up to β4, which is Co(SCN)4.

Wait, no, actually, the stability constant (β) for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal and the ligands. So, β_n would be for the complex with n ligands. So the formation steps would be:

Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ CoSCN^+ ; β1 = 9

CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)₂^2+ ; β2 = 40 / 9? Because β2 is the constant for the second step, so the overall β for the second complex would be β_total = β1 * β2. Wait, no. Wait, I think the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands is the product of all the individual β's up to n. So, for Co(SCN)_n^(2-n), the β would be β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the stability constant for each step is given. So the overall β for Co(SCN)_1 is β1, for Co(SCN)_2, it's β1*β2, etc. Because each step adds another SCN-.

So the formation goes:

Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ CoSCN^+ ; K1 = β1 =9

CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)₂^2+ ; K2= β2=40

So the overall K for Co(SCN)₂^2+ is β1*β2=9*4
