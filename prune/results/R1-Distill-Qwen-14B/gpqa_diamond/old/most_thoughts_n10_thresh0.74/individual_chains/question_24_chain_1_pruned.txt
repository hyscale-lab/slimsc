Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

The problem is about mixtures X and Y and a substance Z. There are a few reactions happening here. Let me jot down the key points.

Mixture X is equimolar and consists of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So, bromine water decolorization usually means the presence of double bonds, like alkenes or maybe some other unsaturated compounds. So, the two liquids in X must have double bonds.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, a disproportionation reaction occurs, forming mixture Y. Y is also equimolar but made of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. Wait, but if they don't decolorize bromine, that suggests they don't have double bonds anymore. So maybe the reaction in X's case breaks the double bonds.

So, X's components might be getting hydrogenated, but wait, the problem says it's a disproportionation, so that's a reaction where one species is both oxidized and reduced. Hmm. Wait, but if X's components are alkenes, and they're treated with platinum (a catalyst), maybe hydrogenation is occurring. But since Y doesn't decolorize bromine, that would make sense â€“ the alkenes would be converted to alkanes, which don't have double bonds, so they wouldn't decolorize bromine water.

Wait, but the question says that X is treated with platinum when heated. Oh, but wait, hydrogenation typically uses H2 and a catalyst like Pt. So maybe X is being hydrogenated, but the mixture Y is formed. But wait, the problem says it's a disproportionation. Hmm, maybe the components in X are not just alkenes but something else that can undergo disproportionation.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. Disproportionation reactions involve a single species being both oxidized and reduced. So, if the starting material is something like an alkene, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alkenes on hydrogenation become alkanes, which is a simple addition reaction, not a disproportionation. So maybe the starting materials are different.

Oh wait, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes or something that can undergo some
