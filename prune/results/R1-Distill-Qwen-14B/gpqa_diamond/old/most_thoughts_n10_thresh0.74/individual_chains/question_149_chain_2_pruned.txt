Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR has an issue: two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar chemical shifts, integrals add up to 1H, and they're not due to spin-spin coupling. Then the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, which matches the expected molecule. So what's going on here?

First, the NMR part. Duplicate peaks for the same proton usually points to something like splitting from coupling or maybe a diastereomer. But the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that. So why else would there be two peaks?

Another thought: if the molecule has some sort of symmetry or maybe there's a diastereomer. Wait, diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would split into separate signals. But in this case, the alpha-proton's signals are similar, same integral. So maybe it's not diastereomers but something else.

Looking at the options. Option B is enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties except for optical activity. So in NMR, they'd look the same because the environments are mirror images. So they wouldn't split into two peaks. Therefore, Option B is probably not the answer.

Option D is diastereomers. Diastereomers have different NMR shifts, so each would have their own set of peaks. But wait, the question says the two peaks for the same proton are similar. If they're diastereomers, the shifts would be a bit different. But if the molecule has some sort of diastereomerism, like epimers, maybe the alpha protons are in environments that cause them to split. Or perhaps it's a diastereomer with two different environments but the same integral.

Alternatively, maybe it's a question of the compound being a mixture of something else. The LC-MS part: two peaks with same mass but same intensity. So same molecular weight, same retention time? Wait, no, same mass but same retention time? Or same mass but different retention times? The question says the LC-MS shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities, same mass.

Wait, LC-MS usually separates based on retention time (LC part), and the MS part gives the mass. So if the mass is same, but there are two peaks, maybe it's a diastereomer. Because diastereomers have same molecular weight but different physical properties. So the LC would separate them into two peaks. And the MS would show same mass. So that could fit.

But wait, the question says the same mass spectrum. So same mass. So the molecule is either a diastereomer or maybe a tautomer, but I don't think that's likely here.

Alternatively, could it be something else like a byproduct or a different isomer?

So considering the NMR. If it's a diastereomer, the alpha protons would split into different signals. But in this case, the two peaks are for the same proton but have similar shifts. Hmm, maybe they're in diastereomeric forms that have very similar environments for that alpha proton, causing similar shifts. But that seems unlikely because diastereomers usually have different shifts.

Wait, another thought: What if the compound is a racemic mixture? Then the NMR would show a single peak because enantiomers are superimposable. So Option B (enantiomers) wouldn't explain the NMR peaks. So that's out.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different. Since the LC-MS shows same mass, probably not. So option A is less likely.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide
