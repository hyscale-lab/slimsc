Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the transgenic mouse model isn't overexpressing the GADD45G protein as expected. Let's go through the problem step by step.

The researcher created a construct where the GADD45G coding sequence has an influenza hemagglutinin tag added at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed. The problem must be in the construct's design.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, which is the plus strand, I need to check for any issues that would prevent proper translation. Let's think about possible issues:

Option A: Missense mutation in the HA tag. If the HA tag has a mutation, the protein might not be recognized for purification, but the question says the issue is with overexpression, not purification. So maybe not, but I'll keep it in mind.

Option B: Ribosome termination early. If there's a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) in the coding sequence, the ribosome would terminate translation early. Let me scan the DNA sequence for any in-frame stop codons.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. If there's no linker between the HA tag and GADD45G, maybe proteases are cutting it. But the issue is that the protein isn't expressed at all, not that it's processed incorrectly. So maybe this isn't the main problem here.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, wait. Wait, in mRNA, the stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. But wait, the DNA sequence is coding, so the mRNA would be the same as the DNA, except T becomes U. So I need to look for sequences that would code for stop codons.

Wait, but look at the end of the DNA sequence: ...TGGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the last part of the sequence ends with TGA. Let me check the last few codons.

Looking at the sequence, the last part is ...TGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Breaking that into codons (DNA is read as triplet, so let me see):

Looking at the end: ...GAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for the stop codons in the DNA. The mRNA is synthesized from the template strand, which is complementary to the plus strand. So the plus strand DNA is the same as the mRNA, except T instead of U.

So in the DNA sequence, the mRNA would be the same except Ts become Us. So looking for UAA, UAG, U
