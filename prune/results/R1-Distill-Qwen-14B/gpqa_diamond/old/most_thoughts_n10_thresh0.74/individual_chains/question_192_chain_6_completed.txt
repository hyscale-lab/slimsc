Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

The setup is a bit involved. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. So, the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somehow inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. But also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Oh, right, I remember that when you have a charge inside a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange. But wait, initially, the conductor is uncharged. So when we add a charge inside the cavity, the conductor must respond.

Wait, the conductor was initially neutral, so when we introduce a charge q inside the cavity, the conductor will have induced charges. Since the cavity is not touching the conductor's outer surface directly (because it's a separate cavity), the charge q will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, how does that work again? I think the charge q inside the cavity will cause the inner surface of the conductor to have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor's material is a conductor, so the charges move freely. The electrons in the conductor will be attracted to the positive charge, leaving the inner surface with a negative charge. But since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q, because the total charge must be zero (original conductor was uncharged, and we added +q. So inner surface is -q, outer surface is +q.)

Wait, let me make sure. The conductor is neutral, so initially, no net charge. Then, we place +q in the cavity. The conductor's free electrons would move towards the +q, leaving the inner surface with a negative charge. So the inner surface must have -q to cancel the +q inside, so that the electric field inside the conductor (the material) is zero. Then, since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner surface has -q, the conductor's total charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0, but wait, the conductor was neutral, so the outer surface must have +q because the cavity is inside. Hmm, not sure if I'm getting this right.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about Gauss's Law. The electric field inside a conductor (the material) is zero. So the charge inside any Gaussian surface within the conductor must be zero. So if the cavity has a charge +q, then the inner surface of the conductor must have a charge -q, because the Gaussian surface just inside the conductor's material would enclose the cavity charge as well as any induced charges on the inner surface. So to have no net charge inside the Gaussian surface (so E=0), the inner surface must have -q.

Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge +q, because the inner surface has -q, so the conductor's total is (-q) + (q_outer) = 0. So q_outer must be +q.

Wait, but wait. The conductor's total charge is zero, because its initial state is neutral. So when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have -q and the outer surface must have +q, so that overall, the conductor's charge is zero. Because the conductor's charge is (charge on inner surface) + (charge on outer surface) + (charge of the cavity) = (-q) + (+q) + (+q)? No, wait, the cavity's charge is +q, which is inside the conductor. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the conductor is neutral. When we add a charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor's free charges must adjust. The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) must have a charge -q, so that the electric field from the +q inside the cavity and the -q on the inner surface cancels inside the conductor. Now, the conductor's total charge is (inner surface: -q) + (conductor's own material: which is neutral? Or wait, the conductor's material can't have charge except on surfaces. So the conductor's own material is neutral, but the charges on the surfaces are induced.

Wait, the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surfaces. The initial conductor is neutral, so when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q, and then the outer surface must have +q to maintain the conductor's neutrality. Because the conductor's own material is neutral, the sum of the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces must be zero. Wait, the conductor was initially neutral, so placing +q inside the cavity would cause the inner surface to have -q, and the outer surface to have +q. Because then, the conductor's own charge is (inner: -q) + (outer: +q) → 0. But that would mean the net charge on the conductor is zero, which is correct because it was initially uncharged. But then, the +q is inside the cavity, so the conductor's outer surface has +q. So from the outside, it looks like the conductor has a charge of +q.

Okay, that makes sense. So when we look at the conductor, the outer surface has a charge of +q.

Now, the question is about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Since the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, the field outside the conductor should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center, right? Because for a spherical conductor, the electric field outside is the same as a point charge at the center.

Wait, but the problem says the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, the angle between l and s is theta, where s is the distance between the cavity's center and the conductor's center.

Hmm. So the point P is outside the conductor, so the distance from P to the conductor's center is L, which is greater than R. So the conductor's radius is R, and L > R → P is outside.

In a conductor, the electric field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface. So the field at P should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed) / (L²), where Q_enclosed is +q. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). So that would be option B.

Wait, but wait. Is there any other effect because the charge is inside the cavity, not at the center? Because the cavity is not at the center, but displaced by s. So the point P is at distance L from the conductor's center, but the cavity is at s distance from the conductor's center.

Wait, but when the charge is inside the cavity, the conductor's outer surface is +q, which is a spherical shell. So the electric field outside the conductor should depend only on the total charge on the outer shell. The position of the inner charge inside the cavity shouldn't affect the outer field because the outer surface's charge distribution depends only on the total charge.

Wait, but the charge inside the cavity is +q, so the inner surface of the conductor must be -q. The outer surface is +q. So the conductor's outer surface is uniformly distributed because it's a conductor, making the field outside the same as a point charge at the center.

So regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity (as long as it's inside), the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because the conductor is a sphere. So the electric field outside would be the same as if the charge were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is at a position that's not aligned with the center of the conductor and the cavity. The problem mentions the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the angle theta between l and s.

Wait, but if the conductor's outer surface is uniformly charged, then the field outside is radial and depends only on the distance from the center, regardless of where the charge inside is located.

Wait a second, no. Because the charge inside the cavity is not at the center, maybe the induced charges on the inner surface aren't uniform. Wait, but the inner surface of the conductor is a sphere. So if the charge inside the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charges would be induced in such a way as to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the inner surface's charges would arrange to create an opposite field to the +q charge. But since the inner surface is a sphere, the field due to the inner surface's charge would be as if all the charge were at the center of the inner surface. Because for a spherical shell, the field outside is as if the charge is at the center.

Wait, but the inner surface is a sphere, so the induced charge would be a uniform shell. So the field inside the conductor due to the inner surface is zero. Because for a spherical shell, the field inside is zero. So the field inside the conductor due to the inner surface is zero, and the field due to the charge inside the cavity is zero inside the conductor. So the conductor's material is shielded.

But the outer surface has a charge +q. So as a result, the electric field outside the conductor is as if there's a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Therefore, regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge of the outer surface, which is +q, and the position of P relative to the center of the conductor.

So the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / (L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Looking back at the options:

Option B) E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Wait, but the problem mentions that the point P's distance from the cavity's center is l, and there's an angle theta. So how does that come into play?

Ah, maybe I was too quick to assume that the conductor's field depends only on L. Because if the charge inside the cavity is not at the center, then the induced charges on the inner surface might not be uniform, which would change how the outer surface charges are arranged.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so any charge displacement inside would cause the inner surface's charge to redistribute to counteract the field. But because the inner surface is a shell, its own field outside is as if the charge were at the center. So the inner surface charge distribution doesn't affect the outer surface's field because it's a shell.

Wait, perhaps not. Because if the inner surface has an induced charge that's not uniform, would that affect the outer surface's charge distribution? Hmm.

Wait, the outer surface's charge is due to the conductor's neutrality and the inner surface's charge. The inner surface has a charge of -q, so the outer surface must have +q. Since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge should be uniformly distributed, regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity.

So regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed. Hence, the electric field outside the conductor, at any point, depends only on the distance from the center of the conductor.

In that case, the answer should be option B.

But wait, the problem gives l and theta. I thought maybe I was missing something, but perhaps those are red herrings. The problem states that point P is outside the conductor, so the distance from P to the conductor's center is L. So the field at P is due to the outer surface's charge, which is +q. So the field is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / (L^2).

So the correct answer is B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) and a charge $+q$ placed inside the cavity. The center of the cavity is displaced by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges on the Conductor**:  
   When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge on its outer surface, regardless of the distribution of charges inside the cavity. For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge located at the center of the conductor. Thus, the electric field at point $P$ is determined by the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.

3. **Relevance of $l$, $s$, and $\theta$**:  
   While the problem provides the distances $l$ and $s$ and the angle $\theta$, these details are not relevant to the electric field at $P$ because the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$. The charge inside the cavity does not affect the field outside the conductor.

4. **Final Expression for the Electric Field**:  
   Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at point $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the electric field outside the conductor.  
- **Option B**: Correct. The electric field at $P$ depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$, as derived above.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the electric field outside the conductor.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the form is similar to the correct expression, it incorrectly uses $l$ instead of $L$.

### Conclusion:
The electric field at point $P$ is determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$. The correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
