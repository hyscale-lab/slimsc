Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. It's represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y, which is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

The task is to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and determine which statement among the options is correct.

Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues are related to the angular momentum quantum numbers. But since this is a 2x2 matrix, we're probably dealing with spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons. So the possible eigenvalues would be ± ħ/2, but wait, here the operator is A_y, which is the Y-component of the angular momentum. Also, the matrix S given might be the Pauli matrices or something similar.

Wait, the matrix S given is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. That looks familiar. Let me think—Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Oh, wait, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is σ_y. So A_y = c * σ_y.

The constant c is h/(4π), right? So A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

But wait, the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, because for Pauli matrices, each has eigenvalues ±1. So the eigenvalues of A_y would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by ±1. So a = ± h/(4π). 

Wait, but wait a second. Quantum mechanically, the angular momentum operators are usually defined with ħ instead of h. Because ħ = h/(2π). So perhaps I'm mixing up the units here.

Wait, let's clarify. The operator S in the problem is given as a 2x2 matrix. So A_y = c * S, where c = h/(4π). So substituting, A_y = [h/(4π)] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
