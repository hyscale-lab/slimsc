Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. So, the question is about observations of a quasar in the near infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at around 790 nm, and the flux drops below that. I remember that the peak wavelength of emission can be related to the redshift of the object because of the expansion of the universe.

Wait, what's the context here? Oh right, the quasar's light is being observed, and its emission lines are shifted due to the universe's expansion. So, the peak wavelength here is longer than what we'd expect from the quasar's rest frame. Oh, right, this is about redshift. The peak at 790 nm must correspond to a certain emission line in the quasar's rest frame, which is now observed to be redshifted.

But wait, I'm not sure about the rest wavelength. Oh, wait, the peak is at 790 nm. Let's think—common emission lines from quasars. I think the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm in the rest frame (far UV). But if the observed wavelength is longer, that's a redshift. So if Lyman-alpha is observed at 790 nm, then the redshift z would be (observed wavelength)/(rest wavelength) minus 1. So z = (790 / 121) - 1. Let me calculate that: 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.529. So minus 1 gives z ≈ 5.529. But wait, wait, 790 nm is in the near infrared. So that's a significant redshift.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from another line. Wait, what about the Balmer series? Like H-alpha is about 656 nm in rest. If observed at 790 nm, that would be z=(790/656)-1. 790/656 is around 1.204, so z≈0.204. But that seems lower. Hmm, but the problem says the flux drops below 790 nm, which suggests that 790 is a peak. If the rest wavelength is in optical and observed longer, that's a lower redshift. Hmm, but I think the Lyman-alpha line is more likely because it's a prominent emission line and would be more redshifted.

Wait, but wait, the Lyman-alpha line is in the far UV, which is hard to observe because of the Lyman limit and the intergalactic medium. So maybe quasars at high redshifts show Lyman-alpha absorption, but for emission lines, perhaps the Lyman-beta or other lines would be easier to observe. Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the host galaxy's emission, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is near infrared. Let's think about the rest frame. If the rest frame has a peak at a certain wavelength, and the observed is 790, then the redshift z is (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. But without knowing the rest, I can't compute z directly. Alternatively, perhaps this is a redshifted version of a rest frame near UV or optical line. 

Alternatively, maybe the peak is the Lyman limit. The Lyman limit is at 912 Angstroms, which is about 91.2 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's much longer. So z = (790e-9 m) / (91.2e-10 m) -1. Let me compute that. 790e-9 divided by 91.2e-10 is 790/0.912 ≈ 866.5. So z ≈ 865.5. That's extremely high, which doesn't make sense because quasars at such high redshifts are probably very rare, and the parameters given for the universe (H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7) would imply a certain age and expansion history.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the peak is from a different process, like the quasar's accretion disk or something. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from the host galaxy's emission, but that doesn't directly give redshift. Hmm.

Wait, the question isn't directly about calculating redshift. It's about the comoving distance given the universe's parameters. So maybe I need to get the redshift first, then compute the comoving distance. But how?

Wait, the question says that the peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. So perhaps this is the Lyman limit, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the 21 cm line of hydrogen, but that's at 21 cm (0.21 m), which is much longer than 790 nm. So that can't be it.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is in the near-infrared and corresponds to a certain rest wavelength, say, 790 nm is the observed wavelength. Suppose the rest wavelength is 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), then z = (790/121) -1 ≈ 6.52. But that would imply a very high redshift, and the comoving distance would be quite large. Alternatively, if the rest wavelength is, say, 700 nm (near IR), then z would be (790/700) -1 = 0.128. That's a much lower redshift.

Wait, but without knowing the rest wavelength, I can't compute z. Hmm, but perhaps the question is implying that
