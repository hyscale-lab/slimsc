Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.

First, the question says that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, using in vivo imaging, they saw that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid and some got stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene showed high variability. The question is asking which process is happening.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are sites where immune responses to oral antigens are initiated. So when rotavirus is given via oral gavage, it likely targets these patches.

The GFP here is probably used to track the rotavirus proteins. But some were destroyed by stomach acid. I guess the stomach has a low pH, so maybe the GFP isn't very stable there. But others made it through the mucus to the secondary lymphoid organs, which I think are like the Peyer patches. Then, in those patches, they isolated the cells that are proliferating, perhaps B cells because when an antigen is presented, B cells start dividing.

Now, sequencing the variable heavy chain gene and finding high variability suggests that each cell's antibody is different. I remember that this kind of diversity is generated through a process called somatic hypermutation. Somatic hypermutation occurs in B cells during the immune response, specifically in the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of antibodies. This process introduces point mutations, leading to a diverse set of antibodies. So when they see high variability, it's likely that each B cell has undergone this mutation.

Wait, what are the options again? Option A is somatic hypermutation. Option B is complement activation, which I think is about activating the complement system, maybe leading to lysis of pathogens. But I don't see how that would cause high variability in the variable regions. Option C is class switching recombination, which is about changing the class of antibodies (like from IgM to IgG) but doesn't increase the diversity of the variable regions. Option D, VDJ recombination, I think that's during the initial formation of the B cell receptor in the bone marrow, leading to the initial diversity. But that's during development, not during the immune response, so perhaps that's not the case here.

So the process happening after the initial B cell development and during the immune response would be somatic hypermutation. This would explain the high variability in the heavy chain genes because each B cell is mutating its variable regions to produce a better fit for the antigen, increasing the chances of a successful immune response.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence of these proteins is observed to be partially destroyed by stomach acid and partially entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs, specifically the Peyer patches. In these patches, the proliferating cell population is isolated, and sequencing of the variable heavy chain gene reveals high variability.

Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are key sites for initiating immune responses to oral antigens. The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene suggests a process that generates diversity in antibody sequences. Among the options provided:

- **Option A (somatic hypermutation):** This process occurs in B cells during the immune response, introducing point mutations in the variable regions of antibody genes to increase diversity. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene.
- **Option B (complement activation):** This process involves the complement system targeting pathogens but does not explain the observed variability in antibody sequences.
- **Option C (class switching recombination):** This process changes the class of antibodies (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not increase the diversity of the variable regions.
- **Option D (VDJ recombination):** This process generates initial diversity during B cell development in the bone marrow but does not occur during the immune response.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response to generate diverse antibodies. 

Answer: A
