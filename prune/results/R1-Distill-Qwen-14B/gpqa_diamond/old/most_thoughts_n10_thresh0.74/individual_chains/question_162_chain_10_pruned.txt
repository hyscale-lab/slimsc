Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think through this.

First, let's read the question again. The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I'm supposed to find the area of a pseudosphere (which I think is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry) with radius r=2.

Wait, wait. Pseudosphere... Oh, right, a pseudosphere, also known as a tractricoid, is a surface of constant negative curvature. Its area can be calculated using some formula. But I'm not exactly sure about the formula off the top of my head.

In flat space, the area of a sphere is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, I think the area is different. Oh wait, no, wait. Pseudosphere's area is finite even though it's infinitely long. I remember something like 4πr² divided by something. Or maybe 2πr²?

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the metric given. The metric is for a 2-dimensional space, right? Because it's written in terms of dx² and dy². So the line element ds² is a function of x and y. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². Let me write that down.

The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, so this looks like a conformally flat metric. Conformally flat means it's just a scaling of the Euclidean metric. The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

I think that when the metric is conformally flat, the area element can be found by integrating over the coordinates with the square root of the determinant of the metric. But wait, since it's conformal, the determinant is (g_xx * g_yy - g_xy^2) = (g_{xx}) * (g_{yy}) ), but since it's diagonal and conformal, the determinant is (g_{xx})², because g_xy = 0.

Wait, no. For a metric g_{ij}, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. For a diagonal metric, the determinant is product of g_xx and g_yy, which in this case are both 32/(4
