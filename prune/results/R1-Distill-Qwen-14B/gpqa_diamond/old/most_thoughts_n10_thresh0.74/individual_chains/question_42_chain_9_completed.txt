Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again and break it down.

So, the problem is about three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They've been discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not too sure about the specifics of that method, but maybe it's not important for solving this particular problem.

The question says that the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 have a ratio of approximately 1.4. Then, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. Also, the mass ratios are given: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. The albedo for all three is 0.3, similar to Earth. And the question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

Hmm. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, including the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. The formula I recall is something like T = [ (L / (16πσ d²) ) * (1 - a) ) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, d is the distance, and a is the albedo. Since the albedos are the same for all three planets (0.3), that part will cancel out when taking the ratio.

Wait, but wait, the planets are orbiting the same star, right? So L is the same for all three. So, the equilibrium temperature T should be inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (d) because T is proportional to (L/(d²))^(1/4). So, T is proportional to d^(-1/2). 

Let me think. So, if T1 is Planet1's equilibrium temperature and T2 is Planet2's, then T1/T2 = [ (d2/d1) )^(-1/2) ], since L and (1-a) are same. Wait, no, wait. Because T is proportional to sqrt(L/(16πσ d²)) * (1-a)^(1/4), but since L, a, and σ are same, T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 ). 

But the problem says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1 / T2 = 1.4. 

So, 1.4 = sqrt( d2 / d1 ), so squaring both sides, (1.4)^2 = d2/d1. That's 1.96 ≈ d2/d1. So, d2 ≈ 1.96 * d1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2 / T3 = 2.3. So 2.3 = sqrt( d3 / d2 ). Squaring, 5.29 = d3/d2. So d3 = 5.29 * d2.

But we can substitute d2 from earlier. d3 = 5.29 * (1.96 d1 ) = (5.29 * 1.96) * d1. Let me calculate 5.29 * 1.96. Hmm, 5 times 1.96 is 9.8, and 0.29*1.96 is about 0.5684. So together, around 10.3684. So d3 ≈ 10.37 * d1.

So the distance of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

But wait, the question is about the orbital period. So we need to relate the orbital period to the distance. I remember Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star). The formula is P² ∝ d³ / M, where M is the mass of the star. Wait, actually, the exact formula is P² = (4π²/G(M_star)) * d³. So, if all three planets orbit the same star, then the proportionality simplifies to P² ∝ d³. So P ∝ d^(3/2).

So, the ratio of the periods P3/P1 would be (d3/d1)^(3/2). Because P² is proportional to d³, so taking square roots, P is proportional to d^(3/2).

We have d3 ≈ 10.37 * d1. So P3/P1 = (10.37)^(3/2). Let's compute that.

Wait, but wait a second. Are the masses of the planets relevant here? The problem mentions the mass ratios between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. But in Kepler's third law as I remember it, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass, so the star's mass is what determines the gravitational parameter. So, unless the star's mass is varying, but in this case, all three planets are orbiting the same star, so I think the planet masses don't affect Kepler's law in this context. So, the mass ratios given (Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, etc.) probably aren't needed for this calculation. Hmm, but why are they given then? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: TTV method relies on the gravitational influence of the planets on each other's orbits. So the masses could influence the TTV signals. But in this problem, the question is about the orbital periods, which are primarily determined by the distance from the star and the star's mass. So perhaps the planet masses are a red herring, or perhaps they're not directly needed for this part of the calculation. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the mass ratios don't affect the period calculation, unless I'm missing something.

So back to the period ratio. We have P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(1.5). Let's compute that.

10.37 to the power of 1.5 is the same as sqrt(10.37^3). Let's compute 10.37^3 first.

10.37 *10.37 = approximately 107.5369. Then, 107.5369 * 10.37.

Wait, let me compute 107.5369 * 10 = 1075.369, and 107.5369 * 0.37 ≈ 39.788653. So adding together, 1075.369 + 39.788653 ≈ 1115.1576. So 10.37^3 is about 1115.1576.

Then the square root of that is sqrt(1115.1576). Let's see; 33^2 is 1089, 34^2 is 1156. So sqrt(1115) is between 33 and 34. Let's compute 33.4 squared: 33.4 *33.4 = 1115.56. Oh, that's very close to our value (1115.1576). So sqrt(1115.1576) ≈ 33.4. So (10.37)^(3/2) ≈ 33.4.

So P3 is approximately 33.4 times longer than P1. So the factor is approximately 33.4.

Looking at the options, option D is 33.4, which would be the correct answer.

But wait, let me check if I did everything correctly. Let's go through the steps again.

First, equilibrium temperatures:

We have T1 / T2 = 1.4. Since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d), then d2/d1 = (T1 / T2)^2 = 1.96. So d2 = 1.96 d1.

Then, T2 / T3 = 2.3. So (T2/T3)=2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3. So, T3 = (T1/1.4) / 2.3 = T1/(1.4*2.3) = T1/(3.22). But I'm more interested in the ratio of distances. So, for T2 and T3, T2/T3 = 2.3 = sqrt(d3/d2). Squaring gives d3/d2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. So d3 =5.29 * d2.

Substituting d2 in terms of d1: d3 =5.29 *1.96 d1 = (5.29 * 1.96) d1.

5.29 * 1.96: Let me compute that precisely.

5 *1.96 =9.8, 0.29*1.96≈0.5684. Total: 9.8 +0.5684=10.3684. So d3=10.3684 d1.

So P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

Which is the same as sqrt( (10.3684)^3 ) = sqrt(10.3684 *10.3684 *10.3684).

Alternatively, it's (10.3684)^(1.5).

Let me compute 10.3684^3.

First, 10^3=1000.

Then, 0.3684^3 is about 0.0504, but that's perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, 10.3684 *10.3684 = 107.53, as before. Then 107.53 *10.3684.

Let me compute 107.53 *10 = 1075.3, and 107.53 *0.3684.

0.3*107.53=32.259.

0.06*107.53=6.4518.

0.0084*107.53≈0.904.

Adding those: 32.259 +6.4518=38.7108 +0.904≈39.6148.

So total is 1075.3 +39.6148=1114.9148.

So (10.3684)^3≈1114.9148.

Now, sqrt(1114.9148)= approximately 33.39, since 33^2=1089 and 33.4^2=1115.56 (as calculated before). So 33.39 is about 33.4.

So P3 is about 33.4 times longer than P1. So the factor is ~33.4, which is option D.

Wait, but the options don't have 33.4 as the first choice. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) ~10.4

B) ~3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

Yes, option D is ~33.4. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait for a moment. I think I might have missed something. Because Kepler's third law is based on the mass of the star, but if the planet's mass is significant, does that change anything? Like, in the more general form, the period depends on the sum of the masses (star + planet), but I think that's only when the planet's mass is a significant fraction of the star's. For most exoplanets, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, so the period depends mainly on the star's mass and the distance.

In this problem, the planet masses are given, but their ratio is about 1.15 (Planet1 to Planet2) and 1.35 (Planet2 to Planet3). So Planet3 is 1.35 times the mass of Planet2, which is 1.15 times Planet1. So Planet3 is 1.15 *1.35 = about 1.5525 times the mass of Planet1. So, not that large. But unless the star's mass is given, I don't think the planet masses factor into the period calculation. So I think I was correct to ignore them for this part.

Therefore, the answer should be D, ~33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant astrophysical principles.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature and Distance Relationship
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} \), where \( d \) is the orbital distance from the star. The albedo \( a \) is the same for all three planets, and the star's luminosity \( L \) is constant. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets is given by:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_1}}
\]

From the problem:
- \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \), so:
\[
1.4 = \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_1}} \implies \frac{d_2}{d_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies d_2 = 1.96 \, d_1
\]

- \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \), so:
\[
2.3 = \sqrt{\frac{d_3}{d_2}} \implies \frac{d_3}{d_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies d_3 = 5.29 \, d_2
\]

Substituting \( d_2 = 1.96 \, d_1 \) into \( d_3 = 5.29 \, d_2 \):
\[
d_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 \, d_1 = 10.3684 \, d_1
\]

Thus, the orbital distance of Planet3 is approximately \( 10.37 \, d_1 \).

### Step 2: Orbital Period and Distance Relationship
Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance \( d \). For planets orbiting the same star, the relationship simplifies to:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{d_3}{d_1} = 10.37 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( (10.37)^{3/2} \)
First, calculate \( 10.37^3 \):
\[
10.37^3 = 10.37 \times 10.37 \times 10.37 \approx 1115.16
\]

Then, take the square root:
\[
\sqrt{1115.16} \approx 33.4
\]

Thus, \( \frac{P_3}{P_1} \approx 33.4 \).

### Step 4: Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. This matches option **D**.
