Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement is made. So, the eigenvector here would be a state vector in a two-dimensional space since the matrices provided are 2x2. 

Wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So direction n can be represented as a unit vector (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So, the operator P along this direction would be a combination of the Pauli matrices multiplied by the components of n. 

Wait, right, in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operator L along a direction n is given by L·n = nx Lx + nz Lz, but wait, in this case, the operator P is given for each component. So, maybe I should think of P as a vector operator with components Px, Py, Pz. So, the operator in the direction n would be P = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny is zero, so it's P = nx Px + nz Pz.

But the problem says the direction is arbitrary, but in the x-z plane. So, I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P along n, which is a combination of Px and Pz. Wait, but the question is asking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Wait, but each component of P has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So, when you have the operator P along a direction n, which is a linear combination of Px and Pz, its eigenvalues would also be ±ħ/2, but maybe it's more complicated than that. Or perhaps, since each component has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, the operator along n would have eigenvalues that are a combination of these.

Wait, perhaps it would be better to represent the operator P·n as (nx P_x
