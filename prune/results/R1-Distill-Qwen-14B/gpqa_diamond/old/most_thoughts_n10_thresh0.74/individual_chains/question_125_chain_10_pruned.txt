Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about a particle in a potential. The potential is V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². Oh right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential, right? So it's an isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator. I remember that in 3D, the potential is separable into x, y, and z parts, each behaving like a 1D harmonic oscillator.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Oh wait, wait. Let me think. The energy levels in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total quantum number. Or is it n_x + n_y + n_z? Right, because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. And n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). So the total n is the sum of these three.

Wait, but the total energy levels can also be written in terms of the principal quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (N + 3/2) ħω. So the ground state is N=0, first excited N=1, second excited N=2, third excited N=3. Oh because each time N increases by 1, you go up one energy level.

So the third excited state would be N=3. So the energy is (3 + 3/2) ħω = 9/2 ħω. Looking at the options, option A and C have 9/2 ħω as their energy. Option B and D have something else, which I don't think is correct because I remember that the energy depends on N and ω, not r^2 or pi terms like in the options B and D.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that have the same energy. That's the number of ways to have N=3. Because for each N, the number of states is the number of ways to write N as the sum of three non-negative integers, which is a combinatorics problem. So how many triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) add up to 3.

Wait, the formula for the number of states for a given N is (N + 2 choose 2), or (N + 2)! / (2! N! ), because it's the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N. For N=3, that would be (3 + 2 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 eigenfunctions for N=3.

So putting it together, the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. Looking at the options, option A is (9/2) ħω, 10. That's the one.

Wait, but I should double-check. The third excited state is N=3.
