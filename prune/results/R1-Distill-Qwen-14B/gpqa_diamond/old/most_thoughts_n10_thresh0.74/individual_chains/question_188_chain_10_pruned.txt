Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral, right, that's one of the crystal systems, I think. 

The given data includes the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms, but in crystals, that's often the lattice parameter, a. Oh wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a cube that's been deformed, so all edges are equal but the angles aren't 90 degrees. Oh right, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. 

The question is about the interplanar distance, which I remember is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane indices. The formula, I think, is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else. Wait, for cubic systems, the formula simplifies, but for non-cubic, like rhombohedral, it's more complicated. 

I think the general formula for interplanar distance is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β)
