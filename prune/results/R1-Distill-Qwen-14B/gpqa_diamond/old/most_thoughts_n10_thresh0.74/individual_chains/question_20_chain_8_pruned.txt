Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice physics question here about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the four given assumptions imply the impulse approximation when considered together. The impulse approximation, as I remember, is when we model nucleons in a nucleus as if they're free particles. So, the idea is that each nucleon behaves independently, without much interaction with the others except perhaps for a quick, 'impulsive' interaction.

The options are 1, 2, 3, 4, and the choices are combinations of them. Let me go through each assumption one by one.

Assumption 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. That sounds right because, in an impulse approximation, each nucleon is treated separately. So the interaction doesn't consider collective effectsâ€”each nuke acts on its own. So 1 is probably part of the correct answer.

Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, what does that mean? Transparent? Oh, I think that means that the nucleus doesn't scatter the interaction current except through the selected nucleon. So the other nucleons don't contribute; they're like not there for the interaction. That makes sense because in the impulse model, the nucleus is treated as a bunch of free particles, so the interaction would only see each nucleon individually, and the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect the interaction. So 2 is likely correct.

Assumption 3: The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, non-relativistic quarks. Wait, but in reality, quarks are held to be relativistic? Or maybe the approximation here is about treating the nucleon as a point particle with non-relativistic internal structure. Or perhaps this is about whether the binding forces are considered. I'm a bit confused here. Wait, the impulse approximation doesn't consider the internal structure of nucleons, treating them as point-like. So if their internal quarks are non-relativistic, does that matter? Or maybe this is a red herring. Alternatively, maybe when quarks are non-relativistic, the nucleus behaves more like free particles? I'm not entirely sure. 

Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, right, that makes sense. Because in the impulse approximation, the nucleon is considered free, so any binding forces (like the strong nuclear force holding the nucleus together) are ignored. So the nucleon is treated as if it's free, not bound. So 4 is definitely part of the correct set.

So now, looking back at the options:

The question is which assumptions together imply the impulse approximation.

From what I gather, 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Assumption 3 is about the internal structure of the nucleon, but impulse approximation is more about treating the nucleons as free, not necessarily their internal state. Or wait, maybe 3 is not part of the assumptions. Because the impulse approximation is about the nucleus as a whole, treating each nucleon as free, regardless of their internal quarks' behavior. So 3 might not be required for the approximation.

Wait, the question is about which assumptions jointly imply the impulse approximation. So the impulse approximation is when nucleons behave as free. For that, the interaction is with individual nucleons (1), the nucleus is transparent except that one (2), and the nucleon isn't bound (4). But what about 3? If quarks are non-relativistic, does that affect the approximation? I think the impulse approximation doesn't make any assumptions about the internal structure of the nucleons. It's more about the interaction with the nucleus as a whole. So
