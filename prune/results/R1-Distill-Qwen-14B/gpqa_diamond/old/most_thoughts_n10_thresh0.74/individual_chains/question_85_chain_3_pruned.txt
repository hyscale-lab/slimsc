Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me a lot of information, so I need to parse it carefully.

Alright, the setup is about two planets orbiting a star. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. So, that's the star's info. Then there are two planets: Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect, but since it's the same, I don't have to worry about that in the equilibrium temperature calculation.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. So I need to find T1 over T2, or T2 over T1? Wait, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So T1 divided by T2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula. Right, the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

T = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

But wait, no, I think I might be mixing up the exact formula. Let me think again.

The equilibrium temperature formula accounts for the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. Another version I recall is:

T_planet = T_star * ( ( L_star / (
