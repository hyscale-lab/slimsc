Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone; it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. So the structure is like a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group.

The first reaction is treating cyclohexanone with bromine, which forms product 1. Wait, what happens when a ketone reacts with bromine? Oh right, I think that's the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but wait, no, that's for alpha bromination. Wait, no, another possibility: maybe it's the addition of bromine to the double bond if any? No, cyclohexanone is a ketone, so it's not a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, no, wait, another thought: when a carbonyl group is treated with bromine, perhaps it's a bromination at the alpha position. So cyclohexanone has alpha carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. So the reaction of ketone with bromine (Br2) might be an alpha bromination. But wait, sometimes that requires a catalyst, but maybe in this case, the conditions are such that it adds a bromine.

Wait, another possibility: bromine in a non-polar solvent might add across the double bond if it were present, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh, wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the reaction isn't about adding to a double bond. So probably, it's the alpha bromination. So product 1 would be 2-bromo-cyclohexanone. Wait, but cyclohexanone has two alpha positions, each with two equivalent hydrogens. So adding a bromine there would give a mono-substituted product, but wait, maybe more than that.

Wait, but wait, when you brominate a ketone, the bromine adds to the alpha position. So cyclohexanone has six-membered ring, and the carbonyl is at one position. The alpha carbons are the two adjacent to the carbonyl. So each of those has two equivalent H's because of the ring's symmetry. So adding Br would substitute one of those H's. So product 1 would have a Br on one of the alpha carbons.

But wait, another thought: maybe it's a di-add
