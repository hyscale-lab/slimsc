Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and partial waves. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The options involve different transitions, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't permitted due to conservation laws and Pauli statistics.

Wait, the problem mentions Pauli statistics. Oh right, Pauli's exclusion principle applies here because nucleons are fermions. So their total wavefunction has to be antisymmetric under exchange. That affects the possible quantum numbers.

The given condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). So the isospin T plus the spin S plus the orbital angular momentum L of the NN system must be even or odd based on this condition. Since T is given as 0, let's plug that in.

Wait, T=0. So the equation becomes 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which simplifies to S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity. If S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.

The initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that term symbol. The notation is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 means 2S+1=1 ⇒ S=0. L is given as 0 (since S0 implies L=0, because the letter S is for L=0). So initial S is 0 and L is 0. So the initial NN state has S=0 and L=0.

When the NN emits a particle X, the final state of the NN must have T=0. So the Pauli condition gives 0 = S' + L' +1 mod 2. So S' + L' must be 1 mod 2.

Now, considering the conservation of angular momentum. The initial angular momentum J is for the NN system. The initial state is 1S0, so J is 0 because J = L + S, and both are zero. So the total angular momentum J_initial is 0.

When the NN emits a particle X with angular momentum state l (like s, p, d, f), the total angular momentum has to be conserved. So the total after emission is the NN's J' plus the angular momentum of X, which is l. So J_initial must equal J' + l.

Wait, no. The initial NN has angular momentum J_initial. They then emit a particle, so the total after emission is the NN's J' plus X's angular momentum. So the total angular momentum must be conserved, so J_initial = J' + l?

Wait, no. Because the NN is emitting X, the initial state is the NN with J_initial = 0. After emission, the NN has J' and X has l. So the sum J' + l should equal the initial J_initial, which is zero. So J' = -l
