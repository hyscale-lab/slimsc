Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to go step by step. Let's read the question again.

We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. So, probably a decomposition reaction happening here. The products are a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through several tubes.

Tube 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb moisture, so maybe it absorbs water vapor. The weight of tube 1 increased by 3.60 g. So whatever was absorbed here is water perhaps?

Then, tube 2 has Ca(OH)2 solution. Wait, if the gas passed through this didn't change the weight, that means no reaction. Because if a gas like CO2 or NH3 passed through, it would react. So the gas didn't react with Ca(OH)2, implying it's not a carbonate or something that reacts with hydroxide. So maybe the gas is N2, Ar, or maybe something inert. But wait, the problem later mentions that tube 3, with red-hot copper, increased by 0.80g. Copper is involved, so perhaps the gas is something like CO. Because CO would react with copper oxide, but wait, in this case, the copper is red-hot. Hmm.

Wait, in tube 3, the gas passed through red-hot copper, and the weight increased by 0.80g, forming CuO. So what reacts with copper upon heating? Well, carbon monoxide reacts with copper(II) oxide: CO + CuO → Cu + CO2. But wait, if the copper is red-hot, maybe it's acting as a catalyst? Or wait, perhaps the gas is hydrogen? No, because if it's H2, it might reduce the oxide. Alternatively, CO is a possibility.

So let me think. The gases after decomposition are passed through these tubes. Let's break down each step.

1. Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water. The weight increase is 3.60g. Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent. So any water vapor in the gas would be absorbed here. So if the gas mixture has H2O, this would be captured here. The weight gain is 3.60g, which is the mass of H2O. Because Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs H2O from the air, converting into Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O. So the mass increase is the mass of the water.

So, 3.60g of H2O is captured here. So the total moles of H2O is 3.60g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.

2. Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If no change in weight, that suggests no CO2, because CO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water, increasing the weight. So if there's no reaction, the gas doesn't have CO2. But maybe there's another gas that doesn't react, like N2 or maybe H2
