Okay, so I've got this question about particles and broken symmetry. Hmm, I need to figure out which one isn't associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion.

Wait, let me think. I remember that when a system undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking, it leads to the appearance of new particles called Goldstone bosons. Oh right, Goldstone's theorem says that for each broken continuous symmetry, there's a massless boson. But wait, sometimes these particles get a mass due to other effects, like in the Higgs mechanism.

So, let's go through each option. 

Option D is Pion. Pions are the Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. When the quark condensate forms, it breaks chiral symmetry, and pions emerge as the Goldstone particles. But wait, in the real world, pions aren't massless because of the axial anomaly or maybe because of confinement. Oh right, but originally, they are associated with broken symmetry.

Option A is Phonon. Phonons are related to the quantized sound waves in crystals. They arise from the breaking of translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Wait, but phonons are not directly tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the same way as Goldstone bosons. Because the translational symmetry isn't a continuous symmetry. Oh wait, no, phonons are for broken continuous symmetry? Or is it more of an emergent thing from the lattice structure. Because phonons are due to the periodicity of the crystal, which breaks translational symmetry. But that's a discrete symmetry, not continuous. So maybe
