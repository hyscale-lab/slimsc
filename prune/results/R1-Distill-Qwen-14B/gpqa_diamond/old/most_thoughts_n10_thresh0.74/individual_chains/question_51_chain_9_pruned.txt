Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Wait, potential energy in such systems usually involves the work done to bring charges together. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, that might change things a bit. Grounding a conductor means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can flow away. Oh right, when a charged object is brought near a grounded conductor, charges redistribute on the conductor to maintain the connection to ground.

So, when charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere being conducting means that induced charges will appear on its surface. But because it's grounded, the conductor's potential is zero. So any induced charges would adjust until the potential on the sphere is the same as the ground, which is zero. Wait, but the sphere's own potential would be zero because it's grounded.

Wait, but the charge q is external. So when q is placed near the sphere, it would induce a charge on the sphere. Since the sphere is a conductor, the charges will redistribute such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the induced charge would be opposite in sign to q if I remember correctly.

Wait, no, wait. If the charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere being neutral (I assume it's neutral initially) would have induced charges. Since it's a conductor, the charges will be on the surface. But because the sphere is grounded, any induced charges will have a path to ground. Wait, no. If the sphere was isolated, it would have induced charges +q and -q on the near and far sides. But when it's grounded, the net charge can leave. Hmm, but wait, the sphere's initial charge isn't given. Wait, the problem says it's a grounded conducting sphere, so any induced charges might allow the sphere to maintain a certain charge.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. When a charge is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's inner surface gets an induced charge opposite to q (because the field inside the conductor must be zero), and the outer surface will get a charge equal to the inner surface's, but wait, no. Wait, for a conducting sphere,
