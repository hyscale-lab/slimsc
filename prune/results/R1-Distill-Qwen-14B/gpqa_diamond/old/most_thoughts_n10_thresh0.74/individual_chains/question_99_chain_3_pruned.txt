Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to have a carboxylic acid group and some branching in the chain.

First, looking at the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretches, and they can appear quite broad, so that makes sense. Then there's a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. That area is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids. Since the compound is a carboxylic acid (as I can see from the COOH in all the options), this peak matches with the carbonyl (C=O) stretch of the carboxylic acid.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens. That means there are no double bonds (like in alkenes) in the compound. So all the structures must not have any vinyl protons. Looking at the options, all four are branched alkanes with a COOH group, so that's consistent.

In the NMR, there are several signals. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm. So we're dealing with complex splitting patterns, which suggests that these protons are adjacent to multiple sets of non-equivalent protons.

Let me think about the splitting. For the doublet of triplets of quartets. Wait, no, wait. Splitting nomenclature is a bit tricky. Each new splitting is due to a neighboring set of protons. So a doublet of triplets implies that each proton is next to two different sets: one with two neighbors (giving a triplet) and another with one neighbor (giving a doublet). But wait, no, the splitting is hierarchical. A doublet of triplets would mean each peak in the triplet is split into a doublet. Or wait, perhaps I should think of it as a doublet (from one coupling) and each of those is a triplet (from another coupling), and each of those is a quartet (from a third coupling). No, that might not be the right way. Alternatively, in splitting, each new set of neighboring protons adds another level of splitting. So a doublet of triplets implies that the proton is split by two different groups: one with two neighboring protons (giving a triplet) and another with one neighboring proton (giving a doublet). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In NMR splitting, each coupling is considered sequentially. So for example, if a proton is next to two sets of neighboring protons, each with a different J, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets. But if the neighboring groups have more protons, the splitting increases.

So, let's take the first signal: a doublet of triplets of quartets. Wait, no, the question says a doublet of triplets of quartets, but I might have misread. Let me check. Oh, wait, the first is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets (a doublet splitting into triplets), but I might be mixing up the order.

Wait, perhaps a more structured approach would help. Let's look at each option and their possible NMR signals.

The options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

Wait, let me write the structures more clearly.

Option A: The structure is (CH3)C(H)(C2H5) connected to another (CH3)C(H)(C2H5), but wait, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the backbone is CH2CH2... no, wait, it's more like:

The molecule is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, perhaps it's better drawn as:

The central part is two CH groups attached to ethyl groups, connected to a CH2COOH.

So the structure would be:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

That's option A.

Option B: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So the structure is CH2CH2(C2H5) connected to
