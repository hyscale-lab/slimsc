Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my studies that the speed of light in a medium depends on the refractive index of that medium. Oh right, the speed v in the medium is c divided by n, where n is the index of refraction. But wait, in this case, the glass itself is moving, so I guess I need to consider the relative motion between the light and the glass.

Wait, the question is about the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab. So the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. Wait, no, the light is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving toward the observer? Or in the same direction as the beam? Let me read the question again.

The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam. Wait, the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So if the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, how does that affect the speed observed?

Oh, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to break it down. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So the light is already moving at speed v_light = c/n in the glass. But since the glass is moving, the observer is seeing the light's speed relative to them, not just within the glass.

Wait, but actually, the speed of light in a medium is v = c
