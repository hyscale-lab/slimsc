Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's everywhere in the universe. The question is about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The process is gamma-gamma → e+ e-. 

I think the key here is to find the energy of the gamma-rays where their lifetime in the universe is limited by this annihilation process. So, the lifetime is determined by the probability of this annihilation happening. If the probability is high enough, the gamma-rays don't last very long, hence their lifetime is limited by this process.

I remember that in particle physics, the cross-section (σ) is a measure of the probability of a reaction happening. The higher the cross-section, the more likely the reaction. So, the annihilation cross-section for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair must be considered.

Wait, the cross-section for this process depends on the energy of the photons involved. Since the CMB photons have a certain energy, and the gamma-rays are high-energy, I think the cross-section increases with the energy of the gamma-rays. But I'm not entirely sure of the exact dependence.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. That's a very low energy, which makes sense because CMB photons are very low energy. So the gamma-rays are much higher energy than that.

I think the formula for the annihilation cross-section of a gamma-ray with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair is given by the so-called Klein-Nishina formula, but that's for photon-photon interactions. Alternatively, maybe the cross-section for pair production scales with some function of the gamma-ray energy.

Alternatively, I recall that the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is approximately σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α²/m_e²) * (1/(4E_cm²)) ), but I'm not confident about that. Wait, maybe that's the cross-section for photon-photon pair production. Let me think.

Wait, the cross-section for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair depends on the center-of-mass energy. The threshold energy for e+ e- pair production is when the center-of-mass energy is at least twice the electron mass (2m_e c²). So, the cross-section is zero below that, and non-zero above.

The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so the center-of-mass energy (E_cm) must be at least about 1.022 MeV. So each photon must have enough energy such that their combined energy in the center-of-mass frame exceeds that.

But wait, the problem is about the probability of annihilation. The lifetime of the gamma-ray would be determined by the inverse of the annihilation rate. The annihilation rate depends on the cross-section multiplied by the photon density.

So, the annihilation rate Γ is given by Γ = n_γ * σ * v, where n_γ is the number density of CMB photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity of the photons. But since photons are massless and moving at the speed of light, their velocities are the same, so v is c? Or maybe each photon's velocity is c in opposite directions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the relative velocity could be considered as c, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the number density n_γ of CMB photons can be calculated using the formula for the density of a blackbody spectrum. The CMB temperature is about 2.7 K, but the average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, which I think is consistent with T = 2.7 K because k_B*T is about 0.000234 eV, but the average energy is higher because the average energy is about 2.7 kT for a photon gas. So with k_B*T ~0.000234 eV, the average photon energy is about 0.00063 eV, but the question says it's 1e-3 eV. Hmm, maybe the exact value isn't critical for this problem.

So n_γ is the number density of CMB photons. The formula for the number density of photons in a blackbody is n_γ = (8π g_{*s} (kT)^3)/(h^3 c^3), where g_{*s} is the spin multiplicity. For photons, g_{*s}=2, but wait, wait, no, g_{*s} is the effective degrees of freedom, but for photons, it's 2. So, n_γ ≈ (8 π (2) (kT)^3)/(h^3 c^3) )

Wait, but I think for the CMB, the number density is about 411 photons per cm³. Let me check, T=2.7 K:

n_γ ≈ (8 * pi * 2 * (k_B * T)^3 ) / (h^3 c^3) )

Let me compute that. But perhaps I don't need to calculate the exact value because the problem gives the average photon energy as 1e-3 eV. Alternatively, the number density can be approximated as ~400 cm^-3.

But perhaps the exact number isn't necessary if I can find the energy scale where the annihilation becomes significant.

So, the annihilation rate Γ is the product of the cross-section σ, the relative velocity (probably c), and the number density n_γ. The lifetime τ is the inverse of Γ: τ = 1/Γ.

We need to find the gamma-ray energy E such that τ is limited by this process. That is, for energies above a certain threshold, the annihilation happens quickly enough that the gamma-ray cannot survive for the age of the universe. So the lifetime is determined by this process.

But how to relate the cross-section σ to the energy E?

The cross-section for γγ → e+ e- depends on the center-of-mass energy squared, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2, but since both photons are moving at c, and assuming opposite directions (since the CMB is isotropic, the average is taken over all directions), but for a given photon, the collision would involve a high-energy photon and a low-energy (CMB) photon.

Wait, wait. Let me consider the frame where the two photons are moving in opposite directions. Let’s denote the high-energy photon as having energy E, and the CMB photon as having energy ε (1e-3 eV). Then the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E + ε)^2 - (p c)^2, where p is the momentum of the high-energy photon (E = p c, so p = E/(c)). For the low-energy photon, ε ≈ p_low c, so p_low = ε/(c).

But in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is E + ε, and the total momentum is (E/(c) - ε/(c)) if the photons are moving in opposite directions, but that depends on the frame. Maybe it's easier to consider the invariant s.

Wait, the square of the center-of-mass energy is s = (E + ε)^2 - (E - ε)^2, because in the lab frame where one photon is moving in the + direction and the other in the - direction, their momenta are E/(c) and ε/(c) in opposite directions. So the total energy is E + ε, and the total momentum is (E - ε)/(c).

So s = (E + ε)^2 - [ (E - ε)^2 ] / c^2 * c^2 = (E + ε)^2 - (E - ε)^2 = (E^2 + 2 E ε + ε^2) - (E^2 - 2 E ε + ε^2) ) = 4 E ε.

So s = 4 E ε.

The pair production threshold is when s ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2. So 4 E ε ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2 → E ≥ ( (2 m_e c²)^2 )/(4 ε) ). Simplifying:

E ≥ (4 m_e² c^4) / (4 ε) ) → E ≥ (m_e² c^4)/ (ε) → E ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / ε.

So for E ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / ε, the process is allowed. But that's the threshold. So for E below that, the cross-section is zero.

But the problem is about when the annihilation becomes significant enough to limit the gamma-ray's lifetime. So we're looking for the energy where the annihilation rate becomes comparable to the inverse of the age of the universe, which is about 1e-17 per second.

Wait, but the annihilation rate Γ is given by the cross-section multiplied by the photon density and the velocity. So Γ = n_γ σ v.

But for photons, the velocity is c, so v = c. So,

Γ = n_γ σ c.

Then, the lifetime τ is 1/(Γ) = 1/(n_γ σ c).

But wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the lifetime τ is the mean lifetime, which is the inverse of the annihilation rate. So τ = 1/Γ = 1/(n_γ σ v).

But for photon-photon interactions, the cross-section is given in terms of the center-of-mass energy. So at high energies, where E >> ε, the cross-section σ can be approximated by the Klein-Nishina formula, but I think for pair production, it's a different expression.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should recall that the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by:

σ = (8 π / 3) (α^2 / m_e^2) (1 / (4 E_cm^2)) ) * something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for E_cm >> m_e c^2, the cross-section scales as 1/E_cm^2.

Wait, for E_cm >> m_e c^2, the cross-section σ for pair production is approximately σ ≈ (8 π / 3) (α^2 / (s)) ), where s is the Mandelstam variable s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since the two photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are in opposite directions, so in the lab frame, the total momentum is (E/(c) - ε/(c)).

Wait, but earlier I found that s = 4 E ε. So, σ ≈ (8 π / 3) (α^2) / (s) ) = (8 π α²) / (4 E ε) ) = (2 π α²) / (E ε).

Wait, but that can't be right because for E >> epsilon, E is much bigger than epsilon, so s =4 E epsilon is about 4 E epsilon. So the cross-section σ ~ 1/(E epsilon).

Wait, but in this case, for each CMB photon, the cross-section with a gamma-ray of energy E is about (2 π α²)/(E ε). Because ε is small, this cross-section is proportional to 1/E.

But wait, the annihilation rate Γ is n_γ * σ * c, because each photon is moving at speed c, so the relative velocity is c.

So Γ = n_γ * (2 π α²/(E ε)) ) * c.

Wait, let me make sure. So the cross-section is per photon. So for each CMB photon, the cross-section is σ, and the number of targets is n_γ.

Wait, perhaps the rate is Γ = n_γ σ v, where v is the relative velocity between the gamma-ray and the CMB photons. Since both are moving at c, but in opposite directions, their relative velocity is 2c. Or wait, actually, for photons moving in opposite directions, their relative velocity is probably 2c. But that's a tricky point. Alternatively, when you have two particles moving towards each other, each at speed v, their relative speed is 2v. For v = c, that would be 2c, but photons can't go faster than c, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in the frame where the gamma is moving, the CMB photons are moving at speed c in all directions, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's best to consider that the rate is Γ = n_γ σ c. Because each CMB photon is moving at speed c, and the gamma is moving at speed c as well, so the relative speed is c (but in opposite directions, but perhaps it's still c in magnitude). Hmm, I'm not sure, but I'll proceed with that assumption.

So Γ ≈ n_γ * (2 π α²/(E ε)) * c.

The lifetime τ is 1/Γ.

So τ ≈ 1/(n_γ * (2 π α²/(E ε)) * c) )

= (E ε) / (n_γ * 2 π α² c )

But we're looking for the energy E where the lifetime τ is comparable to the age of the universe, let's say T ≈ 1e10 years ≈ 3e17 seconds.

But maybe I should set τ ≈ T. So,

E ≈ ( T * n_γ * 2 π α² c ) / ( ε )

But let me plug in the numbers.

First, let's compute each term.

n_γ: number density of CMB photons. Let's use n_γ ≈ 411 cm^-3 = 4.11e5 m^-3. Wait, wait, 1 cm^-3 is 1e6 m^-3, so 411 cm^-3 is 4.11e8 m^-3. Wait, let me think again. 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m^3 = (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm^3. So 1 cm^-3 = 1e6 m^-3. So 411 cm^-3 = 411 * 1e6 m^-3 = 4.11e8 m^-3.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me think: density is number per volume. So 411 photons per cm³ = 411 * 1e6 photons per m³, because 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, so 1/cm³ = 1e6/m³. So yes, 411 cm^-3 is 4.11e8 m^-3.

But wait, I've also heard that the CMB photon density is about 411 photons per cm³, which is about 411e6 photons/m³. So n_γ ≈ 4.11e8 m^-3.

Epsilon ε is given as 1e-3 eV.

Electron charge e is 1.6e-19 C. The fine structure constant α is about 1/137 ≈ 0.00729.

Speed of light c is 3e8 m/s.

Time T, the age of the universe, is about 4.3e17 seconds (approx 1.38e10 years). Wait, 1 year ≈ 3.15e7 seconds, so 1e10 years ≈ 3.15e17 s. Let me take T ≈ 1e18 s for estimation purposes. Wait, 1e10 years is 1e10 * 3.15e7 ≈ 3.15e17 s.

So setting τ ≈ T:

E ≈ ( T * n_γ * 2 π α^2 c ) / ( ε )

Let me plug in the numbers:

T = 1e18 s (approximating the age of the universe as ~1e18 s)
n_γ = 4.11e8 m^-3
alpha = 1/137 ≈ 0.00729
c = 3e8 m/s
epsilon = 1e-3 eV = 1e-3 eV.

Wait, but wait, the cross-section formula I used had units. Let me check if the units are correct.

Hmm, but perhaps I should compute E in terms of eV. Let's see.

Compute numerator: T * n_γ * 2 pi alpha^2 c.

T: 1e18 s
n_γ: 4.11e8 m^-3
2 pi alpha^2: 2 * 3.14 * (0.00729)^2 ≈ 6.28 * 5.31e-5 ≈ 3.33e-4
c: 3e8 m/s

So product: 1e18 s * 4.11e8 m^-3 * 3.33e-4 * 3e8 m/s.

Let me compute step by step:

1e18 s * 4.11e8 m^-3 = 4.11e26 s m^-3.

Then multiply by 3.33e-4: 4.11e26 * 3.33e-4 ≈ 1.37e23 s m^-3.

Then multiply by 3e8 m/s: 1.37e23 * 3e8 = 4.11e31 s m^-3 * m/s.

Wait, s m^-3 * m/s → s m^-2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost in the units. Let me proceed numerically.

Compute each factor:

T = 1e18 s
n_γ = 4.11e8 m^-3
2 pi alpha^2 = ~0.0048 (exact value: 2 * 3.1416 * (0.00729)^2 ≈ 2 * 3.14 * 5.3e-5 ≈ 3.3e-4)
c = 3e8 m/s.

So, putting it all together:

Numerator: T * n_γ * 2 pi alpha^2 c = (1e18) * (4.11e8) * (3.3e-4) * (3e8) )

Compute step by step:

1e18 * 4.11e8 = 4.11e26

4.11e26 * 3.3e-4 = ~1.356e23

1.356e23 * 3e8 = 4.068e31.

Denominator: epsilon = 1e-3 eV.

So E ≈ (4.068e31) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 4.068e34 eV.

But that's a huge energy. Let's convert eV to GeV.

1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 4.068e34 eV = 4.068e25 GeV. That's way higher than any of the options given. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the expression for Γ.

Earlier, I thought Γ = n_γ σ c, where σ is the cross-section.

But wait, the cross-section σ is in cm², perhaps? Or in m²? Let me think about units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use natural units where c=1, but that's probably complicating things.

Wait, another approach: The annihilation rate is given by the number of photon encounters multiplied by the cross-section. The number of photon encounters per unit time is n_γ c, since each photon is moving at speed c and the gamma-ray is moving at speed c. So the rate is n_γ c σ.

Wait, perhaps Γ = n_γ c σ. So the lifetime τ is 1/(Γ) = 1/(n_γ c σ).

But earlier I had τ ≈ (E ε)/(n_γ 2 π alpha^2 c^2)

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for sigma.

Wait, let me think again about the cross-section. The cross-section for pair production in the high-energy limit (E >> epsilon) is approximately sigma = (8 pi alpha^2)/(3 s), where s is the center-of-mass energy squared. Since s = 4 E epsilon, sigma ≈ (8 pi alpha^2)/(3 *4 E epsilon) ) = (2 pi alpha^2)/(3 E epsilon).

So sigma = (2 pi alpha^2)/(3 E epsilon).

Then, the annihilation rate is Γ = n_γ sigma c.

So Gamma = n_γ * (2 pi alpha^2)/(3 E epsilon) ) * c.

Thus, Gamma = (2 pi alpha^2 n_γ c) / (3 E epsilon).

So the lifetime is tau = 1/Gamma = (3 E epsilon) / (2 pi alpha^2 n_γ c).

We set tau equal to the age of the universe, say T = 1e18 seconds.

So,

(3 E epsilon) / (2 pi alpha^2 n_γ c) ) = T.

Solving for E:

E = ( T * 2 pi alpha^2 n_γ c ) / (3 epsilon )

Plugging in the numbers:

T = 1e18 s
n_γ = 411 cm^-3 = 4.11e8 m^-3 (as before)
alpha = 1/137 ≈ 0.00729
c = 3e8 m/s
epsilon = 1e-3 eV.

Let me compute each part:

Compute numerator: T * 2 pi alpha^2 n_γ c.

2 pi alpha^2 = 2 * 3.1416 * (0.00729)^2 ≈ 2 *3.14 *5.3e-5 ≈ ~3.31e-4.

n_γ c = 4.11e8 m^-3 * 3e8 m/s = 1.233e17 m^-2 s^-1.

So numerator: T * (2 pi alpha^2) * n_γ c = 1e18 s * 3.31e-4 * 1.233e17 m^-2 s^-1.

Wait, let me compute this correctly.

Wait, 2 pi alpha^2 n_γ c = (3.31e-4) * (4.11e8 m^-3 * 3e8 m/s) )

Wait, 4.11e8 [m^-3] * 3e8 [m/s] = (4.11e8 *3e8 ) [m^-3 * m/s] = 1.233e17 m^-2 s^-1.

Multiply by 2 pi alpha^2: 3.31e-4 * 1.233e17 = 4.08e13.

Then multiply by T (1e18 s): 4.08e13 * 1e18 = 4.08e31.

Denominator: 3 epsilon = 3 * 1e-3 eV = 3e-3 eV.

Thus, E = 4.08e31 / (3e-3 eV) ) = 1.36e34 eV.

Again, that's 1.36e34 eV, which is 1.36e25 GeV, way higher than the options given (options are up to ~4e5 GeV). So clearly, I'm doing something wrong.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the number density. Let me recheck. The CMB photon density is about 411 photons per cm³, which is 411e6 photons per m³, because 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. So 411 photons/cm³ = 411 * 1e6 photons/m³ = 4.11e8 photons/m³. So n_γ =4.11e8 m^-3.

Wait, but perhaps in the formula, n_γ is in cm^-3, not m^-3. Let me see the units again.

Wait, let me make sure about the units. Let's go back.

The expression for sigma in cross-section has units of cm^2, perhaps? Or m^2?

Wait, perhaps using SI units is causing confusion. Maybe it's better to switch to cgs units.

Because in many particle physics contexts, cross-sections are in cm², and energies in eV, etc.

So, let me recast all the numbers in cgs units.

In cgs units:

n_γ: 411 cm^-3.

c = 3e10 cm/s.

epsilon = 1e-3 eV.

But wait, energy in ergs? Because 1 eV = 1.602e-12 ergs.

So epsilon = 1e-3 eV = 1.602e-15 erg.

The fine structure constant alpha is the same: ~1/137.

So, let's recompute the numerator and denominator.

Compute E = ( T * 2 pi alpha^2 n_γ c ) / (3 epsilon )

But T is in seconds, but let me convert everything into cgs units.

Wait, T is in seconds; let's convert it to cgs time units (seconds are fine, as cgs uses cm, grams, seconds). So T is 1e18 s.

But n_γ is 411 cm^-3.

c is 3e10 cm/s.

So:

E = ( T * 2 pi alpha^2 * n_γ * c ) / (3 epsilon )

Plugging in the numbers:

T = 1e18 s
n_γ = 411 cm^-3
c = 3e10 cm/s
alpha = 1/137 ≈ 0.00729
epsilon = 1e-3 eV = 1.602e-15 erg.

Compute numerator: T * 2 pi alpha^2 n_γ c.

Compute each term:

2 pi alpha^2 = 2 * 3.1416 * (0.00729)^2 ≈ 3.31e-4.

n_γ * c = 411 cm^-3 * 3e10 cm/s = 1.233e13 cm^-2 s^-1.

Multiply 2 pi alpha^2 * n_γ c: 3.31e-4 * 1.233e13 ≈ 4.08e9.

Multiply by T: 4.08e9 * 1e18 = 4.08e27.

Denominator: 3 epsilon = 3 * 1.602e-15 erg = 4.806e-15 erg.

So E = 4.08e27 / (4.806e-15 erg) ) = 8.48e41 erg.

Convert erg to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-12 erg. So erg to eV is division by 1.602e-12.

So E = 8.48e41 erg / 1.602e-12 erg/eV ≈ 5.3e53 eV.

Wait, that's even worse. 5e53 eV is way beyond the options. So something's wrong with this approach.

Hmm, perhaps the approach is incorrect. Perhaps I should instead consider the photon density in terms of flux, or perhaps the Klein-Nishina formula isn't applicable here. Alternatively, I'm missing a factor related to the photon spectrum.

Wait, another approach: the optical depth tau is the product of the cross-section sigma and the photon density n_γ times the distance traveled. The lifetime is determined when the optical depth becomes ~1, meaning that the probability of annihilation is about 1/2.

So tau = n_γ sigma c t.

We set tau ≈ 1 for the process to be significant.

So,

n_γ sigma c t ≈ 1.

So,

sigma = 1/(n_γ c t).

But in our case, the lifetime is when the annihilation probability becomes significant, so when the annihilation rate is such that the mean lifetime is comparable to the age of the universe.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is to use the relation:

E ≈ (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon * n_γ c alpha^2)

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a formula or scaling relation.

I remember that the energy where the annihilation becomes significant is given by E ~ (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon * rho_crit * c^2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering that the cross-section sigma scales as (alpha^2 / (E * epsilon)), the annihilation rate scales as n_γ * sigma * c = n_γ * (alpha^2 / (E epsilon)) * c.

Setting the rate Γ ≈ 1/tau, with tau being the age of the universe T, so:

Gamma ≈ 1/T → n_γ (alpha^2 / (E epsilon)) c ≈ 1/T.

Solving for E:

E ≈ n_γ alpha^2 c T / (epsilon).

Plugging in the numbers:

n_γ = 411 cm^-3 = 4.11e8 m^-3.

Wait, but perhaps in cgs units: n_γ = 411 cm^-3.

So,

n_γ = 411 cm^-3.

alpha = 1/137.

c = 3e10 cm/s.

T = age of universe ≈ 1e18 s.

epsilon = 1e-3 eV = 1e-3 eV.

So,

E ≈ (411 cm^-3) * ( (0.00729)^2 ) * (3e10 cm/s) * (1e18 s) ) / (1e-3 eV) )

Compute numerator:

411 * (0.00729)^2 = 411 * 5.31e-5 ≈ 411 * 5.3e-5 ≈ 0.0218.

Multiply by 3e10 cm/s: 0.0218 * 3e10 ≈ 6.54e8.

Multiply by 1e18 s: 6.54e8 * 1e18 = 6.54e26.

Denominator: 1e-3 eV.

So E ≈ 6.54e26 / 1e-3 eV = 6.54e29 eV.

That's 6.54e29 eV, which is 6.54e20 GeV. Still way too high. So this is not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong expression for the cross-section. Maybe the cross-section is proportional to 1/(E * epsilon). But perhaps I should consider that the cross-section is sigma ≈ (alpha^2 / (s)), where s is the Mandelstam variable s = (E + epsilon)^2 - (p E - p' epsilon)^2. Wait, but earlier calculation shows that s = 4 E epsilon.

So sigma ≈ alpha^2/(s) = alpha^2/(4 E epsilon).

So sigma = alpha^2/(4 E epsilon) * (something), but I think the exact factor may not matter for order of magnitude.

So, the annihilation rate is Gamma = n_γ sigma c.

So Gamma = n_γ * (alpha^2/(4 E epsilon)) * c.

Set Gamma = 1/tau, and tau = age of universe T.

So,

n_γ * (alpha^2/(4 E epsilon)) * c = 1/T.

Solving for E:

E = (n_γ alpha^2 c T) / (4 epsilon).

Plugging in the numbers:

n_γ =411 cm^-3.

alpha = 1/137.

c = 3e10 cm/s.

T = 1e18 s.

epsilon =1e-3 eV = 1e-3 eV.

So,

E = (411 * (1/137)^2 * 3e10 * 1e18 ) / (4 * 1e-3 ) eV.

Compute numerator:

411 * (1/(137^2)) = 411/(18769) ≈ 0.022.

Multiply by 3e10: 0.022 *3e10 ≈ 6.6e8.

Multiply by 1e18: 6.6e8 * 1e18 = 6.6e26.

Denominator: 4*1e-3 = 4e-3.

So E = (6.6e26) / (4e-3) ) eV.

Wait, 6.6e26 /4e-3 = 1.65e29 eV.

Again, that's 1.65e29 eV = 1.65e20 GeV, which is way too high.

Wait, this is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should look for a standard formula or result. I recall that the critical energy where the annihilation becomes efficient is given by E_c ~ (m_e c^2)^2/(epsilon * rho_crit * c^2), but I’m not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider using the relation E ~ (m_e c^2)^2/(epsilon * n_γ c alpha^2 ).

Wait, let me compute that.

m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

So,

E ~ (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (epsilon * n_γ c alpha^2 )

But let me compute this:

E = ( (0.511e6 eV)^2 ) / ( (1e-3 eV) * (411 cm^-3) * (3e10 cm/s) * ( (1/137)^2 ) )

But perhaps I should convert all units to eV and seconds.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute this with numbers.

Compute numerator: (0.511e6)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

Denominator: 1e-3 eV * 411 cm^-3 * 3e10 cm/s * (1/137)^2.

Compute denominator step by step:

1e-3 eV.

411 cm^-3.

3e10 cm/s.

(1/137)^2 ≈ 5.3e-5.

So,

denominator = 1e-3 * 411 *3e10 *5.3e-5.

Compute each multiplication:

1e-3 *411 = 0.411.

0.411 *3e10 =1.233e10.

1.233e10 *5.3e-5 ≈ (1.233 *5.3 )e5 → approximately 6.54e5.

So denominator = 6.54e5 eV cm/s.

Wait, but units are getting messy. But I'm just computing the numerical factor.

So,

E = 2.61e11 eV^2 / (6.54e5 eV cm/s ) → because denominator is 1e-3 eV * 411 cm^-3 *3e10 cm/s *5.3e-5.

Wait, the denominator in terms of units:

cm^-3 * cm/s → cm^-2 s^-1.

So denominator units: eV * cm^-2 s^-1.

Hmm, so E has units of (eV^2 ) / (eV cm^-2 s^-1 ) ) → eV * cm^2 s.

Wait, that can't be right. I'm getting stuck on units again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the numerical value.

So,

E ≈ (2.61e11 ) / 6.54e5 ≈ approx 3.99e5 eV.

3.99e5 eV is 3.99e5 eV = 3.99e5 /1e9 GeV = 0.000399 GeV, which is way too low. This approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the denominator should include c^2 somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is E ~ (m_e c^2)^2/(epsilon * rho c^2), where rho is the energy density.

Hmm, the energy density of the CMB is rho ≈ n_γ epsilon, with epsilon being the average photon energy.

So rho = n_γ epsilon.

So rho = 411 cm^-3 * 1e-3 eV = 0.411e-3 eV/cm^3.

But perhaps in erg/cm^3: 1 eV = 1.602e-12 erg. So rho = 0.411e-3 * 1.602e-12 erg/cm^3 ≈ 6.58e-16 erg/cm^3.

But the critical density rho_crit is about 9.9e-27 g/cm^3, but perhaps that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, the cross-section might depend on the photon energy.

Wait, another approach: The energy where the photon's mean free path equals the age of the universe times the speed of light.

Mean free path lambda = 1/(n_γ sigma).

The lifetime of the photon would be determined by traveling a distance where the probability of interaction is significant. So, the mean free path should be on the order of the universe's size.

Wait, but the age of the universe times c is about 3e8 m/s * 1e18 s = 3e26 m, which is about 3e28 cm.

So, lambda ≈ c * T = 3e28 cm.

Mean free path lambda = 1/(n_γ sigma).

So,

sigma = 1/(n_γ lambda) = 1/(n_γ c T).

But sigma for the process gamma gamma → e+ e- is given by sigma ≈ (alpha^2)/(s), where s is the center of mass energy squared.

So,

sigma ≈ (alpha^2)/(4 E epsilon) ) → setting sigma = 1/(n_γ c T).

So,

(alpha^2)/(4 E epsilon) ) = 1/(n_γ c T).

Solving for E,

E = (alpha^2 n_γ c T) / (4 epsilon).

Plugging in the numbers:

alpha = 1/137 ≈ 0.00729.

n_γ =411 cm^-3.

c =3e10 cm/s.

T=1e18 s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

So,

E = ( (0.00729)^2 * 411 * 3e10 * 1e18 ) / (4 *1e-3 eV).

Compute numerator:

0.00729^2 ≈5.31e-5.

5.31e-5 *411 ≈2.18e-2.

2.18e-2 *3e10=6.54e8.

6.54e8 *1e18=6.54e26.

Denominator:4e-3 eV.

So,

E =6.54e26 /4e-3 eV = 1.635e29 eV.

Which is 1.635e29 eV = 1.635e20 GeV. Again, way too high.

This is not matching any of the options. Clearly, I'm making a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the photon's lifetime from inverse Compton scattering. But no, the process here is pair production.

Wait, perhaps the cross-section for pair production is much larger than what I'm assuming, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the GZK limit approach. The Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) limit is about the energy where high-energy cosmic rays interact with the CMB photons to produce pions. The GZK limit is around 1e20 eV, but that's for protons interacting via p + γ → pions. But that's not the same as gamma-gamma annihilation, but perhaps it's related.

Wait, but the GZK limit is around 1e20 eV, and the options in the problem are about 1e5 GeV, which is 1e8 eV, way below the GZK limit. So perhaps the process discussed here is for much lower energies.

Wait, perhaps the energy scale where gamma-ray photons annihilate with CMB photons is higher than the GZK limit because the cross-section for pair production is higher.

Wait, but no, the GZK limit is for protons, which have a much larger cross-section than photons. Hmm, perhaps not.

Another thought: The Klein-Nishina formula gives the cross-section for photon-photon scattering, but for pair production, perhaps the cross-section is different. Wait, but pair production requires two photons, so the cross-section is a different expression.

Wait, I think I remember that the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by:

σ = (8 π/3) (α²/m_e²) (1/(4 E_cm²)),

where E_cm is the center-of-mass energy.

Since E_cm² = (E + epsilon)^2 - (E - epsilon)^2 =4 E epsilon,

so E_cm² =4 E epsilon.

So,

σ = (8 π/3) (α²/m_e²) (1/(4 E epsilon)) ) = (2 π α²)/(3 E epsilon m_e²).

Wait, but units-wise, this might not be correct. Let me check units.

Wait, but let's proceed.

So, σ = (2 pi alpha^2) / (3 E epsilon m_e^2).

Then, the annihilation rate is:

Gamma = n_γ sigma c.

Set Gamma = 1/tau, tau being the age of the universe.

So,

n_γ * (2 pi alpha^2 )/(3 E epsilon m_e^2) ) * c = 1/tau.

Solving for E:

E = (2 pi alpha^2 n_γ c tau) / (3 epsilon m_e^2).

Compute each term.

n_γ =411 cm^-3 → 4.11e8 m^-3.

But let's use cgs units for consistency.

n_γ =411 cm^-3.

alpha=1/137.

c=3e10 cm/s.

tau=1e18 s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

m_e^2: m_e in grams is about 9.11e-28 grams. So m_e^2 is (9.11e-28 g)^2 = 8.3e-55 g².

But wait, perhaps better to handle in eV units.

Alternatively, energy in ergs. 1 eV = 1.6e-12 erg.

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV = 0.511e6 *1.6e-12 erg = 8.18e-7 erg.

But E_cm^2 = (4 E epsilon) in erg^2.

Wait, maybe I should compute all terms in cgs units.

Compute numerator: 2 pi alpha^2 n_γ c tau.

2 pi ≈6.28.

alpha^2 ≈ (1/137)^2 ≈5.3e-5.

n_γ=411 cm^-3.

c=3e10 cm/s.

tau=1e18 s.

So,

2 pi alpha^2 n_γ c tau =6.28 *5.3e-5 *411 *3e10 *1e18.

Compute step by step:

6.28 *5.3e-5 ≈3.33e-4.

3.33e-4 *411 ≈1.37e-1.

1.37e-1 *3e10 =4.11e9.

4.11e9 *1e18 =4.11e27.

Denominator:3 epsilon m_e^2.

epsilon=1e-3 eV =1.6e-15 erg.

m_e^2 is (m_e c^2)^2 / c^4 → but perhaps I should compute m_e^2 in grams.

Wait, the mass of the electron is 9.11e-28 grams. So m_e^2 is (9.11e-28)^2 = 8.29e-55 g².

But in cgs units, m_e^2 (in erg s² cm²) is (m_e c^2)^2 / c^4 → perhaps it's easier to think in terms of ergs.

Wait, m_e in eV/c² is 0.511e6 eV/c².

So, m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

But I'm getting stuck again. Instead, perhaps I can compute the denominator in cgs units.

epsilon =1e-3 eV =1e-3 * 1.6e-12 erg=1.6e-15 erg.

m_e^2 = (9.11e-28 g)^2 = 8.29e-55 g².

But 1 g² = 1e-4 g^2 (no, that's not right). Wait, in cgs, 1 erg = 1 g cm² / s^2.

So, m_e^2 in erg s² cm^-2 would be (m_e c^2)^2 (because E=mc^2).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed numerically.

Denominator:3 * epsilon * m_e^2.

epsilon=1e-3 eV =1.6e-15 erg.

m_e^2= (9.11e-28 g)^2 =8.29e-55 g².

But to get the denominator in cgs units, which is erg * g², this might not make sense. Perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is 3 * epsilon * m_e^2 in eV.

Wait, m_e^2 is (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 (eV)^2.

So,

denominator:3 * (1e-3 eV) * (0.261e12 eV^2) ) =3 *1e-3 *0.261e12 eV^3 = 7.83e8 eV^3.

So,

E = (4.11e27) / (7.83e8 eV^3) ) = 5.25e18 eV.

Wait, 5.25e18 eV is way too high, like 5.25e9 GeV, which is way off the given options.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a formula or a scaling relation that gives the energy threshold.

Wait, I found a resource that says the critical energy E_c where photon-photon pair production becomes significant is given by:

E_c ≈ 1.2 ×10^5 GeV × (n_γ / (1e-7 cm^-3))^{-1} × (epsilon / (1e-3 eV))^{-1} × (T / (1e18 s))^{-1} × (m_e c^2 / 0.511 MeV)^2.

Wait, perhaps that's the formula. Let me plug in the numbers.

n_γ=411 cm^-3 → n_γ/(1e-7 cm^-3)=411 /1e-7 =4.11e9.

epsilon=1e-3 eV → epsilon/(1e-3 eV) =1.

T=1e18 s → T/(1e18 s)=1.

m_e c^2=0.511 MeV → (0.511 MeV / 0.511 MeV )=1.

So,

E_c ≈1.2e5 GeV * (4.11e9)^{-1} → Wait, no, the formula says (n_γ/1e-7 cm^-3)^{-1}, which is (4.11e9)^{-1} ≈ 2.43e-10.

So,

E_c ≈1.2e5 GeV * 2.43e-10 ≈ 2.916e-5 GeV → which is way too low. That can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is incorrect or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the scaling is different.

Wait, maybe the critical energy E_c is given by E_c ≈ (m_e c^2)^2/(epsilon * n_γ * sigma_0), where sigma_0 is a characteristic cross-section. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: The energy where the photon's lifetime is limited by annihilation is when the photon's lifetime tau equals the age of the universe.

The annihilation rate is Gamma = n_γ sigma c.

Gamma = 1/tau.

So,

tau =1/(n_γ sigma c).

Set tau = age of universe T.

So,

n_γ sigma c =1/T.

Solve for sigma:

sigma =1/(n_γ c T).

But sigma is also a function of E and epsilon.

So, for the pair production process, sigma ≈ (alpha^2)/(s), where s=4 E epsilon.

So,

alpha^2/(4 E epsilon ) =1/(n_γ c T).

Solve for E:

E = (alpha^2 n_γ c T )/(4 epsilon).

Plug in the numbers:

alpha^2= (1/137)^2≈5.3e-5.

n_γ=411 cm^-3.

c=3e10 cm/s.

T=1e18 s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

Compute numerator:5.3e-5 *411 *3e10 *1e18.

5.3e-5 *411 ≈0.0218.

0.0218 *3e10=6.54e8.

6.54e8 *1e18=6.54e26.

Denominator:4 *1e-3 eV=4e-3 eV.

So,

E=6.54e26 /4e-3 eV=1.635e29 eV → which is 1.635e20 GeV.

Again, same result as before. So, I must conclude that I'm making a mistake in the approach, given that the options are all around 1e5 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that the annihilation is effective for E > some threshold is correct, and the threshold is when E ~ (m_e c^2)^2/(epsilon).

Compute that:

(m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 eV^2.

Divide by epsilon=1e-3 eV → 0.261e12 eV^2 /1e-3 eV= 2.61e14 eV.

2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that's 2.6 ×1e5 GeV.

So, the correct answer would be option C: 2.6 ×1e5 GeV.


To determine the energy of high-energy gamma-rays for which their lifetimes in the universe are limited by annihilation with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we analyze the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The annihilation rate $\Gamma$ is proportional to the cross-section $\sigma$ and the photon density $n_\gamma$, with $\Gamma = n_\gamma \sigma c$. The lifetime $\tau$ is the inverse of the annihilation rate: $\tau = 1/\Gamma$. For the gamma-ray lifetime to be limited by this process, we set $\tau$ equal to the age of the universe, $T \approx 10^{18}$ seconds.

The cross-section for $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ depends on the center-of-mass energy squared, $s = 4E_\gamma \epsilon$, where $E_\gamma$ is the gamma-ray energy and $\epsilon$ is the CMB photon energy. For $E_\gamma \gg \epsilon$, the cross-section scales as $\sigma \propto \alpha^2 / (s) = \alpha^2 / (4E_\gamma \epsilon)$, where $\alpha \approx 1/137$ is the fine-structure constant.

Substituting $\sigma$ into the annihilation rate equation, we solve for $E_\gamma$:

\[
\Gamma = n_\gamma \frac{\alpha^2}{4E_\gamma \epsilon} c \quad \Rightarrow \quad \tau = \frac{4E_\gamma \epsilon}{n_\gamma \alpha^2 c}.
\]

Setting $\tau = T$, we find:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{n_\gamma \alpha^2 c T}{4 \epsilon}.
\]

### Parameters:
- $n_\gamma = 411$ cm$^{-3}$ (CMB photon density),
- $\alpha = 1/137$,
- $c = 3 \times 10^{10}$ cm/s,
- $T = 10^{18}$ s,
- $\epsilon = 10^{-3}$ eV.

### Calculation:
1. Compute the numerator:
   \[
   n_\gamma \alpha^2 c T = 411 \cdot (1/137)^2 \cdot (3 \times 10^{10}) \cdot (10^{18}).
   \]
   - $\alpha^2 = (1/137)^2 \approx 5.3 \times 10^{-5}$,
   - $411 \cdot 5.3 \times 10^{-5} \approx 0.0218$,
   - $0.0218 \cdot 3 \times 10^{10} \approx 6.54 \times 10^8$,
   - $6.54 \times 10^8 \cdot 10^{18} = 6.54 \times 10^{26}$.

2. Compute the denominator:
   \[
   4 \epsilon = 4 \cdot 10^{-3} = 4 \times 10^{-3}.
   \]

3. Solve for $E_\gamma$:
   \[
   E_\gamma = \frac{6.54 \times 10^{26}}{4 \times 10^{-3}} = 1.635 \times 10^{29} \text{ eV}.
   \]

Convert to GeV:
\[
E_\gamma = 1.635 \times 10^{29} \text{ eV} = 1.635 \times 10^{20} \text{ GeV}.
\]

This result is far too high compared to the given options. Revisiting the scaling relation for the critical energy where annihilation becomes significant, we use:

\[
E_\gamma \sim \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\epsilon}.
\]

### Final Calculation:
- $m_e c^2 = 0.511$ MeV $= 0.511 \times 10^6$ eV,
- $(m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = 0.261 \times 10^{12}$ eV$^2$,
- $E_\gamma = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14}$ eV $= 2.61 \times 10^5$ GeV.

This matches option **C**.

ANSWER: C
