Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly, but they move at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The radius is 30 meters. The question is asking, what Lorentz factor do we need so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls?

Hmm. So I think I need to relate the Lorentz factor to the distance the particles travel before decaying. Because the higher the Lorentz factor, the longer they can travel before decaying, right? Because in the lab frame, the particles are moving fast, so from our perspective, their lifetime is longer. So they can cover more distance before decaying.

Wait, but the problem says that with a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third reach the walls. So the radius is 30 meters. Let me think about how the distance relates to the lifetime.

I remember that the proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by tau. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, so gamma = 20 in the first case.

The particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance they can travel is the radius, 30 meters. The ones that reach the wall are those that have a mean lifetime just enough to travel that distance. So the velocity is approximately the speed of light, since they're ultra-relativistic. So I can approximate the velocity as c.

So the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is t = distance / speed. Here, distance is 30 meters, speed is c, so t = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 1e-7 seconds.

Wait, but that's the time it takes to reach the wall. For the particle to reach the wall, it must have a lifetime longer than this time. So the mean lifetime of the particle (gamma * tau) must be about the same as this time, right? Because if the mean lifetime is longer, more particles will make it to the wall.

Wait, no. Actually, the particles decay exponentially. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is e^(-t/(gamma tau)). So the fraction that reach the wall is the integral of the survival probability as they move outward. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a simpler ratio. At gamma =20, one third (1/3) of the particles reach the wall. So the distance that the particles can travel is related to their gamma. So perhaps the number that reach is proportional to the gamma.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The proper lifetime is tau. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = R/(beta c), because beta is v/c. Since beta is approximately 1 for ultra-relativistic particles, t ≈ R/(c). So R=30 meters, c=3e8 m/s, so t= 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 seconds.

The average lifetime is gamma tau. So for a particle to reach the wall, its lifetime must be greater than t. The number that make it is the fraction that live longer than t.

The survival probability is e^(-t/(gamma tau)), but if t is comparable to gamma tau, that's when most of the decay happens. Wait, but perhaps for the initial case, when gamma is 20, 1/3 reach the wall. So gamma_20 corresponds to 1/3.

We need to find gamma_2 where 2/3 reach the wall.

So perhaps the fraction is proportional to gamma. Because if gamma increases, the mean lifetime increases, so more particles will reach the wall. But I'm not sure if it's a linear relationship.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it using the relation between the decay length and the radius. The decay length is c * gamma tau. If
