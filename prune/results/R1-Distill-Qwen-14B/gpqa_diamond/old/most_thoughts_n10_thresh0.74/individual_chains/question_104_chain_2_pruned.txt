Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the setup is that astronomers are looking for exoplanets around two stars with the same mass as our Sun. They found one planet each, both similar to Neptune in mass. Both orbits are circular. 

The question is about the orbital periods. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. They want to know how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet tugs it. The shift relates to the star's velocity. The formula I think is something like V = (2Ï€ G)^(1/3) * (M_p / (M_star^(2/3))) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about the velocity semi-amplitude K. Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is what's being measured here.

The formula for K is K = (v) = ( (G * P )^(-1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * something... Wait, no, I think it's better to think in terms of the formula involving K, which is the velocity semi-amplitude.

Wait, I recall that the RV method gives us K, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula for K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(3/2) )) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 + M_p/M_star) )) )

But wait, maybe it's better to think about the relationship between K and the orbital period. Oh, right, another approach: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the period, and the mass of the star.

The formula I remember is K = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1
