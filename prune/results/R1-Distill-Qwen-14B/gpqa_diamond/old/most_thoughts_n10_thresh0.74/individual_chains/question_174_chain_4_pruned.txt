Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and comparing relativistic versus classical (non-relativistic) kinetic energy. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The problem says: An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M.

We're told to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 (which I assume is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) and the T1 value calculated using a classical approximation. The options are in the range of a few MeV.

Hmm. Let me break it down.

First, initial mass is M at rest. Its rest energy is 300 GeV. When it fissions, it splits into two fragments. Let's denote their masses as m1 and m2, where m1 is the more massive one. The problem states that m1 is twice m2, so m1 = 2*m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99*M.

Wait, because the sum is 99% of M. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99*M.

Since m1 is 2*m2, substituting gives 2*m2 + m2 = 3*m2 = 0.99*M → m2 = 0.99*M /3 = 0.33 M. So m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

Wait, but wait. The initial rest mass is M, and the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M. So some mass is lost, right? That's converted into kinetic energy. Because when a nucleus fissions, the total mass decreases, and that mass defect is converted into energy, which is the kinetic energy of the fragments.

But wait, in this problem, the fragments are only the two masses, nothing else. So the initial energy is just the rest mass energy of M, which is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest mass energy is 0.99*M * c², but wait, the rest mass of each fragment is m1 c² and m2 c². So the sum is (m1 + m2)c² = 0.99 M c². So the initial energy is M c² =300 GeV. So 0.99*M c² is 297 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV, which goes into kinetic energy.

Wait, but the initial nucleus is at rest. So the total momentum after fission must be zero since momentum is conserved. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So their kinetic energies can be calculated, but considering they have different masses.

But wait, the problem says to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1.

In the non-relativistic (classical) approximation, kinetic energy is (1/2) mv². But in reality, for high energies, we must use
