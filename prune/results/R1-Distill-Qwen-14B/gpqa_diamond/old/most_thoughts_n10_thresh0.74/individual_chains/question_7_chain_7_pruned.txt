Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. Hmm, the question is asking about the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. Let me think through this.

I remember that high-energy gamma-rays can interact with the CMB photons. The process given is gamma-gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs. The reaction is γγ → e+ e-.

Wait, so the lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited by how quickly it can annihilate with CMB photons. So the lifetime τ is related to the probability of this interaction. The higher the energy, the more likely it is to interact, I guess. But I'm not exactly sure how to calculate this.

I think the key here is the cross-section for this interaction. The cross-section σ determines the probability of the interaction. The annihilation cross-section for two photons depends on their energies. Oh right, there's a formula for the photon-photon cross-section. Let me recall. I think it's something like σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α² / m_e²) * (E_cm² / E1 E2)^2, where E1 and E2 are the photon energies, and E_cm is the center of mass energy. Wait, or maybe it's related to the square of the logarithm of the energy ratio? Hmm, I'm a bit hazy on the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the interaction rate between the gamma-ray and CMB photons would depend on the number density of the CMB photons and the cross-section. The mean free path λ is the inverse of the interaction rate, which would be n * σ, where n is the number density of CMB photons.

Oh right! The lifetime τ is the mean free path divided by the speed, so τ = λ / c. Wait, no, the lifetime is the time it takes for the gamma-ray to travel a mean free path, so τ ≈ λ / v, but since v is close to c for high-energy photons, we can approximate τ ≈ λ / c.

So first, I need to find the cross-section σ for γγ → e+ e-. Then, compute the mean free path λ = 1/(n σ), and then τ = λ / c.

The number density n of CMB photons can be found from the CMB radiation. The average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, which is 1e-3 eV. But wait, the CMB has a blackbody spectrum with a temperature T. The average photon energy is about 2.7 k T, but wait, the average energy for a blackbody is (π^4/30)k T ≈ 2.7 k T. But wait, maybe the average photon energy is given here as 1e-3 eV. Alternatively, the CMB photon density is given by n = (g_{*s} (T) / (π^2)) * (k T)^3 / (2 (ħ c)^3) ), but maybe that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the average number density of CMB photons is n = 411 photons/cm^3 or something
