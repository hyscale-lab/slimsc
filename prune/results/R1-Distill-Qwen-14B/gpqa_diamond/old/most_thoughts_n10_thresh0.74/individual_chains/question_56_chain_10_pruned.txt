Okay, so I have this physics problem about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between different states, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. The question is about a specific transition from the 3,0,0 state to the 1,0,0 state via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out the correct transition route and the probability.

First, I think about the selection rules for dipole transitions. From what I recall, the dipole selection rules for hydrogen are: Δn can be ±1, ±2, etc., but for allowed transitions, the change in n is usually limited to certain values. Also, the angular momentum quantum number l changes by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. The decay is via two dipole transitions, so it's a two-step process. So, the initial state goes to an intermediate state, which then goes to the final state.

The initial state has n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So, n goes from 3 to 1. That's a Δn of -2. But since dipole transitions usually allow Δn = ±1, how is a Δn of -2 possible in two steps? Oh wait, because it's two transitions. So the first transition could be n=3 → n=2 (Δn=-1), and then n=2 → n=1 (Δn=-1 again). That makes sense.

But wait, for the first transition, the initial state is l=0 (s orbital). In the first transition, l must change by ±1. So from l=0, it can go to l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. Let me think about possible states.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The possible first transitions are to |2,1, m⟩ where m can be -1, 0, +1. Because for dipole transitions, Δm can be 0, ±1. So from m=0, the first transition can go to m= -1, 0, or +1.

So the intermediate state must be |2,1, m⟩. Then from that state, you go to |1,0,0⟩. Let's see what the selection rules would say about that second transition.

The second transition is from |2,1, m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. Again, l must change by ±1. So from l=1 to l=0, which is a Δl of -1, which is allowed. And for m, since the initial m is m in the intermediate state, m can change by 0, ±1. So for the second transition, starting from m, it can go to m', which would be m ± 0, ±1.

Wait, the final state is m=0. So in the second transition, the intermediate state |2,1, m⟩ must have m that allows Δm to reach 0.

So let's see:

If the intermediate state is |2,1, 0⟩
