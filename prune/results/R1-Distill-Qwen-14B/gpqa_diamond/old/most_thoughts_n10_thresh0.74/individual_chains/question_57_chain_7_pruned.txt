Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momentum states. The phase shifts are δ0 = 90 degrees, δ1=67, δ2=55, δ3=30, and δ4=13 degrees. Oh wait, and we're told to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond that. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if their energy plays into this particular calculation.

The question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts. The formula is something like f(θ,φ) = sum over l of (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} [ (e^{-iδ_l} -1 ) ] * ( ... something with spherical harmonics ... ). But wait, for the forward direction, which is along the incident beam, φ=0 and θ=0.

Wait, I think there's a simplification for the scattering amplitude in the forward direction. Let me recall. Oh right, when θ is 0 degrees (same direction as incident), the direction is along the beam, so the azimuthal angle φ is 0. But spherical harmonics Y^m_l(θ,φ) might simplify here.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum states l and m. The formula is f(θ, φ) = ∑_{l=0}^∞ ∑_{m=-l}^l (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} [ (e^{-iδ_l} - 1) ] * (something with Y_{l}^m) ). Wait, no, that's not quite right. I think it's more like f(θ, φ) = ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ (e^{iδ_l} -1) ] P_l(cosθ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But wait, that's for the partial wave expansion, and it's when the scattering is in the lab frame. Or maybe that's when the momentum is along the z-axis. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, Im f, along
