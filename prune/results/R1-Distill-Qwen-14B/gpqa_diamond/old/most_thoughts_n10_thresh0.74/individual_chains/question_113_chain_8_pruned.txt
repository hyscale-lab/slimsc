Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR, NMR, and Mass Spec data. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

First, let's look at the IR data. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually suggest O-H stretching. So, the compound likely has an -OH group, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, often around 2500-3300, sometimes even broader. Also, the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is typically a strong peak for a carbonyl, like a ketone or maybe an ester. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest maybe a conjugated carbonyl or something like an aromatic ring with a carbonyl, like an aromatic ketone or a conjugated ester. Alternatively, maybe an amide, but amides usually have lower carbonyl peaks, around 1650. But wait, the options don't include nitrogen, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, but the 1700 and 1650 could both be carbonyl groups. But that seems less likely unless it's something like two different carbonyl groups, which might not fit the options. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else, like an aromatic ring vibration or an amine. Let me think. Another possibility is that 1650 is an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a benzene ring with substituents. Wait, no, that's usually around 1450-1600 for C=C stretching. Oh wait, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone adjacent to a double bond. Alternatively, maybe an ester with conjugation.

But then, the NMR part: the 1H NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those
