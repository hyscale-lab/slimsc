Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: We have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = ½ m ω² r². That's a harmonic oscillator potential, right? Because Hooke's law is F = -kx, and the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So here, it's in three dimensions and isotropic, meaning it's the same in all directions.

The question asks about the energy of the third excited state and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for that energy eigenvalue.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. Each energy level depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, in three dimensions, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). But wait, another way is to think in terms of the total quantum number, which is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. 

Wait, but for an isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate, meaning multiple states share the same energy. The energy levels are quantized as E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each state is labeled by n, and the degeneracy (the number of eigenfunctions with the same energy) depends on the number of ways to write n as a sum of three non-negative integers.

So the first excited state would be when n=1, because the ground state is n=0. Wait, no, the ground state is the lowest energy, which is (0 + 0 +0) → n=0, so E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = 3/2 ħω. The first excited state is n=1, which would be, for example, (n_x=1, n_y=0, n_z=0), but the degeneracy increases as n increases.

Wait, the problem is about the third excited state. Let's clarify: The ground
