Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about organic chemistry reactions and NMR spectroscopy. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through step by step.

So, the first part says a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene was dehydrated to form an anhydride. I remember that when a dicarboxylic acid loses water, it forms an anhydride, which has two carbonyl groups. Since the starting material was a cis-alkene, maybe the dehydration leads to a cyclic anhydride? Like, maybe a five-membered ring, which is common for such reactions.

Wait, the anhydride's NMR data is given. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a region where aromatic protons resonate. But wait, this is a dicarboxylic anhydride. Oh wait, unless the anhydride has an aromatic ring. Or maybe it's not aromatic but an exo-methylene group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is such that the protons are deshielded, like near an electron-withdrawing group.

But wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A carbonyl group would be around 170-220 ppm, so the 165 might be a carbonyl. The 137 could be a carbon adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe a double bond. Oh wait, wait. Alternatively, for an anhydride, the carbonyl carbons are usually around 180-200 ppm. Hmm, but the 13C has two peaks, so maybe there are two types of carbons: one being the carbonyl and another possibly a methylene adjacent to it.

Wait, maybe the anhydride is a cyclic structure. Like, if the starting acid was cis, the dehydration would form a five-membered cyclic anhydride. Let's imagine the structure. Suppose the acid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond. Wait, no, that's a single bond. Oh wait, the acid has a cis-alkene, so maybe it's HOOC-CH
