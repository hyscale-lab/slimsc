Okay, so I've got this problem about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

So, the question is about which planet, Planet_1 or Planet_2, is more likely to transit its star from our point of view. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability because they have limited time. 

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. Wait, more precisely, it's about the alignment of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight. But since both planets are already detected via the radial velocity method, we might not be seeing them transit, but the question is about the chance they could transit, which affects how often they'd do so if observed.

Wait, no. The transit method probability is about how likely the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. But in this problem, I think the planets are already known via RV, so their orbits are known, but maybe the question is about the probability of a transit happening during their orbital periods, regardless of our observation time.

Hmm, but the question says they have limited observing time and want to observe the one with the highest probability to transit. So the higher the probability, the better chance of seeing a transit during their observation period.

So, the transit probability (P) is given by the formula P = (R_star) / (a_planet), where R_star is the radius of the host star and a_planet is the semi-major axis (orbital radius) of the planet. But wait, that's not exactly right. I think the formula might involve the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but it's more precise to say that the probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet) divided by (something else?), perhaps. Alternatively, I recall that the probability is roughly (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital radius. But wait, I think it's actually (R*/a) multiplied by a factor involving the inclination. But since we don't know the inclination, the probability is (R*/a) because the geometric probability is R*/(a * (1 - eÂ²)^0.5), but since both have circular orbits (e=0), it's
