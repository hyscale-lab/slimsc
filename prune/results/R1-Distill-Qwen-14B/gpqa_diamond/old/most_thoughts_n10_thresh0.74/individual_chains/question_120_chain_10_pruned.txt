Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. The parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away, and a larger parallax means it's closer.

The question states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution here probably means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So in any volume, there's the same number of stars per unit volume. Wait, but how does that relate to parallax?

Parallax is related to distance. The formula I recall is plx (in parsecs) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So distance d = 1 / plx. So as plx increases, distance decreases—so plx is inversely proportional to distance.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let's say we're looking at a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx. How many stars are in that shell?

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. So, for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume is approximately 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr.

But parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that. So the volume in terms of parallax would be 4π*(1/plx)^2 * (dd). Now, dd is the change in distance, but we're considering a change in parallax dplx. Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume becomes 4π*(1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should express the volume element in terms of plx. Let me think about it. The differential volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πr² dr, where r is the radius (distance). Since r = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx? Wait, that might not be right. Wait, dr is the differential change in distance, which is related to the differential change in parallax.

Let me rephrase. If I have a small change in parallax dplx, how does that relate to the small change in distance dr? Since plx = 1/d, then dplx = -1/d² dr. So solving for dr: dr = -d² dplx. But since d is 1/plx, substituting, dr = -(1/plx)^2 dplx. So dr is proportional to dplx multiplied by plx^-2.

Now, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume and the number density. Let's say the number density is n (stars per unit volume), which is constant because stars are uniformly distributed.

So the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is n multiplied by the volume between those two parallaxes.

So the volume element dV is the volume of the shell between plx and plx + dplx. Wait, no, wait. No, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when plx increases, the distance d decreases. So the shell with a certain plx is a sphere at a certain distance. But I'm looking for the change in the number of stars as plx changes.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the differential number of stars. So the number of stars per unit parallax range (dplx) would be n multiplied by the differential volume at that plx.

But wait, differential volume element in terms of plx. So I think it's better to express the differential volume in terms of plx.

So, the differential volume element dV is 4π d² dr, where d is the distance (d = 1/plx), and dr is
