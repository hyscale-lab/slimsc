Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in various compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? Which usually happens when a molecule has a chiral center, but wait, there's more to it. I remember that even if a compound has a chiral center, sometimes other factors can make it not chiral overall. Like, if there's a plane of symmetry or if it's meso.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, but-1-ene is a double bond between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So when it's 1-chloro, it's Cl attached to the first carbon. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon of the double bond. So the structure is Cl–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2, so Cl–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So the structure is Cl–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3? Wait, but wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be ClCH2–CH2CH2CH3, but wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro would have Cl on C1, which is part of the double bond. So the structure is Cl–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be Cl–CH2–CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the actual structure is Cl–C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, maybe I'm not getting that right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to the same carbon as the double bond. So, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl–CH2–CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible stereocenters. Alternatively, maybe I can think about whether this compound has a chiral center. The molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, that would be 2-chloro, perhaps. Wait, maybe I should draw it. The correct structure for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So the molecule is Cl–C(CH3)=CH2–CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl–CH2–CH2CH2CH3? But with the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, perhaps it's Cl–CH2–CH(CH2CH3) with a double bond. No, maybe I'm just confusing myself. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is (Z)-configuration. But regardless of the configuration, whether it has a chiral center.

Wait, but for a molecule to have optical activity, it needs to have a chiral center or another form of asymmetry. So, is this molecule chiral?

In (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: The structure is Cl–C(CH3)=CH2–CH2? No, wait, the but-1-ene is four carbons with the double bond between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. Then, C2 has a methyl group and is double bonded to C1, which is Cl. So the structure is Cl–C(CH3)=CH2–CH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it ClCH2–CH2CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C1 and C2. So, Cl–CH2–CH2CH2CH3, which is not possible because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe the structure is Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3? No, that's not but-1-ene. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2. No, wait, that would be 2-chloro. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and the rest are CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. Cl is on C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C2 has a methyl group and a double bond. So, the molecule is Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? No, that's five carbons. Wait, but but-1-ene is four, so maybe I'm miscounting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2=CH–CH2–CH3, with Cl on C1. So Cl–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, that would make it CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2, so structure would be CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3 with a double bond? No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe the structure is Cl–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3 with double bond between C1 and C2, making it CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3 but with C1 and C2 double bonded. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a trans or cis isomer, but regardless, for optical activity, a chiral center is needed. So, in this structure, is there a chiral center? Let's see. The first carbon (C1) is attached to Cl, and because it's double bonded, it's connected to two CH2 groups? Or perhaps it's a CH2Cl group. Wait, if C1 is Cl, and double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), then C1 would have Cl, two CH2 groups, and a double bond. So that would give it four substituents, making it a chiral center. Wait, wait, no. Wait, if a carbon is double-bonded, it's only connected to three substituents (since double bonds are two bonds). So C1 is double bonded to C2, so it has Cl, a single bond to which group? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe I should just accept that I'm getting stuck on this and move on, then come back.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that this molecule has a double bond but no chiral centers. So it's not chiral. Because the Cl is on a carbon with a double bond, which doesn't allow for a chiral center. So maybe this compound is not chiral. So it won't exhibit optical activity.

2. The second compound is (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to parse the name. It's a hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. So, the core is an isobenzofuran ring, which is a bicyclic structure with a benzene ring fused to a furan. But hexahydro means it's partially hydrogenated. The substituents are at positions 4 and 7, with a methano bridge (so a CH2 group). The substituent at position 8 is chloromethylene, which is CH2Cl. And the stereochemistry is (3aR,7aS,E). The E configuration indicates the substituents on the double bond are opposite.

Wait, but if the double bond is in a ring, perhaps the E configuration contributes to the molecule's asymmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a bridge that makes it chiral. Hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione probably has a bridge that creates a chiral center. The substituents R and S on the bridge carbons suggest that they are chiral centers. So this molecule would have multiple chiral centers but perhaps also an E double bond configuration. However, for optical activity, the molecule just needs one chiral center. But wait, if the molecule is part of a ring with a double bond that's in a certain configuration, maybe that leads to a plane of symmetry? No, since the substituents (like the chloromethylene) are in specific positions. Wait, the chloromethylene is a substituent on the ring. So, considering the substituents and the bridge, I think this molecule is chiral, so it would exhibit optical activity.

3. The third compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So if it's 2,3-dimethyl, then the two middle carbons (C2 and C3) each have a methyl group. The (R,S) configuration on these carbons. Now, I need to determine if this is a meso compound. Let's imagine the structure: the molecule is HOOC-C(R)(CH3)-CH2-COOH? No, wait, succinic acid has four carbons: COOH-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with two methyl groups on C2 and C3. Wait, but if the two chiral centers are R and S, respectively, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me think. The molecule would look like:

COOH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, with R configuration on C2 and S on C3. Wait, but wait, if it's (2R,3S), would that create a plane of symmetry? Let's draw it in my mind. Let's consider the structure:

Positions: 1 (COOH), 2 (CH(CH3)), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (COOH). Wait, no, wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When you have 2 and 3 substituted, the four positions would be:

1: COOH, 2: CH2, 3: CH2, 4: COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would make positions 2 and 3 each have a methyl group. So 2R and 3S: the stereocenters are on C2 and C3.

Wait, but maybe this is a meso compound. Because if the configuration is R and S, but arranged in a way that the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry. Suppose the two stereocenters are mirror images. So, for example, if C2 is R and C3 is S, but arranged symmetrically.

Let me imagine the molecule: The two central carbons (C2 and C3) each have a methyl group and are connected to each other. The groups on C2 are: CH3, COOH (from C1), CH2- (to C3), and the hydrogen. Similarly, C3 has CH3, COOH (from C4), CH2- (to C2), and a hydrogen. Wait, but the configuration is (2R,3S). So when you look at C2, the substituents are COOH (C1), CH3, CH2-COOH (from C3 and C4), and H. For C3, substituents are COOH (C4), CH3, CH2-COOH (from C2 and C1), and H. So, if the configurations are R on C2 and S on C3, perhaps the molecule is not meso because the arrangement isn't symmetric.

Wait, but if you mirror the molecule across the center between C2 and C3, the configurations would swap. So, if C2 is R, then C3 would become S. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. But wait, the configurations are R and S. So in that case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and be achiral, right? Because the two stereocenters are mirror images of each other. That would make it a meso compound and thus not optically active.

Wait, but in the compound given, the configurations are (2R,3S). If the molecule is symmetric, then the mirror image would have (2S,3R), which isn't the same as the original. So if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. So let me think: if the two chiral centers are arranged symmetrically, so that the entire molecule is symmetric upon reflection, then it's meso.

But in this case, the configurations are R and S. So if the molecule is symmetric, then the two centers would be mirror images. So for example, if C2 is R, then C3 would be S, but that would be symmetric. So yes, the molecule would be meso. Therefore, it's not chiral, so no optical activity.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. If the two stereocenters have opposite configurations, then perhaps the molecule is not meso. Wait, no. The meso condition is when the molecule has a plane of symmetry and the stereocenters are mirror images, leading to the molecule being superimposable on its mirror image. So in this case, if the two stereocenters are (R,S), then when you mirror the molecule, their configurations would swap, making the mirror image of the molecule the same as the original. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and be a meso compound, thus not chiral. Therefore, this compound wouldn't exhibit optical activity.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think of another example: tartaric acid. (+)-tartaric acid is dextrorotatory, (-)-meso is optically inactive. Wait, no: meso-tartaric acid is actually the meso form, which is optically inactive because it's its own mirror image. So, in this case, the (2R,3S) configuration would be a meso compound because of the internal symmetry. So yes, this compound would not be chiral, so it's not optically active.

Wait, but wait. Let's consider the arrangement. If C2 is R and C3 is S, but the substituents on the two chiral centers are the same, then the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. So, for example, if the groups on C2 are CH3, H, COOH (from C1), and CH2 (to C3), and on C3 are CH3, H, COOH (from C4), and CH2 (to C2), then the arrangement would mirror, making it a meso compound. So yes, this compound is a meso form, so no optical activity.

4. The fourth compound is (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So again, it's succinic acid with methyl groups on C2 and C3, but this time both are R configuration. So, the question is whether this is a meso compound or not.

In this case, the configurations are both R. So, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, would this make it a meso compound? Let's see. If you look at the molecule, if you mirror it along the central plane between C2 and C3, then C2's configuration would become S, and C3's would become R. But since both are R, the mirrored molecule would have (2S,3R), which is different from the original (2R,3R). Therefore, the mirror image isn't the same as the original, so the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's a chiral compound, so it will exhibit optical activity.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let's think: For meso compounds, the mirror image must be the same as the original. So if the original is (2R,3R), then the mirror image would be (2S,3S), which is different. So the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, so it's not a meso compound. Therefore, it is chiral and would exhibit optical activity.

5. The fifth compound is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So, it's a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4 (I think). The configuration is R. Now, cyclohexene rings can have axial or equatorial substituents, but the key here is whether the OH group is in a chiral center. In this case, C1 has four different substituents: the ring (with a double bond at C3), an OH group, and two other substituents (like CH2 groups). So, it's a chiral center. Therefore, this compound is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait. The cyclohexene ring: if the substituents are arranged such that C1 is attached to the ring (which is a cyclohexene), the OH group, and two CH2 groups (from the ring), then yes, it's a chiral center. So, yes, this compound is chiral.

6. The sixth compound is (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So, a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. All three s configurations. Now, I need to determine if this molecule is chiral. How many stereocenters are there? Three. But does the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

In cyclohexane, if you have substituents at 1,3,5 positions, and all are the same configuration (s), does that create a plane of symmetry? Let me think about the structure. Let's imagine the chair conformation. If all three OH groups are axial in the same direction (like all axial down), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, all being the same configuration (s), the molecule might be achiral. Because of the symmetry. Let me imagine flipping the molecule. If the substituents are placed such that the molecule is symmetric, then it would be a meso compound or have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not. Let's think about whether the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry. For example, if all the substituents are in the same position relative to the ring, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, suppose the three OH groups are all on the same face of the ring (like all axial up), then the molecule would be symmetric across the plane that passes through the center of the ring and the midpoints of the opposite edges. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it wouldn't exhibit optical activity.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, the molecule could be chiral. But with three substituents at 1,3,5, it's more likely that the molecule has some symmetry.

Wait, another approach: the molecule has three stereocenters, but whether it's a meso compound. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the mirror image identical, then it's achiral. So, if the (1s,3s,5s) configuration is symmetric, then it's a meso form.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged asymmetrically despite the numbering. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to visualize. If you imagine the cyclohexane ring, with OH groups on 1,3,5, all in the same configuration (s), does that produce a symmetric structure? For example, if all OH groups are on the same side (axial), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, in that case, the molecule is not chiral. Therefore, it wouldn't exhibit optical activity.

But wait, another thought. If the substituents on 1,3,5 are in a way that their positions mirror each other, but their configurations make the molecule chiral. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because the arrangement is symmetric. So I'll tentatively say it's not chiral and thus not optically active.

But wait, I'm not confident. Let me think again. Suppose the three substituents are arranged in a trigonal symmetric fashion on the ring. Then, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So yes, the molecule is not chiral.

7. The seventh compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure is (cyclopentyl)–CH2–C(O)–CH(CH3)–CH2–? Wait, butan-1-one means the ketone is on C1. So the structure is cyclopentyl–C(O)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– something? Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3–CO–, but the substituents are on C1. So structure would be:

Cyclopentyl group attached to C1, which is a ketone (CO), then followed by CH2, CH(CH3), and another CH2? Or wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO. No, butanone is (CH3)2CO, but that's 2-butanone. Wait, butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO, but that would require four carbons. So perhaps the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, wait, the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So the structure is:

CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl? No, wait, butan-1-one would be R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as:

The ketone is on C1, so the structure is (cyclopentyl)–CO–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Butan-1-one is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, butan-1-one would be: 

O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2– ?

Wait, but that's five carbons. No, butan-1-one is four carbons with the ketone on C1. So structure is O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2–R, where R is a cyclopentyl group?

Wait, the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So butan-1-one is O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2–. So substituents are at C3 (methyl) and C1 (cyclopentyl). So the structure would be:

O=C–(cyclopentyl) –CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2CO, but the carbonyl is on C1. So butan-1-one is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2–, where R is attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C–(CH2)–CH(CH3)–CH2–cyclopentyl?

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl, then two more CH2 groups, and a CH(CH3) group. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps it's better to think about whether this molecule has a chiral center. Let's see: does it have any carbon with four different substituents?

The ketone is on C1, so C1 is attached to the carbonyl group, the cyclopentyl group, and two CH2 groups. So, C1 would have substituents: carbonyl, cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups. So, that's three different groups, but wait, the two CH2 groups may be similar. So C1 would have carbonyl, cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups. So, if the two CH2 groups are identical, then C1 isn't a chiral center. Wait, but in this case, perhaps the substituents are:

CO, cyclopentyl, CH2–CH(CH3), and CH2–CH2–something? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CO–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–. So the carbonyl is at C1, then a cyclopentyl group, then a CH2, then a CH(CH3), then another CH2.

Wait, butan means four carbons in the chain. So butan-1-one would have the carbonyl on C1. So the structure is:

CO–R–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–?

Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

Butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2CO. But with substituents. So, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be:

CO–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

Wait, but butan-1-one is: CH2CH2CH2CO. So with substituents:

C1: CO
C2: CH2
C3: CH(CH3)
C4: CH2 cyclopentyl?

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

Cyclopentyl–CO–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– ?

No, that can't be right because butan-1-one is four carbons with CO on C1. So the structure would be:

CO–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–cyclopentyl.

So the carbonyl is on C1, then the substituents are CH2 (C2), which connects to C3 (CH(CH3)), which connects to C4 (CH2–cyclopentyl).

So, the substituents on each carbon:

C1: CO, CH2 (to C2), and two other bonds? Wait, C1 is carbonyl, so it's O=C–, attached to CH2– groups. So C1 isn't a stereocenter because it's double-bonded to O. So, are any other carbons chiral?

Looking at C2: It's CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–cyclopentyl. So C3 is CH(CH3), which is connected to C2, C4, and two CH2 groups? Wait, perhaps C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and another group? Wait, but for a chiral center, a carbon must have four different groups. So, let's look at C3.

If C3 is connected to:

- CH2 from C2,
- CH(CH3),
- CH2 from C4,
- and the cyclopentyl group from C4?

No, perhaps:

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the structure:

C1: O=C–
C2: –CH2–
C3: –CH(CH3)–
C4: –CH2– (connected to cyclopentyl)

Wait, but that's the chain. So C3 is CH(CH3) connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and a hydrogen. So, the substituents on C3 are:

- CH2– (from C2),
- CH2– (from C4),
- CH(CH3),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, that's not four different substituents. Because the two CH2 groups are the same. So C3 doesn't have four different groups; it's attached to two CH2 groups, which are identical. Therefore, C3 is not a chiral center.

C2 is CH2, so it's connected to C1 (CO), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two Hs. So no, C2 isn't a chiral center. C4 is CH2 connected to C3 (CH(CH3)), and the cyclopentyl group. But again, C4 has two CH2 groups, so not a chiral center.

So, this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it's not optically active.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: maybe the cyclopentyl group is attached to C4. So the structure is O=C–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–cyclopentyl. In that case, C4 has substituents: CH2– (from C3), cyclopentyl, two Hs? No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–cyclopentyl. So, in that case, C4 is connected to CH2 from C3, cyclopentyl, and two Hs. So, no chiral centers. So, the molecule isn't chiral and won't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. If the cyclopentyl group is attached to C1, as in O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–, then C1 would have CO, cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups. So, three substituents, but wait, CO is double-bonded, so C1 isn't a stereocenter.

So, the molecule has no chiral centers. So, no optical activity.

Now, let's count how many of these compounds are optically active.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Not chiral (no chiral center due to double bond). So no.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Chiral. So yes.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso, so no.

4. (2R,3R)-... : Chiral. So yes.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral. So yes.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Symmetric, so no.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No chiral centers, so no.

So, the ones that are optically active are compounds 2,4,5. That's three.

Wait, wait. Let me recount:

Compound 2: yes.

Compound 4: yes.

Compound5: yes.

So that's three. Therefore, the answer would be option B (3).

Wait, but let me double-check each decision.

1. Double bond, no chiral center. So no.

2. Has bridge and substituents leading to chiral centers. So yes.

3. Meso, so no.

4. Both R, so not meso, thus yes.

5. Yes.

6. Symmetric, so no.

7. No chiral centers, so no.

Yes, three compounds. So the answer is B.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it has at least one chiral center or another form of asymmetry (e.g., a lack of internal symmetry). Below is the analysis for each compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This compound has a double bond, and the carbon attached to the double bond (C1) is not a chiral center because it is double-bonded and does not have four distinct substituents. Therefore, it is not chiral and does not exhibit optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This compound has a bicyclic structure with a bridge and substituents that create chiral centers. The stereochemistry (3aR,7aS) confirms the presence of chirality. Thus, this compound is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral because they are superimposable on their mirror images. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound also has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, unlike the meso form, this compound lacks a plane of symmetry. The configurations (2R,3R) do not create internal symmetry, making the molecule chiral and optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This compound has a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group on C1. The carbon at C1 is a chiral center because it has four distinct substituents: the hydroxyl group, the ring, and two different hydrogens. Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5 of a cyclohexane ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the trigonal arrangement of the hydroxyl groups, making it achiral. Thus, it does not exhibit optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This compound has a ketone group on C1 and a cyclopentyl group on C4. None of the carbons in the molecule have four distinct substituents, so there are no chiral centers. Therefore, this compound is not chiral and does not exhibit optical activity.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are:
- Compound 2: Chiral due to its bicyclic structure and stereochemistry.
- Compound 4: Chiral due to the absence of internal symmetry.
- Compound 5: Chiral due to the presence of a chiral center at C1.

Thus, **three compounds** exhibit optical activity.
