Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that we have a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then, there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. We need to figure out which two compounds from the given options are present.

First, I need to think about the structures of the given compounds and how they would appear in an NMR spectrum.

The options are:
A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene

Wait, all the options are combinations of tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Hmm, but 1,4-diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups. Let me think about its structure. That would be benzene with two ethyl groups at the 1 and 4 positions. So, each ethyl is a -CH2CH3 group.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The aromatic protons are showing two singlets at around 6.7 ppm. In a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes its own set of signals. So each compound must have equivalent aromatic protons that sum up to a singlet in their own NMR, but when mixed, they appear as two separate singlets.

Wait, but wait. The question says the mixture shows two signals in a 1:1 ratio. So each signal integrates to one proton each? Or each integrates to some amount, but overall the ratio is 1:1. Because it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes equally to the NMR signals. Wait, no, the ratio of the signals is 1:1, but each NMR signal's integral is based on the number of protons in each compound.

Wait, the question says the two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm are in a 1:1 ratio. So each singlet has the same area, meaning each contributes equally. Since the mixture is 1:1, each compound contributes the same number of protons for each peak.

Wait, but each aromatic compound would have a certain number of equivalent protons. Let me think about each possible compound.

Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, no, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene? Wait, maybe I should draw them.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. So the structure is benzene with four methyl groups adjacent. Wait, no, positions 1,2,3,4 are adjacent in a ring? Wait, 1 is next to 2, which is next to 3, then 4 is next to 1? Or is it 1,2,3,4 arranged in a way that's a para arrangement?

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the substituents. Let me think about each structure.

First, 1,2,3,4-tetram
