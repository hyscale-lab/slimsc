Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question says that a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The mass of A times c squared is 300 MeV. We need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, first, I remember that in annihilation processes, matter and antimatter particles (like protons and antiprotons here) annihilate each other and convert their mass into energy, often producing other particles. So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The products are these two A+ and two A- particles.

I think I should start by figuring out the conservation laws. Since this is a closed system, the total energy and momentum should be conserved. Also, charge must be conserved. Let's see, the initial charge: proton has +e, antiproton has -e. So total initial charge is zero. The products are 2A+ and 2A-, so total charge is 2(+1) + 2(-1) = 0. So charge is conserved, which makes sense.

Now, for energy and momentum. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I guess it's moving at non-relativistic speeds. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So we can approximate its kinetic energy as (1/2)mvÂ². But wait, protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So m_p = m_anti_p = m_p. Let's denote m_p as the mass of the proton.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the initial kinetic energy is small compared to their rest mass energy. The rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV, I think. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much less than this, but the rest energy is still significant.

But wait, the annihilation process will release energy, which is converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the produced particles. So the initial total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can approximate that the initial kinetic energy is small, but the rest energy is still important. Let me think about the initial setup.

The initial particles are a
