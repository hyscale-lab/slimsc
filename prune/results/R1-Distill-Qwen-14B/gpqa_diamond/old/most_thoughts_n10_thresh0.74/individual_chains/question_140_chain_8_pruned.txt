Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W and forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B is probably a solid at room temperature but melts just above that. 

Also, it mentions that gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, so the molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Wait, neutrons and protons are in the nucleus, but the question refers to the molecule. Oh, wait, maybe it's talking about each molecule's constituent atoms. Or perhaps it's talking about each atom in the molecule having equal protons and neutrons. Let me think.

Wait, if W is a gas when released, perhaps it's a common gas. For example, H2, O2, N2, CO2, etc. But the key is that each molecule's atoms have equal protons and neutrons. Let's see: for example, H has 1 proton, but depending on the isotope, neutrons can be 0, 1, etc. So for hydrogen (protium), the lightest isotope has 0 neutrons. But maybe looking for an atom where protons = neutrons. So like carbon-12: 6 protons, 6 neutrons. Or oxygen-16: 8 protons, 8 neutrons. But wait, the gas could be CO2, but the molecule as a whole wouldn't have same protons and neutrons. Oh wait, no, the question says the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule of W, the total neutrons equals the total protons.

Wait, but in a molecule, each atom contributes to the total. So, for instance, if W is H2O, each H has 1 proton and 0 or 1 neutrons, and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the total protons would be 2 (from H) + 8 (O) = 10. The total neutrons would be (each H: 0 or 1) plus O's 8. If H is protium, that's 0,
