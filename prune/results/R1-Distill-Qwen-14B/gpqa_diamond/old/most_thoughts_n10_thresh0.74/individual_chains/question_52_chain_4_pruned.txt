Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right. So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels, and when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless versus when it has spots.

Wait, so in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energy levels, and T is the temperature.

The problem says that the transition between these levels corresponds to about 1448 Ã…. Wait, that's in the ultraviolet, I think. But maybe that's a red herring because the question is about the ratio, which depends on the temperature.

So when the star doesn't have spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When it has spots covering 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But wait, does the presence of spots lower the overall Teff because the spots are cooler? I remember that dark spots on a star are actually cooler regions, so they emit less. But when they cover a part of the star, the overall effective temperature of the star (as seen from afar) would decrease because a fraction of the surface is emitting less.

Wait, but in the question, when 40% is covered, the effective temperature goes to 5500 K. So the star's overall Teff is lower because the spots are cooler. But how does that affect the photosphere?

Wait, the question is about the photosphere. The Ti atoms are in the photosphere. So perhaps the
