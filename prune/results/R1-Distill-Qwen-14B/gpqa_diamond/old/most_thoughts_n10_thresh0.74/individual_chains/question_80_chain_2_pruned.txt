Okay, so I've got this science question here about an algorithm that converts DNA sequences into numbers. Hmm, the examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. And I need to find out what ACAGTGACC gives. The options are A) 315, B)185, C)333, D)351.

Let me think. I remember that DNA is made up of four nucleotides: A, T, C, G. Each has a corresponding value, maybe like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4? Or perhaps another numbering. Wait, but the outputs are much larger than that. So maybe each nucleotide contributes more than one point.

Wait another thought: maybe each nucleotide's value is multiplied by a certain factor based on its position. Like, the first nucleotide is multiplied by 1, the next by 2, and so on. Let me try that.

Looking at the first example, AGG. So A is first, G is second, G is third. If A is 1, G is 4. Then the calculation would be (1 * 1) + (4 * 2) + (4 *3) = 1 + 8 +12 =21. But the output is 115. Hmm, that's way off. So maybe each nucleotide is assigned a different value, not 1,2,3,4.

Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide is converted to a number, and then summed. Let's see. For AGG, the sum would be A + G + G. If A is 1, G is 4: 1+4+4=9, but output is 115. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe each base is assigned to a different digit. Like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4 as before. Then the entire string is treated as a base-5 number. Because each digit can be 0-4, but wait our bases are 1-4. So maybe it's a base-5 number where each digit is 1-4, not 0-4. But how?

Let me try the first example again. AGG is a 3-letter sequence. Let's see: A=1, G=4, G=4. So in base 5, that would be digits 1,4,4. So the number would be 1*5^2 +4*5 +4. That's 25 +20 +4=49. But the output is 115. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps each nucleotide's value is multiplied by a position factor, but not necessarily the position. Like, maybe the first position is 1, second is 10, third is 100, etc. So it's a positional numbering system where each position is a higher power.

Let me think again: AGG is the input. If each letter is converted to a number (A=1, G=4), then AGG would be 1,4,4. If we treat this as a number in base 10, but each digit represents A, C, G, T as digits. Hmm, but that doesn't make much sense because the numbers are higher.

Alternatively
