Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a transgenic mouse model where they're trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein. They modified the gene to include the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with the plasmid using Lipofectamine and are trying to express the protein. But the overexpression isn't happening as expected. They checked the plus strand sequence and found something wrong.

The options are A to D, each suggesting a different reason why the protein isn't being expressed.

First, I need to look at the given DNA sequence to see if there's anything obviously wrong. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's good. Let me scan through the sequence.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it should be the first part of the protein. Let me see where the HA sequence would be. HA is a small peptide derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin. The most common HA tag is 10 amino acids long, but sometimes it's shorter. The coding sequence would be after the start codon. Let me check the first part of the given DNA.

The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Wait, wait a second. ATG is Met. Next is TAC, which is Tyr. Then CCA is Pro, TAC is Tyr again. So the first few amino acids would be Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, etc. If the HA tag is supposed to be added, the HA coding sequence should come after the start codon, right?

But in the given sequence, I don't see any HA tag. Wait, wait, the HA is part of the construct. Oh wait, did they add the HA sequence correctly? Let me think about how the HA tag is added. The HA sequence is inserted into the gene so that it's at the N-terminus of the protein. So the first part of the coding sequence should be the HA coding.
