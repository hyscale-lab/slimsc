Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think it through.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The problem is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each with different values for v_rel and E.

Alright, first, I need to remember how to calculate relative velocity in special relativity because, at high speeds like a significant fraction of the speed of light, classical addition doesn't work anymore. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity u' is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²), where u and v are the velocities of the two objects as observed from a common frame.

Wait, but wait. Which object are we taking as the frame of reference? In this case, I think the relative speed is the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's perspective. So, let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). That's (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3c²/c²). Oh wait, c squared over c squared is 1, so 0.3 is (0.5*0.6). So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' = (-0.1)/0.7 c. Which is approximately -0.1428c. Since speed is positive, the magnitude is 0.1428c. Hmm, so about 0.14c. That seems right.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that part's sorted for the relative speed.

Next, the total energy of the system. So each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. But wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system" — but are they considering their rest masses plus kinetic energy, or just the rest mass
