Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in various compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which requires at least one chiral center, I remember. But wait, there's more to it. Some structures might have symmetry that cancels out chirality, like meso compounds.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure here is CH2=CH-C(Cl)(CH3)? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl, but that's 1-chloro-1-butene? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be CH2Cl connected to the first carbon. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait but it's but-1-ene, so CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Wait, wait, but the substituents are 1-chloro and 2-methyl. So, structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but 2-methyl would mean a CH(CH3) on C2.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The but-1-ene part is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. Then 1-chloro is on the first carbon: Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded. So the structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, that's probably not right. Let me draw it.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second. So the molecule is Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2? No,
