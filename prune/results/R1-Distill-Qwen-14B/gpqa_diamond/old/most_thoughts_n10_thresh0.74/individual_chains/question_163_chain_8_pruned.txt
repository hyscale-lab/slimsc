Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these types of questions. But let's take it step by step. The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. I remember that when a metal hydroxide reacts with an acid, it typically forms a salt and water. So, the first thing I need to figure out is the reaction equation.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think, because it's a hydroxide of a transition metal. When it reacts with a strong monobasic acid, like HCl or H2SO4, but wait, the acid is monobasic, so it can only donate one proton. Oh right, monobasic means it has one H+ per molecule. So examples are HCl, HNO3, etc.

The reaction should look something like this: Fe(OH)3 + H+ → Fe^3+ + H2O. But wait, actually, since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it would react with the acid to form Fe^3+ ions. So the balanced equation should be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So for every mole of Fe(OH)3, we need three moles of H+ ions. But wait, the acid is monobasic, so each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. So, to dissolve one mole of Fe(OH)3, I need three moles of acid.

But wait, first, how much Fe(OH)3 are we dealing with? The problem states 0.1 grams. So I need to find out the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Let me calculate that.

Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). So 55.85 + 3*(17) because each OH- is 16 + 1 =17. Let's see: 3*17 is 51, plus 55.85 gives 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g /
