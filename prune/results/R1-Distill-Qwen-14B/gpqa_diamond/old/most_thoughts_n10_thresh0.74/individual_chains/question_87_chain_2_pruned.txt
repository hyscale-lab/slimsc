Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and understand what it's asking.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Oh wait, the ring is 6-membered, and it's a di-substituted aromatic compound. So, let's think about the possible substituents.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the molecule must have both a carbonyl group and a halogen attached to an aromatic ring.

Wait, but the compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. The benzene ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Let's see. Di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring.

Since one substituent is a carbonyl group, that could be something like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or amide. But considering the other substituent is a halogen. So, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, I).

Wait, but let me think about the structure. The two substituents on the benzene ring would add up to 2 carbons. Let's count: if one substituent is a halogen, that's 0 carbons (since Cl, Br, etc., are substituents without carbons). So the other substituent would have to be 2 carbons. So maybe a carbonyl group attached with two carbons.

Wait, maybe it's something like an acyl group attached to the ring. For example, an acetophenone derivative. Acetophenone is a benzene ring with a ketone group (COCH3), but that's only 1 substituent. Wait, but the compound is di-substituted, so there's another substituent, which is a halogen.

Wait, but wait. Let's count. Benzene (6 carbons) + substituent 1 (X, like Cl: 0 carbons) + substituent 2 (maybe a carbonyl group with one carbon, like a ketone R-CO-R').

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The molecule has 8
