Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. So the period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, looking at their radial velocity (RV) curves, system_1 has variations with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s for the two stars. System_2 has amplitudes of 15 and 10 km/s.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So I need to find the mass ratio, system_1 mass divided by system_2 mass.

Wait, I remember that in binary systems, the radial velocity amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars. The formula I recall is that the velocity amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the mass of the star. Because the more massive star would move slower, right? Like in our solar system, Jupiter has a bigger orbit but the Sun doesn't move much because of Jupiter's gravity.

The formula I think is K1/K2 = (M2 sin i)/(M1 sin i), assuming the same inclination angle i. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh yeah, Kepler's third law comes into play here as well. Because the period is involved.

Kepler's third law in binary systems relates the sum of the masses to the cube of the semi-major axis (or period). The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) * a³. But maybe here, the period is given, so perhaps the key is to relate the masses through their velocities and the period.

Alternatively, another approach: the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the mass ratio. So, for a binary system, the more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude. So if the velocities are K1 and K2, then (M1 + M2) is the total mass, and M1/M2 = K2/K1. Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, from the center of mass condition. So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, that makes sense. The more massive star has a smaller velocity. So for system
