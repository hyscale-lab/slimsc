Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this involves some quantum mechanics concepts, specifically angular momentum, spin, isospin, and parity conservation. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. We need to find out which partial wave is not permitted based on the given conditions.

Wait, the question mentions Pauli statistics, which I think relates to the requirement for the wavefunction to be antisymmetric under exchange of identical particles. Oh right, but in this case, the emitted particle X might not be a nucleon. Wait, particle X is emitted, so it's a third particle. So the system would be NN + X.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse this. The notation is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0. So 2S+1 =1 means S=0. So S=0, L is in spectroscopic notation: S corresponds to L=0, P is L=1, D is L=2, F=3, etc. So 1S0 would mean S=0, L=0, J=0. So the NN system is in a state with spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, and total angular momentum 0.

They emit a particle X. So the initial state is the NN in 1S0 state, and the final state is NN' + X, where NN' is the new state after emission. But wait, the problem says the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. T is the isospin. So T=0 for the final NN state.

The condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, I'm a bit confused about what S, L, and T represent here. S would be the spin, L the orbital angular momentum, and T the isospin. So T = S + L +1 mod 2.

Wait, the problem says Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So for the final state, T_final
