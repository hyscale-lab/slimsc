Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the collider when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we can't just use classical mechanics. So I'll probably need to use the relativistic energy equations. The problem is asking for the kinetic energy, I think, because that's what colliders typically provide to their particles.

Wait, the question says the energy of RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. So I'm guessing it's the kinetic energy of the nucleus. But wait, sometimes in these problems, people get confused between total energy and kinetic energy. Let me make sure.

The total energy of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The kinetic energy (K) is the total energy minus the rest mass energy, so K = (γ - 1)mc².

So I need to find the kinetic energy, right? Because the problem is about the energy of the collider, which would be the kinetic energy imparted to the nuclei.

Alright, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. So, Li (lithium) usually has 3 protons. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Actually, the isotope is Li-6, I think. Because Li has atomic number 3, so 3
