Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, I remember that metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Ring-closing metathesis specifically forms a ring by connecting two alkenes. 

The product we're given is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me try to visualize that structure. So, cyclohexene ring, with substituents. The substituents are at positions 3,4,5. Oh wait, 3 and 4 are methyl groups, and 5 is isopropyl. And the double bond is at position 1.

Wait, the naming might be a bit tricky. So cyclohex-1-ene has the double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Positions 3,4 have methyl groups, and position 5 has an isopropyl group.

To form this via ring-closing metathesis, we need two alkenes that can come together. Metathesis typically breaks and reforms double bonds. So, the starting material would be an octadiene, I think. Because when two alkenes undergo metathesis, they form a ring, so the starting diene would have two double bonds or perhaps a diene that can break and form a ring.

Wait, ring-closing metathesis usually starts with a diene and another diene or an alkene and an alkyne? No, more likely, the starting material is a diene that can form a ring upon metathesis. Alternatively
