Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and mass and spring constant. But since this is relativistic, things get a bit more complicated because of special relativity effects. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the problem states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. We're looking for the maximum speed v_max. The options involve expressions with c, the speed of light, which tells me we're definitely considering relativistic effects here.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA². When the mass is at the equilibrium position (x=0), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², which simplifies to v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is the non-relativistic case. The question is about the relativistic scenario, so option C is probably not the right answer here.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The kinetic energy in relativity isn't just (1/2)mv²; it's higher because of the gamma factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, in the relativistic case, the total energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Let me recall the expressions.

The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest mass energy (mc²) and the potential energy at maximum displacement, right? Because at maximum displacement, the mass isn't moving, so its kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy is maximum. Then, when it passes through the equilibrium point, all that potential energy is converted into kinetic energy (which would be the relativistic kinetic energy).

So, the potential energy stored is (1/2)kA². The total energy E is then E = mc² + (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point, the kinetic energy is E_kinetic = (gamma - 1)mc². Because in relativity, the total energy is gamma times mc², which equals rest energy plus kinetic energy (E = gamma mc² = mc² + K).

Wait, let me clarify: The total energy E should always be the same, whether the mass is at maximum displacement or passing through equilibrium. At maximum displacement, the oscillator is at rest (v=0), so all the energy is potential. But wait, no, because in the relativistic scenario, is potential energy treated the same way? Hmm, I might be getting confused here. Maybe I should approach this differently.

In a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². At maximum amplitude A, x = A, so the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The total energy of the system is then the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium position, x=0, so the potential energy is zero, and the energy is all kinetic. The kinetic energy in relativity is given by E_kinetic = (gamma - 1) mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Setting E_total equal to E_kinetic at equilibrium:
mc² + (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc² + mc²

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because the rest energy is already included in the total energy. Let me correct that.

At equilibrium, the total energy is the kinetic energy. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA² (since that's the potential at max displacement) must equal the kinetic energy at equilibrium plus rest energy. Wait, no. Wait, the total energy should be the same in all points of the motion.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, in the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved. But in the relativistic case, how does that work? Because kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't correct.

Alternative approach: Using the equation of motion. The relativistic harmonic oscillator equation might be different. The force is F = -kx. But relativistic mechanics replaces momentum p with gamma m v, so F = d(p)/dt = d(gamma m v)/dt. But solving that differential equation might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the energy approach is better.

Wait, suppose the maximum speed v_max occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². So maybe:

At amplitude A: potential energy is (1/2)kA², kinetic energy is 0. So total energy E = (1/2)kA².

But wait, that can't be right because the rest mass energy is mc². Oh wait, I might have made a mistake. The rest energy is part of the system's total energy, so perhaps the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy.

No, that doesn't make sense. Because the potential energy is due to the position in the field, not the rest mass. So maybe the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At equilibrium, the potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic and rest energy. Wait, but the rest energy is part of the system, so the kinetic energy would be E = (gamma) mc². But how?

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the conservation of energy correctly. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energy and the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential). So, E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point, all the mechanical energy is kinetic, so E_total = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy. Kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma - 1) mc². So:

E_total = mc² + (gamma -1) mc² = gamma mc².

So,

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Dividing both sides by mc²,

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Let me denote kA²/(2 mc²) as a term to simplify, say, let x = (kA²)/(2 mc²). Then,

gamma = 1 + x.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + x.

Rearranging,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + x).

Then square both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + x)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2.

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2:

1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 = [ (1 + x)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + x)^2.

Expanding (1 + x)^2 = 1 + 2x + x², so numerator becomes 2x + x².

So,

v²/c² = (2x + x²) / (1 + x)^2.

But x is (kA²)/(2 mc²). Let me plug that in:

x = (kA²)/(2 mc²).

So,

v²/c² = [ 2*(kA²/(2 mc²)) + (kA²/(2 mc²))² ] / [ (1 + (kA²/(2 mc²)) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator:

2x = (2)(kA²/(2 mc²)) )= (kA²)/(mc²).

x² = (kA²)^2/(4 m^2 c^4).

So numerator becomes:

(kA²/(mc²)) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) = [4 m c² (k A²) + k² A^4 ] / (4 m² c^4)

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to factor out terms.

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor x from numerator:

Numerator = x (2 + x) = x (2 + x).

Denominator is (1 + x)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [x (2 + x) ] / (1 + x)^2.

Hmm. Let me compute this expression.

But what is x in terms of kA and m? x = kA²/(2 mc²).

So,

v² = c² * [ x (2 + x) ] / (1 + x)^2.

Hmm, I'm not sure if this can be simplified further. Let's see. Let me write it as:

v² = c² * [ (kA²/(2 mc²)) ( 2 + (kA²/(2 mc²)) ) ] / [ (1 + (kA²/(2 mc²)) )^2 ]

Expanding numerator:

kA²/(2 mc²) * [2 + (kA²/(2 mc²))] = [kA²/(2 mc²)] * [ (4 mc² + kA² )/(2 mc²) ) ]

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me compute 2 + x, where x = kA²/(2 mc²):

2 + x = (4 mc² + kA² )/(2 mc²).

So,

v² = c² * [ x (2 + x) ] / ( (1 + x)^2 )

= c² * [ (kA²/(2 mc²)) * (4 mc² + kA²)/(2 mc²) ) ] / [ (1 + kA²/(2 mc²) )^2 ]

Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express 1 - v²/c² in terms of x.

We had:

gamma = 1 + x,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²),

so,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + x),

so,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + x)^2.

Then,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2,

so,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 )

Which can be written as:

v = c * sqrt( [ (1 + x)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + x)^2 )

= c * sqrt( (1 + 2x + x² - 1 ) / (1 + x)^2 )

= c * sqrt( (2x + x² ) / (1 + x)^2 )

= c * sqrt( x (2 + x) ) / (1 + x )

But x is (kA²)/(2 m c² ), so substituting:

x = (kA²) / (2 m c² )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (kA²/(2 m c² )) ( 2 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) ) ] ) / [ 1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) ]

Hmm, perhaps this can be simplified.

Let me factor the numerator inside the sqrt:

(kA²/(2 m c² )) (2 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) ) = [kA²/(2 m c² )] * [ (4 m c² + kA²) / (2 m c² ) ) ]

Wait, that's getting too complicated, perhaps it's better to just express the final expression in terms of x. But looking at the options, the expressions are in terms of (1 - (kA²)/(2 m c² )) or similar terms.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Another approach: The relativistic energy equation. The total energy is E = gamma mc². The potential energy is (1/2)k x², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So, when the particle is at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)k A² + mc². At equilibrium, when x=0, the potential energy is zero, so E = gamma mc².

So,

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Which gives gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

So,

gamma = 1 + x, where x = (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Then,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + x.

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + x.

Square both sides:

1 / (1 - v²/c² ) = (1 + x )².

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 +x )^2.

Which gives,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 +x )^2.

So,

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 ].

Which can be written as,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 ).

But looking at the options, I don't see this expression. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) )^2 )

Which matches what I have here. Because x is (kA²)/(2 m c² ).

So, substituting x into option D:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + x )]^2 )

Which is exactly the expression I derived.

Let me see what the other options are.

Option A: c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m ))^2 ) )

Hmm, denominator in the fraction is 1 - (kA²/(2m)), which doesn't match.

Option B: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c² )) ) )

Hmm, denominator is 1 - (kA²/(2 m c² )) ), which doesn't match.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, so we can ignore it.

So, the correct answer must be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and spring constant \( k \), we consider the conservation of energy. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At equilibrium (where the oscillator has maximum speed), the total energy is purely kinetic. In relativistic mechanics, the total energy is related to the velocity by:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( E_{\text{total}} \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so:

\[
\gamma = 1 + x.
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we substitute:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + x.
\]

Rearranging, we solve for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + x}, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we get:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m}\right)^2}} \) — Incorrect, as the denominator does not match the derived expression.
- **Option B**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)}} \) — Incorrect, as the structure of the expression does not match.
- **Option C**: \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \) — Incorrect, as this is the non-relativistic result.
- **Option D**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}} \) — Correct, as it matches the derived expression.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
