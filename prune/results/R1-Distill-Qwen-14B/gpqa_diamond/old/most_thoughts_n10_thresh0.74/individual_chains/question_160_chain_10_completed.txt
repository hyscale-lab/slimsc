Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again carefully. 

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is falling vertically on this aperture. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. They also mention that we can use the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm. So, this seems related to diffraction patterns. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a pattern of bright and dark regions called maxima and minima. The classic example is the single-slit diffraction, where the minima occur at certain angles based on the slit width.

Wait, but in this case, the aperture isn't a single slit but a polygon with many sides. Oh, but the problem says N is infinitely large. So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. So maybe this problem is approximating a circular aperture?

Wait, but wait. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem is given by a formula involving the number of sides and the radius. But in this case, all apothems are the same, so each side has the same length? Or same apothem? Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

So, the setup is that the light is coming along the z-axis and hitting the aperture. The far field region refers to the area where the light has spread out, so we're looking at the diffraction pattern far from the aperture.

Since the problem is about the angular distance between the first two minima, I should think about the diffraction minima conditions. For a single slit, the minima occur when a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer (±1, ±2, ...), a is the slit width, and θ is the angle from the central maximum. The first minima are at m=1, leading to sinθ ≈ θ ≈ λ/(a), so the angle between the first and second minima would be from m=1 to m=2, which is λ/(a) each, but wait, no. Wait, the positions are at θ = mλ/a, so the angular separation between first and second minima would be λ/(a) - λ/(a) but wait, no, let me think again.

Wait no, for single slit, the minima positions are at θ_m = mλ/a, for m=1,2,3..., so the first minimum is at θ=λ/a, the second at 2λ/a, and so on. So the angular separation between the first two minima is (2λ/a) - (λ/a) = λ/a. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, which would be between m=1 and m=2. So the separation is λ/a. But wait, that's in single-slit diffraction, right?

But wait, the problem here is about a polygonal aperture. But N is infinite, so it's a circular aperture. Wait, but wait! Wait, the single-slit diffraction is for a rectangular aperture, but a circular aperture has a different diffraction pattern, called the Airy disk. The minima in the Airy disk pattern are different.

Ah, right! For a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles where sinθ = (mλ)/(a), where m is an integer, but the pattern is more complex because the intensity distribution involves Bessel functions. The first minimum is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a, which is the well-known first dark ring in the Airy pattern.

Wait, but how does this relate to the question? The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large, which would correspond to a circular aperture. So the first minimum is at θ1 ≈ 1.22λ/a, and the second minimum is at θ2 ≈ 2.23λ/a? Or wait, what are the successive minima for a circular aperture?

I think the minima for a circular aperture occur at specific values of the argument of the Bessel function. The first minimum is at approximately 1.4303λ/a (but wait, sometimes I see 1.22, sometimes 1.43). Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The single-slit diffraction minima are at θ = mλ/a, but for a circular aperture, the minima are at θ where the Bessel function J_m has its zeros. The first minimum for the circular aperture is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a, which is the first dark ring. The next minima occur at higher angles, but what is the angular separation between the first and second minima?

Wait, no. Wait, the intensity for a circular aperture is given by I = I_0 (2J_1(k a sinθ))/(k a sinθ))^2, where k is 2π/λ. The minima occur where J_1(x) = 0, where x is k a sinθ. The first zero of J_1 is at x≈3.8317, so sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a), which is approximately 1.22 λ/a (since 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 0.6098, which is about 0.61, so 0.61 λ/a).

Wait, wait, no, let me compute 3.8317/(2π): 3.8317/6.2832 ≈ 0.6098. So sinθ ≈ 0.6098 λ/a. So the first minimum is at θ ≈ 0.6098 λ/a (using small angle approximation where sinθ ≈ θ).

Wait, but for the first zero, J1(x)=0 at x≈3.8317. So x = 3.8317 = (2π a sinθ)/λ. So sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) ≈ (1.22 λ)/a. Because 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 0.6098, so 3.8317 λ/(2π a) = 0.6098 λ/a. Wait, no, wait: 3.8317/(2π) is about 0.6098, so sinθ = 0.6098 λ/a. So θ is approximately 0.6098 λ/a, because for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ.

Wait, but the options given don't match exactly. Let's look at the options:

Option A) 0.610 λ/a

Option C) 1.220 λ/a.

So, according to this, the first minimum would be at θ ≈ 0.610 λ/a. Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, no. Wait, in the case of a single slit, the minima are at θ = m λ/a. The angular separation between m=1 and m=2 would be λ/a, for example. But for a circular aperture, the minima are not as regularly spaced.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the question wrong. The question states: when N is infinitely large, so the aperture becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern. The first minima (the first dark ring) is at θ1 = x1 λ/(a), where x1 is the first zero of the Bessel function J1. The second minimum is at x2, the second zero of J1, which is at x2≈7.0156 (I think the first few zeros are at 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc.) So x2=7.0156, so θ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(2π a) ≈ 7.0156/(6.2832) ≈ 1.116 λ/a.

Wait, wait no: sinθ = x λ/(2π a), so θ ≈ x λ/(2π a). So for x=3.8317, θ1≈3.8317 λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.6098 λ/a, which is approximately 0.610 λ/a. For x=7.0156, θ2≈7.0156/(2π) * λ/a = 7.0156/(6.2832) ≈ 1.116 λ/a. So the angular distance between the first two minima is θ2 - θ1 = (1.116 - 0.6098) λ/a ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

Wait, that would match option D: 0.506 λ/a.

But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is m=1 (θ1) and the second is m=2 (θ2). So the separation is θ2 - θ1 ≈ (1.116 - 0.6098) λ/a ≈ 0.506 λ/a. So the answer would be option D.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: if the aperture is a regular N-gon with infinitely many sides, it's like a circle, but perhaps the diffraction pattern is similar to a single slit. Wait, no, because a single slit and a circular aperture have different patterns. So in the case of a circular aperture, the first minimum is at about θ=1.22 λ/a? Or is that for the diameter of the circle?

Wait, perhaps I got the expression wrong. Let me think again. The condition for minima in a circular aperture is that a sinθ = (x_m λ)/(π), where x_m is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J1. So a sinθ = x_m λ/(π), so θ ≈ x_m λ/(π a) for small angles.

Wait, so for m=1, x1=3.8317. So θ1 = 3.8317 λ/(π a) ≈ 3.8317/(3.1416) λ/a ≈ 1.22 λ/a. But that's if the condition is a sinθ = x_m λ/(π), which is the formula I remember. Wait, that's correct.

Wait, so then the first minimum is at θ1≈1.22 λ/a, and the second minimum is at θ2 where x2=7.0156. So θ2 =7.0156 λ/(π a) ≈ 2.23 λ/a. So the angular separation between the first two minima is θ2 - θ1 ≈ (2.23 - 1.22) λ/a ≈ 1.01 λ/a. But that's not matching any of the options. Wait, but none of the options have that. Hmm, I must be getting something wrong here.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me get back to basics. The diffraction formula for a circular aperture is given by the intensity pattern I = (2 J1(x))/(x)^2, where x = (π a sinθ)/λ. So the minima occur when J1(x) = 0, which happens at x = 3.8317, 7.0156, etc.

So at minima, x = 3.8317, so π a sinθ = 3.8317 λ. So sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a). So θ1 ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ (1.22 λ)/a. Because 3.8317/π ≈ 1.22.

Similarly, the next minimum is at x=7.0156. So sinθ = (7.0156 λ)/(π a). So θ2≈ (7.0156/π) λ/a ≈ 2.23 λ/a.

So the first minimum is at θ1≈1.22 λ/a, the second at θ2≈2.23 λ/a. The angular separation is θ2 - θ1 ≈ (2.23 - 1.22) λ/a ≈ 1.01 λ/a. But that's not one of the options. Hmm. Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is 1.220 λ/a, which is θ1. So that's the angle of the first minimum. But the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which would be θ2 - θ1 ≈ 1.01 λ/a. But this isn't an option. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm looking for the angular separation between the first and second minima. But what's the correct condition for a polygonal aperture. Another thought: perhaps when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, but the diffraction pattern is similar to a single slit? No, I don't think that's correct. The single-slit pattern is for a rectangular aperture, whereas the circular is for a circular aperture.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is not treating the polygon as a circle but as an N-sided polygon. Maybe for a polygon with very large N, the diffraction pattern is similar to a slit of width a, but perhaps with multiple slits. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit of width a, but that wouldn't make sense because a polygon would have multiple edges.

Wait, the problem states that all apothems are the same length a. Apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem is a = (s)/(2 tan(π/N)), where s is the side length. But as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem a becomes the radius. So a is the radius of the circle.

Wait, but in the single-slit diffraction, the slit width is the diameter. So in that case, the formula for minima is a sinθ = m λ. So for a single slit, the first minimum is at θ=λ/(a), where a is the slit width (diameter). So when the problem says the apothem is a, which in the limit is the radius, so the diameter would be 2a. So for a circular aperture, the minima would be at sinθ = (x_m λ)/(π a), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1.

So, the first minimum is at x=3.8317, so sinθ = 3.8317 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.22 λ/a.

Wait, so the first minimum is at θ≈1.22λ/a. The second minimum is at x=7.0156, so sinθ=7.0156 λ/(π a) ≈ 2.23 λ/a. So the separation is 2.23 - 1.22 = 1.01 λ/a. But that's not an option either.

Wait, looking at the options again: option C is 1.220 λ/a. That's the angle of the first minimum. But the question is about the distance between the first two minima, which would be about 1.01 λ/a, which isn't even an option. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the polygon is considered as a collection of N slits, each of width a. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit with width a, and the diffraction pattern is similar to that. So for a single slit, the first minima are at θ=λ/a. The separation between the first two minima would be λ/a. But none of the options match that either.

Wait, but the options don't include a 1.01 λ/a. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me re-read the problem.

The aperture is a regular N-sided polygon, all apothems are a. So each side's apothem is a. When N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So the diameter is 2a. Wait, no: the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon with side length s, the apothem a is given by a = s/(2 tan(π/N)). As N approaches infinity, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so a ≈ s/(2*(π/N)) ) = s N/(2 π ). So as N goes to infinity, to have a fixed a, s must scale as N approaches zero. But perhaps that's complicating things.

Wait, perhaps for a regular polygon with apothem a, the side length s is 2a tan(π/N). As N becomes very large, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so s ≈ 2a (π/N). So the side length becomes very small as N increases.

But perhaps all that isn't necessary. The key is that when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle of radius a. So the question reduces to finding the angular separation between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Wait, I thought earlier that the first minima occurs at θ=1.22 λ/a, and the second at θ=2.23 λ/a. So the separation would be 1.01 λ/a, but that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as an approximation to a single slit of width a, which would have minima at θ=m λ/a, with separation λ/a.

But none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a multi-slit grating. But I don't think so, because the question is about the far-field diffraction pattern from the aperture, not interference from multiple slits.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the problem differently. Since all apothems are a, perhaps each side is considered as a slit of width a, and the overall pattern is a sum of these contributions. But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a variation of the single-slit diffraction, but with the slit replaced by a polygonal aperture. But that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the polygon can be approximated as a series of slits, each of width a, leading to a different diffraction pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the angular separation between the first two minima is the same as for a circular aperture. So the first minima is at θ=1.22 λ/a, the second at 2.23 λ/a. The separation is about 1.01 λ/a, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, maybe the answer is option C: 1.220 λ/a, which is the first minimum. But the question is about the distance between the first two minima, which isn't any of the options. Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is not considering the circular aperture but treating the polygon as a single slit of width a. So the single-slit minima are at θ = m λ/a. The first minimum is at θ=λ/a, the second at 2λ/a. The angular separation would be λ/a. But that's not any of the options either.

Wait, the options given are:

A) 0.610 λ/a

B) 0.500 λ/a

C) 1.220 λ/a 

D) 0.506 λ/a

Hmm. So option C is 1.22, which is the first minimum for a circular aperture. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the angle at which the first minimum occurs, not the separation. But the question says "angular distance between the first two minima."

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Another thought: For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/a, and the second minimum is at θ= 2.23 λ/a. So the angular distance between them is 1.01 λ/a, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the angular separation between the first and second minima is (2.23 - 1.22) = 1.01 λ/a, but no option matches that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit with width 2a, making the first minimum at θ=λ/(2a), which would be 0.5 λ/a. But that's not one of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the condition for the first minimum as the same as for a single slit, but with a slit width a. So first minimum at θ=λ/a, second at 2λ/a. The separation would be λ/a, but that's not an option.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the polygon can be treated as a rectangular aperture with width a, and the diffraction pattern is similar to a single slit.

Wait, but a regular N-gon with apothem a as N approaches infinity would approximate a circle, not a rectangle. So that approach might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually referring to the polygon as a circular aperture, and the angular separation between the first and second minima is option D: 0.506 λ/a. Because 0.506 is approximately (7.0156 - 3.8317)/(2π) * λ/a.

Wait, let me compute that: (7.0156 - 3.8317) = 3.1839. Divided by 2π, which is about 6.2832. So 3.1839/6.2832 ≈ 0.506. So the separation is about 0.506 λ/a.

Ah, that would match option D.

Wait, but how?

Wait, in the case of a circular aperture, the minima are at positions where J1(x) = 0, where x = (π a sinθ)/λ. So, the first minimum is at x=3.8317, so sinθ1= (3.8317 λ)/(π a) → θ1 ≈ 3.8317 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.22 λ/a.

The second minimum is at x=7.0156, so sinθ2=7.0156 λ/(π a). So θ2≈7.0156/(π) * λ/a ≈ 2.23 λ/a.

So the separation between θ1 and θ2 is (2.23 - 1.22) λ/a = 1.01 λ/a. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I compute the separation. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the angular separation between the first and second minima in the single-slit pattern, which would be λ/a. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the separation. Let me think again: for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ1=1.22 λ/a, the second at θ2=2.23 λ/a. The distance between them is θ2 - θ1 = 1.01 λ/a, but the options don't have that.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit of width a, leading to the first minima at θ=λ/a. The separation between first and second would be λ/a. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a two-slit interference setup. But I don't think that's the case. The problem states that it's a diffraction pattern in the far field, so interference from multiple slits isn't the main factor.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: when N is very large, the polygon can be considered as a collection of N slits, each of width a, spaced apart. But perhaps the diffraction pattern would involve a superposition of these individual slits' patterns.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the first minimum of a single slit, which is θ=λ/a, but the separation between m=1 and m=2 would be λ/a. But that's not an option either.

Wait, another angle (no pun intended): perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a circular aperture but using the formula for the first minimum as 1.4303 λ/a, which is the second zero of J1. But no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should refer back to the problem statement. It says that the angular distance is between the first two minima. So the first minimum is the first dark spot after the central maximum. The second would be the next dark spot.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the circular aperture but a different shape. Alternatively, perhaps the polygon's diffraction pattern is more like a rectangular one, leading to single-slit-type minima.

Wait, perhaps the polygon, when N approaches infinity, becomes a circle, but the diffraction pattern is similar to a single-slit diffraction. But no, that can't be right because the single-slit and circular apertures have different patterns.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is approximately half of 1.01 λ/a. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the angular separation between the first and second minima as the difference between their positions, which is (1.22 - 0.610) λ/a = 0.610 λ/a, which is option A. But that would be if the first minimum is at 0.610 λ/a and the second at 1.22 λ/a. But no, that doesn't make sense because the first minimum in circular is at 1.22.

Wait, perhaps I have my initial assumption wrong. Maybe the first minimum corresponds to the first zero of J1, which is 3.8317, leading to θ=3.8317 λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a. The second zero is at 7.0156, θ=7.0156 λ/(2π a) ≈1.116 λ/a. So the separation is 1.116 - 0.610 = 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

Ah, yes! So for a circular aperture, when the condition is a sinθ = x λ/(π), where x is the m-th zero of J1, the first minimum is at x=3.8317, so a sinθ1=3.8317 λ/(π) → θ1=3.8317 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.22 λ/a.

Wait, but earlier when I thought of x as (π a sinθ)/λ, that leads to θ = x λ/(π a). So for x=3.8317, θ=3.8317 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.22 λ/a. Similarly, for x=7.0156, θ=7.0156 λ/(π a) ≈ 2.23 λ/a. So the separation is 2.23 -1.22=1.01 λ/a, which isn't an option.

But wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the condition is a sinθ = x λ/(2π), not divided by π.

Let me check. The general condition for minima in a circular aperture is when the phase shift around the circumference equals an odd multiple of π, leading to destructive interference. The formula is indeed a sinθ = (x_m λ)/(π), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1.

So, a sinθ = (x_m λ)/π → θ ≈ (x_m λ)/(π a).

So for the first minimum, x1=3.8317 → θ1=3.8317 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.22 λ/a.

Second minimum: x2=7.0156 → θ2=7.0156 λ/(π a) ≈ 2.23 λ/a.

So the angular separation is θ2−θ1= (7.0156−3.8317) λ/(π a) = (3.1839) λ/(3.1416 a) ≈ 1.01 λ/a.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the circular aperture, but about the polygon acting as a diffraction grating with multiple slits. For example, a regular polygon with N sides can be seen as N equally spaced slits, each of width a.

In such a case, the diffraction pattern would involve a combination of the single-slit and grating effects. The single-slit condition would come into play for the overall envelope, and the grating would define the spacing between the maxima.

But the question is about minima, which in a grating are determined by the single-slit condition. So perhaps the minima are determined by the same equation as the single slit, i.e., a sinθ = m λ. So the first minimum at θ=λ/a, the second at 2λ/a. The separation would be λ/a, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width a, leading to minima at θ = mλ/a, and the angular separation between the first two minima is (2λ/a - λ/a)= λ/a. But again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the problem again. It says that all apothems are of length a. So each side's midpoint is at a distance a from the center.

When the polygon becomes a circle (N→infinite), the apothem is the radius. So the radius R = a. The circumference is 2πa. But how does that relate to the diffraction pattern?

In the Fraunhofer diffraction (far field) for a circular aperture, the intensity distribution is given by the Airy pattern. The first dark ring occurs at θ = 1.22 λ/a. The second dark ring is at a larger angle. The angular separation between first and second minima is not exactly a fixed number, but the first minima are spaced increasingly further apart as angles increase.

But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So, the first minimum is at θ1=1.22 λ/a, the second at θ2=2.23 λ/a. The separation is approximately 1.01 λ/a. But that's not an option.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a. Which is roughly half of 1.01. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the separation.

Wait, wait: 7.0156 -3.8317 =3.1839.

3.1839 / (2π) =3.1839/6.2832 ≈0.506.

So if the condition is a sinθ = x λ/(2π), then θ= x λ/(2π a). So for x=3.8317, θ1=3.8317/(2π) λ/a ≈0.610 λ/a. For x=7.0156, θ2=7.0156/(2π) λ/a ≈1.116 λ/a. So the separation is 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

Ah, so perhaps I was using the wrong formula earlier. The correct condition is a sinθ = x λ/(2π), not divided by π. That would change the calculation.

So, for a circular aperture, the condition is a sinθ = (x_m λ)/(2π), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1.

So for m=1: x1=3.8317 → sinθ1=3.8317 λ/(2π a) → θ1≈0.610 λ/a.

m=2: x2=7.0156 → sinθ2=7.0156 λ/(2π a) → θ2≈1.116 λ/a.

So the angular separation is 1.116-0.610=0.506 λ/a, which matches option D.

That makes sense now. So the answer must be option D.


The problem involves a regular N-sided polygon aperture with all apothems of length \(a\). When \(N \to \infty\), the polygon becomes a circular aperture. Monochromatic light of wavelength \(\lambda\) falls vertically on the aperture, and the goal is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern.

For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is governed by the Airy disk, where the minima occur at angles determined by the zeros of the Bessel function \(J_1(x)\). The condition for the \(m\)-th minimum is:

\[
a \sin\theta = \frac{x_m \lambda}{2\pi},
\]

where \(x_m\) is the \(m\)-th zero of \(J_1(x)\). The first few zeros of \(J_1(x)\) are approximately \(x_1 = 3.8317\) and \(x_2 = 7.0156\).

### Step 1: Calculate the angles for the first two minima
For the first minimum (\(m=1\)):
\[
\sin\theta_1 = \frac{x_1 \lambda}{2\pi a}, \quad \theta_1 \approx \frac{x_1 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]
Substituting \(x_1 = 3.8317\):
\[
\theta_1 \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{2\pi a} \approx 0.610 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

For the second minimum (\(m=2\)):
\[
\sin\theta_2 = \frac{x_2 \lambda}{2\pi a}, \quad \theta_2 \approx \frac{x_2 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]
Substituting \(x_2 = 7.0156\):
\[
\theta_2 \approx \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{2\pi a} \approx 1.116 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the angular separation
The angular separation between the first two minima is:
\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1.
\]
Substituting \(\theta_1 \approx 0.610 \frac{\lambda}{a}\) and \(\theta_2 \approx 1.116 \frac{\lambda}{a}\):
\[
\Delta\theta \approx 1.116 \frac{\lambda}{a} - 0.610 \frac{\lambda}{a} = 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
The angular separation between the first two minima is approximately \(0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}\), which corresponds to **Option D**.
