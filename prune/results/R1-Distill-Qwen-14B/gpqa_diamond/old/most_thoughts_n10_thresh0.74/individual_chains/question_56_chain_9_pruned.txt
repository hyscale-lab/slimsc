Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to piece this together.

First, I remember that electrons can transition between energy levels through photon emission or absorption, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. For the hydrogen atom, the standard selection rules say that during a dipole transition, the angular momentum quantum number l can change by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1. Also, the principal quantum number n can change by any integer, but in this case, going from n=3 to n=1 in two steps, so each step probably changes n by 1.

So the process is 3 → 2 → 1. But wait, the first transition would be from 3 to 2, and the second from 2 to 1. Each step must satisfy the selection rules.

The state |3,0,0> has l=0, m=0. So the first transition to a state with l=1 because Δl = ±1. So the first transition must be from l=0 to l=1. That would make the intermediate state |2,1, m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the initial state is |3,0,0>, so m is 0. So the possible m changes are by 0, ±1. So the first transition's m can change by +1, 0, or -1. But since we're going from m=0 to something else. So the possible intermediate states could be |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1, +1>.

But wait, the second transition is from 2 to 1. The state |2,1,m> can transition to |1,0,0>, since l must go from 1 to 0 (Δl= -1 is allowed). Also, m changes can be 0, ±1. So the m for the intermediate state must allow m' to reach 0 in the next step.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0> with m=0. The first transition can go to m=0, +1,
