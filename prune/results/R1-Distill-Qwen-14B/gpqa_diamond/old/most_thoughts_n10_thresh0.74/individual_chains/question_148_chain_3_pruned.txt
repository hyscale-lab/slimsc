Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. So, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds. I remember that binary compounds consist of two elements, so Y must be another element combining with F.

The first compound is A1, which is bright red and decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. The oF for A2 is 31.96%. Wait, oF usually refers to the oxygen-free part? Or maybe it's the oxygen content? Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, wait, oF is probably the oxygen-free fraction. No, wait, another possibility: Sometimes, oF could stand for the oxygen-free part in terms of molecular weight. Or maybe it's the oxygen content in a compound. Wait, perhaps it's the formula of A2. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. So, decomposition reaction would be something like A1 â†’ A2 + F2. So, if A1 is a binary compound of Y and F, then A2 must be another binary compound. So, perhaps A1 is YF3, decomposing into YF2 and F2? Or maybe YF4 decomposing into YF2 and F2? Because if A2 has 31.96% fluorine, let's calculate that.

Wait, let's calculate what A2's formula is. If the
