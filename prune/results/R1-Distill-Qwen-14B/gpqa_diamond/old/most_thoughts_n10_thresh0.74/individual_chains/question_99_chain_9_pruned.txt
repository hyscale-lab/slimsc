Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let me take it step by step.

First, let me read the question again. The compound is unknown, and they used FTIR and 1H NMR for characterization. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. The NMR has multiple signals, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Oh wait, vinyl hydrogens are those in double bonds, like CH2=CH. Since none of the NMR signals are vinyl, that suggests the compound doesn't have any double bonds or maybe the structure doesn't have any protons attached to doubly bonded carbons.

Looking at the IR data: the broad peak at 3000 is probably an O-H stretch. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate hydrogen bonding or strong absorption. O-H groups like in carboxylic acids have a broad peak because of their strong hydrogen bonding. The 1700 cm^-1 peak is a strong absorption, likely a carbonyl group (C=O). In carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700-1750 cm^-1. But wait, sometimes if the compound is an ester, it can be similar, but the broad peak at 3000 suggests it's more likely a carboxylic acid. So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group.

Now onto the NMR. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds, which aligns with the O-H and C=O groups but not any alkenes. The NMR has several signals. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about splitting patterns.

In 1H NMR, splitting (multiplicity) arises from neighboring protons. A quartet is four peaks, which comes from three neighboring hydrogens. A triplet is three peaks from two neighboring H. So if a signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, what does that mean? Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me break
