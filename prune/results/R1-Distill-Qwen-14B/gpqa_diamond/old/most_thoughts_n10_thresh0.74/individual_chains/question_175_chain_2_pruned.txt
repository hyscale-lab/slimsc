Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when charges oscillate, they can radiate electromagnetic waves. The question mentions a spheroidal shape with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, it's symmetric around the z-axis. That probably means the radiation pattern isn't isotropic; it's more focused in certain directions.

The problem states that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, where theta is the angle with the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees, as well as the form of f.

Wait, I remember that for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum along the equatorial plane, which is at 90 degrees from the z-axis. But wait, no, wait. No, actually, the dipole radiation is maximum along the axis perpendicular to the dipole's oscillation. Oh wait, no, for a dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the radiation pattern is such that the intensity is maximum at theta = 90 degrees (equatorial direction), and it falls off as cos(theta) in the far field. Or no, wait, the far-field (radiation) pattern for a dipole is proportional to (1/(r sin^2(theta))) and the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta), no. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things.

Wait, the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the formula for the intensity. For a dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the intensity (power per unit area) in the far field depends on the angle theta. The formula I recall is that the intensity is proportional to (sin(theta))^2, but that's for the dipole's radiation pattern. So the maximum intensity occurs at theta = 90 degrees, which is perpendicular to the dipole's axis.

But in this problem, the charge distribution is spheroidal. Wait, a sphere would be isotropic if it's static, but
