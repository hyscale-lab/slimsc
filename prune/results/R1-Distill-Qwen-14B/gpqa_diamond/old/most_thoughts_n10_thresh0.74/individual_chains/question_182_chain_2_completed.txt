Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity conditions. Hmm, I remember from my solid-state devices class that the Mott-Gurney equation describes the current-voltage behavior in certain conditions. Let me try to think this through.

The equation given is J = (9/8) ε μ V² / L³. I think that this equation applies in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. So, what's the SCLC regime again? Oh right, it's when the current is limited by the space charge effects, meaning the electric field isn't uniform anymore because of the charges that accumulate. So the space charge creates a non-uniform field, which affects the current.

Now, the question is about the validity conditions. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's go through each option.

Option A says it's valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, drift current... I thought the Mott-Gurney equation is about when drift is significant but diffusion is negligible. Or was it the other way around? Oh, wait, in the SCLC region, the current is mainly due to the electric field created by the space charge, so it's dominated by drift. So if the option says negligible drift current, that would be wrong. So probably A is incorrect because it says negligible drift.

Option B: trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion current. Hmm. Trap-free makes sense because traps would complicate things, maybe leading to more complex behavior like in the trap-filled limit (which is another regime, I think like the Fowler-Nordheim for tunneling). Single-carrier is correct because the equation assumes only one type of carrier is contributing. No carrier injection barrier suggests Ohmic contacts, perhaps. And negligible diffusion current—since the Mott-Gurney is for drift-dominated, diffusion would be negligible. So maybe B is correct.

Option C: single-carrier with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion. Schottky contact implies a barrier, but the equation assumes maybe Ohmic? Or does it not matter? Because Mott-Gurney is more about the space charge and the device's length, not the contact type. Also, if it's a Schottky contact, there's a barrier, so the injection may not be Ohmic. But I think the Mott-Gurney equation doesn't make assumptions about the contact, as long as it's a single carrier and the conditions for SCLC are met. Also, the equation's validity is about the current being space-charge limited, which depends on the electric field and carrier concentration. So whether it's Schottky or Ohmic might not affect the validity of the equation itself, but the conditions of the current flow. Hmm, but the option says negligible diffusion current, which aligns with the equation's conditions. But the contact type—what if Schottky introduces some other factors? Not sure. Maybe the equation doesn't depend on contact type, as long as it's single carrier and SCLC.

Option D: two-carrier device, Ohmic contact, negligible diffusion. But Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier, right? Because in two-carrier cases, like in p-n junctions, you have more complex behavior. Plus, if it's a two-carrier device, the space charge might affect both carriers, but I think the Mott-Gurney equation is derived for a single type of carrier, like electrons or holes only. So D is probably incorrect.

Wait, let me think again. So, the Mott-Gurney equation applies to a trap-free, single-carrier device. Because in traps, the current might follow a different model. So options A and B and C are single-carrier, D is two, so D is out.

Now, between A, B, and C. Let me remember the conditions—what is the SCLC? It's when the current is limited by the space charge. So, when you have a high enough voltage that the electric field is so strong it causes significant space charge, which in turn reduces the electric field (because the space charge creates a counter field). So, in that case, the current is proportional to V squared, which is what the equation shows.

In terms of validity, the equation assumes that the current is space-charge limited, which occurs when the electric field is non-uniform due to the space charge. Also, it assumes that the carriers are in the SCLC region, which is for low temperatures and high voltages, I think.

Now, the equation also assumes that the device is single-carrier, which rules out D. Also, it's trap-free because traps would lead to different current mechanisms, possibly leading to the Poole-Frenkel effect or something else. So options with traps are out. So A and B are trap-free. Option C says single-carrier but doesn't mention traps. So maybe C is incorrect because it could have traps, but the equation requires trap-free. Wait, the question is about which statement is true about the equation's validity. So the correct option would be the one that correctly states the conditions.

Option B says 'no carrier injection barrier' which I think implies that the contacts are Ohmic. So, if the contacts are Ohmic, there's no barrier for carriers to move in, which makes the current flow more freely. But I'm not sure if the presence of an injection barrier affects the Mott-Gurney equation. The equation itself is more about the current in the bulk, not about the contacts. So maybe that part doesn't matter. So, maybe B is correct because it says 'no carrier injection barrier' which is Ohmic, and the other conditions.

Alternatively, looking back at the equation, it's J proportional to V squared. The derivation comes from assuming that the current is due to the space charge and that the electric field is varying in the region. So the key conditions are single-carrier, trap-free, and negligible diffusion (so drift-dominated).

So, looking at the options again.

Option A says 'Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.' Wait, if drift current is negligible, that would mean that the current is mainly due to diffusion. But in SCLC, drift is dominant. So if the equation is for drift, then A is incorrect because it says negligible drift.

Option B says 'no carrier injection barrier' which implies Ohmic contacts, and 'negligible diffusion current.' That sounds correct because in SCLC, diffusion is negligible, and Ohmic contacts would mean easy carrier movement, so the equation applies.

Option C says 'Schottky contact and negligible diffusion.' Schottky contact implies a barrier, which would affect the current, but the equation's validity probably doesn't depend on the contact type as long as it's a single-carrier and SCLC conditions are met. So the contact type might not matter as much as the SCLC conditions. But the equation does assume that the device is single-carrier and in the SCLC regime, regardless of the contact. So maybe option B is better because it mentions no injection barrier.

Wait, but does the presence of a barrier change the current? For example, in a Schottky contact, you have a barrier that may prevent injection, but in the SCLC regime, the current is limited by the space charge, so maybe the contact's barrier isn't a big factor once the SCLC conditions are met.

But I think the main point is that the equation is applicable when the current is space-charge-limited, which requires that the carriers are not scattered (like in traps) and that the current is due to drift, not diffusion.

So, back to the options. The equation is valid when the device is single-carrier, trap-free, and the current is due to drift (so diffusion is negligible). Also, the contacts being Ohmic might not matter as much as the other conditions.

So, looking back, option B says 'trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (so Ohmic) and negligible diffusion current.' That seems to fit perfectly.

Option A is wrong because it says negligible drift, which is opposite of what we need. Option C says Schottky, which is a barrier. But perhaps the equation doesn't care about the barrier because it's more about the space charge. But the presence of a barrier would change how the carriers are injected, but once they are moving in the bulk under high fields, the Mott-Gurney equation would still apply, right? So the contact type might not affect the validity of the equation as much as the presence of traps or whether it's single carrier.

So the key points in the options are:

Option B: no injection barrier (Ohmic), trap-free, single-carrier, negligible diffusion.

Which aligns with the Mott-Gurney conditions.

So the correct answer is B.


The Mott-Gurney equation, given as 

\[
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3},
\]

describes the dark current (\(J\)) versus voltage (\(V\)) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. This regime occurs when the current is dominated by the electric field created by the space charge, which makes the electric field non-uniform. The equation assumes that the current is drift-dominated and diffusion is negligible. Additionally, it applies to single-carrier devices and requires the absence of traps, as traps would introduce complexities like the Poole-Frenkel effect.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: This option states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. However, the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that drift current is significant, not negligible. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: This option specifies a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (implying Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current. This aligns with the conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation, as it assumes single-carrier, trap-free, drift-dominated current, and negligible diffusion. This option is correct.

- **Option C**: This option describes a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. While the equation does assume negligible diffusion, the presence of a Schottky contact (with a carrier injection barrier) is not consistent with the conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation, which assumes free carrier movement under Ohmic conditions. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: This option refers to a two-carrier device, which is inconsistent with the Mott-Gurney equation. The equation is derived for single-carrier devices, as the inclusion of two carriers would lead to more complex behavior. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current. This is accurately described by **Option B**.
