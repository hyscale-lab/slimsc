Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? Like when calculations give you infinite results, you need to regularize them to make sense of the math. 

The question is asking which of the theories never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, let me think. Regularization is needed when the theory has divergences. So which of these theories don't have such issues? 

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory. I remember that QED has things like the electron self-energy and vacuum polarization, which cause divergences. So they must use regularization techniques, like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization. So C isn't the answer.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is similar to QED but with a non-abelian gauge group. I think QCD has issues with things like the Landau pole problem if you don't consider asymptotic freedom. But wait, isn't QCD a theory that's been quantized successfully, so they must deal with divergences. So B needs regularization, so not the answer.

Superstring Theory... Wait, string theory is a different approach. Instead of point particles, it uses strings. I think string theories have a different structure. Oh right, in string theory, the concept is that higher energy scales correspond to longer length scales, which might prevent some divergences. Or maybe the theory is finite, meaning it doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same divergences as QFTs? I'm not sure. I remember that string theory has a kind of 't Hooft coupling, but I'm not certain if it needs regularization. 

Classical Electrodynamics (option D) is a classical theory, not a quantum one. So it doesn't involve the same divergences that quantum theories do. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you don't have issues with renormalization because it's not a quantum field theory. So classical theories don't require regularization because regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So option D might be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. The question specifies "at high energies." So which theory doesn't require regularization when energies are high. 

In QED and QCD, even at high energies, you still get divergences that
