Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups are part of molecular symmetry and group theory, right? I remember that these groups describe the arrangement of atoms in a molecule, determining its symmetry properties.

First, I need to figure out what the compounds are. Let me read through the problem again.

The first part says: Reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. I'm thinking, what solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio? Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something, but sulfur usually has a 2:1 ratio sometimes. Alternatively, maybe a metal reacting with a halogen. Wait, another thought: maybe A is sodium, and B is chlorine? But wait, sodium and chlorine 8:1? Hmm, sodium is a metal, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide and B is hydrogen? Or maybe nitric acid? Not sure yet.

Next, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. So C + 2D → E. And E is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So when C is in water, it breaks down into A, and produces two acids. One strong, one weak.

Another clue: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D + B → H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, maybe something else. If B and D are gases, what gas B reacts with gas D in 1:1 to make a solvent. Hmm.

Let me try to piece this together. The product C is a bright red solid. I'm thinking maybe it's lead dioxide (PbO2) which is dark brown, or maybe mercury(II) oxide is red? Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate or sulfate. Wait, another thought: perhaps A is Fe, B is Cl2, and C is FeCl3. No, because FeCl3 is yellowish, not bright red. Alternatively, A could be K, but when K reacts with Cl2, it's KCl, but 8 equivalents? That seems a lot.

Wait, another approach: when C reacts with water, it produces A and two acids. So C is likely a salt that's an acid when it reacts with water. Wait, no, because when C reacts with water, it produces A and acids F and G. So perhaps C is a metal carbonate that when hydrolyzed gives a strong and weak acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, which reacts with water to produce ammonia (a weak acid?) and something else.

Wait, but F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So maybe when C is in water, it breaks down into A and produces these acids. So perhaps C is a nitride, like Na3N. When Na3N reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base, but maybe the product is acid if hydrolysis occurs differently) but that might
