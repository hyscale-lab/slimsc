Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about cosmology, specifically related to the Lambda-CDM model and comoving distance. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. So, I remember that this kind of peak is probably from the Lyman-alpha forest or something related to the Lyman-alpha emission line. Wait, actually, Lyman-alpha is a specific line in hydrogen, right? It's emitted when an electron transitions from the second energy level to the first. The wavelength for Lyman-alpha is about 121.6 nm. But wait, why is the observed wavelength longer here?

Oh, right! This is due to redshift. If the quasar is moving away from us, the wavelength of the emitted light stretches. So the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted one. So the observed peak at 790 nm must be the redshifted Lyman-alpha emission. So the emitted wavelength is 121.6 nm, observed is 790 nm. So the redshift z can be calculated.

Redshift z is (observed wavelength / emitted wavelength) - 1. So let me calculate that. Observed is 790 nm, emitted is 121.6 nm. So 790 / 121.6 is... let me see, approximately 6.498. So z ≈ 6.498 - 1? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait, no, wait. Redshift formula is z = (lambda_obs - lambda_emit) / lambda_emit. So that's (790 -121.6)/121.6. Let me compute that: 790 minus 121.6 is 668.4. Then 668.4 / 121.6 is approximately 5.5. So z is about 5.5.

Okay, so the quasar is at a redshift z of approximately 5.5. Now, the question is about the comoving distance to this quasar. The parameters given are Hubble constant H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m =0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (Omega_total=1). So we need to calculate the comoving distance for a=1 (which is today's scale factor) to this quasar.

Wait, comoving distance is given by the integral from a=0 to a=1 of c / (a H(a)) da. Or wait, actually, I think the comoving distance is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m (1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda). But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The comoving distance D_C is the integral from t=0 to t=now of c dt / a(t), which in terms of redshift can be written as D_C = (c / H0) ∫ from 0 to z [1 / sqrt( Omega_m (1 + z')^3 + Omega_lambda ) ] dz'.
