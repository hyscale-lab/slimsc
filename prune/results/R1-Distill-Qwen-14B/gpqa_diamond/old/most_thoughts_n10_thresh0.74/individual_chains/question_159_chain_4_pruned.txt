Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let me try to think through this. So the question is about the comoving distance of a quasar based on certain observations and cosmological parameters.

The observations are in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at around 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. Wait, I remember that the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm in the rest frame, but when redshifted, it can move into optical or infrared. Oh wait, but 790 nm is in the near-infrared. So maybe this quasar's emission line is redshifted into that region.

So if the peak is at 790 nm, which is the observed wavelength, and assuming it's the Lyman-alpha line, the rest wavelength is 121 nm. So the redshift z would be (observed / rest) - 1. Let me calculate that: 790 / 121 is approximately 6.5289. So z is about 5.5289, which is roughly 5.53. That's a high redshift, which means the quasar is very far away.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance at scale factor a=1, which I think is the same as the current comoving distance. The comoving distance is the distance we use to calculate the proper distance at any time, considering the expansion of the universe.

The cosmological model given is Lambda-CDM with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm=0.3, dark energy Ωλ=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ωk=0).

Comoving distance D_C is calculated by integrating from the observer to the source. The formula is D_C = (c/H0) * ∫[a=0 to a=1] da/(a^2 H(a)), where H(a) = H0 * sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ). Wait, no, H(a) is H0 multiplied by the square root of (Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ*(1+z)^0) because dark energy's equation of state is w=-1, so its density doesn't change with a (since a is 1 now). Oh wait, no, H(a) actually scales with the scale factor. Let
