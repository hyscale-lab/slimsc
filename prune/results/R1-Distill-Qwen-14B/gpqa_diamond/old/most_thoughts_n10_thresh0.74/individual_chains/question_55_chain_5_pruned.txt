Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are all types of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

Let me start by recalling what these compounds look like. Acetates are esters where the acid part is acetic acid. So, propenyl acetate would have an acetate group (OAc) attached to a propenyl group. Similarly, butenyl acetate would have the same group but with a butenyl chain.

Wait, the options are Cis or Trans for both propenyl and butenyl. So propenyl is CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond, I think. Wait no, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or maybe the double bond is in a different position. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond. Let me get the structures right.

Actually, propenyl groups can be either allyl or isopropenyl. But for esters like propenyl acetate, it's usually the allyl group, I think. So propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Similarly, butenyl would have four carbons with a double bond. But the options specify cis and trans for these, which implies that the substituents on either side of the double bond are different.

Wait, but for the NMR, I need to look at the splitting patterns and the coupling constants to figure out the structure.

Looking at the NMR data given:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

So, I'll break this down.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably the methyl group of the acetate. The acetate's OCH3 typically appears as a singlet because all three protons are equivalent, right? So that would be the OAc group.

Then, the doublet at 7.0 ppm. Since it's a doublet with J=16 Hz, that's a relatively large coupling. In aromatic regions, that's a big coupling. Wait, but wait, 7 ppm is where aromatic protons usually are. Hmm, but acetate esters don't have aromatic rings unless it's something else. Wait, but the options are propenyl and butenyl acetates, which are alkenes, not aromatic. So maybe this proton is part of a double bond system.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 7.0 ppm peak is an allylic proton. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton adjacent to another group.

Wait, in an ester with an allyl group, the protons on the double bond would be split based on their neighboring protons. Let me think about the structure.

Let's take propenyl acetate. The structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So, the protons on the double bond are at the CH2 and CH ends. Wait, the central CH would have neighboring protons. Let
