Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me take a deep breath and try to work through it step by step. I remember that these kinds of problems often involve interpreting spectroscopic data to figure out the structure of a compound and then predicting its reaction.

The question is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I'm supposed to find the final product from the options given. Let me start by looking at the IR and NMR data to determine what Compound X is.

First, looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a high wavenumber, so I'm thinking it's a carbonyl group. Could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the 3400-2500 cm-1 might suggest it's not a carboxylic acid because they usually have broader O-H stretches. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol with a carbonyl group nearby. 

Looking further, there's a peak at 1610 cm-1, which could be aromatic C=C stretching. And 1450 cm-1 is probably another aromatic ring vibration, maybe the ortho or meta positions. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents.

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let me parse that:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an -OH proton, but in an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad. So if there's a peak here, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm and a triplet or something else. Or maybe an acidic proton like in a phenol? But phenol protons are usually around 5 ppm in NMR, but maybe if it's something else. Wait, but the IR doesn't show a strong broad peak for O-H, but wait the IR data says 3400–2500, which could be an O-H. Maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but then the 1720 cm-1 might fit a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid. Wait, no. Carboxylic
