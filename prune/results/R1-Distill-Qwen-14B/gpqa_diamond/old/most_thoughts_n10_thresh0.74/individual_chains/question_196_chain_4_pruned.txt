Okay, so I've got a physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass attached to a spring oscillates. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. But this problem is relativistic, so I need to think about how relativity affects the motion.

The question asks for the maximum speed of the mass. In the classical case, the maximum speed would be achieved when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But relativity probably changes things because the speed of light is a limit.

Wait, in the classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), right? So that's option C. But this is a relativistic case, so that can't be the right answer here. Or maybe it's modified.

So, in special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv², it's (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy is gamma mc², and when the mass is at the maximum displacement (x=A), all the energy is potential, which in the relativistic case might be similar to the classical expression but adjusted.

Wait, no, in the relativistic oscillator, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kA². I think the relativistic correction comes into play. I remember that in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is quantized, but I'm not sure about the maximum speed part.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the energy conservation in this scenario. The total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy. Wait, no, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)kx², but relativistically, maybe that's different. Or perhaps the system is treated such that the total energy includes both the rest mass and the oscillation energy.

Wait, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all its energy is potential. Then, as it moves towards the equilibrium, that potential energy converts into kinetic. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn
