Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about analyzing a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, which are similar in chemical shift and integral. Together, they add up to one proton. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so that's not the issue. Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. Hmm.

Hmm, what do I know about NMR and LC-MS? Well, in NMR, if you have two separate signals for the same proton, it can mean a couple of things. One possibility is that the compound has some kind of symmetry or perhaps it's a diastereomer or enantiomer. Wait, but if it's a diastereomer, the NMR signals might split into multiple peaks because the environments are different. Enantiomers, though, would have the same NMR spectrum because they're mirror images and the NMR can't distinguish them. So why are the peaks appearing as two?

Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. The integrals add up to one, so it's like each peak is integrating to about 0.5H. So maybe it's an issue of the proton being split by something else, but the coupling is ruled out. Hmm. Wait, another possibility is that the compound is a racemic mixture. But wait, enantiomers would have the same NMR signals, so that wouldn't cause two peaks. Oh, but wait, if the molecule has more than one chiral center, perhaps it's a diastereomer mixture. So for diastereomers, the NMR would show different signals because their environments are different. So that could cause two peaks for the same proton in different environments.

But wait, the question says that the two peaks have the same integral and similar shifts. Wait, but if they were diastereomers, the shifts would be a bit different. But the shifts are similar, so maybe the diastereomers are close in structure, making the shifts similar. Or perhaps it's something else.

Alternatively, what about the possibility of a double bond isomerism, like cis and trans? But then the NMR would show different shifts. Also, the problem is about a peptide, so probably about stereochemistry.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. So the molecular weight is the same, meaning same molecular formula. So they are not different molecules with different masses. So that suggests that the two compounds are either isomers or maybe something else like a byproduct.

Looking at the options:

Option A) Contaminated with a precursor. Then the mass would be different. But the problem states the mass is consistent with the expected molecule. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B) Mixture of enantiomers. But as I thought earlier, enantiomers have the same NMR, so
