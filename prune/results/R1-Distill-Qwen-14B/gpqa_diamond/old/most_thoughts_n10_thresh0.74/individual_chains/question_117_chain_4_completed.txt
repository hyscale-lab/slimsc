Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism... I think that's when compounds have the ability to rotate plane-polarized light because they have non-superimposable mirror images, like enantiomers. So, the question is asking which of the four given organic compounds show optical isomerism.

Let me go through each option one by one. First, I need to determine if each compound has any chiral centers or if they can exhibit some kind of stereoisomerism.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, biphenyl rings with substituents. Let me draw this out in my mind. The structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond, right? At position 6 on each ring, there are nitro groups, and at position 2 on each, there are carboxylate ester groups (since it's dimethyl, the ester is OMe).

Wait, biphenyl structures can have isomerism based on their substituents. If the substituents are in positions that make the structure not symmetrical, then the compound might have stereoisomerism. But for optical isomerism, we need a chiral center or some kind of asymmetry.

So, in this case, the substituents are on positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. The 6,6' positions have nitro groups, and the 2,2' have the ester groups. Let me think about the symmetry here. If both rings have the same substituents in symmetrical positions, then maybe the molecule isn't chiral. But wait, the biphenyl itself can have a kind of axial chirality. Oh wait, but axial chirality is more about the arrangement around the single bond connecting the two rings. Do the substituents on each ring cause the molecule to have a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, leading to enantiomers. For example, if the substituents are in such a way that the two rings are not mirror images. Let me imagine the positions: 2 and 6 are meta to each other on the benzene rings. So, when you have two substituents on each ring, arranged at 2,6 positions, it's possible that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, leading to optical isomerism. Or wait, maybe the nitro groups are in a position that makes the molecule symmetrical. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents on the biphenyl make it asymmetrical. For example, if one ring has a nitro in 6 and the other has another nitro in 6, but the ester groups are at 2,2', which are on the adjacent positions. Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical. So, maybe this compound exhibits optical isomerism. I'm a bit shaky on this, but I think biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can show optical isomerism. So I'll tentatively mark option 1 as showing optical isomerism.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. The structure would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. The formula would be something like CH3-O-C(O)-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH3CHOHCOOH, but since it's the ester, the structure would be CH3-O-CO-CH(CH3)OH? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is propanoic acid with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When it forms an ester with methanol, the -OH is replaced by OMe. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, or is it CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, no. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the propanoic acid has three carbons. The -COOH is on C1, the -OH on C2. So, structure is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOOC-CHOH-CH3? No, wait, the numbering is from the COOH end. So the first carbon is COOH, the second is CH(OH), and the third is CH3? So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, but wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, right? Or wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of the actual structure. The formula is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, no, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoic acid. Hmm, maybe I should draw it. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the ester.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure would be:

O
||O-C-O-CH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 ?

Wait, maybe it's better to think of propanoic acid as CH2CH2COOH (but that's not correct; it's CH3CH2COOH). So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When you esterify it with methanol, the -OH in the -COOH becomes OMe, right? Or wait, no, wait. The esterification replaces the -OH in the acid with OMe, so the structure becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH? Because propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but that's incorrect. Let me correct that. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, the correct structure is CH3CH2COOH, right? So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So when it esterifies with methanol (CH3OH), the structure becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but in that structure, is there a chiral center? Let's see. The carbon chain would be:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, the chain is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3?

Wait, that would be a straight chain with COOCH3 at the end, and the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbon chain is: COOCH3 is on the third carbon, then second is CH2, first is CH2(OH), but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the propanoate part is the ester. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbons are arranged as:

CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-OH? No, wait, that's not correct. Let me think again. The ester is formed from the acid. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When we make the ester with methanol, the -OH in COOH becomes OMe. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

COOCH3 connected to CH2CH2(OH). So the carbonyl is on the third carbon, the CH2OH is on the first carbon, and the middle is CH2.

Wait, but wait, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Because 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is: 

O
||
O-C-O-CH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait no, that would be CH(CH2OH)COOCH3, which is 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think of propanoic acid as CH2CH2COOH, but that's not correct. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not possible because the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Or wait, perhaps it's CH(CH2OH)COOCH3. No, no, wait. Wait, the correct structure is:

The propanoate ester. The parent chain is three carbons. The ester is at the end, so the structure would be:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the central carbon (second carbon) has the OH group. So the structure is:

CH2(OH) connected to CH2, which is connected to COOCH3. Wait, that would be the first carbon as CH2OH, second as CH2, third as COOCH3?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me structure it as follows:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

Wait, that can't be right because the ester is at the end. Alternatively, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, that's correct. So the structure is:

COOCH3 is on carbon 3, carbon 2 has the OH, and carbon 1 is a methyl group. So the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this structure, the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- a methyl group (CH3 from the left)
- a hydroxyl group (OH)
- a carbonyl group (from the COOCH3)
- and another carbon from the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no. Let me count the bonds. Carbon 2 is CH(OH). So, it's connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3
- Carbon 3: COOCH3 (which is a carbonyl group attached to OCH3)
- Two hydrogens? Wait no, because the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So carbon 2 is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- OH
- and another H?

Wait, no, wait. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then carbon 2 is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- OH
- And another H, making it a chiral center.

Because four different groups are attached: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So that's a chiral center. So this compound has a chiral center, so it can exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 shows optical isomerism.

Option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, where Ph is the phenyl group. The structure is two benzene rings connected to a ketone (C=O) group. The structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar, where Ar is phenyl. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's see. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen. So the structure is:

Ph
|
C=O
|
Ph

Wait, no, it's actually two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl carbon. So the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. So the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph

In this case, the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, one O (double bond), and another single bond (to the other phenyl). Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is only bonded to two phenyl groups and O. So, for benzophenone, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph

So the central carbon is connected to two identical groups (Ph), a carbonyl oxygen, and another Ph? No, wait, no. The structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph

So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two benzene rings and an oxygen. So each substituent is a phenyl group. So the substituents on the carbonyl are two phenyl groups and the double-bonded oxygen. Are there any other substituents? Wait, the carbonyl carbon has three substituents: two phenyls and the oxygen. But wait, wait, no, the carbonyl group is O=C-Ph2. Or is it Ph2CO? So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and an O, and the fourth bond is a double bond to O. So, the carbonyl carbon has no other substituents, just two phenyl groups, an O double bond, and the other substituent is the other phenyl? Wait, no. Let me clarify. The structure of benzophenone is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph

The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups. So, the substituents are two phenyls and a double bond O. So the central carbon has two phenyl groups and a double bond O. So, the substituents are two phenyls (same), O (from double bond), and another single bond? Wait, no, because the carbonyl is O=C, so the structure is Ph–C(=O)–Ph, which means the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and the O.

Wait, but that's three substituents. For a carbon, four bonds. Oh wait, the carbonyl is a double bond, so the central carbon is connected via double bond to O, and via single bonds to two phenyl groups. So, the substituents are two phenyl groups and a double bond O. But the fourth bond would be another single bond? No, wait, the carbonyl is O=C, so the structure is O=C-R. So in benzophenone, R is diphenyl. So, the carbonyl carbon has two phenyl groups and a double bond O. But that's only three substituents. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again: the carbonyl group is C=O, so the structure is Ph–C(=O)–Ph. So the central carbon is bonded to two Ph groups and an O via a double bond. So, that's three substituents, but a carbon must have four bonds. So perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe benzophenone is Ph-C-O-Ph, but that's not correct. No, benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, so the structure is Ph–C(=O)–Ph. So the central carbon has two phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and no other substituents. Wait, that's impossible because the central carbon must have four bonds. So perhaps the structure is Ph–C(=O)–Ph, meaning the central C is double-bonded to O and connected to two Ph groups, and the fourth bond is a single bond to another Ph? That would make it (Ph)3C=O, which is not benzophenone. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but I think I should proceed.

Regardless, the point is whether benzophenone has any stereogenic centers. Since the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups, a double bond O, and maybe another substituent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a trigonal planar structure around the carbonyl, making it symmetrical. So, if the two phenyl groups are identical, the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and is symmetrical, so it doesn't show optical isomerism. So option 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. I think maleic acid is a cis-dicarboxylic acid, but wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Wait, no, I think fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Wait, maleic acid is cis, and fumaric is trans. Wait, actually, maleic acid is the cis-dihydroxy derivative, and fumaric is the trans. But when it's the di-ester, like dimethyl fumarate, does it have any double bonds or other stereogenic centers?

Wait, let me think. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, which is a trans-dicarboxylic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would have a structure like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is two ester groups connected by a double bond. Wait, fumarate comes from fumaric acid, which has a trans configuration. So fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH (no, wait, no—fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where each COOH is replaced by COOCH3, and the double bond is still present. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2COOCH3)2? No, wait, wait. Wait, the actual structure of fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 on each end? No, that's not correct. Let me get this right. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, that's not correct either. Actually, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans di-ester. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that's not correct because that would imply a single bond. Wait, no, the correct structure is:

Each ester group is on a carbon that's connected by a double bond. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, two ester groups (COOCH3) attached to a double bond, with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

But wait, that's not correct because that would be a central double bond with two COOCH3 groups on either end. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

So, each COOCH3 group is attached to a carbon that's part of the double bond. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2? No, wait, no, each COOCH3 is attached to the double bond carbons. So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - C=C - O-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, no, that's not correct either. Alternatively, the structure is:

Each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. So we have:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

So, each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. Now, in this structure, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond because it's the trans isomer (fumarate is the trans di-ester of maleic acid). So, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on opposite sides, leading to a possibility of geometric isomerism, but not optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Optical isomerism arises from chiral centers or from axial chirality in certain cases, like allenes. But in this case, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's see. The structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

But arranged trans. So, the substituents (COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, this molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, and thus it doesn't have optical isomerism. But wait, wait—no, wait. If the substituents are on opposite sides, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So option 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another second. Fumarate is the trans isomer, and it's a di-ester with a double bond. Does it have any stereocenters? No, because the double bond is between two carbons each attached to two ester groups. So each of those carbons has two COOCH3 groups and two double bonds, but no, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 and two other carbons in the double bond. So each has two identical substituents (COOCH3), which doesn't create a chiral center. So, no chiral centers, and the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. So, no optical isomerism. Thus, option 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, what's the structure again? Dimethyl fumarate is the trans ester. So the structure is (Z)- or (E)-? No, wait, fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. So each COOCH3 is on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, summarizing each option:

1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. I'm not entirely sure, but I think biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can have axial chirality. In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. I think that if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it can have optical isomerism. So I'll say option 1 shows optical isomerism.

2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Has a chiral center, so shows optical isomerism.

3: benzophenone. No chiral centers, symmetrical, no optical isomerism.

4: dimethyl fumarate. Trans double bond, but symmetrical, no optical isomerism.

So the compounds that show optical isomerism are options 1 and 2. Looking back at the options provided:

Options given:

A) 1,2,4
B)3,4
C)2,3
D)1,2

So the correct answer would be option A if 4 was correct, but earlier analysis says 4 doesn't show optical isomerism. Wait, did I make a mistake with option 4?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, right? Because the carbons attached to the double bond are each connected to two COOCH3 groups, which are identical. So no, they aren't chiral centers. So option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, dimethyl fumarate's structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond in a trans configuration. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has two identical substituents (two COOCH3 groups). Therefore, each of those carbons has two identical groups (COOCH3), making them non-chiral. So no, no chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

So, the only compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.

Wait, but wait again. Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The substituents are at 6,6' (nitro) and 2,2' (ester). So the biphenyl has substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Are these positions symmetric? Let's imagine the biphenyl. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. Are the substituents in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry? Let me think about it.

If the substituents are in positions 2 and 6 on each ring, which are meta to each other on the benzene ring, then perhaps the arrangement leads to asymmetry. For example, if the two rings are connected in such a way that the substituents are all in positions that break symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

Wait, the molecule is symmetrical if the substituents are in positions that mirror each other. For example, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetric around the central axis. Let me imagine the biphenyl: each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, for each ring, the substituents are on adjacent carbons. Wait, positions 2 and 6 on a benzene ring are meta, not adjacent. So, in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 go around. So, position 2 is next to 1 and 3, and position 6 is next to 5 and 1. So, positions 2 and 6 are across from each other (para positions are 1 and 4, 2 and 5, etc. Wait, no: the positions are numbered such that position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6, position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3, position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1. So positions 2 and 6 are separated by two carbons each way—so they are meta to each other. Hmm, so for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are meta. So, when you have two rings connected by a single bond, with each ring having substituents at 2 and 6, which are meta, the overall structure might be asymmetrical.

Wait, but if both rings have substituents in the same relative positions, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. For instance, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two rings. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to a non-superimposable mirror image.

I'm a bit confused about whether the molecule is chiral. Another approach: if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is not chiral. If it doesn't, it is chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me imagine looking at the molecule from the side. If the substituents are in positions that make the left and right sides mirror images, then it's symmetrical. But if they aren't, then it's asymmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro groups are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical. Wait, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6. So if the two rings are connected such that the substituents on each are in positions that don't mirror each other across the central bond, then the molecule is chiral.

Wait, perhaps because the substituents are on opposite sides of the biphenyl, creating a lack of symmetry. For example, if the two rings have substituents in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, the molecule would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Let me think: each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So, if the two rings are connected in such a way that when you rotate the molecule 180 degrees around the central bond, the substituents' arrangement remains the same. Wait, but that depends on their positions.

Wait, if the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Because each ring has the substituents in the same relative positions. So the overall structure would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Hmm, but I'm not so sure. Because when you have a biphenyl, the arrangement around the central bond can lead to different isomers based on the substituents' positions.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Another way to determine if a compound has a plane of symmetry. For example, if there's a mirror plane that bisects the molecule into two mirror images.

In the case of option 1: the substituents are on each ring's 2 and 6 positions. So if I imagine the central bond connecting the two rings, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So when looking from the top, each ring has the nitro and ester at certain positions. If the substituents are arranged such that across the central bond, their positions mirror each other, then the molecule is symmetrical. But wait, if the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides, it could affect symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps this compound is a case of biphenyl with substituents leading to axial chirality. Axial chirality refers to the arrangement of substituents around the central axis of a molecule, such as in biphenyls or allenes. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they can't be superimposed on their mirror image, the molecule is chiral.

In option 1, each ring has a nitro and ester group. The positions are 2 and 6 on each ring. So, when connected, the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that might not be symmetrical. For example, if the nitro and ester groups on each ring are on opposite sides relative to the central bond, the molecule could lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, I think that when the substituents are in such a way that they don't mirror each other across the central bond, the molecule is chiral. So, if the substituents on the two rings are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, perhaps option 1 is chiral and shows optical isomerism. Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are options 1 and 2.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1 and 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought option 4 didn't show it. Oh wait, no, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

So the correct answer would be D: 1 and 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought option 4 doesn't show it, which was correct.

So, to recap:

Option 1: Yes, optical isomerism due to axial chirality.

Option 2: Yes, due to chiral center.

Option 3: No.

Option 4: No.

Thus, the correct answer is options 1 and 2, which is option D.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chirality, which arises from non-superimposable mirror images, typically due to chiral centers or axial chirality.

### Option 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with nitro groups at positions 6 and 6' and ester groups at positions 2 and 2' on each ring. The substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring create asymmetry in the molecule. The lack of a plane of symmetry across the central bond leads to axial chirality, making this compound capable of exhibiting optical isomerism.

### Option 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a methyl group (CH3), a hydroxyl group (OH), a carbonyl ester group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen atom (H). This creates a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.

### Option 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical phenyl groups. Since all substituents on the carbonyl carbon are either identical (two phenyl groups) or involve a double bond (oxygen), there are no chiral centers. The molecule is symmetrical and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Option 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the trans di-ester of maleic acid, with the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)2. The two carbonyl ester groups (COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion  
The compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are **Option 1** (due to axial chirality) and **Option 2** (due to a chiral center). Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
