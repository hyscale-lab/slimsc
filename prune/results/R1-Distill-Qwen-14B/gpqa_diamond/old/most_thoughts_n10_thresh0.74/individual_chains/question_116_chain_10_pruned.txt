Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the problem involves several reactions and identifying a final compound. Let me break it down.

First, there's Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration gives the number of hydrogens. So, 6H as a triplet and 4H as a quartet. Let me think about what structure that could correspond to.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm is probably from a methyl group adjacent to another CH2. Like maybe (CH3)2CH something. Because a triplet usually comes from coupling with two neighboring hydrogens. For example, if it's a methyl group next to a CH2, the CH2 would split the methyl into a triplet.

Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet suggests each of those protons is next to a CH2 group with two protons. Wait, or maybe it's a set of two CH2 groups. Let's think: 4H as a quartet. Could be two sets of two protons each. Maybe it's a -CH2CH2- group where each CH2 is next to another CH2, leading to a quartet. So like if you have CH2CH2, each H in the first CH2 is split into a quartet by the adjacent CH2.

Putting it together: 6H as a triplet (probably two methyl groups attached to a CH2) and 4H as a quartet (maybe a CH2CH2 group). Wait, but wait, another possibility: maybe the quartet is from a CH2 group adjacent to a CH2 with two protons. So perhaps an ethyl group where the CH2 next to the CH3 is split into a quartet by the adjacent CH2.

Wait, no, if it's two CH2 groups in a row, like CH2CH2, each would be a triplet? Or maybe a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH2... but that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, another thought: How about a cyclopropane situation? No, probably not.
