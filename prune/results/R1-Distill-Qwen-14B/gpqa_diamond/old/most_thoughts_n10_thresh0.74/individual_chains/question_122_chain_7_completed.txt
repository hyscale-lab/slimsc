Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions and NMR questions. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts with acetic acid being treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm, I remember that when you treat acetic acid with acetic anhydride and something else, it's often an acetylation reaction. Oh wait, bromine and pyridine... Oh right, I think that's the conditions for the formation of an acyl bromide. So acetic acid reacting with acetic anhydride and a base like pyridine (which probably deprotonates and helps as a catalyst) would form acetyl bromide. So product 1 is probably acetyl bromide, which is CH3COBr.

Next, product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2. Wait, heating an acyl bromide with ethanol and acid sounds like an acid-catalyzed nucleophilic acyl substitution. So the Br would be replaced by an ethanol group. So product 2 should be ethyl acetate, which is CH3COOEt (Et is CH2CH3). Because in this case, the bromide leaves and the ethanol attacks the carbonyl.

Then, product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3. Sodium cyanide is a good nucleophile. So in this step, we're probably doing another nucleophilic acyl substitution. The ethyl ester would react with CN- to form a nitrile. Wait, wait. No, wait: when you substitute the ester's OR group with CN, that would give an acyl cyanide? Or maybe it's a hydrolysis? No, because the conditions are with sodium cyanide, which is a nucleophile. So the ester (ethyl acetate) would react with CN- to form an acyl cyanide. So product 3 would be CH3COCN, which is acetyl cyanide.

Wait, but wait a second. Ethyl acetate is an ester, R-O-CO-R'. So when treated with CN- in a nucleophilic acyl substitution, the OR group is replaced by CN. So the product is CH3COCN, yes. So product 3 is acetonitrile? No, wait, acetonitrile is CH3CN. Oh wait, wait. Acetyl cyanide is CH3C(O)CN. Hmm, but that's a possibility. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is first hydrolyzed to the acid, but with sodium cyanide, maybe the acid would react. Wait, but the treatment is with NaCN, so it's more likely a direct substitution.

Wait, let me think again. The ethyl acetate structure is OEt-CO-OEt? No, wait, ethyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH3. So when treated with NaCN, since CN- is a strong nucleophile, it would attack the carbonyl. But wait, the ester is less reactive than the acid, but in the presence of a base? Or maybe after some activation.

Alternatively, perhaps the conditions are not aqueous, so it's just a substitution. So the OEt group is replaced by CN. So the product would be CH3COCN, which is an acyl cyanide. So that's product 3.

Now, product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming product 4. Sodium hydride is a strong base, so it's likely deprotonating something. 1,5-dibromopentane is an alkylating agent, probably providing a pentyl group. So what's happening here?

Product 3 is CH3COCN. When treated with a strong base like NaH, perhaps it deprotonates the nitrile. Wait, but nitrile protons are usually not acidic enough. Alternatively, maybe the base is deprotonating the alpha position of the carbonyl. Wait, CH3C(O)CN has alpha positions on the carbonyl, but wait, the carbonyl is between the methyl and the cyano group. So the alpha carbons are the methyl group. Are there any protons there? No, because CH3 is attached to the carbonyl. So maybe the base is abstracting a proton elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the nitrile group is converted into an amide or something else. Or maybe the NaH is activating the nitrile for alkylation. Or perhaps the nitrile is acting as a leaving group? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the NaH is deprotonating the nitrile. Wait, nitriles are generally not very acidic, but perhaps the base can abstract a proton from the alpha position, such as the CH3 group.

Wait, CH3C(O)CN is an acyl cyanide. When treated with a strong base like NaH, perhaps the base deprotonates the alpha hydrogen (the CH3 group). But wait, the CH3 group is attached to a carbonyl, so the alpha hydrogens are acidic. But wait, in acetyl cyanide, the structure is CH3-CO-CN. The alpha hydrogens are the CH3's H's. The pKa of those is around 20, I think. So NaH (which is a strong base, pKa ~35-40) might deprotonate it. So deprotonation would give a resonance-stabilized carbanion: CH2-CO-CN^-.

Then, the 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide. So perhaps it undergoes an elimination or a substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a two-step alkylation. Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane has two leaving groups. So perhaps the carbanion attacks one of the bromide groups, leading to alkylation.

Wait, but how? Let's think about the structure. 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So when sodium hydride is present, it's a strong base. Maybe it's deprotonating the dibromopentane, but that's probably not the case because the C-Br protons are not that acidic. Alternatively, the NaH could deprotonate the CH3 in the acyl cyanide, making a carbanion. Then, the carbanion would attack one of the CH2 groups in the dibromopentane, displacing a bromide. But wait, the dibromopentane is symmetrical, so perhaps both ends are the same. So the carbanion could attack either end, leading to an alkylation.

So when the carbanion (CH2-CO-CN^-) attacks one of the bromides in 1,5-dibromopentane, it would substitute the Br. So the product would have a pentyl group attached where the H was. Wait, but the structure would be CH2-CO-CN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br? No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, if the carbanion is at CH2-CO-CN, and it attacks a CH2Br in the dibromopentane, then the structure would become CH2-CO-CN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- with the Br leaving. Wait, no, the substitution would replace the Br with the R group (from the carbanion). Wait, maybe the carbanion attacks one of the end CH2Br groups. So for example, the structure after substitution would be CH2-CO-CN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- with the R group added.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that each substitution would add a pentyl group. But wait, 1,5-dibromopentane has two Br atoms on adjacent ends of a five-carbon chain. So perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon group, but in this case, maybe it's adding two five-carbon groups because there's excess NaH and excess dibromopentane.

Wait, but product 3 is CH3COCN. Then, when treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps the carbanion abstracts a proton from the dibromopentane. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromopentane acts as a dihalide, and the carbanion does a double alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the carbanion (from CH3COCN) attacks one Br in the dibromopentane, adding a pentyl group. Then, perhaps another equivalent of the carbanion attacks the other Br in the same dibromopentane molecule, adding another pentyl group. But wait, would that be possible? Let's think.

The dibromopentane is symmetrical, so each end is the same. So perhaps the first substitution would give a mono-alkylated product, but then another substitution could occur, leading to a di-substituted product. But wait, the starting carbanion is CH2-CO-CN^-.

So, let's model it:

The carbanion is CH2-CO-CN^-, which attacks the CH2Br in the dibromopentane. The Br leaves, and the CH2-CO-CN^- becomes attached to the CH2. So the product after the first substitution would be CH2-CO-CN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-+ (but wait, no, that's just adding one group). But wait, the product would be CH2- (from the carbanion) attached to the CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- group after substitution.

Wait, maybe the attack is at the first bromine. So the carbanion (CH2-) attacks the CH2Br end, giving CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-CN.

Wait, but that would result in the structure CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CO-CN. Wait, that can't be right because the chain length doesn't match. Let me clarify: 1,5-dibromopentane is CH2Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So when the carbanion (CH2^-) attacks one of the Brs, say the first one, it would add a CH2 group to that end. So the product would be CH2-CH2^-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. Wait, no, that's not right. The substitution would replace the Br with the R group.

Wait, the general reaction would be:

R-Br + Nu^- â†’ R-Nu + Br^-

In this case, Nu^- is the carbanion from CH2-CO-CN. So the Nu would attack the CH2Br, replacing Br with the R group (CH2-CO-CN). So the product would be CH2-CO-CN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, because the other end is also Br. But with excess reagents, perhaps two substitutions occur.

Wait, perhaps each molecule of the dibromopentane can undergo two substitutions. So each molecule would lose both Br atoms and have two R groups attached. So the product would be (R)CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-R, where R is CH2-CO-CN. So the structure would be (CH2-CO-CN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2-CO-CN).

Wait, but that would make a symmetrical molecule with two acyl cyanide groups attached to the ends of a five-carbon chain. So the structure would be:

CH2-CO-CN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-CN.

Wait, that can't be right because 1,5-dibromopentane is CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So when each Br is replaced by CH2-CO-CN, the product would be CH2-CO-CN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-CN. But wait, that seems like a 6-carbon chain, but the dibromopentane is 5 carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon group. So the product would be a longer chain. Let me think again. The starting material is CH3COCN (product 3). When treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps each NaH deprotonates the CH3COCN to form a carbanion, which then does a substitution on the dibromopentane. Since the dibromopentane has two Brs, each substitution would add a five-carbon group to the carbanion.

Wait, but the carbanion is from CH3COCN, which has a CH2 group after deprotonation. So after adding two five-carbon groups, the structure would be (CH3COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon group, but in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon group to each end, leading to a longer chain. Wait, maybe the product is a di-substituted compound where each substitution adds a five-carbon group.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial substitution is on the CH3 group of CH3COCN. So when the CH3 is deprotonated, the carbanion is CH2-COCN. Then, it attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane, substituting Br with the CH2-COCN group. So the product after first substitution would be CH2-COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. But since there's excess reagents, perhaps the second substitution occurs, replacing the other Br with another CH2-COCN group. So the product would be CH2-COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COCN. Wait, but that's 10 carbons in total. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a di-substituted compound where each substitution adds a five-carbon group. So the structure would be:

(CH2-COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2-COCN)

So that's CH2-COCN-CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-COCN.

Wait, that would make a 10-carbon molecule with two acetyl cyanide groups at each end.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Let me think again about the reactions.

So, product 3 is CH3COCN. Then, when treated with NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, NaH would deprotonate CH3COCN to form CH2COCN^-.

Then, the CH2COCN^- would attack one of the Br atoms in the dibromopentane, leading to substitution. The product would be CH2COCN-CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. But wait, but that's only one substitution. Since the dibromopentane has two Brs, and we have excess reagents, perhaps another substitution occurs. So the CH2COCN^- attacks the other Br, leading to CH2COCN-CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2COCN.

Wait, but wait, the structure would be CH2COCN attached to each end of a five-carbon chain. So the molecule would be:

CH2COCN - CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 - CH2COCN

Wait, but that would imply a 10-carbon chain, with two acetyl cyanide groups at each end.

Hmm, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon group, making a longer chain. For example, each substitution adds a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group. So the initial CH2COCN would become CH2COCN-CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2COCN.

Wait, but that's what I was thinking earlier. So product 4 would be that structure.

Now, the question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4. How many distinct hydrogen signals would be observable?

First, let's imagine the structure. It's a symmetrical molecule with two acetyl cyanide groups at each end of a five-carbon chain. So:

CH2-COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COCN

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. The structure after substitution would be:

(CH2-COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2-COCN)

So the overall structure is a five-carbon chain with CH2-COCN groups on each end.

Wait, no, the substitution would add each CH2-COCN group to each end of the five-carbon chain. So the structure would be:

CH2-COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - COCN

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the dibromopentane is CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br, so substitution on each end would give:

(CH2-COCN)CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2(CH2-COCN)

Wait, no, that would make a nine-carbon molecule, which doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a CH2 group from the dibromopentane. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible structure of product 4.

Alternative approach: product 3 is CH3COCN. When treated with NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps the nitrile group is being alkylated. But wait, nitriles are generally not very reactive towards alkylation under basic conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the NaH is deprotonating the nitrile to form an anion, which then attacks the dibromopentane.

Wait, perhaps the NaH deprotonates the nitrile. Wait, nitriles have protons on the adjacent carbon only if it's not a primary nitrile. Acetone nitrile is CH3CN, which has no adjacent Hs. So product 3 is CH3COCN, which is an acyl cyanide. The structure is O=C(Nâ‰¡C)-CH3. So the alpha position is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the NaH is deprotonating the methyl group, making a carbanion: CH2(-)-COCN. Then, this carbanion attacks the dibromopentane, leading to substitution. Each substitution adds a five-carbon group.

So each substitution would replace a Br with the CH2-COCN group. Since 1,5-dibromopentane has two Br atoms, perhaps two substitutions occur, leading to a molecule where each end is a CH2-COCN group attached to a five-carbon chain. So the structure would be:

CH2-COCN - CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 - CH2-COCN

Wait, but that's a 10-carbon molecule with two acetyl cyanide groups at each end. But in this structure, the two ends are symmetric, so perhaps some of the hydrogens would be equivalent.

So, the structure would have a central five-carbon chain with two acetyl cyanide groups attached via CH2 groups at each end.

Now, let's analyze the NMR of this molecule.

In the 1H NMR, each distinct set of equivalent hydrogens would give a signal. Let's look at each part:

1. The CH2 groups attached to the carbonyl (COCN) would have two sets. Wait, no, because the two ends are symmetric. So each end is CH2-COCN, and the central chain is five carbons. So:

- The end CH2 groups (attached to COCN) are identical on both ends. So each has two Hs, but since the molecule is symmetric, these would be equivalent.

- The next CH2 groups in the chain would be the ones adjacent to the central chain. Let's think about the structure as:

(CH2-COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2-COCN)

Wait, no, that's not correct because the chain between the two CH2-COCN groups is five carbons. Wait, no, the chain from the substitution would be the five carbons in between. So the structure is (CH2-COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2-COCN). So this is a nine-carbon molecule, with two CH2-COCN groups on each end.

Wait, no, wait. The starting dibromopentane is CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So when each Br is replaced by CH2-COCN, the structure becomes (CH2-COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2-COCN). So the central chain is five CH2 groups, and each end is a CH2-COCN group.

Wait, but that would make the central chain (the five CH2 groups) as:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

So the entire molecule is:

CH2-COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - COCN.

Wait, no, that's not right. The correct structure is (CH2-COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2-COCN), which is a nine-carbon molecule. Because each substitution adds a CH2 group, so the central chain is five CH2 groups, plus two CH2 groups on each end, making seven CH2 groups in total. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the count wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (CH2-COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COCN. Wait, but that would have six CH2 groups in the chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon group. So each end of the central chain is substituted with a five-carbon group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2-CO-CN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2-CO-CN)

So the central chain is five CH2 groups, and each end is a CH2-CO-CN group. Thus, the entire molecule is a symmetrical structure with the two CH2-CO-CN groups on either end of a five-carbon chain.

Now, let's count the distinct hydrogen environments.

Let me label the structure as follows:

A - B - C - D - E - F - G

Where A is CH2-CO-CN, B is CH2, C is CH2, D is CH2, E is CH2, F is CH2, and G is CH2-CO-CN.

Wait, that can't be right because the central part is five CH2 groups. So, the structure is:

A-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-A

Where each A is CH2-CO-CN.

So the molecule is symmetric. So each end is identical.

Now, looking at each CH2 group:

1. The terminal CH2 groups (A) are next to the COCN. Each has two Hs. But because the molecule is symmetric, the Hs on both ends are equivalent. So this is one signal.

2. The CH2 groups adjacent to the central chain: these are the CH2 groups attached to the end CH2 groups. Let me call them B and F. But since the molecule is symmetric, B and F are equivalent. So the Hs here would be another signal.

Wait, no, the structure is A-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-A, so the CH2 groups in the middle are all connected in a row. So:

- CH2 (A) - CH2 (B) - CH2 (C) - CH2 (D) - CH2 (E) - CH2 (F) - CH2 (A)

Wait, that can't be right because the central part is five CH2 groups. So the structure is:

A-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-A

Hmm, perhaps I should consider each CH2 in the chain:

Positions:

1: A (CH2-COCN)
2: CH2
3: CH2
4: CH2
5: CH2
6: CH2
7: A (CH2-COCN)

Wait, that can't be right because the main chain would be seven carbons, but the starting dibromopentane has five. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a CH2 group. So, the structure after two substitutions would be:

(CH2-COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2-COCN)

Which is a seven-carbon molecule. Because the starting dibromopentane has five carbons, and each substitution adds a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is (CH2-COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2-COCN), which has seven CH2 groups in the chain. But that seems a bit long. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution adds a five-carbon group, but that would complicate the structure more.

Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the possible NMR signals.

If the final product is a symmetrical molecule, the number of distinct signals would be less because of equivalent positions.

Assuming the structure is (CH2-COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2-COCN), which is a seven-carbon molecule with two CH2-COCN groups on each end.

The middle five CH2 groups are in the chain.

Looking at each position:

1. The terminal CH2 (attached to COCN): each has two Hs. Since the molecule is symmetric, both ends are the same. So this is one signal.

2. The next CH2 group (position 2 and 6): each is adjacent to a terminal CH2 and a central CH2. These are equivalent due to the symmetry, so one signal.

3. The next CH2 group (position 3 and 5): these are in the middle of the chain, but wait, in a seven-carbon chain, positions 3 and 5 are symmetric. Wait, no, because positions 3 and 5 would be equidistant from the center. So their environments are equivalent, giving one signal.

4. The central CH2 (position 4): this is the middle of the chain, so it's equivalent on both sides. So another signal.

Wait, but in a seven-carbon chain, that would mean positions 1 and 7 are the same (terminal), positions 2 and 6 are the same, positions 3 and 5 are the same, and position 4 is in the center. So that's four signals from the CH2 groups. But wait, each of these positions has two Hs, but they're all in different environments.

Wait, but perhaps the central CH2 is a triplet or something else. But regardless, each position would contribute a distinct signal if their environments are different.

Additionally, the COCN groups are attached to CH2, which are part of the terminal groups.

So, the CH2 groups would give four signals: terminal, positions 2 and 6, positions 3 and 5, and the central position 4.

But wait, the COCN is a substituent on the CH2, so each terminal CH2 has two Hs in an identical environment. So that's one signal.

The next CH2 groups (positions 2 and 6) each have two Hs in an identical environment, another signal.

Positions 3 and 5: same environment, another signal.

Position 4: unique, another signal.

So that's four signals from the CH2 groups.

But wait, what about any other Hs? In this case, the COCN group is CH3COCN, but wait no, product 4 is the alkylated product. So in product 4, each end is CH2-COCN, so the CH3 from the original acetic acid is now part of the CH2 group attached to the COCN.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: product 3 is CH3COCN. When the methyl group is deprotonated by NaH, the CH3 becomes CH2^-. Then, substitution occurs at the dibromopentane, adding a five-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps each substitution adds a CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 group, but that would make the structure longer. Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a CH2 group, leading to a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the two CH2-COCN groups are on each end of a five-carbon chain, making the molecule symmetric.

In any case, perhaps the NMR would have the following signals:

1. The terminal CH2 groups (each with two Hs) â†’ 1 signal.

2. The CH2 groups adjacent to the terminal CH2 (each with two Hs) â†’ 1 signal.

3. The CH2 groups further along the chain (each with two Hs) â†’ 1 signal.

4. The central CH2 group (two Hs) â†’ another signal.

Wait, but in a five-carbon chain, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2-COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2-COCN)

So that's seven carbons in total. The middle would be the third CH2 group.

So in this case, the CH2 groups would be:

Positions 1: CH2-COCN (two Hs) â†’ 1 signal.

Positions 2 and 6: CH2 next to the ends â†’ same environment, 1 signal.

Positions 3 and 5: CH2 in the middle â†’ same environment, 1 signal.

Position 4: central CH2 â†’ 1 signal.

So that's four signals from the CH2 groups.

Additionally, any other Hs? Perhaps the COCN groups have any Hs attached, but in this case, the COCN is attached to the CH2 group, which is part of the chain. So the COCN itself doesn't contribute any Hs.

Wait, no: CH3COCN is acetyl cyanide, which has a methyl group attached to the carbonyl. But in product 4, the methyl group would have been deprotonated and substituted, so the COCN is attached to a CH2 group in the chain. So the COCN doesn't have any Hs attached in product 4.

So the total signals would be four from the CH2 groups.

Wait, but earlier I thought there were more. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is symmetric, so perhaps the NMR signals are fewer.

Alternatively, maybe each CH2 group in the chain is unique, leading to more signals.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 groups are in different environments. For example, in a seven-carbon chain:

Positions 1 and 7: same environment â†’ 1 signal.

Positions 2 and 6: same â†’ 1.

Positions 3 and 5: same â†’ 1.

Position 4: unique â†’ 1.

So four signals.

But wait, the actual structure might have more CH2 groups. Let me count again.

Wait, the molecule is (CH2-COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2-COCN). So the central part is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, which is five CH2 groups. So the entire structure is:

CH2-COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - COCN.

Wait, no, that can't be right because that's seven CH2 groups in the chain, making nine carbons in total, which seems too long. So perhaps the substitution occurs only once, giving a single CH2 group attached.

Wait, perhaps the initial substitution adds a five-carbon group, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for alternative reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is a di-substituted acetylene or something else, but that doesn't seem to fit the reaction conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the final structure is a cyclic ether or something else, but I don't think so.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of NaH with 1,5-dibromopentane could generate a strong base that deprotonates and forms a Grignard-like reagent. But with the presence of NaH, perhaps it's more of an alkyne or some other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution adds a single pentyl group. But given that the reaction uses excess NaH and dibromopentane, perhaps two substitutions occur.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a gem-dibromide, but that doesn't make sense.

I think I'm stuck on visualizing the structure correctly. Let me try to think of the NMR possibilities regardless.

Assuming product 4 is a symmetrical molecule with two identical ends, perhaps the number of signals would be as follows.

Let's imagine the molecule is a seven-carbon chain with two CH2-COCN groups at each end.

The structure: CH2-COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - COCN.

Wait, that's nine carbons, which might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution adds a single CH2 group to each end, making the central part a five-carbon chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted alkane with two CH2-COCN groups attached to a five-carbon chain.

In any case, the key is to determine how many distinct CH2 groups are present.

If the molecule is symmetric, then the CH2 groups equidistant from the center would have the same environment, contributing to the same NMR signal.

So, for a five-carbon chain (so a seven-carbon molecule including the two CH2-COCN groups), the CH2 groups would be:

- Ends: two Hs, same on both ends â†’ 1 signal.

- Next to ends: two Hs, same on both sides â†’ 1 signal.

- Middle CH2: two Hs â†’ 1 signal.

Wait, but in a five-carbon chain, the CH2 groups would be:

Positions 1 and 7: CH2-COCN â†’ same â†’ 1 signal.

Positions 2 and 6: adjacent to ends â†’ same â†’ 1 signal.

Position 3 and 5: symmetric â†’ same â†’ 1 signal.

Position 4: central â†’ 1 signal.

That's four signals from the CH2 groups.

So total of four signals.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 5, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I've missed some environments.

Another possibility: the COCN groups might have any Hs nearby, but I don't think so. The COCN is attached to a CH2 group, which is part of the chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile groups cause some splitting, but I don't think that affects the CH2 groups in the chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each substitution leads to a branching, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product is a 1,5-dipentyl acetylnitrile. So the structure is CH2-COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COCN. No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted acetylnitrile where each substitution adds a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the product is CH2-COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COCN, which would be a nine-carbon molecule. So the CH2 groups would be:

- Ends: two Hs â†’ 1 signal.

- Next to ends: two Hs â†’ 1.

- Middle three CH2 groups: each has two Hs. But are they all in the same environment?

In a nine-carbon chain, the CH2 groups would be:

Positions 1 and 9: same â†’ 1.

Positions 2 and 8: same â†’ 1.

Positions 3 and 7: same â†’ 1.

Positions 4 and 6: same â†’ 1.

Position 5: central â†’ 1.

So that's five signals from the CH2 groups.

Wait, that's more than four. So perhaps the structure leads to five signals.

Wait, but why would the structure have a nine-carbon chain? Because each substitution adds a five-carbon group. Hmm, perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a seven-carbon molecule where the two CH2-COCN groups are on each end of a five-carbon chain. So the structure would be: CH2-COCN - CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 - CH2-COCN.

Wait, that's a nine-carbon molecule, as each substitution adds a five-carbon group. But I'm not certain.

If that's the case, then the CH2 groups would be as follows:

1. Ends (CH2-COCN): two Hs â†’ 1 signal.

2. Next to ends (CH2 groups adjacent to ends): two Hs â†’ 1 signal.

3. CH2 groups at positions 3 and 7: two Hs â†’ 1 signal.

4. CH2 groups at positions 4 and 6: two Hs â†’ 1 signal.

5. Central CH2 (position 5): two Hs â†’ 1 signal.

So that's five signals from the CH2 groups.

If that's the case, the total number of signals would be 5.

But wait, the options given are A)8, B)5, C)10, D)12.

So option B is 5. But earlier I thought four, but perhaps I was mistaken.

Alternatively, perhaps there are more signals because each substitution doesn't create symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon group, making the central chain five carbons, and the two ends each have a CH2-COCN group. So the structure is:

(CH2-COCN) - CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 - (CH2-COCN)

Which is a seven-carbon molecule.

In that case, the CH2 groups would be:

Positions 1 and 7: ends â†’ 1 signal.

Positions 2 and 6: adjacent to ends â†’ 1.

Positions 3 and 5: symmetric â†’ 1.

Position 4: central â†’ 1.

So four signals from CH2 groups.

But in this case, how many signals in total? Four.

But none of the options is four. The options are 5,8,10,12.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some Hs.

Wait, perhaps the NaH and dibromopentane reaction leads to more than just adding CH2 groups. Maybe the product has other structures, such as rings or branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a cyclic structure. For example, 1,5-dibromopentane could form a five-membered ring upon substitution. But I don't think that's the case here because substitution would require two alkylation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaH deprotonates the acyl cyanide, leading to a carbanion that forms a Grignard-like reagent, which then adds to the dibromopentane. But even then, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substitution adds a single five-carbon group, leading to a mono-substituted product. But the problem states that product 4 is formed with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, so likely two substitutions occur.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaH deprotonates the acyl cyanide to form a carbanion, which then adds to the dibromopentane, displacing both Br atoms and forming a bridge. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution adds a single five-carbon group, making a mono-substituted product. But that would give a longer chain but only one substitution.

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to think about the possible answer.

The options given are A)8, B)5, C)10, D)12.

If the structure leads to five signals, option B would be correct. So perhaps the correct answer is 5.

But how?

If the molecule is a seven-carbon chain with two substituents on each end, leading to five distinct CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is:

(CH2-COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2-COCN)

Which is a seven-carbon chain, with two CH2-COCN groups on each end.

The CH2 groups would be:

1. Ends (positions 1 and 7): same â†’ 1.

2. Positions 2 and 6: same â†’ 1.

3. Positions 3 and 5: same â†’ 1.

4. Position 4 (center): 1.

So four signals.

But the options don't have four. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the nitrile groups are attached to the CH2 groups, which are part of the chain. So maybe each CH2-COCN group has a unique environment, but in the symmetric structure, they are equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the COCN groups have any Hs attached. No, because the COCN is a nitrile attached to a carbonyl, which is attached to a CH2 group. So no Hs directly attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaH and dibromopentane reaction leads to a different kind of product, such as a gem-dialkylation or a different substitution pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic structure, but I can't see how that would form under these conditions.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option B)5.


The problem involves a multi-step organic synthesis starting with acetic acid and ending with a compound whose $^1$H NMR spectrum is analyzed for distinct hydrogen signals. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reaction 1**: Acetic acid reacts with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride to form acetyl bromide (CH$_3$COBr). This is a nucleophilic acyl substitution where acetic anhydride acts as a catalyst.

2. **Reaction 2**: Acetyl bromide reacts with ethanol and sulfuric acid to form ethyl acetate (CH$_3$COOCH$_2$CH$_3$). This is another nucleophilic acyl substitution where ethanol replaces the bromine atom.

3. **Reaction 3**: Ethyl acetate reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) to form acetyl cyanide (CH$_3$COCN). This is a nucleophilic acyl substitution where the cyanide ion replaces the ethoxy group.

4. **Reaction 4**: Acetyl cyanide is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. NaH deprotonates the methyl group of acetyl cyanide, forming a carbanion (CH$_2$COCN$^-$). This carbanion undergoes two nucleophilic substitutions with 1,5-dibromopentane, replacing both bromine atoms with CH$_2$COCN groups. The final product is a symmetrical molecule with the structure:

   $$(CH_2COCN)-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-(CH_2COCN)$$

   This is a nine-carbon chain with two acetyl cyanide groups (CH$_2$COCN) at each end.

### Analysis of the $^1$H NMR Spectrum:
The molecule is symmetric, and the distinct hydrogen environments are determined as follows:

1. **Terminal CH$_2$ groups (CH$_2$COCN)**: These are equivalent on both ends of the molecule, giving **1 signal**.

2. **CH$_2$ groups adjacent to the terminal groups (positions 2 and 8)**: These are equivalent due to symmetry, giving **1 signal**.

3. **CH$_2$ groups further from the ends (positions 3 and 7)**: These are equivalent due to symmetry, giving **1 signal**.

4. **CH$_2$ groups near the center (positions 4 and 6)**: These are equivalent due to symmetry, giving **1 signal**.

5. **Central CH$_2$ group (position 5)**: This is unique and gives **1 signal**.

Thus, there are **5 distinct hydrogen signals** in the $^1$H NMR spectrum of the final product.
