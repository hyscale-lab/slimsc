Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. So, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a particular observable and getting a specific outcome. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by operators, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of those operators.

The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I'm a bit confused—should this be a normalized state vector? Because usually, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are unit vectors, meaning their length (or norm) is 1. Let me check: the components are -1, 2, 1. So the norm would be the square root of (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2. That's 1 + 4 +1 =6, so sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. Hmm, does that matter for the calculation? I think it does because probabilities depend on the square of the coefficients. So perhaps I should normalize the state vector first.

The observable is given by the matrix P. Let me write down matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/√2, 0), second row (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), third row (0, 1/√2, 0). Okay, so it's a 3x3 matrix. I'm trying to find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0.

So, the first thing I need to do is find the eigenvalues of matrix P because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's component in the state.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, the expectation value of P can be found using the state vector, but since the question is about the probability of getting 0, that's when the eigenvalue is 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.

So, let me start by finding the eigenvalues of P. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

So, let's compute the matrix P - λI.

P is:
[ 0        1/√2      0     ]
[1/√2     0        1/√2  ]
[ 0        1/√2     0     ]

So, P - λI would be:
[ -λ      1/√2      0     ]
[1/√2   -λ        1/√2  ]
[ 0      1/√2     -λ     ]

Now, the determinant of this matrix is:

| -λ        1/√2         0         |
|1/√2      -λ          1/√2      |
| 0         1/√2       -λ         |

To compute the determinant, I can expand it. Let's see. The determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or the cofactor expansion. Let's go with the cofactor expansion along the first row.

So, determinant = (-λ) * det of the minor matrix for (1,1), which is the 2x2 matrix:
[ -λ    1/√2 ]
[1/√2  -λ   ]

Minus (1/√2) times the determinant of the minor for (1,2), which is:
[1/√2  1/√2 ]
[ 0     -λ   ]

Plus 0 times the minor for (1,3), which we can ignore because it's multiplied by zero.

So, let's compute each part.

First term: (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
= (-λ) [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: minus (1/√2) times [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]
= - (1/√2) [ (-λ / √2) - 0 ]
= - (1/√2) * (-λ / √2)
= - (1/√2) * (-λ / √2) = (λ)/(2)

Wait, no, wait. Let me redo that part. The minor matrix for (1,2) is:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3. So the minor is:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, -λ]

So the determinant is (1/√2)*(-λ) - (1/√2)*0 = (-λ)/(√2) - 0 = -λ/√2.

So the second term is minus (1/√2) multiplied by (-λ/√2) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) )= λ/(2).

So putting it all together:

Determinant = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) 

Wait, no: the first term is (-λ)(λ² - (1/√2)^2 ) = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2 ). And then the second term is (1/√2) * ( -λ/√2 ) but wait, the minor determinant is -λ/√2, and the cofactor is multiplied by (-1)^(1+2) which is -1. So:

Wait, maybe I messed up the signs. Let me carefully recompute the determinant.

The determinant expansion along the first row:

= (-λ) * det[ (-λ, 1/√2 ), (1/√2, -λ) ) ] 
- (1/√2) * det[ (1/√2, 1/√2 ), (0, -λ) ) ] 
+ 0 * det(...) 

So, det of the first minor is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2 ) = λ² - (1/2).

So the first term is (-λ)(λ² - 1/2 ) = -λ^3 + (λ/2 )

Second term: the minor is:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [0, -λ ]

Determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) )= (-λ/√2 )

So the second term is - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2 ) = (1/√2)(λ/√2 ) = λ/2.

So putting it all together:

Determinant = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2 )

= -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2 )

= -λ^3 + λ

So, the determinant is -λ^3 + λ = 0.

Set this equal to zero:

-λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) =0 → λ (1 - λ² )=0 → λ =0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

The question asks for the probability of measuring 0. So we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 and then compute the squared amplitude of the state vector in that eigenvector's direction.

Wait, but the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). But I need to make sure it's normalized. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1,2,1).

Alternatively, when calculating the probability, maybe it's easier to first normalize the state, but perhaps it's not necessary because probabilities are based on the square of the inner product, which would handle the normalization factor.

Wait, but let me proceed.

First, find the eigenvectors for λ=0. So, solving (P - 0 I ) |v> =0 → P |v> =0.

So the matrix P is as before:

[0 1/√2 0]
[1/√2 0 1/√2]
[0 1/√2 0]

We can write the equations:

Equation 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 +0*v3 =0 → v2 =0.

Equation 2: (1/√2) v1 +0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → v1 + v3 =0.

Equation 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 +0*v3 =0 → v2=0.

From equation 1 and 3, v2=0. Then equation 2
