Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, so it's about some salts A and B that are heated, and then the gases formed go through some reactions in different tubes. The goal is to find the total number of atoms in the original salts.

Alright, let's break down what's given. So, the mixture of salts A and B weighs 7.20 grams, and when heated, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through three tubes. 

The first tube is Mg(ClO4)2, which is anhydrous. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent. So, any water vapor in the gas would react with it. The weight of tube 1 increased by 3.60 grams. That must mean that the gas passing through had some water, which was captured by Mg(ClO4)2. So, the increase in mass is the mass of the water that was absorbed.

Then, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change. Wait, Ca(OH)2 is a base. If any acidic gases like CO2 were present, they would react with the solution. But since the weight didn't change, maybe there was no CO2? Or perhaps the solution didn't react because the conditions were right? Or maybe the gas wasn't acidic? Hmm.

The third tube is red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed. So, the gas that passed through must have reacted with copper. The reaction between carbon monoxide (CO) and copper at high temperatures produces CO2 and copper metal. Alternatively, maybe it's hydrogen reacting? Wait, but CO is more likely because when CO reacts with Cu, it gets oxidized.

Wait, another possibility is that the gas was H2. If the gas was H2, then passing it through hot Cu wouldn't react, because H2 needs a catalyst for such reactions, and maybe the conditions here aren't suitable. So perhaps it's CO reacting. Let me think: when CO reacts with Cu, the reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + C. Wait, no, wait. Actually, CO is a reducing agent. So, if CO passes through red-hot copper, it would oxidize. The reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + C (solid). So, the CO would react, and the mass of the tube would increase by the amount of CuO formed. But wait, the mass increase is 0.80 grams. 

Let me calculate the moles of CuO formed. The molar mass of CuO is 80 g/mol (Cu is ~63.55, O is 16). So 0.80 g / 80 g/mol is 0.01 mol. So, 0.01 moles of CuO. That would mean that 0.01 moles of CO were consumed, because the reaction is 2CO → CuO (since each mole of CO reacts to form 0.5 moles of CuO). Wait, wait. Let me write the balanced equation. 

The reaction between CO and Cu when heated is:

2 CO + Cu → CuO + C

So, for every 2 moles
