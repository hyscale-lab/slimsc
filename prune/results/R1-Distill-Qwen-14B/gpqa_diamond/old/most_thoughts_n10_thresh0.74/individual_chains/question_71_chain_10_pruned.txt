Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think this through.

The question says there are five exoplanets in orbital resonance, with orbital periods in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They used the TTV method, but I think that's just a red herring for the question because TTV stands for transit timing variations, which is a detection method. But the main point is about the equilibrium temperatures.

All the planets have the same albedo, so that shouldn't affect the ratio. Right, albedo is about how much light reflects, but since it's the same for all, it won't change the temperature ratio.

Equilibrium temperature... I remember the formula is something like T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), but wait, wait. Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature considering the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. Oh right, I think the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) ), where a is the semi-major axis. Or wait, maybe it's T proportional to the square root of (L/(16πσ a²)) ), but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, I think the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature can be calculated by considering the energy balance. The star emits L, and the planet absorbs a fraction (based on albedo), but since all have same albedo, that cancels out in the ratio.

Wait, the key is that the equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square of the distance from the star. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance. So if planet 2 is at a distance a2 and planet 4 at a4, then the ratio of their temperatures would be sqrt(a2/a4), because temperature is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), but since L is same for all (assuming same star), it's (1/a^2)^(1/4) = 1/a^(1/2). So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So the ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt(a2/a4).

But wait, the orbital periods are given. So I need to relate the periods to the semi-major
