Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and muons are like heavier electrons. Neutrinos are really light, almost massless. The question is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. Wait, neutrinos are tricky because their mass is so small, but I think in many problems they're considered massless unless stated otherwise. So I can probably ignore the neutrino's rest mass here.

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta. That means their momenta are the same in magnitude but opposite in direction. But how does that help with kinetic energy?

I remember that in such decay processes, energy and momentum are conserved. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion because it's stationary. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

So the initial energy is m_pi c², which is 139.6 MeV. The energy after decay is the sum of the energies of mu and nu. The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible). 

Wait, but since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its energy is equal to its momentum times c. Hmm. Let me set up the equations.

Let me denote:
m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²
m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
m_nu ≈ 0

Let me think about energy conservation:
Energy before decay = Energy after decay
m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu

Momentum before = 0, so:
p_mu = -p_nu (equal in magnitude, opposite direction)
So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p (let's say)

But E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )
E_nu = p c (since m_nu=0)

So substituting into energy equation:

m_pi c² = sqrt( p² c² + m_mu² c^4 ) + p c

Hmm, maybe I can divide both sides by c² to make it easier, but maybe it's better to square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let me rearrange the equation:

sqrt(p² c² + m_mu² c^4) = m_pi c² - p c

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me denote x = p c.

Then, sqrt( x² + (m_mu c²)^2 ) = m_pi c² - x

Squaring both sides:

x² + (m_mu c²)^2 = (m_pi c² - x)^2
Expanding the right side:
= m_pi² c^4 - 2 m_pi c² x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

(m_mu c²)^2 = m_pi² c^4 - 2 m_pi c² x

Rearranging terms:

2 m_pi c² x = m_pi² c^4 - (m_mu c²)^2

Divide both sides by 2 m_pi c²:

x = [ m_pi² c^4 - (m_mu c²)^2 ] / (2 m_pi c² )

Hmm, let me compute the numerator. Let's factor out c^4:

= [ (m_pi^2 - (m_mu)^2 c^2 / c^4 ) ] * c^4 ) / denominator.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me think again. Let's not multiply by c's yet.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to work in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics. So, with c=1, the equation becomes:

x = [ m_pi² - m_mu² ] / (2 m_pi )

Because, let's see:

Earlier equation: 2 m_pi c² x = m_pi² c^4 - (m_mu c²)^2

Divide both sides by 2 m_pi c²:

x = [ m_pi² c^4 - m_mu² c^4 ] / (2 m_pi c² )

Factor out c^4:

x = c² (m_pi² - m_mu² ) / (2 m_pi c² ) 

The c² cancels: x = (m_pi² - m_mu²) / (2 m_pi )

So x is p c, so p = x / c.

But in c=1 units, p = x.

So p = (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi )

Wait, but since m_pi = 139.6, m_mu = 105.7.

Compute m_pi squared: 139.6^2 ≈ let me calculate:

139.6 * 139.6. Let's approximate.

139.6 = 140 - 0.4. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 ≈ 19488.16.

Similarly, m_mu^2 = 105.7^2. Let me compute 105^2 is 11025. 0.7^2 is 0.49. The cross term is 2*105*0.7 = 147. So 105.7^2 = (105 +0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Divide by (2 * m_pi) which is 2 * 139.
