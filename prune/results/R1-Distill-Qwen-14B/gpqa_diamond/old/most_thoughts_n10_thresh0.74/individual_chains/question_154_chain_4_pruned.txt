Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound the spectral data corresponds to. Let me start by going through each piece of information step by step.

The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's also a peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, wait, the molecular ion is at 156, but there's another peak at 158. That might indicate the presence of a chlorine atom because Cl has an atomic mass of approximately 35, but considering isotopes, the Cl-35 and Cl-37 would cause the molecular ion to appear as a doublet. Oh wait, but wait, the molecular ion is at 156. Let me think about the possible molecular formulas.

The molecular weight is 156. Let's see, for benzoic acid derivatives. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2, which has a molecular weight of 122 (C=12, H=1, O=16). So if the compound is 156, that's 34 more than benzoic acid. Hmm. Maybe a substitution with Cl? Wait, Cl is about 35.5, so adding a Cl would increase the molecular weight by around 35.5.

Wait, let me calculate: 156 minus 122 is 34. So that's almost exactly a Cl substitution. Because 35.5 is close to 34? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps there's a carbonyl group and some substituents.

Looking at the IR data: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests the presence of an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid (which usually has a peak around 1700 cm^-1) or maybe an ester or acid chloride. Wait, acid chlorides have higher carbonyl stretching frequencies, around 1800 cm^-1, I think. So 1720 is more in line with a carboxylic acid or maybe an ester.

Wait, but benzoic acid's carbonyl peak is around 1700. So 1720 might be a bit higher, but perhaps due to the substituent or other factors. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Ester carbonyls are usually around 1720-1740. Hmm, so that could be it.

Now the 1H NMR: Let's look.

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): That's a strong singlet. A singlet with such a high chemical shift is likely an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the OH protons are usually around 10-12 ppm and are deshielded, appearing as broad singlets. But here it's a sharp singlet, which might suggest something else. Wait, but maybe it's part of an aromatic
