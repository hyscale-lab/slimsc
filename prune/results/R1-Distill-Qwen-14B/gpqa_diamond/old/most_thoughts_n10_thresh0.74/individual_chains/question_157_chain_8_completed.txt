Okay, so I've got this question about designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak. Hmm, let's think through this. I remember that retroviruses are RNA viruses, right? So their genetic material is RNA, not DNA. When designing a diagnostic kit, the method depends on what you're detectingâ€”like, whether it's the virus itself or the antibodies against it.

The question is about choosing the best approach. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's go through each.

Option A says to identify the virus using symptoms and then do a nested PCR. Wait, nested PCR is a technique where you do multiple rounds of PCR to increase specificity. But if the virus is new, relying on symptoms might not be accurate. Plus, PCR targets DNA. Since retroviruses have RNA, you might need to make cDNA first. So maybe A isn't the best.

Option B suggests cDNA sequencing first, then real-time PCR. Oh, right, because for retroviruses, you'd convert RNA to cDNA using reverse transcriptase. Once you have the cDNA, you can sequence it to identify the virus. Then, real-time PCR would be a quick way to detect the virus in patient samples. Real-time PCR is good because it's fast and quantifies the amount, which is helpful for diagnosis. Sounds plausible.

Option C uses DNA sequencing and a regular PCR. Wait, but the virus is RNA-based, so DNA sequencing wouldn't make sense unless they're talking about host DNA, which isn't right. So C probably isn't correct.

Option D is about IgG antibodies and an ELISA kit. ELISA tests for antibodies, which would indicate a past infection, not an active one. But for quick diagnosis, especially in an outbreak, you might want to detect the virus itself, not antibodies. Also, antibodies can take time to develop, so maybe the test would miss acute cases. So D might not be the best choice for initial diagnosis.

So putting it together, the correct approach would involve identifying the virus via cDNA sequencing because it's an RNA virus, then using real-time PCR for quick detection. That points to option B.


To design a molecular diagnostic kit for detecting a retrovirus, it is important to consider that retroviruses are RNA viruses. The first step should involve identifying the virus by performing cDNA sequencing, as this process converts the viral RNA into cDNA, which can then be analyzed to confirm the presence of the virus. Once the virus is identified, real-time PCR is an effective and rapid method for detecting the virus in patient samples. This approach is both quick and accurate, making it ideal for diagnosing an outbreak.

Option A is less suitable because nested PCR is not the most efficient method for diagnosing retroviruses, and relying on symptoms may not provide accurate identification. Option C is incorrect because DNA sequencing is not applicable to RNA viruses like retroviruses. Option D focuses on detecting IgG antibodies, which indicate past infection rather than active infection, making it less suitable for quick diagnosis during an outbreak.

Answer: B
