Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically about using a transgenic mouse model and some cloning issues. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about why the protein isn't being overexpressed as expected after introducing a construct into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The construct includes the coding sequence for GADD45G with an added influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine for transfection and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, but the protein isn't being expressed. The provided DNA sequence is the plus strand of the construct.

First, I need to figure out what's wrong with the sequence. Maybe there's an issue with the reading frame or a stop codon somewhere. Let me think about how the sequence might have errors.

Looking at the sequence, I'll try to check for any in-frame stop codons. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the start codon (ATG) should be right after the HA sequence. The sequence starts with ATG, which is correct because that's the start codon. So the initial part is the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, let me see. The HA tag is a short peptide, right? Its coding sequence is something like YPYDVPDYA. The DNA for that would be something like ATG TAC CCC ATC GAT G... Hmm, looking at the beginning of the given sequence: 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, the first part is ATG TAC CCC ATC GAT G... The HA tag's DNA is ATG TAC CCC ATC GAT G... which is correct. So the start codon is ATG, then the HA tag begins.

So after the HA tag, the GADD45G coding sequence should follow. But perhaps there's a premature stop codon in the construct.

Looking through the sequence, I need to find any instances of TAA, TAG, or TGA. Those are the stop codons. Let me scan the sequence.

Looking through the sequence in triplets:

Positions 3-5: TAC (tyrosine)
6-8: CCA (proline)
9-11: TAC (tyrosine)
12-14: GAT (aspartic acid)
15-17: GCT (alanine)
18-20: TCC (serine)
21-23: AGA (arginine)
24-26: TCG (serine)
27-29: CGC (alanine)
30-32: GGA (glycine)
33-35: AGA (arginine)
36-38: AGT (serine)
39-41: CC G (wait, need to see the exact triplet. Let me count as I go.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to scan the sequence for stop codons. Let's go through the sequence:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA. Let me see:

Starting from the beginning:

The first 12 bases: ATGTACCCATACGATG

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the next triplet after ATG is TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), then TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), etc.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any TGA, which is a stop codon. Alternatively, look for any TAG or TAA.

Looking for TGA:

Looking through the sequence:

Looking for 'TGA' in the sequence. Let me go through:

The sequence is:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Let me see if any triplet is TGA. Scanning:

Looking at parts:

In the part: ...GCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, I think I see a TGA in the middle. Let me check: 'TGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'

In the substring 'TGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'

Looking for TGA, I see that 'TGA' is present in the sequence 'TGAACGTGGAC...' So the triplet is T G A A C G T... Wait, wait, no. The triplet is TGA as in positions: Let's see, looking at the sequence:

Within this part: 'TGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'

So the first three letters are T G A → TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh no! So right after the HA tag (which starts with ATG TAC ...), the next codon is TGA, which would terminate translation early.

Wait, how does this happen? Because the construct was supposed to have the HA tag followed by GADD45G. But if the HA tag's coding sequence ends with a TGA, that's a problem. Let me think about the HA tag coding sequence.

The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, but maybe the coding sequence in the construct is messed up. The HA tag's DNA is usually in frame, so the HA coding sequence must end before the start of the GADD45G. But looking at the sequence, the HA part is ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the HA tag is added as the N-terminal, so the construct's first part is HA, then GADD45G. But in the given sequence, the HA coding sequence seems to be followed by a TGA. Let me check: the HA coding would start with ATG (start), then the HA sequence. The HA tag's coding is ATG TAC CCC ATC GAT G... and so on. So after the HA coding, the GADD45G should start. But in the provided sequence, after the HA, the next codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the ribosome would terminate translation at that point, making a very short HA tag plus a few amino acids, but not the full-length GADD45G.

So the issue is that the HA coding sequence is followed by a stop codon. But why? Did they introduce a mutation there?

Wait, the options are:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.

C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

Hmm. So the problem is that the construct has a stop codon after the HA tag. So the gene is being translated but the ribosome stops at TGA, leading to a truncated protein, which is why they can't overexpress it—maybe the protein isn't functional or is unstable.

Wait, but the question says they're unable to overexpress the protein. So if the construct has a stop codon, the protein won't be expressed at all, or only a small peptide. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is followed by a stop codon, leading to no full-length protein being made.

So looking at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That's exactly the case because there's a TGA in the sequence. So the ribosome would stop there. So the protein isn't being expressed because the mRNA has a stop codon early on.

Alternatively, option C says the lack of linker leads to proteolysis. But if the protein is being made, regardless of linker, but it's being cut, that would be a problem. But in this scenario, the protein isn't made at all because translation stops early.

Option A says a missense mutation in the HA determinant. But the TGA is the problem, not a missense. So the HA sequence itself would have a mutation leading to a stop, but the HA coding sequence is supposed to be the tag, not the entire GADD45G. So if the HA coding has a stop, the protein is aborted.

Wait, but the HA tag is a short peptide, so perhaps the coding sequence for the HA was not correctly followed by the GADD45G. So in the construct, right after the HA, there's a TGA, leading to early termination.

So the problem is that the HA coding sequence is followed by a stop codon, which is a mistake in the construct. So when the mRNA is made, the ribosome translates until the stop codon, making a small peptide, not the full-length GADD45G with HA tag.

So looking at the options, the reason is that the construct has a stop codon in the coding sequence. So which option matches this?

Looking at the options again:

A) Missense mutation in HA sequence.

But the issue is a stop codon, not a missense. So A is about a mutation leading to a wrong amino acid, but here it's a stop codon.

B) Ribosome terminated early. That's exactly what's happening because of the TGA.

C) No linker causing proteolysis. That's a possibility if the protein is made, but quickly degraded. But in this case, the protein isn't being made at all.

D) No tRNA for UAA. But UAA is a stop codon, and all cells have mechanisms to recognize stop codons, so this is unlikely.

So the correct answer would be B—the ribosome stopped early because of the TGA.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition of the HA tag introduced an in-frame stop codon. So the HA sequence must have been altered, perhaps by a frameshift or a mutation that adds a stop.

Wait, the plus strand starts with ATG and then the HA coding. So the TGA is part of the HA coding, leading to a premature stop.

So the reason is that the HA coding has a stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early, so the GADD45G isn't expressed. So the problem is that the HA coding has a TGA, which is a stop codon.

So the issue is in the construct's coding sequence for the HA tag. So the correct answer would be B, because the ribosome stops early.

But wait, looking at the options, option A says the HA has a missense mutation. But in our case, the HA sequence is followed by a stop codon. So the HA coding is incorrect, but not a missense—it's a stop. So maybe the question is about a frame shift or an incorrect addition that introduces a stop. If the HA coding has an inserted or deleted base that causes a frameshift, leading to a premature stop, that would be a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA coding was correctly placed, but the GADD45G coding starts with a stop codon.

Wait, but looking at the DNA sequence, after the HA coding, the next codon is TGA. So the problem is that the HA coding includes a TGA, which is a stop. That would mean the HA coding is longer than intended, or perhaps a mistake during cloning caused this.

So the construct has a premature stop, which causes the ribosome to terminate translation early. Hence, the protein isn't expressed.

So in the options, B says the ribosome terminated early, which is correct.

Option C is about proteolysis due to missing linker. But if the protein isn't made, that's not the issue. So B is more likely.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein is not working as expected. The construct includes the coding sequence for GADD45G with an N-terminal HA tag. Upon analyzing the provided DNA sequence, a premature stop codon (TGA) is identified immediately after the HA tag sequence. This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being synthesized. 

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:**  
  This option suggests a single amino acid change in the HA tag. However, the issue here is not a missense mutation but the presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) in the HA coding sequence, which terminates translation early. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early:**  
  This is correct. The premature stop codon (TGA) in the construct causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed. This matches the observed issue.

- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:**  
  Proteolysis refers to the degradation of the protein after it is synthesized. However, in this case, the protein is not being synthesized at all due to the premature stop codon. Therefore, this option does not explain the problem.

- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:**  
  All cells, including mouse cells, have mechanisms to recognize and translate stop codons like UAA (or TGA in the DNA sequence). Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The issue is that the premature stop codon (TGA) in the construct causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed. This aligns with option **B**.
