Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to think through it step by step. The question is about evaluating a volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and only has a radial component. 

Wait, I remember that the divergence of a vector field is a measure of the source or sink at a point. So, divergence being high means a lot of field lines are starting or ending there. But I'm not sure exactly how to calculate that for this specific field.

The field is radial, so in spherical coordinates, all the components except the radial one are zero. So f(r) must be (F_r, 0, 0), right? And the magnitude is F_r = 1/r². So F_r = 1/(r²) in the radial direction.

Now, the divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field that only has a radial component is given by the derivative of the radial component with respect to r, divided by r². Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. Oh right, the divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² F_r) + ... other terms for angular components. But since F_θ and F_φ are zero, those terms drop out. So divergence ∇·f is (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r ). 

So substituting F_r = 1/r², let's compute that. So r² F_r is r² * (1/r²) = 1. Taking the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = (1/r²)(0) = 0? That would mean the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at r=0.

Wait, but wait a minute. That can't be right because the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. Oh, because when r approaches zero, the field might have a problem, but the divergence is zero elsewhere. So the integral of the divergence over the volume would be the integral of zero plus any contributions from the origin.

Wait, but what if the divergence isn't zero at the origin? Wait, actually, the divergence formula I used assumes that F_r is twice differentiable, right? So maybe at the origin, which is r=0, the function isn't smooth. So perhaps the divergence isn't zero there, and that's
