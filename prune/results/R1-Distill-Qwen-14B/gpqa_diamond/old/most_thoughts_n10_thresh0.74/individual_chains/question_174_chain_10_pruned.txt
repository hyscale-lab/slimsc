Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The fragments' masses are in a 2:1 ratio, and together their rest masses sum up to 99% of M. We need to find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) using the correct relativistic approach and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, which means the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me denote the masses. Let the more massive fragment have mass 2m, and the other m. So total mass after fission is 3m. But wait, the problem says the sum is 99% of M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the more massive fragment is 2m = 0.66 M, and the lighter one is 0.33 M.

Rest mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. So the rest mass energy of each fragment would be, well, their rest masses multiplied by c². But when they split, some mass is converted into kinetic energy. Wait, the total energy after fission includes the rest masses of the fragments plus their kinetic energies. Oh right, and since the nucleus was at rest, the total energy after should be the sum of the rest masses plus the kinetic energies, but energy must be conserved. Hmm, but I think in this problem, the initial rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV. So when the nucleus splits, the total energy after should also be 300 GeV plus any binding energy released? Wait, no, because binding energy is usually considered as part of the rest mass. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of conservation of energy and momentum.

So the initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments have momenta p and -p, since momentum must be conserved. So p1 = p,
