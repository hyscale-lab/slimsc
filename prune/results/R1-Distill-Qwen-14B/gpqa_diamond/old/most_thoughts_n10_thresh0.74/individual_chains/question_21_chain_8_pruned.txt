Okay, so I have this chemistry question about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements. There are two types: constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in structure, while stereoisomers have the same structure but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question is in two parts, A and B. For part A, I need to determine which of the given compounds doesn't show tautomerism. The compounds are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. For part B, among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, I need to find which shows optical isomerism.

Let me tackle part A first. Tautomerism occurs when a compound has the ability to shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, resulting in structural isomerism, typically involving keto-enol tautomerism. So, do either of these compounds exhibit that?

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a quinone, which is an aromatic compound with two ketone groups. Quinones are known for their keto form. Wait, but can they tautomerize? Tautomerism usually involves moving a hydrogen from one position to another, like in enols and ketones. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups, but in a conjugated system. Wait, but in quinones, the structure is such that the two carbonyl groups are conjugated. So, maybe they're in a fixed position. Wait, can they tautomerize? I'm a bit fuzzy here. Alternatively, maybe quinones can't tautomerize because the structure is already conjugated and doesn't have an acidic proton that can shift. Or perhaps they can undergo some tautomerism, but wait, I'm not sure.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This molecule has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. So, positions 1,3,5 are all carbonyls. Are these all conjugated? Well, in a six-membered ring, three alternating ketones would form a conjugated system. So, each carbonyl is adjacent to another. But for tautomerism, I think you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl that can move. Wait, in each ketone, the carbonyl is adjacent to CH2 groups. So, each ketone is at 1,3,5 positions, and the adjacent carbons (like 2,4,6) would be CH2. So, the hydrogens on these adjacent carbons (like on C2) can potentially tautomerize. Wait, but in a cyclic system like this, perhaps the structure is rigid. Hmm, maybe this compound can show keto-enol tautomerism because each ketone is adjacent to a CH2 group, which has hydrogens that can shift. So, in that case, the cyclohexane trione might exhibit tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. Benzoquinone is a bicyclic compound, right? It's two benzene rings connected by an oxygen bridge. Or wait, no, benzoquinone is a single benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone is C6H4O2, with two ketone groups. So, it's a 1,4-diketone. In such a structure, perhaps the two ketones are conjugated and might not have acidic hydrogens that can shift, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach. Tautomerism usually requires that the molecule has at least one hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. Benzoquinone has two ketones. The adjacent carbons in a 1,4-diketone would be two CH groups. So, on each ketone, the adjacent carbons are CH. So, maybe they have acidic hydrogens. If so, they can undergo tautomerism, like enolization. Wait, but benzoquinone is more likely to be in its keto form because the enol form would be less stable? Or perhaps it's more about whether the molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because it's a conjugated system and the enol form isn't favored. Hmm, I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about which of the two compounds can undergo tautomerism. The cyclohexane trione has three ketones, each adjacent to a CH2 group. So, each ketone has alpha hydrogens (two on each adjacent CH2). Those hydrogens can tautomerize, leading to enol forms. So, cyclohexane trione would show tautomerism, which means that benzoquinone might not. Or wait, maybe benzoquinone can't because the structure is rigid and conjugated, making tautomerism impossible or very unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the hydrogens are not in a position to shift. Or maybe both can or can't. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups in the para positions (1,4). So, the structure is O=C6H4-C=O. The adjacent carbons would be CH, but in a conjugated system. In such a case, the alpha hydrogens are part of the aromatic system. Wait, but in a benzene ring, the hydrogens are all part of the aromatic ring and are sp2 hybridized. So, in the case of benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are at 1 and 4 positions. The adjacent carbons (2 and 3, 5 and 6) are CH groups. But these are in a conjugated system, so the hydrogens are in the aromatic ring. So, can these hydrogens tautomerize? Because tautomerism requires the movement of a hydrogen from an sp3 to sp2 orbital, or vice versa. If the hydrogens are already sp2, like in the aromatic ring, moving them might not be possible. So, maybe benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism because the alpha hydrogens are already in the sp2 state, part of the aromatic ring.

In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Each ketone is at every other carbon, so the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups. These CH2 groups have hydrogens that are sp3 hybridized. So, these hydrogens can tautomerize, shifting from one position to another, making enol forms. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

Wait, but the question is asking which compound does NOT show tautomerism. So, if cyclohexane trione does show tautomerism, then benzoquinone is the one that doesn't. So, A would be benzoquinone.

So, for part A, the answer is A is benzoquinone.

Now, moving to part B: between methyl 2-h
