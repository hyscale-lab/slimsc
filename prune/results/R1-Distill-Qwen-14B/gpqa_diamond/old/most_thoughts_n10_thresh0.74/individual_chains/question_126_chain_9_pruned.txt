Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two reactions, I and II. Then, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. I need to find out how many peaks they observe in each.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one has a ketone at position 3. So, after LAH, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. The molecule would become (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the configuration. The starting material is (S) configuration. When LAH reduces a ketone to an alcohol, it adds a hydride. The ketone is at C3. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3... Wait, no, wait. Let me draw this structure. Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on C3. So, the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3, but wait, the actual structure is longer. Let me see: it's 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the six-carbon chain has a ketone at C3 and a methoxy at C5.

Structure: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3. But here, it's 5-methoxy. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3, but that's not the correct carbon count. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. So if the 5th carbon has a methoxy, it's on the fifth carbon. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3, but wait, wait. Let me count:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: OCH3

Wait, no, because hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)3. But 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon, which is the last CH2. So the structure is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, hexan-3-one: positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? No, wait, that can't be because that would make the methoxy on C6. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one: the carbonyl is on C
