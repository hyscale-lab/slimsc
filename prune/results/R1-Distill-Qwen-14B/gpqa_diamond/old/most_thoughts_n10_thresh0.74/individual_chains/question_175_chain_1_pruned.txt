Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let's see... The question is about the power radiated by an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped with the z-axis as its symmetry axis. They mentioned that because it oscillates, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ, measured along the z-axis.

The question is asking for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at θ=30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f in terms of λ. The options are A through D, each giving a fraction and a power dependence on λ.

I remember from my electromagnetism classes that when a charge oscillates, it radiates electromagnetic waves. The radiation pattern depends on the charge's motion. For a spheroid, which is kind of like a sphere that's been stretched along an axis, the symmetry would influence the radiation pattern.

Wait, what's the radiation pattern like for a dipole antenna? Oh right, for a dipole, the radiation is maximum at the equator (θ=90 degrees) and falls off as you go towards the poles (θ=0 and 180). The radiation pattern is sin²θ, if I'm not mistaken. So the intensity varies with θ as sin²θ. If that's the case, then the maximum occurs when sinθ is 1, so θ=90 degrees. Then at θ=30 degrees, the intensity would be sin²(30), which is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the fraction of the maximum power at θ=30 would be 0.25, which is 1/4.

But wait, wait. Is that the right approach here? The problem states that the charge distribution is spheroid, which I think is a dipole-like configuration. So the radiation pattern would be similar to a dipole's, which I think is proportional to sin²θ. So at θ=30 degrees, the power per unit solid angle is (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the maximum.

But the maximum power is A. So the fraction would be 1/4, so the first part of the answer is 1/4. Looking at the options, options B and C have 1/4 as the fraction. So those are possible.

Now, the second part: the form of f as a function of λ. What determines the dependence of the radiated power on λ?

I think about the power radiated by an oscillating charge. The power in electromagnetic radiation is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the charge, and the higher order terms based on the multipole expansion. For a dipole, the radiated power varies with the square of the frequency. Wait, or is it higher?

Wait, the power radiated by an oscillating charge (dipole) is given by the Larmor formula. Larmor formula is P = ( (e² a² ) / (6πε₀ c³) ), where a is the acceleration. But for a harmonic oscillator, the acceleration a is proportional to ω², so P would be proportional to ω^4.

But wait, the frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by ω = 2π c / λ. So ω = 2π c λ⁻¹. Substituting into the power, which is proportional to ω^4, so that would be (λ⁻²)^4? Wait, wait. Let's see: ω = 2π c / λ, so ω^4 is (c^4)/(λ^4), since (1/λ)^4 is λ^-4. So then the power would be proportional to λ^-4.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The Larmor formula is for the total power, which is the integral over all angles, right? The total power is the integral of the power per unit solid angle times the solid angle (which is 4π). So the function f(θ, λ) is the power per unit solid angle, so it's the intensity. So what's the dependence on λ for the intensity?

The total power is P = 4π ∫ (f(θ) sinθ dθ dφ). And if the total power is given as A, then A is the integral of f over all solid angles.

For a dipole radiation, the intensity (power per solid angle) is proportional to sin²θ and also proportional to (ω^2 λ^2) or something? Wait, let me think about the expression for the intensity.

The electric field of a dipole radiation is E proportional to (p0 sinθ)/(r λ) (or something like that), and the Poynting vector (which gives the intensity) is E × H. The intensity is then proportional to the square of that. Wait, but another approach: for a dipole, the intensity (or the power per unit area at a distance r) is given by I = (μ₀ p₀² ω^4 sin²θ) / (12 π c² r²). So, since p is proportional to e x a (acceleration), and a is proportional to ω².

Wait, the dipole moment p varies sinusoidally as p = p0 sin(ωt). So the second derivative (acceleration) is proportional to ω² p0 sin(ωt), which affects the power.

But looking at the intensity expression, I is
