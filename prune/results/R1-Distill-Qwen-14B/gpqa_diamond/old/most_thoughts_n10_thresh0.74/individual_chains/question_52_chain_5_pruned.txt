Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves stars with dark spots and how they affect the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The star's parameters are given, and when there are spots, the effective temperature changes, which in turn affects the ratio.

First, let's break down the problem. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses, but I'm not sure if those details are directly relevant to the question. The main points are about the effective temperature and the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels.

Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that affect the photosphere? I remember that when spots are present, the darker regions (which are cooler) cover part of the star's surface. So the overall observed temperature would be a combination of the hotter and cooler regions.

But the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. Oh, right, this has to do with the Boltzmann equation in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)). Here, g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the ratio observed is (n1)/(n2), but the problem says that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. Hmm, let me think. If the ratio decreases, that means that the denominator (n2) is increasing relative to n1, so the fraction n1/n2 is getting smaller. So, the ratio (n1/n2) is going down when the star has spots.

Wait, but let's get back to the problem. The observed ratio when the star has spots is lower than when it doesn't. Wait no, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher than when it has spots. So, the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2) without spots divided by (n1/n2) with spots.

So, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots. Since each (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) * (g1/g2), because (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )^{-1}.

Wait, let me write the formula correctly. The ratio (n1/n2) is equal to (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no, more accurately, it's (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Since E2 > E1 (higher energy level), that would be (
