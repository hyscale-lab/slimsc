Okay, so I have this physics problem here about scattering of electrons. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that scattering amplitude involves phase shifts. The question gives me several phase shifts: δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, δ4, and tells me to ignore the rest. I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, the scattering amplitude, right. I think the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) involves the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by some spherical harmonics or something like that. But wait, along the incident direction, θ is zero. Oh right, the forward direction.

Wait, the general expression for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (u_l (k R))^* v_l (k R) ) * ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ), summed over l. But wait, when θ is 0, the direction is along the beam, so maybe only the l=0 term is non-zero? Because higher l terms involve angular dependence. Or wait, no, I think for the forward direction, it's the sum over all l, but for each l, the coefficient depends on the angles. Hmm, maybe I should think about the specific expression for the imaginary part in the forward direction.

Wait, the imaginary part of the amplitude is important because the cross-section relates to it. Oh right, the differential cross-section is proportional to |f|^2, and the imaginary part contributes to that. But the question is specifically about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0.
