Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. I remember that SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. From what I've studied, effective field theories are used when you have a high-energy theory (like the Standard Model) and you're considering the effects at lower energies, maybe after some heavier particles have been integrated out.

Now, the question is about symmetries. The options given are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. I think I need to recall what each of these symmetries entails.

Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is broader; it includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So Poincare implies Lorentz, but maybe not the other way around. Wait, but in the SMEFT, I think the theory is formulated in a way that respects Lorentz symmetry because it's a relativistic theory. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is definitely a yes.

Next, what about Poincare symmetry? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Poincare includes both Lorentz transformations and translations, so it's more about the full symmetry of Minkowski space. SMEFT is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model, which already respects Lorentz symmetry. But do these operators automatically respect Poincare? I'm not sure. I think because the theory is built in a way that respects translations as well, perhaps all operators in SMEFT do respect Poincare. Or wait, maybe Poincare isn't necessarily required because the effective theory might have operators that are non-renormalizable but still respect Lorentz, but could they violate Poincare? Hmm.

Wait, no, I think SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because all the operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, so they must be Lorentz-invariant. So Poincare symmetry would be automatically respected because the theory is invariant under Lorentz transformations and translations. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare is a combination of translations and Lorentz, but maybe the operators in SMEFT only need to respect Lorentz, not necessarily Poincare. Or maybe Poincare is automatically respected because the SM respects it, and SMEFT is an extension. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

The Standard Model is a Poincare-invariant theory, so SMEFT, being an extension, incorporates the same symmetries. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So both 1 and 2 would apply.

Then there's CP symmetry. CP stands for charge conjugation and parity. Do SMEFT operators have to respect CP? I don't think so. The SMEFT allows for operators that can break CP. For instance, certain Beyond the Standard Model theories predict CP violation, which can be captured in SMEFT via specific operators. So operators in SMEFT might not necessarily respect CP. So option 3 is not a must.

CPT symmetry is a combination of charge, parity, and time reversal. CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, especially for theories that are Lorentz invariant. Because SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT. So operator must respect CPT, so option 4 is correct.

So putting it all together, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait—does the SMEFT allow for operators that violate Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation invariance. I think translation invariance is a part of the underlying symmetry, but in an effective field theory, you might have operators that are nonrenormalizable, but translation invariance is still a thing. Wait, but all the operators in SMEFT are written in a way that they are Lorentz scalars, so they must be Poincare invariant as well. So yes, Poincare symmetry is respected.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose an operator is a Lorentz scalar, which it must be in SMEFT. Then it's automatically Poincare invariant because it's invariant under Lorentz and translation. Because the operators are constructed from the SM fields in a Lorentz-invariant way, and the theory is set in a Poincare-invariant spacetime, so the operators must respect that. So 1, 2, and 4 are correct.

So the correct options would be 1,2,4. Let me check the options. Option C is 1,2,4. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but let me confirm. Are all operators in SMEFT required to be CPT-invariant? Yes, because the theory is Lorentz-invariant, and CPT is a consequence of Lorentz symmetry in quantum theories. So CPT must be respected.

So the correct answer should include 1,2,4. Looking at the options:

Option C) 1,2,4.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators to describe interactions at lower energies. These operators must respect certain symmetries, and the question asks which symmetries are universally required.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic theory, and all operators in SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz scalars. This ensures that Lorentz symmetry is always respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is formulated in a Poincaré-invariant spacetime and all operators are Lorentz scalars, they are automatically Poincaré-invariant as well.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves charge conjugation and parity. SMEFT does not require operators to respect CP symmetry, as it allows for CP-violating operators consistent with Beyond the Standard Model physics.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry, which combines charge, parity, and time reversal, is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory for Lorentz-invariant theories. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is:

**Answer: C**
