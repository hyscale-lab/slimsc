Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to work through this.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric because it only involves dx and dy. So this is a 2-dimensional spacetime? Or maybe a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space? I'm not entirely sure, but let's proceed.

The question is about a pseudosphere. Oh wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid, which is the 3D shape, but when embedded in 3D space. But wait, in two dimensions, maybe it's a different concept. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hyperbolic space represented in 2D.

But the term 'pseudosphere' can sometimes be used in different contexts. Oh wait, maybe in this case, they're referring to a 2-dimensional surface that's topologically a sphere but with an imaginary radius, leading to negative curvature. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, a pseudosphere could be a surface with a metric that's like a sphere but in some way altered—for example, in the context of anti-de Sitter space or something similar.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the metric given. Let me write it down again:

ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²)

This looks
