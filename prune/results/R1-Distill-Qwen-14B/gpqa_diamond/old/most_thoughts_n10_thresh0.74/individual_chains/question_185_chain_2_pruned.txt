Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n vectors. Wait, sigma is the Pauli matrices, right?

So, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product means I have sigma_x times n_x plus sigma_y times n_y plus sigma_z times n_z, all multiplied by epsilon. So H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z).

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of this operator. Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(H - λI) = 0. But wait, for Pauli matrices, I think there's a shortcut. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But when they're combined in a dot product with a unit vector n, maybe the overall operator is similar to sigma_z but in a different direction.

Wait, think in terms of spin-1/2 systems. The Hamiltonian in such cases often corresponds to something like the spin in a magnetic field. The energy eigenvalues depend on the component of spin along the direction of the field. Oh right, for a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) sigma. So the Hamiltonian might be similar to that.

Wait, but the given H is ε times the dot product of sigma and n. Let's see: if H were proportional to sigma · n, then the eigenvalues would be plus and minus the magnitude of that term. Because the Pauli matrices have the property that their dot product with any unit vector n gives an operator whose eigenvalues are ±1, right? Because the trace is zero, and determinant is -1, so the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The trace is the sum of eigenvalues. The trace of H would be ε (n_x Tr(σ_x) + n_y Tr(σ_y) + n_z Tr(σ_z)). But each Pauli matrix has trace zero, so Tr(H) is zero. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The product of eigenvalues is determinant of H. Since H is a 2x2 matrix, determinant is (ε)^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2)
