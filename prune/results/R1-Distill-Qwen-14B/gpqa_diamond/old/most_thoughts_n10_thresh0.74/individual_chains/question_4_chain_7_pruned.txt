Alright, so I'm trying to tackle this Maxwell's equations question. Hmm, let me think. The question is about how Maxwell's equations would change in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles, meaning monopoles exist.

Wait, in our real world, magnets can't have isolated poles; every magnet has both a north and south pole. That's why the magnetic field lines form closed loops, right? So the divergence of the magnetic field is zero because there are no magnetic monopoles. Oh wait, yes, that's the one of Maxwell's equations. The equation is ∇·B = 0, which states that the magnetic field has no sources or sinks. So if there were magnetic monopoles, this equation would change because divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore.

But wait, the question says that Maxwell's equations look different, but which specific ones? Let me recall all four equations.

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. This relates to electric charge distribution. Since the question is about magnetic monopoles, this equation should remain the same, right? So it's not about E or electric fields changing here.

2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0. As I thought earlier, this would change if monopoles exist. Because monopoles would act as sources or sinks for the magnetic field. So in that case, ∇·B would equal μ₀ ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So this equation would definitely change.

3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. This one deals with the curl of the electric field and changing magnetic fields. I don't think this equation changes because it's about how changing B fields induce E fields. Unless the presence of magnetic monopoles affects this, but I'm not sure. Wait, in a universe with monopoles, maybe the form changes, but I'm not certain. Let me think. The original Faraday's law is about induced electric fields due to varying B fields. If B can have sources (monopoles), perhaps the equation doesn't change because it's about the time derivative. Hmm, maybe not.

4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): ∇×B = μ₀( J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t ). This equation deals with the curl of the magnetic field and current plus changing
