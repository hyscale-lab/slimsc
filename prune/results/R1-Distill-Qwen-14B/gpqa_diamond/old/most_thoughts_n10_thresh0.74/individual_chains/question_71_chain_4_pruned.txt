Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's think about what I remember from my studies. So the question says there are five planets in a system, all with circular orbits discovered via the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so I don't need to worry about that factor.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. The main formula I remember is the one that relates the temperature of a planet to its distance from the star. The formula is T = T_star * ( (R_star / (2a)) )^(1/2), but wait, no, that's for the effective temperature. Alternatively, I think the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Oh right, the basic formula for equilibrium temperature (assuming no greenhouse effect and uniform albedo) is T = T_eff (star) * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) )^(1/2) or something. Wait, maybe it's T = (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4). Because the flux received is L/(4πa²), and the planet's cross-section is πr², but it radiates from the entire surface, so the effective area is 4πr². So the equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L/(4πa²)) * (1/4) ) / σ ]^(1/4) ) → which simplifies to [ L/(16 π σ a²) ) ]^(1/4). 

But wait, L is the star's luminosity, but since all planets are orbiting the same star, their L is the same. So the temperature should be inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance a. Because T is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2). But wait, isn't a related to the orbital period through Kepler's third law? Oh right, Kepler's law says that P² is proportional to a³, assuming same star mass. So P² ∝ a³ → a ∝ P^(2/3). So combining this with the temperature relation, since T ∝ 1/√a
