Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e, and they have negligible mass. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and choose the correct option from A to D.

Hmm. So, the setup is that there's a central charge fixed at P, and twelve others arranged around it, each at 2 meters away. All charges are 2e. Since all charges are the same, they're all positive or all negative? Wait, the charge is 2e. e is the elementary charge, around 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each is 3.2e-19 C if positive, or -3.2e-19 C if negative. But what's the arrangement?

Wait, because all the charges are identical, so if all are positive, they would repel each other. But since twelve are fixed at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. Hmm, but wait, the 13th is fixed, so maybe the arrangement is such that the twelve are equally spaced around point P, each at 2 meters distance.

Wait, but the problem states that the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other twelve are each at 2 m from P. So the 13th is at P, so perhaps the other twelve are arranged symmetrically around it, each at 2 meters. But wait, but if they are identical charges, they would repel each other. But here, their positions are fixed. So the system is fixed in that configuration.

So the question is about the potential energy of the system. Because the system is isolated, the energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Wait, but wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy. Hmm. Wait, but
