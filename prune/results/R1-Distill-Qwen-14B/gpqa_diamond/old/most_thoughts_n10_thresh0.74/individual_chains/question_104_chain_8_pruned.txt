Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. When a planet orbits a star, the star moves a little bit in the opposite direction, causing the spectral lines to shift periodically.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, what determines the size of the Doppler shift? I think it's related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by a formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance between them.

I remember the formula K = (v * sin i) for the semi-amplitude. But wait, the exact formula probably involves more terms. Oh right, the formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) / ( (P * (1 - eÂ²)^(3/2) ) ) )^(1/ something... Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the planet's orbital period and the velocity induced in the star.

Alternatively, I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/ P ) * something. Hmm, maybe I should look for a more precise approach.

Wait, another approach: since both stars have the same mass (same as the Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), perhaps we can consider that the ratio of their velocities (as seen in the RV shifts) relates to their orbital periods.

Wait, the RV shift depends on the velocity of the star due to the planet. The star's velocity K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * sin i ) / ( P^(1/3) ) *
