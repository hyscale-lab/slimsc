Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ for two electrons in a p orbital state. Hmm, let me think. 

Wait, each electron is in a p orbital, so their individual angular momentum quantum numbers l1 and l2 are both 1, right? Because p orbitals have l=1. The problem says the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. Oh wait, wait, no, that's not right. Because when you couple two angular momenta, the total l can range from l1 + l2 down to |l1 - l2| in integer steps. So l1=1 and l2=1, so possible total l are 2,1,0. But the state given is |1,1,2,-1>. That means the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the m (the z-component) is -1.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. Oh right, orbital angular momentum is separate from spin, but the problem says to ignore spin angular momentum. So we're just dealing with the orbital part here.

The state is |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>. So the state is for the combined orbital angular momentum. Now, when we make a measurement of L1z and L2z, the individual components, we want the probability that both are -ħ.

Hmm, wait a minute. Each Li is the orbital angular momentum for each electron. So L1z and L2z are the z-components for each. The eigenvalues are m_i * ħ, where m_i is the magnetic quantum number for each. So for each electron, L1z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ, same for L2z.

But the problem says, what's the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ. That is, m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. So the joint state would be |m1=-1, m2=-1>, but does that state exist in the coupled basis?

Wait, the coupled state is given in terms of l and m, but to find the probability of a particular m1 and m2, I need to expand this coupled state
