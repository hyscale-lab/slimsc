Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the compound is based on the spectral data. Let me start by going through each piece of information step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. Then there's another peak at m/z 158, about 32% intensity. Hmm, I remember that molecular ion peaks can sometimes be indicative of the molecular formula. The 32% ratio suggests it's a fragment or maybe a chlorine isotope? Because chlorine has isotopes, right? Cl is about 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%). So if the molecule has a Cl, the molecular ion peak would be at m/z for both Cl isotopes. Let me check: 156 and 158 are two apart, which fits with Cl having an atomic mass of 35 and 37. So maybe the molecular formula has a Cl.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate OH groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the OH would be broad and strong. Alternatively, an aldehyde might have a peak around 2800-2720, but that's a stretch. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So possibilities are a ketone, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, or maybe an ester. But wait, the sharpness might suggest it's not an aldehyde or a ketone (since those can sometimes have a bit broader peaks depending on the environment), or maybe I'm mixing that up. Carboxylic acids have a C=O around 1700, but sometimes a bit lower. But wait, the peak is at 1720, which is a bit higher. Ester carbonyls are around 1720-1750, so that's a possibility. Or maybe a chloride is involved, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now. The peaks are at 11.0 ppm as a singlet integrating to 1H. That's really high, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acid protons are around 10-12 ppm, but as a singlet. But wait, in the NMR, if it's a carboxylic acid, you often see a broad peak, not a singlet. Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Wait, another possibility is an aromatic aldehyde, which would be around 9-10. But 11 is a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps it's a phenolic OH, but that's usually around 5-7 ppm and broad. Wait, but if it's an aromatic aldehyde, maybe it's deshielded more, so higher
