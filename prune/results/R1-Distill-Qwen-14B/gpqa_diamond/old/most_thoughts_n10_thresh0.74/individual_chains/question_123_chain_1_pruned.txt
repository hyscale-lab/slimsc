Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that a supernova occurred in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm. So, this sounds like a problem involving special relativity because we're dealing with different reference frames moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed given is 60,000 km/s, which is 6e4 km/s. Let me check what the speed of light is: approximately 3e5 km/s. So 6e4 is 0.2 times the speed of light, which is 20% of c. That's a significant speed, so relativistic effects might come into play.

Wait, but the question is about the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame. Oh, right, because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some velocity. But how do we relate the time in the ejecta's frame to the galaxy's frame?

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the time experienced in each frame relates. Oh, time dilationâ€”no, wait, but time dilation is about the rate at which time passes in different frames, but here the problem gives the time in the ejecta's frame and asks for the distance in the galaxy's frame. So maybe I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame, which would be the velocity of the ejecta in the galaxy's frame multiplied by the time it's been traveling as per the galaxy's clock.

But wait, the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, not the galaxy's. So the key is to find out how much time passes in the galaxy's frame during those 50 seconds of the ejecta's time. Alternatively, perhaps we're supposed to consider the velocity of the ejecta as seen from the galaxy and then multiply by the time in the galaxy's frame. Hmm, but which frame is which?

Wait, another approach: since the problem states that both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames, I
