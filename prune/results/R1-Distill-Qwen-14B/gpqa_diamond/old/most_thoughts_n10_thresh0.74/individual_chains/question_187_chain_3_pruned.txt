Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is an instrument on the VLT (Very Large Telescope) at Paranal. It's used for spectroscopy, right? The question is about signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The S/N needs to be at least 10 for a star to be detectable.

The options are a) to f), each describing different stars. I need to figure out which of these stars would provide a S/N of 10 or more with ESPRESSO in one hour.

Wait, I think the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude) is the key here. Because a higher S/N means the star is brighter, making it easier to detect. So, I should calculate the apparent magnitude of each star, then see if their brightness is sufficient for ESPRESSO's sensitivity.

ESPRESSO's performance depends on the brightness of the object. I remember that ESPRESSO's S/N per pixel scales with the square root of the exposure time and the photon flux. The formula for S/N is something like S/N = (flux * exposure time) / (read noise + dark current), but I'm not sure about the exact parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up or recall the typical limiting magnitude for ESPRESSO. I think ESPRESSO is very high-resolution, but it's optimized for bright stars. Wait, I remember reading that ESPRESSO can achieve a high S/N for stars down to a certain magnitude, maybe around V=15 or so? Or was it brighter?

Wait, the stars in the options have absolute magnitudes of 15 mag (for c, d, e, f). Absolute magnitude is how bright they appear at 10 pc. So their apparent magnitude would depend on their distance.

The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log₁₀(d), where d is the distance in parsecs. Or wait, is it m = M + 5 log₁₀(d/10) )? Let me get that right. The formula is m = M + 5 log₁₀(d) - 5, because d is in parsecs.

So for each star:

a) Canopus. I'm not exactly sure of its distance and magnitude. Let me think. Canopus is a bright star, I think it's the second brightest star in the night sky. Wait, what's its apparent magnitude? I believe it's about -0.7 magnitudes. So m= -0.7. That's way brighter than V=15. So this should easily be detectable.

b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star. It's a bit dimmer than Canopus. I think its apparent magnitude is around 2.0. So m=2. So that's brighter than V=15, so it should be detectable as well.

c) Star with M=15, distance 10 pc. So using the formula: m = M +5 log₁₀(d) -5. d=1
