Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) â†’ mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, I remember that pions decay into other particles. The pion here is at rest, which probably simplifies things because when the parent particle is at rest, the problem might be easier since we don't have to deal with motion in the lab frame. 

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) has 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Hmm. I think the neutrino's rest mass is considered negligible here because neutrinos are super light, almost massless compared to other particles. So when calculating, I can ignore the rest mass of the neutrino. 

Wait, but wait. So the pion is at rest, so the total initial energy is just its rest mass energy, right? Because when it's at rest, its kinetic energy is zero. So the initial energy is 139.6 MeV. 

When it decays, the products are a muon and a neutrino. The muon has some kinetic energy, and the neutrino has some too, but because the neutrino's mass is so small, maybe its energy is more about its kinetic energy. But wait, in such decay processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. 

So let's think about energy and momentum conservation. 

The initial
