Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but let me try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I don't think the masses directly matter here—maybe they're a red herring, or maybe they affect other factors like luminosity or something else, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, so perhaps it's not needed. I'll focus on the abundance data given.

The elemental abundances given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh wait, I remember that the brackets mean logarithmic ratios relative to hydrogen. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

Wait, no, wait. The notation [A/B]_star is usually defined as log10(n_A/n_B)_star - log10(n_A/n_B)_sun. So positive values mean A is more abundant relative to B than in the Sun.

So, let's parse the data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So, the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that in the Sun. Because [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log_sun, so n_X/n_Y = 10^[X/Y].

Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So, [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log_sun(n_Fe/n_H) = 0. So n_Fe/n_H is the same as in the Sun. So, Star_1's Fe abundance is solar.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So the ratio of Mg to Si is 10^0.3 times solar.

And [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so Mg abundance relative to H is solar.

Wait, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So (n_Si)_1 / (n_Si)_2.

Hmm, I think I'll have to compute n_Si for each star relative to H, because then I can take the ratio.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/H] for each star, then take their ratio.

Wait, but the question doesn't give [Si/H] for either star. Hmm. So perhaps I can derive [Si/H] for each star using the given data.

Let me think. Let's start with Star_1.

Star_1:

Given [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so [Fe/H] = 0 → n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.
