Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the probabilities of getting specific outcomes after two measurements. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll try to understand the setup. The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, maybe I should normalize it. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, right? So the state vector has components (-1, 2, 1). Let me calculate its norm squared to see if it's normalized.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so it's not normalized. So the actual state vector is (1/√6)*(-1,2,1). Right, because the state must have a norm of 1.

Next, the operators P and Q are given. Let me look at their matrix forms.

Operator P:
First row: 0, 1/√2, 0
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0.

Operator Q:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1.

Wait, so Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, and -1. The probability of getting each outcome depends on the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvectors.

But the question is about measuring P first and then Q. Wait, no, wait the problem says: someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the order is first P, then Q. Hmm. Wait, no, the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". Oh, no, wait: the measurements are done in the order P first, then Q? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the question says: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P
