Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation first. The formula is CnHmOxNp. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - p)/2. So plugging in the numbers: n=9, m=11, O=2, N=1. So (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20 -14)/2 = 6/2=3. So 3 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean three rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc. But since it's organic, probably a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees if it's a benzene) but wait, wait, benzene is three double bonds, so that's 4 degrees (each double bond is 1, each ring is 1). Hmm, wait no. The degree of unsaturation for benzene is 4: three double bonds and a ring. So if the compound has a benzene ring, that's 4, but our calculation is 3. That doesn't add up. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me recalculate. The formula is C9H11NO2. So 2*9 + 2 = 20. 20 - 11 (H) =9. Subtract O and N: O is 2 (each O contributes 0 to this formula), N is also 0 here. So 9 -0 (since O and N don't count in this step). So 9 divided by 2 is 4.5? Wait, no, wait the formula is (2n+2 - m - x - p)/2. Wait, wait, maybe I should think again.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. The correct formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, no, I think it's (2n +2 - m - x + p)/2. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me get the formula right. The correct formula is Degrees of Un
