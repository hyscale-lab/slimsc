Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized peptidic compound. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum is mostly as expected, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts, same integral (together 1H), and the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So what's going on here?

Wait, the NMR of the crude compound shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. But spin-spin coupling is ruled out. Oh, because if it were coupling, like with adjacent protons, you'd see more splitting or a different pattern. So why two peaks then?

Then, looking at the LC-MS data. It shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So same molecular weight, but two peaks. That suggests maybe some separation in the LC. But same mass, so perhaps they're isomers or something. But why?

Let me think about the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a lower mass than the product, right? Because the product is the desired molecule. So if the LC-MS shows same mass, maybe that's not it. Unless it's a byproduct with same mass? Not sure.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so same mass, same everything else. They would elute in the same way in LC if the column doesn't chiral. So the LC would show one peak, right? Because the column can't distinguish enantiomers. Unless it's a chiral column, but the question doesn't say that. So if the LC is achiral, both enantiomers would appear as one peak. But the question says two peaks. Hmm, maybe B is not the answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Wait, what's double coupling? Maybe during the formation of the amide bond, perhaps some double bonds or something else. But wait, the NMR peaks are for the same proton. Hmm, not sure. Or maybe from some exchange happening, but not sure.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times in LC. And they have same mass, so same mass spec. In NMR, if two diastereomers are present, the same proton might appear as two separate peaks if they're in different environments. So that would explain the two peaks in NMR. But why same integral? Because each peak would be from each isomer, each contributing 1H each. But if the mixture is 50:50, each would have 0.5H, but together integral is 1H. Oh, that makes sense. So the two peaks would be from each diastereomer's alpha-proton.

But wait, why are the chemical shifts similar? Diastereomers can have different shifts. But if
