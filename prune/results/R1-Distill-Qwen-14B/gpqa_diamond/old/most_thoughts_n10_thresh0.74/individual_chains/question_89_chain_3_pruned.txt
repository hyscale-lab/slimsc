Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when dihalides react with strong bases like KOH, elimination can occur. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably undergoes dehydrohalogenation. Since it's heated, it's likely an E2 mechanism, which would form an alkene. But where?

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows specific signals. Let's check the IR. There's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Hmm, so maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else. Oh wait, maybe it's elimination forming a ketone? Wait, no, elimination usually forms alkenes or maybe epoxides, but that's not likely here.

Wait, another reaction possibility: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base like KOH, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation. But I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe this is a case of a Hofmann elimination or something else. Oh wait, wait. Another possibility comes to mind: the reaction could be a double elimination to form a diene. But no, the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone formation. How?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework. When KOH is used in excess and heat, perhaps it's an elimination followed by another elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's forming an epoxide, but IR doesn't show O-H stretch, which might not fit.

Wait, wait, another thought: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes it can form a ketone if the base is a good enough oxidizing agent. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a diels-alder reaction, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the base abstracting a Î²-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene
