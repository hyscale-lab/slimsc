Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question carefully and figure out what's going on step by step.

The problem starts with compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, splitting patterns can give information about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet means each is next to three.

So, for compound A: the triplet with 6H. That sounds like two equivalent CH3 groups next to another CH2 group. Because 6H could be two CH3 groups. Each CH3 would be a triplet if they are next to a CH2. Wait, wait. Let me think. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is probably from two methyl groups adjacent to a CH2. So maybe like (CH3)2CH- but that would be a triplet for the CH2. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, if the methyl groups are attached to a CH2, then the CH2's protons would be split into a quartet. Because each CH2 proton is next to two methyl protons. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the triplet in the NMR is for 6H. So each of those 6H is in a triplet. So each is adjacent to two others. If it's a triplet, the splitting comes from two neighboring protons. So maybe each of those 6H is on a CH2 group, but each CH2 is next to another CH2 with two protons. Wait, no. Wait, maybe the structure is something like two methyl groups attached to the same carbon, which is adjacent to another CH2. Like (CH2CH3)2CH2? No, maybe that's not right.

Wait, another approach. The triplet is for 6H. That could mean three CH2 groups, but wait no. Wait, if the triplet is 6H, that would mean each H is in a triplet, but each group has 2H. Wait, no. Let me think about this. A triplet has integration 6H, which suggests that each of those 6H is in a triplet environment. So each proton is adjacent to two others. That suggests that each of these
