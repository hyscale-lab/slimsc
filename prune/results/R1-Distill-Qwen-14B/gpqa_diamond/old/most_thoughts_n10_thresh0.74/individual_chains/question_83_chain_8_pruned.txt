Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this should be a classic acid-base titration scenario. 

Alright, let's read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe after calculating, I can match my answers.

First, I think I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

The initial moles of acetic acid would be (volume in liters) multiplied by molarity. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the new volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so the concentration is moles/volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait, 0.001 divided by 0.04 is 0.025? Let me verify: 0.001 / 0.04 is 0.025, yes. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So let's calculate the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. Because initially, 20 cm³ *0.05 M=0.001 mol, and after dilution, the moles stay the same, only concentration changes. So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001 mol, since the reaction is 1:1.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration. Volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH. 

But the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's tackle each part.

First, the 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume. Since equivalence is 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Let me calculate the moles of NaOH used here. Moles = concentration * volume (in L). 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So 0.00025 moles of NaOH have reacted with acetic acid.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So the moles of acetic acid will decrease by 0.00025 mol, and the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) will increase by the same amount.

Let me compute the initial moles after dilution: 0.001 mol of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in 40 cm³ (0.04 L). After adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, which is 0.0025 L, the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So the moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 mol.

So now, the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. 

The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]), where A^- is acetate and HA is acetic acid.

Wait, pKa is given by the formula pKa = -log(Ka). Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. Let me compute pKa.

So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.73. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. Let's compute log(1.85e-5):

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that:

log(1.85) is about 0.267. So 1.85e-5 is 1.85 * 1e
