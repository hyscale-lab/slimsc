Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. 

We're supposed to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are given in MeV, so I'll need to make sure my calculations are in the right units.

Wait, let me write down the given info:

- Initial mass: M
- Initial rest energy: 300 GeV (so M*c² = 300 GeV)
- After fission, two fragments: let's call them m1 and m2
- m1 is twice as massive as m2: m1 = 2 * m2
- Sum of rest masses: m1 + m2 = 0.99 M

Okay, so from m1 = 2 m2, and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Let me substitute m1 in the second equation.

So, 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 2/3 * 0.99 M? Wait, no, wait. Because 0.99 M is the sum of the two, so m1 is 2/3 * 0.99 M? Not exactly. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, m1 = 2 m2. So m1 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M. So m1 is 2 * 0.33 M = 0.66 M. So the two fragments have masses 0.66 M and 0.33 M. But wait, the sum is 0.99 M, which is 99% of the initial mass. So that leaves 1% for the kinetic energy, because in reality, the mass-energy must account for the kinetic energy as well. But wait, the initial rest mass was M, and the fragments' rest mass is 0.99 M. So the mass difference of 0.01 M must be converted into kinetic energy.

Wait, but in nuclear fission, the mass of the products is less than the initial mass, so the mass deficit is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, in this problem, the sum of rest masses is 99% of M. So the mass before is M * c² = 300 GeV. After fission, the rest mass is 0.99 M c², so the energy released is 0.01 M c² = 3 GeV. So that 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy of the two fragments.

But wait, the problem says to ignore electrons, so maybe they don't contribute, but perhaps the binding energy is considered. Hmm, but I think the main point is that the kinetic energy comes from the mass difference.

So the total kinetic energy (K) of the two fragments is 3 GeV. Since the fragments are moving, we can model this using conservation of energy and momentum. Because the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me model this. Let the velocities be v1 and v2 for the two fragments. Wait, but if they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

In the non-relativistic case, momentum is m*v, so
