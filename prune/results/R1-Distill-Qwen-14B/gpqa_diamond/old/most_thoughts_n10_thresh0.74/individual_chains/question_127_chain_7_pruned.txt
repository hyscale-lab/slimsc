Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which molecule forms when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Hmm, I remember that heating alkenes can lead to various reactions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting molecule. The compound is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Wait, nona means nine carbons, right? So it's a nine-carbon chain. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6, and there's a butyl group attached at position 5.

But wait, butyl is four carbons. So 5-butylnona-2,6-diene would have the structure: CH2=CHCH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me count again.

No, wait, nona is nine carbons. The structure is: positions 1 to 9. So position 5 has a butyl group attached. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait no, because the double bonds are at 2 and 6. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a butyl
