Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to understand it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. 

Alright, let me read the problem again. We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on stability constants. Stability constant (β) tells us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it means the reaction goes more to the product. So, the higher the β, the more the complex will form.

So the complexes are probably CoSCN, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4. The blue one is the dithiocyanato complex, which would be Co(SCN)2. So I'm looking for the fraction of Co(SCN)₂ in the solution.

But wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN- per Co. So that's the second complex in the series. So I need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)₂ compared to all possible Co species.

The total cobalt is the sum of all the species: Co²+, CoSCN+, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)3^-, and Co(SCN)4^2-? Or wait, what are the charges?

Let me think. Co²+ is the free ion. Each SCN- is -1. So the complexes would have charges:

- CoSCN: Co²+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+ → charge +1
- Co(SCN)₂: Co²+ + 2SCN^- → Co(SCN)₂^0 (neutral)
- Co(SCN)3: Co²+ +3 SCN^- → charge -1
- Co(SCN)4: Co²+ +4 SCN^- → charge -2

Wait, but in solution, the charge would affect their distribution. But since the solution is aqueous, perhaps the main thing is the concentrations. But the stability constants are given for each step.

Stability constants are for each step. So β1 is the formation of the first complex from the second ion. Let me clarify.

The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit odd because β3 is higher than β4. Maybe I got the order wrong. Let me think about how stability constants are defined.

Stability constant βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n ligands. So for each step, like:

Co²+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+ ; β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN^-])

Similarly, CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)₂ ; β2 = [Co(SCN)₂]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-])

And so on. So each β corresponds to adding one more ligand.

So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, no. Wait, the overall β for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 through βn. So for Co(SCN)₂, it's β1 * β2. For Co(SCN)3, it's β1 * β2 * β3. And for Co(SCN)4, β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. Each β is for the step-wise addition. The stability constants are given for each successive addition. So the overall K for the complex with n ligands would be the product of all β up to that n.

So for the first complex, CoSCN^+ : overall K1 = β1.

For the second: Co(SCN)₂: K2 = β1 * β2.

Third: Co(SCN)3: K3 = β1 * β2 * β3.

Fourth: K4 = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

Wait, but in the problem, the β4 is 16. So that would make K4 = 9 *40 *63 *16. Let me compute that. Wait, 9*40 is 360, 360*63 is 22680, 22680 *16 is 362
