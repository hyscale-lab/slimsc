Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical addition because relativity comes into play. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition formula.

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity doesn't just add up normally. So the formula for adding velocities is v = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). But wait, wait. Do I subtract v2 from v1 or the other way around? Because it depends on the frame of reference. Oh right, the relative speed of object 2 from the frame of object 1 would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Let me think. So if object 1 is moving at v1, then in object 1's frame, object 2 is moving at v2 - v1, but we need to apply the relativistic formula.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. If object A is moving at v_A in the lab frame, and object B is moving at v_B in the lab frame, then the speed of B relative to A is (v_B - v_A) / (1 - (v_A v_B)/c²). So in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, the faster one is 0.6c, and the slower is 0.5c. So from the perspective of the 2m astronaut (moving at 0.6c), what's the speed of the 3m astronaut? It would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c*0.5c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. Oh, but since speed is a magnitude, it's 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. That's one of the options, like option C or D.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so their energies are gamma * m c² each. But wait, the masses are 2m and 3m, so for each, we calculate gamma times their mass.

Gamma for the first astronaut (v=0.6c) is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma * m1 c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

For the second astronaut, v=0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma * m2 c² = 1.154
