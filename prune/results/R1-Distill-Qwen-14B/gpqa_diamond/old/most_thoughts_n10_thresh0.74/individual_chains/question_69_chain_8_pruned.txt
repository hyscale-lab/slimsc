Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime is given as τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. I need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can appear longer due to time dilation. Oh right, the proper lifetime is τ₀, which is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, we have to consider the Lorentz factor gamma, which makes the observed lifetime longer.

The formula for gamma is gamma = total energy / rest mass energy. Because E = gamma * m * c², and since energy is given, I can calculate gamma as E / m. But wait, the units are in GeV, so I should be careful with units, maybe they'll cancel out.

So, first, calculate gamma. The energy E is 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let me think, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 * 8 is 27.28, which is a bit more than 27. So 27 / 3.41 is approximately 7.915. Let me calculate it more accurately. 3.41 * 7.915 is 27? Let me see:

3.41 * 7 = 23.87. 3.41 * 0.915 is approximately 3.41 * 0.9 = 3.069 plus 3.41 * 0.015=0.05115, so total around 3.12. So 23.87 +3.12=26.99, which is close to 27. So gamma is approximately 7.915.

So gamma is about 7.915. Now, the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by τ₀. So τ = gamma * τ₀. Plugging in the numbers, τ ≈7.915 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.915 *8 is 63.32, so 63.32e-16 s. Wait, no, 7.915 ×8 = 63.32? Wait no, 7 *8 is 56, 0.915*8 is 7.32, so 56+7.32=63.32. So τ is approximately 6.332e-15 seconds.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake with the exponents. Let me recheck: 7.915 × 8e-16 = 63.32e-16 = 6.332e-15 seconds. Right.

Now, the lifetime is longer, so the particle has more time to travel before decaying. The distance it travels before decaying is L = v * τ. But I can also express it using the velocity and the lifetime. Alternatively, since we know the energy and mass, maybe we can find the velocity beta (β) and then compute L = β c τ.

Wait, beta is v/c. So how do I find beta? Well, beta squared is (1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)) ), because E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2. Alternatively, another approach is to use beta gamma.
