Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says we have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, wait, that means there's a 68% chance it doesn't decay in that time, right? Because 100% minus 32% is 68%. So the probability of it surviving 100 minutes is 0.68.

But wait, the question says that 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So now, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? That's a bit confusing. Let me break it down.

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The key formula here is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where N(t) is the number remaining after time t, N0 is the initial amount, λ is the decay constant, and t is time.

But wait, the problem gives the probability of decay within a certain time, not the decay constant directly. So maybe I can find the decay constant first. Let's see.

The probability that the atom decays within time t is given by 1 - e^(-λt) = probability of decay. Oh right, because e^(-λt) is the survival probability, so 1 minus that is the decayed probability.

So, for the initial case, the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let's solve for λ.

Let me rearrange that equation:

e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

-λ *100 = ln(0.68)

λ = - ln(0.68) / 100

Let me calculate ln(0.68). I think ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit less, maybe around -0.3856 or something? Wait, I might be mixing up numbers. Alternatively, I can compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me think: ln(0.68) is ln(1 - 0.32) which is about... Hmm, maybe I could approximate it, but perhaps I should proceed symbolically for now.

So λ = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100. Let's compute that numerically.

Wait, let me compute ln(0.68). Let me recall that ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108.

So 0.68 is between 0.7 and 0.6. Let me see. Let me use a calculator approach in my mind. The exact value of ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So λ ≈ 0.0038566 min^-1.

Now, the question is about the probability of decay over the next 150 minutes, but given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay.

Wait, no. So the total time we're considering is 50 minutes that have passed, and the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the decay hasn't happened in the first 50 minutes. So what's the probability it decays between 50 and 200 minutes?

Alternatively, since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period, starting from the current time.

Wait, that's a key point. Because radioactive decay is a Poisson process, which means it's memoryless. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect the future probabilities. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is just 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. The initial statement says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability from time 0 to 100 minutes. But in our case, the current time is 50 minutes, and we're looking from 50 to 200 minutes, which is 150 minutes. So perhaps the way to think about it is to compute the probability of decay between 50 and 200, given that it hasn't decayed by 50.

Alternatively, since the process is memoryless, the probability of decay in any interval of length t is the same, regardless of when you start. So the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

But wait, that's the same as the initial probability for any 150-minute interval. So maybe I can compute this.

Wait, let me think again. The initial 100-minute period gave a 32% decay. So λ is 0.0038566 per minute.

So for 150 minutes, the probability would be 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Compute λ *150: 0.0038566 *150 ≈ 0.5785.

So e^(-0.5785) ≈ ? Let me calculate that. I know that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Let me do a linear approximation or maybe use a Taylor expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as follows.

Wait, ln(2) is about 0.6931, so e^-0.6931 is 0.5. So 0.5785 is less than 0.6931, so e^-0.5785 is around 0.562 maybe?

Wait, wait, I need a better approach. Let me compute 0.5785.

Let me think of e^-0.5785 = 1 / e^0.5785. Let's compute e^0.5785.

e^0.5 is about 1.6487.

e^0.5785 is e^(0.5 + 0.0785) = e^0.5 * e^0.0785.

e^0.0785: 0.0785 is approximately 0.0785.

e^0.07 is about 1.0725, e^0.08 is about 1.0833. So 0.0785 is about 0.07 + 0.0085.

So e^0.07 is 1.0725, e^0.0085 is approx 1 + 0.0085 + (0.0085^2)/2 ≈ 1.00856.

So e^0.0785 ≈ 1.0725 * 1.00856 ≈ 1.0814.

So e^0.5785 ≈ 1.6487 * 1.0814 ≈ Let's compute that:

1.6487 * 1 = 1.6487.

1.6487 * 0.08 = 0.1319.

1.6487 * 0.0014 ≈ 0.0023.

So total is approximately 1.6487 + 0.1319 = 1.7806 + 0.0023 = 1.7829.

So e^0.5785 ≈ 1.7829.

So e^-0.5785 ≈ 1/1.7829 ≈ 0.5607.

So 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, which is approximately 43.93%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 44%, which is about 43.93%.

But wait, I was supposed to use the decay probability within 150 minutes, but let me double-check if I did that correctly.

Wait, another approach: since the decay process is memoryless, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes doesn't affect the next 150 minutes. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as any 150-minute period, which is 1 - e^(-λ *150). So indeed, the 44% seems correct.

But another way to approach it would be to calculate the survival probability up to 50 minutes, then up to 200 minutes, and subtract.

So the survival probability after t minutes is e^(-λ t).

So the survival up to 50 minutes: e^(-λ *50).

The survival up to 200 minutes: e^(-λ *200).

The probability of decay between 50 and 200 is the difference.

So:

P(50 < decay <200) = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200).

But since the process is memoryless, this should be the same as 1 - e^(-λ*150), which is the same as the previous approach.

Let me compute this way:

We already have λ ≈ 0.0038566.

Compute λ *50 = 0.19283.

e^-0.19283 ≈ Let me calculate this. e^0.2 is about 1.2214, so e^-0.2 is 1/1.2214 ≈ 0.8187. But 0.19283 is less than 0.2, so e^-0.19283 is a bit higher than 0.8187.

Approximately, e^-0.19283 ≈ 0.824.

Similarly, λ *200 = 0.77132.

e^-0.77132 ≈ Let's see. e^-0.7 is ~0.4966. e^-0.8 is ~0.4493. So 0.77132 is closer to 0.77. Let me approximate this.

Alternatively, I can calculate 0.77132:

We know that ln(0.46) ≈ -0.775, so e^-0.77132 ≈ around 0.462.

Wait, maybe better to compute it more accurately.

Wait, e^0.7 is about 2.01375, so e^0.77132 is higher. Hmm, wait no, wait. Wait, e^-0.77132 is approximately 1/(e^0.77132).

Calculate e^0.77:

e^0.7 is 2.01375, e^0.07 is about 1.0725, so e^0.77 is e^0.7 * e^0.07 = 2.01375 * 1.0725 ≈ 2.158.

So e^0.77132 ≈ 2.158, so e^-0.77132 ≈ 1/2.158 ≈ 0.463.

So P(50 < decay <200) = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200) ≈ 0.824 - 0.463 = 0.361, which is about 36.1%.

Wait, that's different from the 43.9% we got earlier. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Because the two methods should yield the same result. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, because I think I messed up the calculation of e^(-0.19283). Let me recalculate that.

Wait, wait, the problem was that the 32% decay in 100 minutes is given, so perhaps my initial calculation of λ is incorrect. Let me recompute λ more accurately.

Given that 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32.

So e^(-λ*100) = 0.68.

Take natural log: -λ*100 = ln(0.68).

So λ = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100.

Calculate ln(0.68) more accurately.

Using a calculator approach: ln(0.68).

Let me think, ln(0.6) is approximately -0.5108256,

ln(0.68) is between that and ln(0.7) which is -0.3566749.

Compute it more precisely.

Let me use the Taylor series expansion of ln(x) around x=0.7.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

Wait, perhaps I can use ln(0.68) = ln(0.7 * 0.97142857). Hmm, not sure that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach.

But perhaps it's easier to use exact numbers.

Wait, perhaps I can compute ln(0.68) using the known value.

Wait, I remember that ln(1) is 0, ln(2) is 0.6931, ln(3)=1.0986, etc. But for numbers less than 1, ln(0.5)=-0.6931, ln(0.6)=−0.5108, ln(0.68)=?

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation.

Let me consider that ln(0.68) = ln( (68/100) ) = ln(17/25).

Wait, not helpful.

Alternatively, using the Taylor series expansion for ln(x) around x=1.

Wait, Taylor series for ln(x) around x=a is: ln(x) = ln(a) + (x-a)/(a) - (x-a)^2/(2 a^2) + ... 

But that's for x near a. So if a=1, then:

ln(x) = (x-1) - (x-1)^2/(2) + (x-1)^3/(3) - ... 

But 0.68 is 0.32 away from 1, which is a bit far.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach:

Let me compute ln(0.68).

I think ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566.

Yes, that's correct. Because 0.68 is approximately e^-0.38566.

So λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So λ *150 = 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.

e^-0.57849 ≈ let me compute it more accurately.

So e^-0.57849 ≈ 1/(e^0.57849).

Compute e^0.57849.

We know that e^0.5=1.64872, e^0.6=1.82211, e^0.57849 is between that.

Let me compute it more precisely.

We can do a linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6.

But maybe a better approach is to compute using the Taylor series.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 0.57849 = 0.5 + 0.07849.

So, e^0.57849 = e^0.5 * e^0.07849.

We know e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872.

And e^0.07849 ≈ 1 + 0.07849 + (0.07849^2)/2 + (0.07849^3)/6.

Compute:

0.07849^2 ≈ 0.00616.

0.07849^3 ≈ ~0.000483.

So e^0.07849 ≈ 1 + 0.07849 + 0.00616/2 + 0.000483/6.

Calculating each term:

1 = 1.

0.07849.

0.00616/2 = 0.00308.

0.000483/6 ≈ 0.0000805.

Adding up: 1 + 0.07849 = 1.07849.

+0.00308 → 1.08157.

+0.00008 → ~1.08165.

So e^0.07849 ≈ 1.08165.

Thus, e^0.57849 = e^0.5 * e^0.07849 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08165.

Compute this:

1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.64872 * 1.08.

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872.

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976.

So 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176.

But we have 1.08165, which is 1.08 + 0.00165.

So the remaining part is 1.64872 * 0.00165 ≈ 0.002723.

So total is 1.7806176 + 0.002723 ≈ 1.78334.

So e^0.57849 ≈ 1.78334.

Thus, e^-0.57849 ≈ 1 / 1.78334 ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%, approximately 44%. So option A is 44%, which matches.

But earlier, when I used the other method (calculating from 50 to 200 minutes), I got a different result. Wait, but that must have been a miscalculation on my part.

Wait, let me redo the calculation using the correct λ.

Compute e^(-λ*50) and e^(-λ*200).

λ = 0.0038566.

λ*50 = 0.0038566 *50 = 0.19283.

e^-0.19283 ≈ how much?

Let me compute e^-0.19283.

We can compute e^-0.19283 ≈ 1/(e^0.19283).

Compute e^0.19283.

Approximate e^0.19283.

We know that e^0.1=1.10517, e^0.2=1.22140.

So 0.19283 is close to 0.19.

Compute e^0.19283.

Use Taylor series:

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + x^4/24.

x=0.19283.

x²≈0.03719.

x³≈0.00718.

x^4≈0.00138.

So,

1 + 0.19283 = 1.19283.

+ 0.03719/2 = 0.018595 → 1.211425.

+ 0.00718/6 ≈ 0.001197 → 1.212622.

+ 0.00138/24 ≈ 0.0000575 → 1.2126795.

So e^0.19283 ≈ 1.213.

Thus, e^-0.19283 ≈ 1/1.213 ≈ 0.8243.

Similarly, λ*200 = 0.77132.

Compute e^-0.77132.

As before, e^0.77132 ≈ 2.164 (earlier calculation was e^0.77≈2.158, but let me check more accurately).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute e^0.77132.

We can say e^0.7=2.01375, e^0.77132 = e^0.7 * e^0.07132.

Compute e^0.07132.

Again, using the Taylor series.

x=0.07132.

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6.

x=0.07132.

x^2=0.005087.

x^3=0.000362.

So:

1 + 0.07132 = 1.07132.

+0.005087/2 = 0.0025435 → 1.0738635.

+0.000362/6 ≈ 0.0000603 → 1.0739238.

So e^0.07132 ≈ 1.07392.

So e^0.77132 = e^0.7 * e^0.07132 ≈ 2.01375 * 1.07392 ≈ 2.01375 * 1.07392.

Compute:

2 * 1.07392 = 2.14784.

0.01375 *1.07392 ≈ 0.014778.

So total ≈ 2.14784 + 0.014778 ≈ 2.1626.

So e^0.77132 ≈ 2.1626.

Thus, e^-0.77132 ≈ 1/2.1626 ≈ 0.4622.

So the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes is e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200) = 0.8243 - 0.4622 = 0.3621, which is about 36.21%.

Wait, that's a different result than the 43.9% we got earlier. That's a problem.

Ah, wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because the time intervals are 50, 150, and 200. So if we're considering the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 have already passed, that's the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period starting at time 50. So that should be 1 - e^(-λ *150), which is 43.9%.

But according to the second method, where I compute the survival from 50 to 200, I get a different number.

So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-read it.

The question says, "We want to observe a decay of a single atom... It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?"

Wait, the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So the survival is 68% after 100 minutes.

But the question is, after 50 minutes of survival, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.

So, the time from now is 150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Because the process is memoryless, the fact that it's survived 50 minutes doesn't affect the remaining probability. So the answer should be 1 - e^(-λ *150) = 43.9%, which is 44%, option A.

But why did the second approach give me a different result? Because in the second approach, I was calculating the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes, which is 36.21%. That's a different time frame.

Wait, but the question is about the next 150 minutes, which is 50 to 200. So why are these two methods giving different results?

Ah, wait, no. Because the first approach (1 - e^(-λ*150)) is the probability of decay in 150 minutes from now, regardless of previous time. But the second approach (e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)) is the probability of decay between 50 and 200, which is 150 minutes. So they should be the same.

But in my calculations, they aren't. So I must have made a mistake in one of the calculations.

Wait, let me recompute the second approach with the correct λ.

Compute λ as 0.0038566.

Compute λ*50 = 0.19283.

e^-0.19283 ≈ 0.8243.

λ*200 = 0.77132.

e^-0.77132 ≈ 0.4622.

So 0.8243 - 0.4622 = 0.3621, which is 36.21%.

But that's different from 1 - e^(-λ *150) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439.

Wait, this suggests that I've made a mistake. Because the two methods should give the same result, as the time between 50 to 200 is 150 minutes, same as the next 150 minutes.

Ah wait, perhaps the confusion is that the question is about the next 150 minutes, which is from 50 to 200. So the second method (e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)) is correct, and should give the same as 1 - e^(-150λ), but it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of e^(-150λ). Let me recompute that.

λ *150 = 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.

e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.561. So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439.

But according to the second method, the probability is 36.21%. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption that the process is memoryless is incorrect in this context? No, that can't be right. Radioactive decay is memoryless, so the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes should be independent of the previous 50.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the second approach.

Wait, let me recompute the second approach.

Compute e^(-λ*50) = e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.8243.

Compute e^(-λ*200) = e^(-0.77132) ≈ 0.4622.

So the difference is 0.8243 - 0.4622 = 0.3621.

But that's about 36.2%, which is not 43.9%.

So now I'm confused. Both approaches should give the same result, but they don't. So perhaps I made a mistake in one calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.

Wait, the formula for the probability of decay between t1 and t2 is:

P(t1 < decay < t2) = e^(-λ t1) - e^(-λ t2).

Which is correct.

In this case, t1 is 50, t2 is 200.

So e^(-λ*50) is e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.8243.

e^(-λ*200) = e^(-0.77132) ≈ 0.4622.

So the difference is 0.8243 - 0.4622 = 0.3621, which is 36.21%.

But that's different from 43.9%. So why?

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect. Because the question states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So perhaps this is a different situation.

Wait, the initial time is 100 minutes. So the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes.

But in the problem, we're looking for the decay probability in the next 150 minutes, given 50 minutes have passed.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the probability that the atom decays after 50 minutes but within 200 minutes.

But that's the same as the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes, which is what method two computes.

But according to that, it's 36.2%, which is not 44%.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach, using the memoryless property, is wrong.

Wait, the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is 1 - e^(-λ t), regardless of how much time has passed.

So for t=150, the probability should be 43.9%, which is option A.

But according to the second method, it's 36.2%.

So I'm getting conflicting results. Which suggests that I made a mistake in either the calculation or the approach.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the initial 32% decay is within 100 minutes, but the problem is about a different setup.

Wait, the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes. So after 100 minutes, 32% have decayed on average.

But in the problem, we're observing an individual atom. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay affects the future probability.

Wait, but no, because in radioactive decay, the probability per unit time is constant. So the decay rate is memoryless.

So the initial approach should be correct. So why is the second approach giving a different answer?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Let me recheck e^(-0.19283).

We calculated e^0.19283 ≈ 1.213.

So e^-0.19283 is 1/1.213 ≈ 0.8243.

But perhaps that's wrong.

Wait, let me compute e^0.19283 more accurately.

Using the Taylor series expansion around x=0:

e^x = 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24 + x^5/120 + ... .

x=0.19283.

x²=0.19283^2=0.03719.

x^3=0.19283 *0.03719≈0.00718.

x^4=0.19283 *0.00718≈0.00138.

x^5≈0.19283 *0.00138≈0.000266.

So,

e^0.19283 ≈ 1 + 0.19283 + 0.03719/2 + 0.00718/6 + 0.00138/24 + 0.000266/120.

Compute each term:

1 =1.

0.19283.

0.03719/2=0.018595.

0.00718/6≈0.001197.

0.00138/24≈0.0000575.

0.000266/120≈0.000002216.

Add them all up:

1 + 0.19283 = 1.19283.

+0.018595 → 1.211425.

+0.001197 → 1.212622.

+0.0000575 → 1.2126795.

+0.000002216 → ~1.2126817.

So e^0.19283 ≈ 1.21268.

Thus, e^-0.19283 = 1/1.21268 ≈ 0.8245.

Which is what I had before.

Similarly, e^0.77132: let me compute more accurately.

e^0.77132.

We can write it as e^(0.7 + 0.07132) = e^0.7 * e^0.07132.

e^0.7 ≈ 2.01375.

e^0.07132: x=0.07132.

x²=0.005087.

x^3=0.000362.

x^4=0.0000258.

So,

e^0.07132 ≈ 1 + 0.07132 + 0.005087/2 + 0.000362/6 + 0.0000258/24.

Which is:

1 +0.07132 = 1.07132.

+0.0025435 → 1.0738635.

+0.0000603 → 1.0739238.

+0.000001075 → ~1.0739248.

So e^0.07132 ≈ 1.073925.

So e^0.77132 = e^0.7 * e^0.07132 ≈ 2.01375 * 1.073925.

Compute:

2 * 1.073925 = 2.14785.

0.01375 *1.073925 ≈ 0.014778.

Sum: 2.14785 + 0.014778 = 2.162628.

Thus, e^0.77132 ≈ 2.162628.

So e^-0.77132 = 1/2.162628 ≈ 0.4622.

So the difference is 0.8245 - 0.4622 = 0.3623, which is 36.23%.

Hmm, so with accurate calculations, the second method gives 36.23%, while the first method (1 - e^(-λ *150)) gives 43.9%.

This suggests that I'm making a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect because the atom's decay probability is given as 32% within 100 minutes, not as the decay constant. So perhaps I should model the problem differently.

Wait, perhaps the decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes is the cumulative probability, so the survival probability is 68%, as I did before.

Thus, the decay constant λ is found correctly as 0.0038566 per minute.

So the probability of decay in 150 minutes is 43.9%, which is 44%, option A.

But according to the second approach, it's 36.23%. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the way the time intervals are considered. Let me think about the time frames.

The initial approach computes the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, regardless of the prior 50. So that's 1 - e^(-λ *150) = 43.9%.

The second approach computes the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes, which is the same as the next 150 minutes. So why are the results differing?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the second approach's calculation.

Wait, let me compute e^(-λ*50) = e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.8243.

e^(-λ*200) = e^(-0.77132) ≈ 0.4622.

So 0.8243 - 0.4622 = 0.3621.

Which is 36.21%.

But according to the memoryless property, the probability should be 43.9%, not 36.2%.

So what's the issue here?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the memoryless property. The property states that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. So for any time t, after any time, the probability remains the same.

But according to the calculation, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 43.9%, but the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes is 36.2%, which is a different value.

This suggests that my initial approach is wrong.

But that can't be. Because the memoryless property should apply.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong because the decay probability given is for 100 minutes, not for any time frame.

Wait, perhaps the 32% decay is the cumulative probability, so the survival probability is 68% after 100 minutes.

Thus, the decay constant λ is correctly calculated as 0.0038566 per minute.

Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 150) = 1 - e^(-0.57849) ≈ 43.9%.

But according to the second approach, the probability between 50 and 200 minutes is 36.2%.

So the only conclusion is that I must have made a mistake in the second approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula in the second approach is not correctly applied.

The formula for the probability of decay between t1 and t2 is P = e^(-λ t1) - e^(-λ t2).

Which is correct.

So for t1=50, t2=200:

P = e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ) = 0.8243 - 0.4622 = 0.3621.

But according to the memoryless property, this shouldn't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong, and the correct answer is 36.2%.

But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the question is not asking about the next 150 minutes, but the next 150 minutes from the start, i.e., from 0 to 150 minutes. But no, the question says that 50 minutes have passed, and asks about the next 150.

Wait, no. The question says, "What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?" So that's from the current time, which is 50 minutes, to 200 minutes. So the time frame is 150 minutes.

Thus, the correct probability should be 43.9%, which is option A.

But then why does the other approach give 36.2%? I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me re-calculate 1 - e^(-λ *150).

λ=0.0038566.

λ *150=0.57849.

e^-0.57849=0.5607.

1-0.5607=0.4393.

Yes, that's correct.

So why does the other approach give a different result?

Ah! I think I know the mistake now. The second approach calculates the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes, which is 150 minutes, but the initial condition is that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the conditional probability.

Wait, no, because the memoryless property implies that given the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability of decay in the next 150 is the same as any 150-minute period.

Thus, the correct answer should be 43.9%, option A.

But then why does the calculation of e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ) give 36.2%? Because that's the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes, without considering the condition that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the survival up to 50 minutes is already considered. So the calculation e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ) is the correct probability, given that the atom has survived up to 50 minutes.

Wait, but according to that, the probability is 36.2%.

Hmm, I'm getting conflicting results. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the given decay probability is only for 100 minutes, and the atom is a different one. But no, the question states that it's the same atom.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes, so this implies that the average lifetime is such that after 100 minutes, 32% have decayed.

But for an individual atom, the probability is always 1 - e^(-λt), regardless of previous time.

Thus, the correct approach is the first one: the probability is 43.9%, option A.

But then why does the second approach give 36.2%? Because that approach is incorrect.

Wait, what's the correct approach?

The correct formula for the probability that the atom decays between t1 and t2, given that it hasn't decayed before t1, is indeed P = e^(-λ t1) - e^(-λ t2).

But according to this, the probability is 36.2%.

But according to the memoryless property, the probability should be 43.9%.

So now I'm really confused.

Wait, perhaps the memoryless property is not applicable here because the decay probability is given as 32% within 100 minutes, which is a specific time frame, not the general case.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption about λ is incorrect.

Wait, another way to look at it is to compute the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes.

Which is the same as the conditional probability.

The probability is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50)}.

So that's [0.8243 - 0.4622] / 0.8243 = 0.3621 / 0.8243 ≈ 0.439.

Ah! There it is. I see now.

So the earlier approach where I computed e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ) gives the absolute probability, but since we're given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, we need to condition on that.

Thus, the correct conditional probability is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50)}.

Which is (0.8243 - 0.4622) / 0.8243 = 0.3621 / 0.8243 ≈ 0.439.

So that's 43.9%, which matches the first approach.

Ah, that's the mistake! I forgot to condition on the fact that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the correct calculation is [e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)] / e^(-50λ)}.

Which simplifies to 1 - e^(-150λ), which is the same as the first approach.

So the correct probability is 43.9%, option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential decay model. The decay probability within a given time is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in the next $t$ minutes depends only on $t$, not on how much time has already passed.

### Key Information:
1. **Decay Probability in 100 Minutes**: The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so the survival probability is $1 - 0.32 = 0.68$.
2. **Decay Constant ($\lambda$)**: Using the survival probability formula $e^{-\lambda t} = 0.68$, we solve for $\lambda$:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{min}^{-1}.
   \]
3. **Next 150 Minutes**: We calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes using the decay probability formula:
   \[
   P(\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}.
   \]
   Substituting $\lambda = 0.0038566$ and $t = 150$:
   \[
   \lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849.
   \]
   \[
   e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.5607.
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - 0.5607 \approx 0.4393 \, (43.9\%).
   \]

### Alternative Approach:
To verify, we calculate the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes, given that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The formula for the conditional probability is:
\[
P(\text{decay between 50 and 200 minutes}) = \frac{e^{-\lambda \cdot 50} - e^{-\lambda \cdot 200}}{e^{-\lambda \cdot 50}}.
\]
1. Compute $e^{-\lambda \cdot 50}$:
   \[
   \lambda \cdot 50 = 0.0038566 \cdot 50 \approx 0.19283.
   \]
   \[
   e^{-0.19283} \approx 0.8243.
   \]
2. Compute $e^{-\lambda \cdot 200}$:
   \[
   \lambda \cdot 200 = 0.0038566 \cdot 200 \approx 0.77132.
   \]
   \[
   e^{-0.77132} \approx 0.4622.
   \]
3. Calculate the conditional probability:
   \[
   P(\text{decay between 50 and 200 minutes}) = \frac{0.8243 - 0.4622}{0.8243} \approx \frac{0.3621}{0.8243} \approx 0.4393 \, (43.9\%).
   \]

### Conclusion:
Both approaches yield the same result: the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **43.9%**, which corresponds to **44%**. This confirms that the memoryless property holds, and the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
