Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, the Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Oh wait, sigma is the Pauli vector, right? So sigma is a vector made up of Pauli spin matrices: sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. And n is a unit vector, meaning it's pointing in some arbitrary direction on the sphere.

I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, each multiplied by the identity in their respective directions. So when you take the dot product of sigma and n, you're essentially creating a matrix that's a combination of these Pauli matrices based on the components of n.

Wait, so the dot product would be sigma_x * n_x + sigma_y * n_y + sigma_z * n_z. But n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. So the Hamiltonian H is a 2x2 matrix because each Pauli matrix is 2x2, and the dot product would just scale each by the components of n.

Now, the question is about the eigenvalues of H. I recall that for any Pauli spin matrix, say sigma_x, sigma_y, or sigma_z, their eigenvalues are plus and minus 1. Because when you find the eigenvalues of sigma_z, for example, you get 1 and -1. Same for the others. But wait, here each Pauli matrix is scaled by the corresponding component of n, but since n is a unit vector, the sum of squares
