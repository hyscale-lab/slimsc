Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, mainly the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from it. Oh wait, right, the formula is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). But wait, actually, the formula might be a bit different. Let me think.

The star's parameters are given: mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets have their own masses and radii, but I'm not sure if those matter for equilibrium temperature. Oh wait, equilibrium temp should depend on their distance from the star, right? So I need to find their orbital distances.

The question mentions that both planets are detected via transit and RV methods. The RV method gives the mass of the planet, which I already have, but the transit method gives the radius of the planet and the size of the orbit. Wait, no, the RV gives the mass and the orbital period, I think. Oh wait, the RV method gives the velocity of the star's wobble, which relates to the planet's mass and orbital period, but perhaps the exact distance can be found from that.

Wait, but in this problem, they actually give us the Doppler shifts induced by each planet. Oh, right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift as the
