Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a genetic construct and why the eGFP isn't showing up under the microscope. Let me start by breaking down what's given.

So, the setup is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with 8 alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. But the key here is probably the genetic construct they made.

The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor). The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor's ORF is at the 3', fused to eGFP. The ligand uses the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element.

Wait, so the CBA promoter is upstream of the ligand's ORF. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor has eGFP at the C-terminus. But between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

I think this means that without Cre, the stop cassette prevents expression of the downstream genes. So in the vector, the ligand is under CBA, then ligand ORF followed by stop, then mCherry. But the stop is under loxP, so when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed in frame with the ligand. Similarly, the receptor is after an IRES, which is before the eGFP and the lox2272 stop.

Wait, no, wait. So the construct is like this: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop (loxP) -> mCherry. Then, IRES -> receptor ORF -> stop (lox2272) -> eGFP.

So without Cre, the stop cassettes block expression. So in the vector, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry only when the stop is excised by Cre. Same with the receptor and eGFP.

But the first part: they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wildtype background. Then, they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So, in the offspring, the Cre would be active in neural crest cells.

So the idea is that Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed, each fused to mCherry and eGFP, respectively.

But when they look under the confocal, they don't see green. So eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Hmm, paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But I'm not sure how that affects expression of eGFP in the construct. The expression is about whether the protein is made, not about their function.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. Well, eGFP is a fluorescent tag. If it's stuck in Golgi, it wouldn't get to the cell surface, so fluorescence might be low. But why would that happen? Maybe if the signal peptide is missing or something. But the construct is receptor ORF fused to eGFP. If the receptor is correctly processed, eGFP should come along. Or maybe the stop cassette isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't made at all.

C) Enhancer for expression missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is a weaker, internal ribosome entry site, often used for co-expression. So if the enhancer is missing, maybe the expression isn't happening. But the question says the ligand is under CBA, so if the promoter is strong, why would it not express? Unless both are relying on an enhancer that's missing.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, right! If the ORF (receptor) is in frame with eGFP, then the fusion protein would be expressed. But if not, the eGFP might be truncated or not made. So, the stop cassette is in the lox2272, which is a different recombinase site. The stop is between receptor and eGFP. So, when Cre is used, which recognizes loxP sites, does it affect the lox2272? Wait, no, because Cre is loxP-specific. Lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by a different recombinase, like Dre or something else. So in this case, using Cre wouldn't excise the lox2272 stop cassette. So the stop remains in place, preventing eGFP from being expressed.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The construct has two stop cassettes: one between ligand and mCherry with loxP, and one between receptor and eGFP with lox2272. So when Cre is introduced (from SOX10-Cre mice), it will only excise the loxP site. The lox2272 isn't affected by Cre because that's for a different recombinase. So the stop cassette for the eGFP remains, meaning the eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, no green signal.

So the correct answer would be option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. No, wait. Or if the stop is still there, the receptor and eGFP aren't even expressed together. So the eGFP isn't expressed at all, so no signal.

So if the Cre is only removing the loxP stop, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed. But the receptor and eGFP would still have the lox2272 stop. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So in the mouse, the ligand would be expressed (with mCherry), but the receptor wouldn't be expressed (since the stop remains), so the eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, no green signal.

Looking at the options, which choice fits this?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But actually, the stop is still there. So that's not the issue. The issue is that the stop isn't excised, so eGFP isn't expressed. So maybe the problem is that the other recombinase isn't present. Because the lox2272 is a different site, and Cre won't cut it. So the lox2272 stop cassette isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the question says that the vector was transfected into primary astrocytes. They tested the expression on Western blot. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and saw signals proportional to actin. So perhaps in the Western blot, they saw the ligand (since the ligand's stop is loxP and Cre would have been used in the culture?), but perhaps not the receptor.

But the question is about the mouse model.

So the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. The construct is in the germline. Then they cross to SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so the Cre would be active there, excising loxP sites.

Wait, the construct is in the mouse genome. So when Cre is active, in the neural crest cells, the loxP stop would be excised, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the lox2272 stop isn't affected by Cre, so the receptor-eGFP would not be expressed.

So in the mouse, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. So when they look under the microscope, they might see red fluorescence (mCherry) but not green (eGFP). But in the question, they don't observe a green signal. So that's expected. So why is that happening?

But the question is, which option explains that. The options don't directly address the use of Cre and the different lox sites.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the stop isn't the issue, but the frame is. But if the stop is in place, then the eGFP isn't expressed at all. So the issue is that the stop isn't removed, not the frame. So why would the stop not be removed? Because the recombinase isn't present. Cre is only for loxP; the lox2272 requires a different enzyme.

So the problem is that the lox2272 stop isn't removed. But none of the options directly address this. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option C says the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. But the ligand is under a strong promoter (CBA), and the receptor under IRES. So probably the expression isn't the issue with the promoter or enhancer.

Option D is about the frame. If the ORF isn't in frame, the eGFP isn't expressed. But in this case, the stop is preventing expression. So the issue is that the stop isn't removed. But the options don't have an option about the different lox sites.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 is upstream of the eGFP, so when Cre is used, which doesn't affect it, the stop remains. So the eGFP isn't expressed. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is D. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says that the vector is bicistronic with the ligand at 5' and receptor at 3'. The ligand is under CBA, then the ORF, then stop (loxP), then mCherry. The receptor is under IRES, then ORF, then stop (lox2272), then eGFP.

So when Cre is active, it can only remove the loxP stop. The lox2272 stop remains. So the receptor and eGFP are not expressed. So the only way eGFP would be expressed is if both stops are removed. Since the Cre isn't targeting the lox2272, the eGFP stop remains.

So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

But the question is, why didn't the eGFP show up? So the reason is that the lox2272 stop isn't removed because the Cre doesn't act on it. But the options don't directly address that. So perhaps the answer is not in the options. But wait, let me look again.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the lox2272 stop is a stop cassette that's not flanked by lox sites that Cre can cut, so it remains. So the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't have that as an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But no, the stop is still present, not the frame.

Wait, maybe the stop cassette is not properly flanked, so when Cre is used, it's not excised. So the eGFP isn't expressed. But which option would that correspond to?

Alternatively, think about the expression in the mouse. The mouse is homozygous for the construct. They crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a Cre line. So in the offspring, the Cre is active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the loxP stop is excised, so ligand and mCherry are expressed. But the lox2272 stop remains, so receptor and eGFP are not expressed.

So in the experiment, they would see ligand expressed (if they have the right antibodies) but not eGFP. So in the confocal, they're looking for eGFP expression — no green.

But why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the stop isn't removed. So in the construct, the stop is present, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is, why is that? Because the construct isn't properly designed. So the reason is that the lox2272 stop isn't excised because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. Which would be option... but none of the options state that.

Wait, perhaps the vector's design has the receptor-eGFP under an IRES without the proper stop cassette removal.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working. Or perhaps the frame is off.

Another angle: the lox2272 stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. When Cre is used to excise loxP sites, it won't affect lox2272. So the stop remains. Hence, eGFP isn't expressed.

So the issue is that the stop isn't removed because the recombinase used doesn't target that site. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the correct answer would be that the stop isn't removed, but that's not an option.

Wait, option D is about the receptor and eGFP not being in frame. If the eGFP is in a different reading frame, then it's not expressed. But in this case, the stop is present, so the eGFP ORF isn't even started. So perhaps the problem is that the stop is present, not the frame.

But none of the options directly address that. So I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible options.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the ORF continues into the eGFP but isn't in the same reading frame, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is there, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed regardless.

Wait, but maybe the stop is not properly flanked by loxP sites. Oh, but in the question, the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, and the receptor's by lox2272.

So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't flanked by lox sites that Cre can cut. So the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

But again, none of the options directly state that.

Wait, looking again at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. That's about function, not expression. So probably not the right answer.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. That would affect localization, but expression would still occur. Unless the construct isn't properly made, but the question is about expression.

C) Enhancer for expression missing. The CBA promoter is strong, so probably not the issue.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. So the ORF is not in frame. If that's the case, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the stop is still present, so the ORF isn't even started. So the real issue is the stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 stop wasn't properly excised because the Cre isn't specific for that. But the answer options don't mention that.

Hmm, this is tricky. The correct answer is likely option D. Because the eGFP isn't being expressed, implying that the ORF isn't in frame. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, without the stop being removed, the eGFP isn't made, which would be a design flaw because the lox sites are different.

Wait, but the question setup: the vector has two stop cassettes. So without the correct recombinase, the eGFP isn't expressed. But when using Cre, only the loxP stops are cut. So unless another recombinase is present (like Dre for lox2272), the eGFP won't be expressed.

But in the setup, the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which only provides Cre. So the eGFP remains unexpressed because the stop isn't cut.

So the reason is that the lox2272 stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't have that.

So the only option that deals with the construct's design issue is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe option C is the answer if the enhancer is missing, but the ligand would have the same promoter.

Wait, another thought: if the IRES is used, it allows internal initiation. But if the IRES is not functioning, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the construct includes the IRES regulatory element upstream of the receptor. So the IRES should drive the receptor's expression.

But in this case, the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed. So the issue is that the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Hmm. I'm going around in circles. Let me try to think of the options again.

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame. So when Cre removes the loxP stop, the mCherry would be expressed, but if the eGFP is not in frame, it wouldn't be. But the real issue is that the stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed regardless of the frame.

So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another angle: when using a bicistronic vector, each gene is under its own promoter. If the ligand is under CBA promoter, it's likely expressed in all cells, while the receptor is under IRES, which is weaker. But the question is about the mouse crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is supposed to induce expression in the neural crest.

But the main issue is the lack of green signal. The eGFP isn't expressed because the stop wasn't removed. Why? Because the stop is under lox2272, which Cre doesn't cut. So the construct isn't designed to allow eGFP expression with Cre alone.

So the real issue is the mismatch in the lox sites. But the options don't address that.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct is designed wrong, like using the same lox sites. But the question says loxP and lox2272 are used.

Given the options, I think the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the stop isn't removed, but that's not an option.

Wait, another thought: the vector is bicistronic, so the ligand is first, then the receptor. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is a weaker promoter. So when Cre is used, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are not because the IRES isn't strong enough. But the IRES should allow some expression.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is still in place, blocking its expression.

But I'm getting stuck. Based on the options, the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but no, the stop is blocking it, not the frame.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed because the ORF isn't in frame, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein.

But in the setup, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So if the stop is removed, the receptor-eGFP would be in frame. But if they're not in frame, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the way the construct is described: the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. So the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP. So the ORFs are in frame with their respective fluorescent proteins.

So the issue isn't the frame but the stop being present. So the answer must be that the stop hasn't been removed because the lox2272 isn't cut by Cre.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option D. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the plasmid was transfected into astrocytes, and the Western blot showed expression. So in the culture, perhaps the stop was removed, but in the mouse, it wasn't. But the question states that in the mouse, the model is crossed with SOX10-Cre.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, the answer is C: the enhancer is missing, but the ligand is under a strong promoter.

No, I think the correct reason is that the lox2272 stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed. But since that's not an option, I think the intended answer is D.


The question involves a bicistronic genetic construct designed to express a ligand and receptor in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is under an IRES element, fused to eGFP. The construct includes stop cassettes: a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand and mCherry, and a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP. Cre recombinase, provided by SOX10-Cre mice, is expected to excise the loxP stop cassette, allowing ligand and mCherry expression. However, the lox2272 stop cassette is not excised by Cre, preventing receptor and eGFP expression.

Key analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: "Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship" refers to their functional interaction, not their expression. This does not explain the lack of eGFP fluorescence.
  
- **Option B**: "The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi" could explain a localization issue, but it does not address why eGFP is not expressed in the first place. The primary issue is the lack of expression, not localization.

- **Option C**: "The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing" is unlikely because the ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. These regulatory elements should suffice for expression in the absence of additional enhancers.

- **Option D**: "The receptor and the eGFP are not in frame" suggests a problem with the reading frame of the receptor-eGFP fusion. However, the primary issue is that the lox2272 stop cassette remains unexcised, preventing eGFP expression. The construct design flaw lies in the mismatch between the Cre recombinase and the lox2272 site, not in the reading frame.

The lack of eGFP fluorescence is due to the lox2272 stop cassette remaining intact, as Cre does not recognize lox2272. However, none of the options explicitly address this issue. Among the given options, **Option D** is the most plausible, as it indirectly points to a construct design issue that prevents proper expression of the receptor-eGFP fusion.

Answer: D
