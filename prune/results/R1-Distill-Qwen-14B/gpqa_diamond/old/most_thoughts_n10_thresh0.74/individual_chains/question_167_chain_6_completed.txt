Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they exhibit properties beyond Gaussian states, which are easier to handle.

The state given is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. Oh wait, phi is the phase, and alpha is the amplitude. The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). Okay, so I need to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure.

The relative entropy measure here is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of our state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, but how do I compute this? I think the relative entropy of quantum states is also called the quantum relative entropy. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Oh right, the quantum relative entropy between two states rho and sigma is defined as S(rho || sigma) = Tr(rho log rho) - Tr(rho log sigma). So in this case, tau is the reference Gaussian state. So del_b is S(rho || tau) minus something? Wait, no, the problem statement says del_b is [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. Oh wait, that's S(rho || I) minus S(tau || I)? No, wait, S(rho || sigma) = Tr(rho (log rho - log sigma)) ), so it's Tr(rho log rho) - Tr(rho log sigma). But the given del_b is [Tr(rho log rho) - Tr(tau log tau)], which is S(rho || I) - S(tau || I), assuming I is the identity, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy here is directly S(rho || tau).

Wait, the problem says del_b is [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. So it's the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and tau. So del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). Hmm, is that correct? Because normally, the relative entropy is S(rho || sigma) = S(rho) - S(sigma) if and only if rho and sigma commute. But in general, that's not the case. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the reference state tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho, or perhaps it's the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments. Because Gaussian states are completely determined by their first and second moments. So if I compute the density matrix of rho, and then find the closest Gaussian state tau (maybe the Gaussian Wigner-Moyal or something else), then compute the relative entropy between them.

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the reference Gaussian state tau is such that it has the same first moments as rho, but I'm not sure. Wait, but for a cat state, which is a superposition of coherent states, the first moments might be zero? Let me think. The state |psi> is a combination of |alpha> and |-alpha>, so let's compute the expectation value of the position and momentum operators. 

Wait, the state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. The expectation value <x> would be cos(phi) <alpha|x|alpha> + sin(phi) < -alpha |x| -alpha>. But coherent states |alpha> have <x> proportional to Re(alpha), right? Let's see, if |alpha> is a coherent state, then <x> = sqrt(2) Re(alpha) * something. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact expressions.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the first and second moments for |psi>. The first moments are <x> and <p>, and for a cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, these might cancel out if phi is such that the phases are opposite. Let me see, for example, when phi is -pi/4, as in the problem. So cos(phi) would be cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, and sin(phi) would be -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [ sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 | -alpha > ] / N.

Now, the expectation value of x in |psi> would be ( sqrt(2)/2 <alpha|x|alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 < -alpha |x| -alpha > ) / N^2. Wait, because when you compute <x>, you have <psi|x|psi> = [ ... ].

Wait, <alpha|x|alpha> is sqrt(2} * Re(alpha). And < -alpha |x| -alpha> is sqrt(2) Re(-alpha) = - sqrt(2) Re(alpha). So substituting, the expectation value would be [ (cos(phi) * a_x) + (sin(phi) * (-a_x) ) ] where a_x is sqrt(2) Re(alpha). So let's compute for phi = -pi/4.

cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. So cos(phi) * a_x + sin(phi) * (-a_x) = (sqrt(2)/2 a_x) + (-sqrt(2)/2) (- a_x) = sqrt(2)/2 a_x + sqrt(2)/2 a_x = sqrt(2)*a_x. So <x> = [ sqrt(2)*a_x ] / N^2. Wait, but N is given, so I can compute N^2 as 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2). For phi=-pi/4, sin(2 phi) is sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N^2 = 1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5). Let me compute that. exp(-0.5) is about 0.6065, so 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6276.

So <x> = [ sqrt(2) a_x ] / (0.3935). But wait, a_x is sqrt(2) Re(alpha). Wait, alpha is 0.5, so Re(alpha) is 0.5. So a_x = sqrt(2) * 0.5. So sqrt(2) a_x = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) * 0.5 = 2 * 0.5 = 1. So <x> = 1 / 0.3935 ≈ 2.54. Hmmm, that's a non-zero expectation of x. Wait, but I thought cat states are often considered as having zero mean, but perhaps that depends on the choice of phase and parameters. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: the coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> have expectation values x = sqrt(2) Re(alpha) and x = sqrt(2) Re(-alpha) = - sqrt(2) Re(alpha). So when you take a superposition, the expectation value of x depends on the coefficients. For phi = -pi/4, the coefficients are cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2 and sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2. So the expectation value is [ (sqrt(2)/2) * sqrt(2) Re(alpha) ) + ( -sqrt(2)/2 ) * (- sqrt(2) Re(alpha) ) ] / N^2.

Wait, let's compute each term. (sqrt(2)/2) * sqrt(2) Re(alpha) = (2/2) Re(alpha) = Re(alpha). The second term is ( -sqrt(2)/2 ) * ( - sqrt(2) Re(alpha) ) = (2/2) Re(alpha) = Re(alpha). So sum is Re(alpha) + Re(alpha) = 2 Re(alpha). Re(alpha) is 0.5, so 2*0.5=1. Then divided by N^2 = 0.3935, so <x> ≈ 1 / 0.3935 ≈ 2.54. So it's non-zero. So the state |psi> has a non-zero expectation value for x. So the reference Gaussian state tau must have the same first moments, right? Because that's how you choose the closest Gaussian state. So the reference state tau would be the Gaussian state with the same first moments as rho. Or perhaps not; maybe the reference is the vacuum or something else. Hmm, the problem statement isn't entirely clear on this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the closest Gaussian state to rho, which would have the same first and second moments as rho. Because Gaussian states are determined by their first and second moments. So if tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments, then the non-Gaussianity would be the relative entropy between rho and tau. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, but the problem gives the relative entropy measure as del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So it's the difference in the von Neumann entropies. So del_b = S(rho) - S(tau).

But I'm trying to compute this. So I need to compute S(rho) and S(tau), then take their difference.

First, let's compute S(rho), the von Neumann entropy of the state |psi>. Since |psi> is a pure state, rho is a pure state, so S(rho) = 0. Wait, no wait: von Neumann entropy is -Tr(rho log rho). For a pure state, rho has eigenvalues 1 and 0, so S(rho) = 0. Oh wait, no, wait: rho is a pure state density matrix, so its entropy is zero. But wait, wait, the state |psi> is a pure state, so rho is |psi><psi|, so yes, rho is pure, so S(rho) is zero. Oh wait, but wait, if that's the case, then del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But the options include D) 0, which would imply that del_b is zero. But that can't be right unless S(tau) is zero, which would mean tau is also a pure state. But Gaussian states are mixed unless they are single coherent states (which are pure). Wait, coherent states are pure Gaussian states, but when you have a state that's a superposition of two coherent states, like a cat state, it's non-Gaussian and mixed.

Wait, but wait a second. If rho is a pure state, then S(rho) is 0. But if tau is a Gaussian state, which may be mixed, then S(tau) would be positive. So del_b would be 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau), which would be negative. But the options given are all positive numbers except D) 0. So this suggests I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I was wrong. Let's think again. The state |psi> is given, but is it a pure state? Because when you have a superposition state, it's pure. But wait, wait, wait: the state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, but normalized by N. So |psi> is a pure state, so rho is pure, thus S(rho) = 0. But then del_b would be 0 - S(tau), which is negative. But the options don't have negative values. So perhaps I made a mistake in the interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is defined as S(tau || rho), which would be Tr(tau ln tau) - Tr(tau ln rho). But that's not what's given. The problem says it's Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), so del_b is S(rho) - S(tau). But if rho is pure, then S(rho)=0. So del_b = - S(tau) which is negative, but the options are positive. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I have the wrong reference state. Maybe the reference state is the vacuum, which is a Gaussian state. Then tau is the vacuum state. So for the vacuum, the density matrix is |0><0|, so S(tau) is zero. Then del_b would be 0 - 0 =0. But that would make the answer D)0. But that can't be right because the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, so non-Gaussianity shouldn't be zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the definitions. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is defined as the relative entropy between rho and the optimal Gaussian state tau, which minimizes the relative entropy. So the minimal relative entropy would be S(rho||tau), which is S(rho) - S(tau) - mutual info between rho and tau. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is not the von Neumann entropy but something else. Wait, maybe the problem is using the Bhv (Bennett, H., and Vitanyi) entropy, which is different. Or perhaps it's the classical relative entropy. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think about the structure of the state. The state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. This is known as a Schrödinger cat state, which is a non-Gaussian state. So the non-Gaussianity should be positive, as it's a measure of how non-Gaussian the state is.

Another approach: perhaps the relative entropy in the problem is the classical relative entropy, which for a pure state would have a certain value. Alternatively, perhaps it's the symmetrized relative entropy or something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the density matrix rho of |psi>, then compute the relative entropy between rho and the reference Gaussian state tau. The problem is, without knowing tau, it's tricky. But perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. So for a cat state, which has certain first and second moments, the Gaussian approximation would have the same moments.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state obtained by taking the Wigner function of |psi> and approximating it with the closest Gaussian Wigner function. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the second moments of the state |psi> to find the parameters of the reference Gaussian state. The Gaussian state is determined by its first and second moments. So the first moments are <x> and <p>, and the second moments are <x^2>, <xp>, and <p^2>.

But for |psi>, a cat state, the first moments are non-zero as we saw earlier. So the reference Gaussian tau would have the same <x> and <p> as rho. So I can compute the first moments, then compute the second moments to define the Gaussian state.

Wait, but perhaps the Gaussian state with the same first two moments as rho is the best approximation. Once I have tau, I can compute S(rho) and S(tau), then del_b = S(rho) - S(tau).

But wait, rho is a pure state, so S(rho) =0. So del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). So again, that would be negative, which doesn't match the options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. The problem says the relative entropy measure is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. So it's the difference in the von Neumann entropies of rho and tau. But since rho is pure, its entropy is zero, and tau is a mixed Gaussian state, whose entropy is positive, so del_b would be negative. But the options don't have negative numbers. So perhaps the problem is using the absolute value, or perhaps I'm wrong about the entropy.

Alternatively, maybe the relative entropy is the other way around: S(tau || rho). But that would be Tr(tau ln tau) - Tr(tau ln rho) = [Tr(tau ln tau) - Tr(rho ln rho)] + [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln rho)]. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the density matrix rho for the given state. Let me do that.

The state |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

So the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. Let's compute it.

rho = [|psi><psi|] = (1/N^2) [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] [ <alpha| cos(phi) + <-alpha| sin(phi) ]

Expanding this, we get:

rho = (1/N^2) [ cos^2(phi) |alpha><alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + sin(phi) cos(phi) | -alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) | -alpha>< -alpha| ]

Wait, that's correct. So rho is a 2x2 matrix in the basis {|alpha>, |-alpha>}, but in reality, it's a larger Hilbert space, so the actual density matrix would have elements between these states. But perhaps for the purposes of calculating the entropy, I can model it as a two-level system, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is a mixed state, but wait, no, it's a pure state because it's a normalized superposition.

Wait, but the state is a pure state, so the density matrix is rank 1. So the entropy S(rho) would be 0. Hmm, but then the relative entropy del_b would be - S(tau), which can't be right because the options are positive. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the non-Gaussianity is being calculated.

Wait, perhaps the relative entropy is not between rho and tau, but between rho and some other Gaussian state, not necessarily the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the reference state tau is the vacuum, or the thermal state. But the problem says tau is the reference Gaussian state, which probably refers to the best Gaussian approximation, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept of quantum relative entropy in a different way. Let me think again: the problem gives the relative entropy as del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So, if rho is a pure state, then Tr(rho ln rho) = 0. So del_b would be - Tr(tau ln tau) because Tr(rho ln rho) is zero. But Tr(tau ln tau) is the entropy of tau, so del_b = - S(tau). But if tau is a mixed Gaussian state, S(tau) is positive, so del_b would be negative. But none of the options are negative. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is defined as S(rho || tau), which for a pure rho and a mixed tau would be positive. But in that case, del_b would be S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau) = 0 - Tr(rho ln tau) = - Tr(rho ln tau). But that's not what the problem states. The problem's del_b is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), which is S(rho) - S(tau), which can be 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau).

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct formula is S(rho || tau) which would be Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But then, given that rho is pure, this would be 0 - Tr(rho ln tau). So that would be negative, but again, the options are positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the classical relative entropy, which is for probability distributions, but that's not the same as quantum relative entropy.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the given parameters: phi = -pi/4, alpha = 0.5. So let's compute N first.

As before, N^2 = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp( -2 alpha^2 ). For phi = -pi/4, sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N^2 = 1 - exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5). exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065, so N^2 ≈ 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6276.

The state |psi> is [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6276. So cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So |psi> ≈ [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 | -0.5> ] / 0.6276.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. So rho is a pure state, so its von Neumann entropy is zero. So S(rho)=0.

What about the reference Gaussian state tau? The problem states that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps tau is the Gaussian state with the same first moments as rho. So the first moments are <x> and <p>, which I calculated earlier as approximately 2.54 for <x>. But I'm not sure about <p>, which is the expectation of the momentum operator.

Wait, for a coherent state |alpha>, the expectation values are <x> = sqrt(2) Re(alpha) and <p> = sqrt(2) Im(alpha). So for |alpha=0.5>, Re(alpha)=0.5, Im(alpha)=0. So <x> = sqrt(2) * 0.5 ≈ 0.7071, <p> = 0.

But our state |psi> is a superposition, so the expectation values are different. Earlier, I found <x> ≈ 2.54, so tau must have the same <x> and <p> as rho.

Wait, but coherent states have both <x> and <p> as real numbers. So if rho has <x> = 2.54 and <p> = 0, then tau (the Gaussian state) would be a coherent state |beta>, where beta is chosen such that <x> = 2.54 and <p>=0. But wait, the Gaussian state would also have the same second moments as rho, but perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state which is the closest Gaussian state to rho, which would require matching the first two moments (the first and second order correlations). But this may be more involved.

But perhaps for this problem, the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum, which is |0>. So tau is |0><0|. The von Neumann entropy of |0> is zero, so del_b would be 0 - 0 = 0, which is option D. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity shouldn't be zero.

Wait, but perhaps the reference Gaussian state is not the vacuum, but another Gaussian state. For example, the Gaussian state with the same first moments as rho. So let's compute the first moments.

Earlier, I found <x> ≈ 2.54. What about <p>? Let's compute it.

The expectation value <p> would be ( cos(phi) <alpha|p|alpha> + sin(phi) < -alpha | p | -alpha> ) / N^2.

For a coherent state |alpha>, <p> = sqrt(2) Im(alpha). Since alpha=0.5, Im(alpha)=0, so <p> =0. So <p> for |alpha> and |-alpha> is zero. So when you take the expectation in |psi>, it's [ cos(phi) *0 + sin(phi) *0 ] / N^2 = 0. So <p> = 0.

So the state |psi> has <x> ≈2.54 and <p>=0. So the reference Gaussian state tau would be the coherent state |beta> where beta is chosen such that <x> =2.54 and <p>=0. Because for a coherent state |beta>, <x> = sqrt(2) Re(beta), and <p> = sqrt(2) Im(beta). So to get <x>=2.54 and <p>=0, Re(beta) = 2.54 / sqrt(2) ≈ 1.796, and Im(beta)=0. So beta ≈ 1.796. So tau is |beta><beta|, which is a pure Gaussian state. Therefore, the von Neumann entropy S(tau) is zero.

Wait, but that would make del_b = 0 (since S(rho)=0 and S(tau)=0) which gives nG =0. But that's option D. But the state is non-Gaussian, so nG shouldn't be zero. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, but wait. The entropy is calculated based on the entire density matrix. Wait, rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state, so S(rho)=0. The reference Gaussian state tau is |beta><beta|, which is also pure, so S(tau)=0. So del_b = 0 - 0 =0. So the non-Gaussianity is zero? But that's not possible because the state is non-Gaussian.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is incorrect. Maybe the reference Gaussian state is not a pure state but a mixed state. For example, the reference could be a thermal state or a squeezed vacuum state.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state obtained by Gaussianizing the Wigner function of rho. But I'm not sure about the details.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The state |psi> is a superposition, so its Wigner function is non-positive in some regions, making it non-Gaussian. The closest Gaussian state would have a positive Wigner function. But the relative entropy between rho and tau would then depend on how non-Gaussian rho is.

But without knowing the exact form of tau, it's hard to compute the relative entropy. So perhaps the problem uses a specific reference, like the vacuum state. But as we saw earlier, that would make del_b zero, which is option D.

But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is D)0. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a pure Gaussian state, but that's not correct because a cat state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, maybe I should compute the density matrix in phase space and see if it's Gaussian. A Gaussian state has a Wigner function that is a Gaussian function. The Wigner function of a cat state is non-Gaussian, so the state is non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be positive, not zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that when phi is -pi/4, the state becomes (|alpha> - | - alpha >)/sqrt(2) * something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the state becomes an even or odd state. For example, an even cat state is (|alpha> + |-alpha>)/sqrt(2}, and an odd cat state is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/sqrt(2}. These are non-Gaussian states. So the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the earlier calculation, the relative entropy del_b would be zero if tau is the same as rho. But that's not the case, because rho is non-Gaussian and tau is Gaussian.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, and the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a superposition of Gaussian states, but that doesn't make it Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the fact that the state is a superposition, thus non-Gaussian, but the relative entropy depends on the specific parameters. Let's think about the case when alpha is very small. For alpha approaching zero, the state becomes [ cos(phi)|0> + sin(phi)|0> ] / N, which is just |0> because both terms are the same. So for alpha=0, it's a Gaussian state, and the non-Gaussianity is zero. But in our case, alpha=0.5 is not zero, so non-Gaussianity should be positive.

But earlier, when I assumed that tau is the best Gaussian approximation (same first moments), I found that tau is a pure state, leading to del_b=0. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian. Therefore, perhaps the reference Gaussian state isn't the same as rho, but another state.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum, which is a Gaussian state with zero mean and identity covariance matrix. So let's compute the relative entropy between rho and the vacuum.

The vacuum state |0> has density matrix tau = |0><0|. The von Neumann entropy S(tau)=0. So del_b would be 0 - 0 =0. Again, leading to nG=0. But this can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the relative entropy between rho and the Gaussian state that has the same first moments as rho. So let's compute that.

Wait, but for a cat state, the Wigner function is non-Gaussian, but the first moments are non-zero. So the Gaussian state with these first moments would have a Gaussian Wigner function, but different from the actual state's Wigner function.

But how to compute the relative entropy between rho and this Gaussian state? I think this is getting too involved for the problem, which is multiple-choice.

Another thought: perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero when the state is Gaussian, which occurs when the state can be written as a Gaussian density matrix. But the given state is a superposition of coherent states, which is non-Gaussian, so non-Gaussianity should be positive, so option D is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using another approach, such as the logarithmic negativity or something else, but the question states that the relative entropy is the measure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the density matrix rho and the reference Gaussian state tau, then compute the quantum relative entropy. But without knowing tau's exact form, it's impossible. So perhaps the problem is designed such that the non-Gaussianity is zero, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, another angle: the state |psi> is a pure state. The relative entropy of a pure state with a mixed Gaussian state would be positive. But since the problem states that del_b is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), which is S(rho) - S(tau), and rho is pure (S(rho)=0), then del_b = - S(tau). But if tau is a mixed Gaussian state, S(tau) is positive, so del_b is negative. But the options don't have negative numbers, so perhaps the problem has a different definition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the absolute value of the relative entropy, so the non-Gaussianity is |del_b|, which would be positive. But that's not stated in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relative entropy formula. Maybe the problem is using the classical relative entropy for probability distributions. But that would require knowing the probability distribution of the state, which I'm not sure how to compute.

Wait, perhaps the state |psi> can be considered as a mixed state in the basis of |alpha> and |-alpha>. So the density matrix rho would have elements |c1|^2, |c2|^2, and the cross terms. Let's compute that.

Given |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N,

rho = |psi><psi| = [ cos^2(phi) |alpha><alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + sin(phi) cos(phi) |-alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) | -alpha><-alpha| ] / N^2.

In the basis {|alpha>, |-alpha>}, rho is a 2x2 matrix:

rho = (1/N^2) [ [ cos^2(phi), cos(phi) sin(phi) ], [ sin(phi) cos(phi), sin^2(phi) ] ]

But in reality, the states |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal. So this approximation isn't valid. So this is a mistake. Therefore, I can't treat rho as a 2x2 matrix in this basis. I need to compute the actual density matrix in the Fock basis or something else, which is complicated.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is too complex for me to compute without more information. But given the options, perhaps the answer is D)0 because the state's density matrix is pure, making del_b=0. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, another possibility: the non-Gaussianity is defined as the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state. So if the state is Gaussian, the relative entropy is zero. But in our case, the state is non-Gaussian, so the relative entropy should be positive. But according to the earlier calculation, if the reference Gaussian state is a pure state with the same first moments, then del_b=0, which suggests no non-Gaussianity. So perhaps the problem considers the state rho as Gaussian, which it's not.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me think about the problem statement again. The non-Gaussianity is calculated using relative entropy, which is del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So it's the difference between the entropies. If rho is pure, S(rho)=0. If tau is a mixed Gaussian state, S(tau) is positive, so del_b = - S(tau), which is negative. But the options don't have negative numbers. So perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 0, option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is defined as the relative entropy between the state and the vacuum, which is a Gaussian state. But the state |psi> is not the vacuum, so S(rho) is zero and S(tau)=0, so del_b=0. That can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is designed such that when phi is -pi/4, the state becomes a coherent state, making it Gaussian, hence nG=0. Let me check.

Phi is -pi/4, so cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2 and sin(phi)=-sqrt(2)/2. So the state is [ sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 | -alpha> ] / N.

Is this a coherent state? No, because it's a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. So it's a non-Gaussian state.

Wait, but perhaps when alpha=0.5 and phi=-pi/4, the state becomes a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. No, squeezed states are Gaussian but this is a superposition. No, squeezed states are still Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is probably option D)0, but I'm not confident.


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \( \phi \) is the phase, \( \alpha \) is the amplitude, and \( N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}} \) is the normalization constant. The relative entropy measure is given as:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \( \rho \) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state \( |\psi\rangle \), and \( \tau \) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Observations:
1. **State Properties**: The given state is a superposition of two coherent states \( |\alpha\rangle \) and \( |-\alpha\rangle \), making it a non-Gaussian state. Non-Gaussian states are known to exhibit properties beyond those of Gaussian states, such as those involving superpositions and interference.

2. **Relative Entropy**: The relative entropy \( \Delta_b \) is defined as the difference between the von Neumann entropies of \( \rho \) and \( \tau \): 
   \[
   \Delta_b = S(\rho) - S(\tau),
   \]
   where \( S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) \) and \( S(\tau) = -\text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau) \). For a pure state \( \rho \), \( S(\rho) = 0 \), so \( \Delta_b = -S(\tau) \).

3. **Reference Gaussian State**: The problem does not explicitly specify the reference Gaussian state \( \tau \). However, it is reasonable to assume that \( \tau \) is the closest Gaussian state to \( \rho \), which would match the first and second moments of \( \rho \). For a Schrödinger cat state, the first moments (e.g., \( \langle x \rangle \)) are non-zero due to the superposition of coherent states.

4. **Calculation of \( N \)**: For \( \phi = -\pi/4 \) and \( \alpha = 0.5 \), the normalization constant is:
   \[
   N^2 = 1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \phi = -\pi/4 \) (so \( \sin(2\phi) = -1 \)) and \( \alpha = 0.5 \) (so \( e^{-2\alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065 \)), we find:
   \[
   N^2 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935, \quad N \approx \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6276.
   \]

5. **Von Neumann Entropy of \( \rho \)**: Since \( |\psi\rangle \) is a pure state, \( \rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi| \) is also pure, and its von Neumann entropy is \( S(\rho) = 0 \).

6. **Von Neumann Entropy of \( \tau \)**: The reference Gaussian state \( \tau \) is mixed because it approximates the non-Gaussian state \( \rho \). Thus, \( S(\tau) > 0 \), making \( \Delta_b = -S(\tau) \) negative. However, the problem's options are all non-negative, suggesting that the non-Gaussianity is being defined as the absolute value of \( \Delta_b \).

7. **Special Case**: For \( \phi = -\pi/4 \) and \( \alpha = 0.5 \), the state simplifies to a superposition of coherent states with opposite phases. While this state is non-Gaussian, the problem's options suggest that the non-Gaussianity might be zero under certain interpretations or approximations.

### Conclusion:
Given the ambiguity in defining the reference Gaussian state \( \tau \) and the structure of the problem, the most plausible answer is that the non-Gaussianity is zero. This could occur if the problem implicitly assumes that the state is Gaussian or if the relative entropy calculation results in zero under specific approximations.
