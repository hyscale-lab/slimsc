Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about the synthesis of a specific compound, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me draw that structure in my mind. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is a bromine, and position 5 is a nitro group. Then, attached to the benzene is an ethanone groupâ€”like a ketone, where the carbonyl is attached directly to the benzene ring. So the structure would be a phenyl group with substituents at 3 and 5, and a ketone attached at position 1.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the numbering might be different. The ketone is in position 1. So the benzene is attached to a ketone group (C=O) at position 1, and then bromo at 3 and nitro at 5. So the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the carbonyl group.

So, the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone (ethanone) at position 1, bromine at 3, and nitro group at 5. So the positions are 1 (CO), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). 

Now, the question is about how to synthesize this starting from benzene. So, I need to plan the steps considering the directing effects of substituents and the order of reactions.

Let me think about the substituents on benzene. Nitro groups are meta-directing, strong deactivating. Bromine is ortho/para-directing but deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group. The ketone group (COCH3?) Wait, wait, no, wait. The ethanone is a carbonyl group attached directly to the benzene. So, the substituent is a ketone (CO-) attached to the ring. That's a carbonyl group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group and deactivating. It's meta-directing.

Wait, but wait. In ethan-1-one, the structure is Ar-C(=O)-CH3? No, wait. Wait, the name is
