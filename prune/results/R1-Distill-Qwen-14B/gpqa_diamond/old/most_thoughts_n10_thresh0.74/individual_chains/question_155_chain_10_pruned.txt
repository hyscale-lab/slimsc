Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of operators and uncertainties. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty of the operator P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, right. The uncertainty principle tells me that the uncertainty in an observable is related to the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value. So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). That makes sense.

First, I need to find the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared for the given state. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this state as |ψ⟩.

Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. That means when I express |ψ⟩ in this basis, each component corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. So, the state is already written in the eigenbasis of P_z? That's good because it might simplify things.

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So, |ψ⟩ is a superposition of the eigenstates of P_z. Let me think about that. The eigenstates of P_z are |+z⟩ and |-z⟩, I suppose, with eigenvalues +ħ and -ħ respectively. So, since the state here is a combination of these, perhaps its components in this basis are known.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector with three elements. So maybe it's a three-level system? Hmm, I'm a bit confused because I thought spin systems are usually two-level, but perhaps this is a different context. Maybe it's spin-1 particles or something else.

So, the matrix for P_z is given, and it's diagonal because it's in its eigenbasis. Oh wait, looking at P_z's matrix: the first row is [ħ, 0, 0], the second [0,0,0], and the third [0,0,-ħ]. So, it's a diagonal matrix. That makes sense because if the basis vectors are the eigenvectors, then the matrix is diagonal. So the
