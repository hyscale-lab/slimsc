Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ=10^-17 degrees, and it's located at a distance d=10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, which are all around different exponents of 10^50 something. 

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. Oh right, the formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. And I think the area of a black hole's event horizon is A = 4π r_s²/4, where r_s is the Schwarzschild radius. Or wait, actually, the area is 16π (r_s/2)^2, no wait, let me get that right. The Schwarzschild radius is r_s = 2 G M / c². So the area A = 4π (r_s)^2. Yeah, that sounds right.

So first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon, which is r_s. But how? The problem gives me the angular size θ and the distance, so maybe I can find the actual size of the event horizon using some trigonometry.

Angular size θ is given in degrees, but I need to convert it into radians for calculations. Oh right, because when θ is small, θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the arc length divided by the radius. So θ (rad) ≈ θ_deg * (π/180). 

So θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees). Let me compute that. 1e-17 * π / 180. Let's approximate π as 3.1416, so 1e-17 * 3.1416 / 180 ≈ (3.1416/(180)) * 1e-17. 3.1416 divided by 180 is approximately 0.017453. So θ_rad ≈ 0.017453e-17 ≈ 1.7453e-19 radians.

Wait, or is that correct? No, wait, 1e-17 * (π/180) is approximately (1e-17) * 0.017453, which is 1.7453e-19 radians. Yeah, that's right.

Now, if the object is at a distance d, then the size (actual size) is approximately d * θ (in radians). So r_s ≈ d * θ_rad. 

Wait, but wait. The size of the event horizon is the same as the Schwarzschild radius, right? So r_s = d * θ_rad.

So d is given as 1e10 parsecs. Oh, wait, parsecs to meters. I need to convert parsecs to meters to have consistent units. Let me remember: 1 parsec is about 3.0857e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs is 3.0857e26 meters.

So r_s ≈ d * θ_rad = 3.0857e26 m * 1.7453e-19 rad. Let me compute that: 3.0857e26 * 1.7453e-19 = 3.0857 * 1.7453 * 1e(26-19). 

3.0857 * 1.7453 is approximately, let's see: 3 * 1.7 is 5.1, 0.0857*1.7453 is about 0.15, so total around 5.25. So 5.25e7 meters. So r_s ≈ 5.25e7 meters.

But wait, that's the Schwarzschild radius. So now, since r_s = 2 G M / c², I can solve for M, the mass. But perhaps I don't need M itself, since the entropy formula uses the area, which is based on r_s squared.

Wait, the entropy formula I mentioned earlier. Let me double-check the formula. Oh yes, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area. Alternatively, sometimes written as S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ
