Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem starts with Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet means each is next to three. The integration tells us how many protons are in each signal. 

Wait, 6H as a triplet... That makes me think of two equivalent CH3 groups. Because each triplet would have 6H in total, so maybe two methyl groups. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each proton is next to three others. 4H as a quartet... Maybe a -CH2-CH2- group, where each CH2 is next to another CH2. So the quartet could be from the middle of an ethyl group, but wait, an ethyl group's protons are usually a triplet and a quartet. Oh wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH2- in a larger structure. 

Wait, let me think. If it's a triplet for 6H, maybe two CH3 groups attached to a CH2. Because then each CH3 is next to a CH2, which has two protons. So each CH3 would be a triplet. Wait, but the triplet integrates for 6H, so that would be two CH3 groups. So the structure would be something like CH2CH3-C... or maybe a cyclopropane? No, wait, cyclopropane's protons are usually around 0.5-1.5 ppm, but I'm not too sure. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group. No, diethyl would have more protons. Wait, another possibility: if the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2. But that might complicate things. Wait, perhaps the structure is 2,2-dimethylpropane? No, wait, that's neopentane, which would have a singlet for the CH3 groups. Not a triplet. 

Wait, maybe it's a cyclopro
