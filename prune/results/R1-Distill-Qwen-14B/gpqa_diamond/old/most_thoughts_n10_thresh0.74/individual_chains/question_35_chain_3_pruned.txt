Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the correct statement regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem.

The question says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator which equals c multiplied by S. The constant c is given as h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. Wait, no, wait. Wait h bar is usually h/(2π), but in this case, c is h/(4π), so that's half of h bar. Interesting.

The matrix S is given as:
First row: 0, -i
Second row: i, 0.

Wait, so S looks like this:

0  -i
i   0

I remember that S is similar to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are 2x2. Let me think: σy is (0, -i; i, 0), which matches S. So S is actually the Pauli y matrix. So S = σy.

So Ay = c * σy. Since σy is a spin operator matrix, maybe it's related to the spin angular momentum in the y-direction. Oh wait, the intrinsic angular momentum operator, so for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.

The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, so we're looking for eigenvalues a and eigenvectors φ.

First, I need to compute the eigenvalues of Ay. Since S is σy, the eigenvalues of S (σy) are ±i, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 but scaled by i? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the eigenvalues of σy are i and -i. Because when you compute the determinant, (σy - λ I) = 0,

so | -λ     -i |
    |i      -λ | = λ² + 1 = 0 → λ = ±i.

So the eigenvalues of S are ±i. Then, since Ay = c * S, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(±i). Given that c is h/(4π), so a = (h/(4π)) * (i) and a = (h/(4π))*(-i). Wait, but wait, that's a bit odd because
