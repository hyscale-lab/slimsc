Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem states that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We're asked about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

First, I need to figure out what's happening when we dilute the acetic acid. Diluting it with water will decrease the concentration, right? Because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. Wait, wait, the initial concentration is 0.05 M in 20 cm³. Adding 20 cm³ of water makes the total volume 40 cm³. So the new concentration should be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that. 0.05 *20 is 1 mmol, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating, the moles of acetic acid will react with NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. 

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid present. But wait, what's the volume at equivalence? Let me calculate that. 

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 moles. Because 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001. Correct.

The NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed to reach equivalence is moles / concentration. Moles are 0.001, so V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. At 25% titration, that's 25% of 10 cm³, so 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Wait, 25% of the titration point. Oh, right, because the equivalence is 10 cm³, then 25% titration is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

So for 25% titration, what's the situation? At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution is a buffer solution because both acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate) are present.

Let me find the moles of each component at
