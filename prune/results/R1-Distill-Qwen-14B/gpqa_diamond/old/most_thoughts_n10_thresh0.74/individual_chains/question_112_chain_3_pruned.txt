Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm going to try to think it through step by step. Let's start by trying to understand what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's an electron described by the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, the state is given in the computational basis of the z-spin.

The question asks for two things: first, the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator, and second, the average value of that operator.

The operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. Wait, so what does that matrix look like? Let me think. If the operator is 2x2, which it must be since we have two states (up and down), then the matrix would have zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So, the matrix A would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Oh, wait, that's right. Because for a 2x2 matrix, the non-diagonal elements are A_12 and A_21, which are hbar/2 each. And the diagonals are zero.

I think this operator is related to the spin in the x-direction. Because the Pauli matrices, like sigma_x, have similar structures. Oh right, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply that by hbar/2, we get our matrix A. So A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x. That might help later.

So, the first part is to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A. But wait, the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x, since A is just a scaled version of sigma_x. Because scaling a matrix by a scalar doesn't change its eigenvectors, only the eigenvalues.

Sigma_x has eigenstates that are the superposition states |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. So, the eigenstates of A are these |+x> and |-x> states.

Wait a second, the state |alpha> is given, but it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize this state because right now it's just proportional; not necessarily unit length.

Let me compute the normalization factor. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) because the inner product is |a|^2 for each component. Wait, no, waitâ€” no, more accurately, the norm is |(1+i)|^2 + |(2-i)|^2.

Calculating each term:

|1 + i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1
