Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts involved. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains two different phosphoric acid salts. The solution has a volume of 200 cm³, which I think is 0.2 liters. The substances are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, each weighing 1.00 grams. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is H3PO4, but wait, no, orthophosphate ions are actually PO4^3- right? But depending on the pH, phosphate can exist in different forms. The problem gives me the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Oh wait, so for each deprotonation, the acid loses a proton and the Ka decreases each time.

So the first thing that comes to mind is that KH2PO4 is the diprotic form, maybe H2PO4^- (since K+ is the cation and H2PO4^- is the anion), and Na2HPO4·2H2O would be Na+ and HPO4^2- as the anion. So, in solution, these salts would dissociate completely into their respective ions.

Wait, but orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which would be the fully deprotonated form. So, I'm trying to find [PO4^3-] in the solution. But wait, given the pH of the solution, which is influenced by the presence of these salts, maybe the phosphate exists in different forms, but I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion specifically.

Wait, but how do these salts affect the pH? Because when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, you get a buffer solution. Since KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (the dihydrogen phosphate ion) and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (the hydrogen phosphate ion), their mixture would form a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. 

So the solution is a buffer solution. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, I'm not directly asked about the pH, but about the concentration of PO4^3-.

Hmm. Let me think. The phosphate species in solution would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because those are the ions from the salts. But can any of them deprotonate further to form PO4^3-? Well, the third dissociation constant is Ka3 = 1.8e-12, which is really small. That means HPO4^2- can deprotonate to PO
