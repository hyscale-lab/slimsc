Okay, so I have this physics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment in different magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So, the setup is that the particle's magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with it. Then, they turn off that field and turn on another one along +Y, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when a magnetic moment is in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque which affects its orientation. But because the particle is spin-1/2, it's quantized. Oh right, the energy levels are quantized.

Initially, the field is along Z. So the magnetic moment is aligned along Z. The spin state is probably in the eigenstate of Sz, which would be either up or down. But when the field is suddenly switched to Y, the system isn't in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, which is now proportional to Sy. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The key here is probably to find the time evolution of the expectation value of Sz after the field changes.

So, let's model this. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, where S is the spin operator. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu·B. So before the switch, H_initial = -gamma B S_z. After the switch, H_final = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, when the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. But wait, since the magnetic field is along +Y, the direction matters. So H = -gamma B * (S · Y direction). The Y component is S_y, so yeah, H = -gamma B S_y.

But wait, the initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial. Let me think: the initial state must be an eigenstate of S_z. Let's say it's |+z>, which is the eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ/2.

When the Hamiltonian changes to H = -gamma B S_y, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve
