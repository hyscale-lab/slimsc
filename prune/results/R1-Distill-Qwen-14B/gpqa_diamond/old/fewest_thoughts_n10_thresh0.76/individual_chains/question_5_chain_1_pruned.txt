Okay, so I need to find the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is ħ/2 times a 2x2 matrix. So first, I should probably figure out what the operator P actually is. Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, I think the operator is along some direction vector n, which can be represented as (x, 0, z) perhaps? Or maybe in spherical coordinates, θ and φ. But wait, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle φ would be either 0 or 180, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the operator is given, and I need to find the eigenvector for a specific eigenvalue, +ħ/2. So the eigenvector equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>. 

But wait, P is a vector operator, so P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z, right? So I need to express P in terms of the components given. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z, where n is the direction vector. Since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. So n_y = 0, and n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). And since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So, constructing the operator P in terms of n's components. Let me write each component matrix:

P_x matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

P_y matrix:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

P_z matrix:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, -1] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So, the operator P would be n_x * P_x + 0*P_y + n_z * P_z.

Which is:

P = (n_x * (ħ/2)) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z * (ħ/2)) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix. Let's compute each term:

First term: n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
So that becomes [[0, n_x ħ/2], [n_x ħ/2, 0]]

Second term: n_z * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]
Which is [[n_z ħ/2, 0], [0, -n_z ħ/2]]

Adding these together, the matrix P is:

[ [n_z ħ/2, n_x ħ/2 ],
  [n_x ħ/2, -n_z ħ/2 ] ]

So P is a 2x2 matrix. Now, I need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Eigenvector equation: (P - λ I) |v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue.

So λ is +ħ/2.

So P - λ I = [ [n_z ħ/2 - ħ/2, n_x ħ/2 ],
              [n_x ħ/2, -n_z ħ/2 - ħ/2 ] ]

Simplify each element:

First row first column: ħ/2 (n_z - 1)
First row second column: (ħ/2) n_x
Second row first column: (ħ/2) n_x
Second row second column: ħ/2 (-n_z - 1 )

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ (n_z -1) ħ/2 , n_x ħ/2 ],
  [ n_x ħ/2 , (-n_z -1) ħ/2 ] ]

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x ],
            [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ]

So the equation is (P - λ I) v = 0, so:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x ],
         [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ] * [v1; v2] = 0

Since ħ/2 is a scalar factor, we can ignore it for the purposes of finding the eigenvector. So, we get the system:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0
n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0
Equation 2: n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0

Since the system is homogeneous, we can solve for the ratio of v1 to v2.

Let me take equation 1:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0
=> v1 = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] v2

Wait, but wait. Let me rearrange equation 1:

(n_z - 1) v1 = -n_x v2
v1 = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] v2

Similarly, equation 2:

n_x v1 = (n_z + 1) v2
v1 = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] v2

Wait, so from equation 1 and equation 2, we have two expressions for v1 in terms of v2.

So:

v1 = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] v2
v1 = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] v2

Set them equal:

[ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] v2 = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] v2

Assuming v2 is not zero, we can divide both sides by v2:

- n_x / (n_z -1) = (n_z + 1)/n_x

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1) * n_x:

- n_x^2 = (n_z + 1)(n_z -1 )

Which simplifies to:

- n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1

But wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

So substituting n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.

Left side: -(1 - n_z^2)

So:

- (1 - n_z^2) = n_z^2 -1

Which becomes:

-1 + n_z^2 = n_z^2 -1

Which is an identity (both sides equal), so it doesn't give any new information. That suggests that the two equations are dependent, so we have one equation. So either equation can be used to find the ratio.

So using equation 1:

v
