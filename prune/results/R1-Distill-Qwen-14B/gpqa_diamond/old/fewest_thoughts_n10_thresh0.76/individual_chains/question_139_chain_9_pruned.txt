Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that two compounds, A and B, are treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment leads to the formation of two different diketones. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when certain compounds react with HCl, NaNO2, and water, it's probably related to diazotization or maybe some kind of substitution. Wait, wait, no. Let me think. Diazonium salts are usually formed from amines, right? But this reaction produces diketones, which have two ketone groups. So maybe it's something else.

Oh wait, I've heard about the Stephen reduction or maybe the benzidine assay, but that's for amines. Another thought: maybe it's the oxidation of certain functional groups. Or perhaps it's about the formation of ketones from alcohols.

Wait a second, another possibility: the Beckmann rearrangement. No, that's for oximes converting to amides. Not sure about that. Alternatively, what about the oxidation of alcohols to ketones? Oh, but how does that fit with HCl, NaNO2, and water?

Wait, I think I remember something about the HNO2 (nitrous acid) reaction with alcohols. Oh, right! There's a reaction where primary alcohols can be treated with nitrous acid to form diazonium salts, which can then undergo various reactions like the Sandmeyer reaction. But wait, that's more for aromatic amines, I think.

Alternatively, maybe this is about the formation of carbonyl groups from alcohols via some kind of elimination. Oh, wait! Could it be the formation of ketones from secondary alcohols via oxidation? But HCl and NaNO2 don't directly oxidize alcohols. Maybe it's a different pathway.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a nitronium ion, which acts as an oxidizing agent. So, maybe secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones under these conditions. Let me think: HCl and NaNO2 in aqueous solution would produce nitrous acid (HONO). Nitrous acid is a mild oxidizing agent. So, if A and B are secondary alcohols, treating them with nitrous acid would oxidize them
