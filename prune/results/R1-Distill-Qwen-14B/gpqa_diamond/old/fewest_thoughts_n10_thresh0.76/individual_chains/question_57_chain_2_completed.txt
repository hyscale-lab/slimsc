Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momentum states, I think. The phase shifts provided are δ₀=90 degrees, δ₁=67 degrees, δ₂=55 degrees, δ₃=30 degrees, and δ₄=13 degrees. They also mention to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess we're only considering these delta values up to δ₄.

They ask for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula for f(θ) when you have partial waves is a sum over l of (2l + 1) * e^{2iδ_l} * (sin δ_l) * P_l(cosθ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0.

So when θ is zero, cosθ is 1, so the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are 1 for l=0, zero for l>0. Because P_l(1)=1 for l=0, and for any higher l, it's some other value but wait no, let me think. Wait, no, actually, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_l(1)=1. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Let me recall: For each l, P_l(1) is indeed 1, because when x=1, P_l(1)=1. Because the series expansion would evaluate to 1. So for each l, the term (2l+1) * e^{2iδ_l} * sin δ_l * P_l(1) would contribute only if l=0 or other l? Wait, but when θ=0, each P_l(1) is 1, right? So that's not zero except for l=0?

Wait, no, that can't be right because for example, l=1: P1(x) = x, so at x=1, it's 1. For l=2, it's (3x²-1)/2, so at x=1, that's (3-1)/2=1. Hmm, wait, so for any l, P_l(1) is 1. So all terms contribute?

Wait, that's a problem because when I look at the formula for f(θ=0), it's a sum over all l of (2l+1) * e^{2i δ_l} * sin δ_l * P_l(1), and since P_l(1) is 1, it's sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I think they mean to consider only up to l=4, since the given phase shifts go up to δ4. So l=0 to 4.

But wait, that can't be right because if all l contribute, then the sum would include all these terms. But the question is asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0. Let me think about the expression for f(θ) again.

Wait, the general expression for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is:

f(θ) = ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ)

So the imaginary part of f(θ) is Im[f(θ)] = ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) Im[e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ)]

But when θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So the imaginary part becomes sum (2l+1) Im[ e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l ].

But sin δ_l is a real number, and e^{2i δ_l} = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). So e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l = [cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l)] * sin δ_l.

So the imaginary part of this is sin(2δ_l) * sin δ_l.

Wait, no. Let me compute Im[e^{2i δ} sin δ] = sin δ * Im[e^{2i δ}]. Because e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So Im[e^{iθ}] = sinθ. So for e^{2i δ}, Im[e^{2i δ}] = sin(2δ).

So Im[e^{2i δ} sin δ] = sin δ * sin(2δ).

Wait, wait, let me make that clearer. Let me compute e^{2i δ} sin δ.

Express e^{2i δ} as cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ). Then multiply by sin δ:

= sin δ cos(2δ) + i sin δ sin(2δ).

The imaginary part is the coefficient of i, which is sin δ sin(2δ).

So Im[e^{2i δ} sin δ] = sin δ * sin(2δ).

But wait, another approach: since sin δ is real, and e^{2i δ} is a complex number, their product's imaginary part is sin δ times the imaginary part of e^{2i δ}.

Which is sin δ * sin(2δ).

Alternatively, using trigonometric identities: sin(2δ) = 2 sin δ cos δ.

So Im[e^{2i δ} sin δ] = sin δ * sin(2δ) = sin δ * 2 sin δ cos δ = 2 sin²δ cos δ.

Wait, that's another way to write it.

But regardless, the important part is that for each l, the contribution to the imaginary part of f(0) is (2l+1) * sin δ_l * sin(2δ_l).

Wait, let me compute that. So the imaginary part of f(0) is sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) * [sin δ_l * sin(2 δ_l)].

So let's compute each term for l=0 to 4.

Given the phase shifts:

δ0=90 degrees → π/2 radians.

δ1=67 degrees.

δ2=55 degrees.

δ3=30 degrees.

δ4=13 degrees.

Let's compute each term.

First, for l=0:

(2(0)+1) =1.

sin δ0 = sin 90° = 1.

sin(2*90°) = sin(180°) = 0.

So term for l=0 is 1 * 1 * 0 = 0.

So no contribution from l=0.

l=1:

(2*1+1)=3.

sin δ1 = sin67°.

sin(2*67) = sin(134 degrees).

Compute these values.

Let me compute each numerically.

sin67 ≈ 0.9205.

sin(134) is sin(180-46)= sin46 ≈ 0.7193.

So term is 3 * 0.9205 * 0.7193.

Calculate 0.9205 * 0.7193 ≈ 0.9205 * 0.72 ≈ 0.6627.

Multiply by 3: 3 * 0.6627 ≈ 1.988.

So term ≈1.988.

l=2:

(2*2+1)=5.

sin55≈0.8192.

sin(110)=sin(70)≈0.9397.

So term is 5 * 0.8192 * 0.9397.

Compute 0.8192 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.7735.

Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.7735 ≈3.8675.

l=3:

(2*3+1)=7.

sin30=0.5.

sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

So term is 7 * 0.5 * 0.8660 =7 * 0.4330=3.031.

l=4:

(2*4+1)=9.

sin13≈0.22495.

sin(26)≈0.4384.

So term is 9 * 0.22495 * 0.4384.

Compute 0.22495 * 0.4384 ≈0.0985.

Multiply by 9: 9 * 0.0985≈0.8865.

Now sum all terms:

l=1: 1.988

l=2:3.8675

l=3:3.031

l=4:0.8865

Sum them up.

1.988 +3.8675 =5.8555.

5.8555 +3.031=8.8865.

8.8865 +0.8865=9.773.

So total imaginary part is approximately 9.773.

Wait, but wait. The question is talking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which is given in units of fm, I think. Because the options are in fm.

Wait, but in the formula, the amplitude f has units of fm. So once I calculate this sum, what is it? Because I think the formula for f is in terms of these terms, but I might be missing some factors.

Wait, I think I might have missed a factor in the formula. Let me go back.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ)

Wait, no, wait. Another formula I recall is that in partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] P_l (cosθ)

But wait, I might be confusing it with something else. Alternatively, another expression is:

f(θ) = ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ sin δ_l e^{i δ_l} ] P_l (cosθ)

Wait, I think the correct expression is:

f(θ) = ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l (cosθ)

Wait, but then the units would depend on the factors. I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the actual formula includes a factor like 1/(k) or something else.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the scattering amplitude f in terms of partial waves and phase shifts is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ)

But I'm not entirely sure. Or perhaps it's:

f(θ) = ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ (e^{2i δ_l} -1)/ (2ik) ] P_l (cosθ)

Wait, if I can't remember the exact formula, maybe I can think about the units. The scattering amplitude f has units of length (since it's a cross-section like quantity when multiplied by k^2, perhaps? Or maybe because the cross-section is |f|^2 multiplied by k^2 or something else.)

Wait, but in this problem, the phase shifts δ_l are provided, and the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the direction of the incident beam (θ=0), so f(0).

Assuming that the formula is f(θ) = sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(1)

Because P_l(1)=1, so f(0)= sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l.

But wait, the amplitude f has units of fm, right? Because the options are in fm.

But in the partial wave expansion, the amplitude f is typically written as:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) P_l (cosθ) ]

Where k is the wave number. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps f is given as:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ)

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the imaginary part is the sum I calculated earlier, multiplied by some factor.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. So if the formula is f(θ)=sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l, then the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l sin(2δ_l) as I calculated, which gives about 9.773.

But the options are all in the hundreds or thousands. So 9.773 is much smaller than the options given. So perhaps I'm missing a multiplicative factor, such as 1/(2ik), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ)

In that case, the imaginary part would be (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) [ Im( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) ] P_l(1) since cosθ=1 at θ=0.

Wait, but P_l(1)=1, so Im( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) = Im(e^{2i δ_l}) because Im(-1)=0.

e^{2i δ_l} = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l), so Im(e^{2i δ_l})= sin(2δ_l).

So the imaginary part is (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Wait, but wait, because [e^{2i δ_l} -1] = e^{2i δ_l} -1, which has real and imaginary parts.

So the imaginary part is [ Im(e^{2i δ_l} ) - Im(1) ] = sin(2δ_l) - 0 = sin(2δ_l).

So the imaginary part of f(0) would be:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)

Hmm, but then what is k? The wave number k is given by (E)^{1/2}/ħ, but perhaps in units where ħ= c=1, or perhaps in this problem, k is the wave number corresponding to 50 MeV electrons.

Wait, the problem states that the incident electrons are 50 MeV. So the wave number k can be calculated using the energy of the electron.

The energy of an electron is given by E = (ħ² k²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

But let's compute it. The mass of the electron is about 9.109e-31 kg.

E is 50 MeV. Let's convert that to Joules.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 50 MeV =50e6 eV =50e6 *1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.

Then, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ.

Compute numerator:

2mE = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-13 J.

Multiply 2 *9.109e-31=1.8218e-30.

Multiply by 8.01e-13: 1.8218e-30 *8.01e-13 =1.459e-42.

sqrt(1.459e-42) = sqrt(1.459)*1e-21 ≈ 1.208e-21 m^-1.

Divide by ħ=1.05457e-34:

k≈1.208e-21 / 1.05457e-34 ≈ 1.208e-21 / 1.05e-34 ≈ approx 1.15e13 m^{-1}.

Wait, but that's a very large number. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, another approach: perhaps it's better to use natural units for this calculation, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by:

Im(f) = (k/(2)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(1) )

Wait, but I'm not finding a clear recollection of the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l sin(2δ_l), as before, but that gave me 9.773, which is not matching any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options: option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 355.351e-15 meters. Option C is about 177, which is half of that. Option D is 251, which is about a third of option A (87163), but all are in the hundreds or tens of thousands.

Hmm, my previous sum gave 9.773, which is way too small. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1e6 or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes the wave number k in the expression. Let me think again.

The general expression is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ)

So the imaginary part of f(0) is:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2ik)) * ∑ (2l+1) Im( e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) * P_l(1)

= (1/(2ik)) * ∑ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * 1

= [1/(2ik)] * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)

So we need to compute this sum, multiply by [1/(2ik)].

So let's compute the sum first.

Compute sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) for l=0 to 4.

l=0: (1) * sin(0) =0.

l=1:3 * sin(134) → sin(134 degrees)=sin(180-46)=sin46≈0.7193.

So 3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110) → sin(110)=sin(70)=approx 0.9397. 5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60) → sin60=√3/2≈0.8660. 7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26) → sin26≈0.4384. 9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum these:

2.1579 +4.6985 =6.8564.

6.8564 +6.062=12.9184.

12.9184 +3.9456 =16.864.

So sum is approximately 16.864.

Now, compute Im(f(0)) = [1/(2ik)] * 16.864.

But we need to find k. Earlier, I calculated k as approximately 1.15e13 m^{-1}.

But wait, that seems very large. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, the energy E of the electron is 50 MeV. Let me get the correct expression for k.

The relation between energy E and wave number k for a free particle is E = (ħ²k²)/(2m).

Rearranged, k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

E is in Joules, m is in kg.

E=50 MeV =50e6 *1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.

m=9.109e-31 kg.

So,

k = sqrt( (2 * 9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J) ) / (1.05457e-34 J·s)

Compute numerator inside sqrt:

2 *9.109e-31 =1.8218e-30.

Multiply by 8.01e-13: 1.8218e-30 *8.01e-13 =1.459e-42.

sqrt(1.459e-42) = approx 1.208e-21 m^{-1}.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, sqrt(1.459e-42) is (1.459e-42)^0.5 = 1.208e-21.

So k = 1.208e-21 / 1.05457e-34 ≈ (1.208 / 1.05457) ) * 1e13 m^{-1}.

1.208 /1.05457 ≈1.145.

So k ≈1.145e13 m^{-1}.

So 2ik =2i *1.145e13 = 2.29e13 i.

Then Im(f(0))= [1/(2ik)] * 16.864.

Wait, 1/(2ik) = 1/(2i * 1.145e13) = 1/(2.29e13 i) = -i/(2.29e13) ) (since 1/i = -i).

So [1/(2ik)] * sum = [ -i/(2.29e13) ) ] * 16.864.

But the imaginary part of f is Im(f) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) )

Wait, wait, perhaps I should re-express this. Let's compute [1/(2ik)] * sum.

sum is 16.864.

So [1/(2ik)] = 1/(2i k) = (1/(2k)) * (1/i) ) = (1/(2k)) (-i) )

So [1/(2ik)] * sum = [ -i/(2k) ) ] * sum.

So, the imaginary part of f is the real part of this expression, because f is complex and Im(f) is the coefficient of i in f.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The imaginary part of f is the coefficient of i in the expression.

But let's compute [ (1/(2ik)) * sum ].

Which is [1/(2ik)] *16.864.

Let me compute [1/(2ik)]:

= (1/(2i )) * (1/k )

= ( -i/(2)) * (1/k )

Because 1/i = -i.

So,

Im(f(0)) = [ -i/(2k) ] * 16.864.

But this is a complex number, and the imaginary part is the coefficient of i. Wait, but wait: the expression is ( -i *16.864 ) / (2k).

So,

= (-i 16.864 )/(2k )

= (-i 8.432 ) /k.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is the coefficient of i, which is (-8.432 ) /k.

But wait, the imaginary part is a real number, so perhaps I messed up somewhere. Because the entire term is imaginary, so the imaginary part would be (-8.432 /k ) * i, but I'm looking for the imaginary part as a real value.

Wait, no. Let me think again: f(0) is a complex number, given by some real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part of f(0) is a real number. So in the expression above, the entire term is imaginary. So the imaginary part is ( -8.432 /k ), which is a real number.

So,

Im(f(0)) = (-8.432 ) /k.

But since k is positive, this would be a negative value. However, the options are positive, so perhaps I made a sign error.

But let's proceed with the magnitude.

Compute 8.432 / k.

k is 1.145e13 m^{-1}.

So,

8.432 /1.145e13 ≈7.36e-13 meters.

But 1 meter is 1e15 femtometers (fm). So,

7.36e-13 m =7.36e-13 *1e15 fm =736 fm.

Wait, that's about 736 fm. But the options are B) 355, C) 177, D)251, etc. Hmm, none match exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) from l=0 to4:

l=0: 1 * sin(0)=0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134°) ≈3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2: 5 * sin(110) ≈5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 *sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.

That's correct.

k calculation:

E=50 MeV =50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

m=9.109e-31 kg.

k= sqrt(2 m E)/ħ.

2mE=2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13= 1.459e-42.

sqrt(1.459e-42)=1.208e-21 m^{-1/2}.

Wait, no, sqrt(1.459e-42) is sqrt(1.459) * 1e-21 = approx 1.208e-21.

ħ=1.05457e-34 J·s.

So k = (1.208e-21 m^{-1/2})/(1.05457e-34 s^{-1})? Wait, no, units are messed up, perhaps.

Wait, the formula for k is k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ.

So units: sqrt( kg * J ) / ( J·s )

But J= kg m^2/s^2.

So sqrt(kg * kg m^2/s^2 ) = sqrt( kg^2 m^2/s^2 ) ) = kg m/s.

So sqrt(2mE) has units of kg m/s.

Then, ħ is J·s= kg m^2/s^2 * s= kg m^2/s.

So (kg m/s) / ( kg m^2/s ) ) = (kg m/s) * (s)/(kg m^2) )= 1/(m).

So yes, k has units of m^{-1}.

So the calculation of k is correct: 1.208e-21 /1.05457e-34 ≈1.145e13 m^{-1}.

So 1/k is approx 8.72e-14 m.

So 8.432 /k ≈8.432/(1.145e13)= approx 7.36e-13 m.

Convert to fm: 1 m=1e15 fm, so 7.36e-13 m=7.36e-13 *1e15 fm=736 fm.

But the options don't have 736. The closest is option A: 87163.4 fm which is way bigger, B is 355, C:177, D:251.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the initial formula I used was incorrect. Earlier, I considered f(θ)=sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ), but perhaps the correct formula includes 1/(k), which would change the calculation.

Wait, I found a reference that says that the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ).

So the imaginary part of f(θ=0):

Im(f(0))= (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(1).

As P_l(1)=1, this becomes:

Im(f(0))= (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So sum is 16.864 as before.

So, compute (1/(2ik)) *16.864.

k=1.145e13 m^{-1}.

So (1/(2ik)) = 1/(2i *1.145e13 )= (1/(2.29e13 i ) )= -i/(2.29e13 ).

Multiply by sum: (-i *16.864)/(2.29e13 )= (-i *7.36e-13 ) = -i *7.36e-13 m.

But the imaginary part is the coefficient of i, so Im(f(0))= -7.36e-13 m.

But that's -736 fm. But the options are all positive. Also, none of the options match exactly. However, perhaps I made a sign mistake. Or perhaps the question is considering the magnitude.

Wait, but the options are given as positive numbers. So perhaps the correct answer is 736 fm, but it's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recheck.

Wait, for l=3, 2δ_l is 60 degrees. sin(60)=0.8660. So 7 * 0.8660=6.062.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, for l=4, 2δ_l=26 degrees, sin26≈0.4384. 9 *0.4384=3.9456. Correct.

So sum is 16.864.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in k. Let me recheck the calculation of k.

Wait, E=50 MeV.

But wait, electrons are relativistic? At 50 MeV, which is much less than their rest mass (about 0.511 MeV). So non-relativistic approximation is okay.

Wait, but in non-relativistic case, E = (ħ²k²)/(2m).

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Because when I compute k, I think I forgot a factor of 1e6 or something.

Wait, E=50 MeV =50e6 eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 50e6 eV =50e6 *1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So, 2mE=2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J.

Compute 2*9.109e-31 =1.8218e-30.

1.8218e-30 *8.01e-13 =1.8218e-30 *8.01e-13 = (1.8218 *8.01 )e-43 ≈14.59e-43 =1.459e-42.

sqrt(1.459e-42 )=1.208e-21 m^{-1/2}.

Wait, but the units are correct?

Wait, sqrt(kg * J )=sqrt(kg * kg m^2/s^2 )= kg^{1/2} m/s.

Then, ħ is J·s= kg m^2/s^2 * s= kg m^2/s.

So, kg^{1/2} m/s divided by kg m^2/s → (kg^{1/2} m/s ) / (kg m^2/s ) ) = (1/(kg^{1/2} m )) ) → m^{-1}.

So the calculation is correct.

So k=1.208e-21 /1.05457e-34 = approx 1.145e13 m^{-1}.

Hmm. So 1/k is about 8.72e-14 m.

But then, 8.432 /k is 7.36e-13 m =736 fm. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ).

In that case, the imaginary part would be (1/k) sum (2l+1) sinδ_l sin(2δ_l).

Then, sum is 9.773 as before.

So Im(f)=9.773 /k.

k=1.145e13 m^{-1}.

So 9.773 /1.145e13 ≈8.53e-13 m =853 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ).

So then, Im(f)=sum (2l+1) sinδ_l sin(2δ_l) =9.773.

That would give Im(f)=9.773 fm^{-1}? No, that can't be because units would be inverse meters.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for f is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)

Which would make the imaginary part:

Im(f)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(1).

That would be the same as before, leading to 736 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f(θ) = sum (2l+1) [ (e^{2i δ_l} -1 )/ (2ik) ] P_l (cosθ).

In that case, the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) / (2k) ].

So,

Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k).

Sum is 16.864, so 16.864/(2k) =16.864/(2*1.145e13 )=16.864/(2.29e13 )=7.356e-13 m =735.6 fm.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

So the imaginary part is [1/(2ik)] * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Which gives the same 735 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1e-6 somewhere? Wait, 735 fm is 0.735e-12 meters.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in inverse fm.

Because 1 fm=1e-15 m.

So k=1.145e13 m^{-1} = 1.145e13 / (1e-15 m^{-1}) )= 1.145e28 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 m =1e15 fm, so 1 m^{-1} =1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So k=1.145e13 m^{-1} =1.145e13 *1e-15 fm^{-1} =1.145e-2 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k = (1e2)/(1.145) fm.

So 1/k≈87.2 fm.

Wait, then Im(f)= ( sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) / (2k )

sum=16.864.

So Im(f)=16.864/(2k) =16.864/(2 *1.145e13 m^{-1} )

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute using 1/k in fm.

k=1.145e13 m^{-1} =1.145e13 *1e15 fm = 1.145e28 fm^{-1}.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think.

Wait, 1 m =1e15 fm → 1 m^{-1} =1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So 1.145e13 m^{-1} =1.145e13 *1e-15 fm^{-1} =1.145e-2 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k = (1 /1.145e-2 fm^{-1}) ) =87.2 fm.

So then,

Im(f)= ( sum )/(2k ) = [16.864 ] / (2 *1.145e-2 fm^{-1} )

Wait, no, units are getting messy. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute everything in terms of fm.

Let me recompute k in fm^{-1}.

k= sqrt(2mE)/ ħ.

But let me compute everything in terms of fm.

E=50 MeV.

But to compute k in fm^{-1}, perhaps using natural units where ħ=c=1, but I'm not familiar with the exact expressions.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for k in terms of the electron's momentum.

But perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of the Compton wavelength.

The Compton wavelength λ_c= 2πħ/(m c).

But again, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to realize that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f is given by:

Im(f) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin(2δl) P_l(1).

But with P_l(1)=1.

So Im(f)= (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δl).

Sum=16.864.

k=1.145e13 m^{-1}.

1/k=8.72e-14 m.

So Im(f)=16.864 *8.72e-14 m=1.467e-12 m=1467 fm.

Still not matching any of the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Hmm. 1467 is close to option A, but no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe I should use the formula without the 2ik in denominator.

Wait, another approach. Let me try to find a known formula.

In partial wave analysis for scattering, the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

The imaginary part of f(θ=0) is then:

Im(f(0))= (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Because, as before, P_l(1)=1, and [e^{2iδ_l} -1] has imaginary part sin(2δ_l).

So sum is 16.864.

Im(f)= (1/(2k)) *16.864.

But 1/k=8.72e-14 m.

So 16.864/(2 *1.145e13 )=16.864/(2.29e13 )=7.36e-13 m=736 fm.

Again, this doesn't match any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the sum.

Wait, let's recompute the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l):

l=0: 1 * sin(0)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134) =3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.

That's correct.

Hmm. So I'm not seeing any mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps another approach: perhaps the question is actually asking for the real part, but that would change things.

Alternatively, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians, but we treated them as degrees. That would change everything.

Wait, the phase shifts are given in degrees: δ0=90°, etc.

If I mistakenly treated them as radians, that would be a problem.

Wait, let me reevaluate with δ in radians.

δ0=90 degrees = π/2 ≈1.5708 rad.

Compute sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) in radians.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin(0)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(2*1.5708 * (67/180) )

Wait no, l=1's δ is 67 degrees, which is 67 * π/180 ≈1.169 radians.

So 2δ_l = 2.338 radians.

sin(2.338)=approx 0.717.

So term l=1:3 *0.717≈2.151.

l=2:5 * sin(2*55 degrees in radians).

55 degrees is 0.9599 rad. 2δ=1.9198 rad.

sin(1.9198)=approx 0.944.

So term l=2:5 *0.944≈4.72.

l=3:30 degrees is 0.5236 rad.

2δ=1.0472 rad.

sin(1.0472)= approx 0.866.

So term l=3:7 *0.866≈6.062.

l=4:13 degrees→0.2269 rad.

2δ=0.4538 rad.

sin(0.4538)=0.437.

Term l=4:9 *0.437≈3.933.

Sum: 2.151 +4.72 =6.871 +6.062=12.933 +3.933=16.866.

So sum is about the same, 16.866.

So no change in sum.

Thus, the same result as before, 736 fm.

But options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another thought: perhaps the imaginary part of the amplitude is given by (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) , but that would be:

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Compute that:

l=0: 1 * sin90=1.

l=1:3 * sin67≈3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 *sin55≈5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *sin13≈9 *0.22495=2.0246.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0246=13.3821.

So sum is 13.3821.

But I don't see how this would relate to the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would be 13.38, which is still not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. But looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 355 fm.

Which is roughly 355≈ (16.864 * 22.063e-15 ) → but not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would give 13.38, but that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula involves a factor of 4π.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ)= (1/(k)) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{2i δ_l} -1 )/(2ik) ] P_l(cosθ).

Which would make:

Im(f)= (1/(2k²)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

But that would make the value much smaller.

But k=1.145e13 m^{-1}.

k²= (1.145e13 )²=1.31e26 m^{-2}.

So,

Im(f)=16.864/(2 *1.31e26 )= 16.864/(2.62e26 )=6.43e-26 m=6.43e-11 fm, which is way too small.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the amplitude f is given by:

f(θ) = sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

So, the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(1).

Which gives sum=16.864.

So, Im(f)=16.864.

But this is in units of fm? Because the options are in the hundreds, but 16.864 is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 355 fm, but I can't see how to get there.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im(f) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * something.

But when I computed sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, I got 13.38.

But 13.38 * something=355 → something= about 26.5.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of considering all phase shifts, only the first non-zero phase shift contributes. No, the question says to ignore the rest beyond given, which includes up to δ4.

I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is B)355.351 fm.

But I'm not certain.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts provided are $\delta_0 = 90^\circ$, $\delta_1 = 67^\circ$, $\delta_2 = 55^\circ$, $\delta_3 = 30^\circ$, and $\delta_4 = 13^\circ$, with the instruction to ignore higher phase shifts. The scattering amplitude $f(\theta)$ is expressed in terms of partial waves, and the imaginary part of $f(0)$ is derived using the formula:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l),
\]

where $k$ is the wave number of the incident electrons. The wave number $k$ is calculated using the relation:

\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar},
\]

with $E = 50 \, \text{MeV}$ being the energy of the electrons, $m$ the mass of the electron, and $\hbar$ the reduced Planck constant. Converting $E$ to joules and performing the calculation yields $k \approx 1.145 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^{-1}$.

The sum $\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)$ is computed as follows:

- For $l=0$: $1 \cdot \sin(0) = 0$.
- For $l=1$: $3 \cdot \sin(134^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot 0.7193 = 2.1579$.
- For $l=2$: $5 \cdot \sin(110^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot 0.9397 = 4.6985$.
- For $l=3$: $7 \cdot \sin(60^\circ) \approx 7 \cdot 0.8660 = 6.062$.
- For $l=4$: $9 \cdot \sin(26^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot 0.4384 = 3.9456$.

Adding these contributions gives:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 = 16.864.
\]

Substituting into the formula for $\text{Im}(f(0))$:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{16.864}{2k} = \frac{16.864}{2 \cdot 1.145 \times 10^{13}} \approx \frac{16.864}{2.29 \times 10^{13}} \approx 7.36 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{m}.
\]

Converting to femtometers ($1 \, \text{m} = 10^{15} \, \text{fm}$):

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 7.36 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{m} \times 10^{15} \, \text{fm/m} = 736 \, \text{fm}.
\]

However, none of the provided options match this result exactly. The closest option is **B) 355.351 fm**, which could suggest a discrepancy in the interpretation of the formula or the units. Given the available choices, the most reasonable answer is:

**Answer: B**
