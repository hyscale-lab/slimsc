Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base. When it's dissolved in an acid, it should react to form Fe^3+ ions and water. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. So the H+ ions from the strong acid will attack the hydroxide ions from Fe(OH)3.

The problem gives me 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I need to find out how many moles that is. The formula mass of Fe(OH)3 is Fe (55.85 g/mol) + 3*(O (16) + H (1)) = 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85... yeah, approximately 9.36e-4 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:3 for Fe(OH)3 to H+, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+. So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid provided is a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. Monobasic means it donates one H+ per molecule, so the concentration is 0.1 mol per liter. To find the volume needed, I can use the formula: moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). Rearranging, Volume = moles / Molarity.

Plugging in the numbers: Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but the options don't list exactly 28.08. Let me look again. Option C is 28.05 cm³ and B is 30.09 cm³. Hmm, maybe I should be more precise with the calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Let me recalculate that. Fe is 55.845, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.845 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 55.845 + 3*(17.008) = 55.845 + 51.024 = 106.869 g/mol. So 0.1 g divided by 106.869 is approximately 0.0009357 moles. That's about the same as before, so the volume calculation remains close.

So 0.002807 moles of H+ needed. Divided by 0.1 M gives 0.02807 L, which is 28.07 cm³. So the closest option for the volume would be option C's 28.05 cm³. But let me look at the options again. Option C is 28.05 and the pH is 2.04.
