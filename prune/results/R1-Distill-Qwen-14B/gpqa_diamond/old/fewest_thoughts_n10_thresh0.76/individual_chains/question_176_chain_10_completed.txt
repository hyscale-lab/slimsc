Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with observables and their measurements, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So the problem is about measuring P first and then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

The system's state is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors, so maybe this is a normalized vector? I should check if it's normalized. The components are -1, 2, 1. The norm squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the state is not normalized. Oh wait, but perhaps the actual state is a normalized version of this vector divided by sqrt(6)? Because in quantum mechanics, states are typically unit vectors.

So the state vector |ψ> is ( -1, 2, 1 ) divided by sqrt(6). Let me write that as |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Now, the operators P and Q are given. Let me write down their matrices.

Operator P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q's matrix:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

Wait, Q looks like a diagonal matrix. So its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. Because the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are the diagonal elements. So when we measure Q, possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. Oh, but in the question, we are interested in the probability of getting -1 for Q.

But wait, the measurement is done after P. So first we measure P, then Q. Or wait, the problem says someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the order is measure P first, then Q. But when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenvector of that observable. So the measurement of P changes the state, and then Q is measured on that new state.

Wait no, the problem says: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. Oh, so the order is first P, then Q. So the initial state is |ψ>, measure P, get a certain outcome (0 in this case), then the state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, measure Q on that state to get -1.

But wait, the question is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. So the process is: measure P, get 0, then measure Q on the resulting state, get -1. So the probability is the product of the probability of P=0 and, given that P=0, the probability of Q=-1.

Alternatively, maybe the two measurements are done in sequence, but perhaps the first measurement affects the second.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that when P is measured, the outcome is 0, and then the state is projected onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, when Q is measured on that state, what is the probability of getting -1.

So first, I need to find the eigenvectors of P for eigenvalue 0. Then, the state after measuring P=0 is the projection of the initial state onto this eigenspace.

Wait, but actually, when you measure P and get 0, the state collapses into an eigenvector of P corresponding to 0. So perhaps P has only one eigenvector for eigenvalue 0, or maybe a subspace. Let me check the matrix of P.

The P matrix is:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]

Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

So to find eigenvalues, I need to find the determinant of (P - λ I). Let's compute the characteristic equation for P.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note the structure of P. Looking at P, it's a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

Let me think about the possible eigenvalues. The matrix P is 3x3. Let me try to find its eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to notice that P has 0 as an eigenvalue because the sum of each row is zero?

Wait, sum of first row: 0 + 1/sqrt(2) +0 = 1/sqrt(2) which is not zero. So that approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps we can perform row operations or look for eigenvectors.

Looking for eigenvectors for λ=0: solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 => P v = 0.

So P v = 0. Let me write the equations:

Row 1: (0) v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

Row 3: 0 v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 +0 v3 = 0 → v2 =0.

So from row 1 and 3: v2=0.

From row 2: v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where v2=0 and v1=-v3. So the eigenspace is two-dimensional. So any vector of the form (a, 0, -a) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

Wait no, because when I set v1 = -v3, and v2=0, the vector is (a, 0, -a). So it's a one-dimensional eigenspace, because all vectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,0,-1). 

Wait, but wait a second, because the equation from row 2 is v1 = -v3. So the vector can be written as (a, 0, -a), which is a one-dimensional space. So the eigenvalue 0 has multiplicity 1, and the eigenvector is (1,0,-1) up to scaling.

So when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses into a scalar multiple of (1,0,-1). But wait, the initial state is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6). Let me compute the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace of P=0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is the component of |ψ> in the direction of (1,0,-1).

So the projection would be [ <e|ψ> ] |e>, where |e> is the normalized eigenvector (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

So first, normalize |e>: (1,0,-1)/sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

Compute the inner product <e|ψ>:

= (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) * ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )

Wait, wait no. Wait, |ψ> is ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6). So let me write |ψ> as [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

The eigenvector |e> is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + (0)*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

Which is (-1)/(sqrt(12)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(12)).

That's (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) → because sqrt(12) is 2 sqrt(3). So (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

So <e|ψ> = -1/sqrt(3).

So the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace of P=0 is |e> multiplied by |<e|ψ>|^2? Wait, no, the projection is ( <e|ψ> ) |e>.

So the state after measuring P=0 is |e> multiplied by |e>, but wait, no: when you measure P and get 0, the state becomes the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace, which in this case is ( <e|ψ> ) |e>.

So the new state is ( -1/sqrt(3) ) * |e> = ( -1/sqrt(3) ) * (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2) = [ -1/(sqrt(3)*sqrt(2)), 0, 1/(sqrt(3)*sqrt(2)) ].

Wait, but the state is a vector, and the probability is the square of the absolute value of <e|ψ>. So the probability of getting P=0 is |<e|ψ>|² = (1/3) → because (1/sqrt(3))² is 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the state is |e>, because the collapse is into the eigenvector.

Wait, no, wait. Because |e> is the normalized eigenvector, and the projection is ( <e|ψ> ) |e> which has a coefficient of -1/sqrt(3). So the state after measurement is |e> multiplied by (-1/sqrt(3)) divided by the norm of that state.

Wait, wait, when you project, the resulting state is ( <e|ψ> ) |e> divided by the norm squared? No, wait. If the initial state is |ψ>, and the projection onto |e> is ( <e|ψ> ) |e>, then the norm of this projection is | <e|ψ> |², which is 1/3. So the normalized state after measurement is ( <e|ψ> / sqrt( |<e|ψ> |² ) ) |e> ). Which is ( (-1/sqrt(3)) / (1/sqrt(3)) ) |e> ) → that's -1 |e>. Wait, no, because the norm squared is 1/3, so the square root is 1/sqrt(3). So the normalized state is ( <e|ψ> ) |e> / ( |<e|ψ> | ) → which is ( (-1/sqrt(3)) |e> ) / ( 1/sqrt(3) ) ) → which is -|e>.

Wait, but vectors are up to a global phase. So the state is just |e> multiplied by a scalar. So the state after measurement is |e>, normalized. So regardless of the negative sign, the state is |e>.

Now, we need to measure Q on this state. The Q operator is diagonal: Q = diag(1, 0, -1). So its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

So the eigenstates are |e1> = (1,0,0), |e2> = (0,1,0), |e3> = (0,0,1).

The state after measuring P=0 is |e> = (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). So to find the probability of measuring Q=-1, we compute the projection of |e> onto |e3>, which is (0,0,1).

So the inner product <e3|e> is the third component of |e>, which is (-1)/sqrt(2). So the probability is | (-1)/sqrt(2) |² = (1/2).

So the probability of getting Q=-1 after P=0 is 1/2.

Wait, but wait. Because the state after P=0 is |e>, and Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the components of |e> along each of the standard basis vectors give the probabilities for each eigenvalue.

So the probability of Q=-1 is the square of the amplitude of the third component of |e>, which is ( -1/sqrt(2) )² = 1/2.

So the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities: probability P=0 (1/3) multiplied by probability Q=-1 given P=0 (1/2) → 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Wait, but wait, no. Because when you first measure P and get 0, the state becomes |e>, and then you measure Q on this state. The probabilities are independent in this case, so the total probability is the product.

So the probability of P=0 is 1/3. The probability of Q=-1 given that the state is |e> is 1/2. So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6. So the answer should be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the sequence of measurements of the observables \( P \) and \( Q \) on the given quantum state. The initial state is \( |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\]

and \( Q \) is represented by:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The eigenvalue \( 0 \) of \( P \) corresponds to the eigenvector \( |e\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto \( |e\rangle \):

\[
P(P=0) = |\langle e | \psi \rangle|^2.
\]

Compute \( \langle e | \psi \rangle \):

\[
\langle e | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (-1 - 1) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

Thus, the probability is:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 2: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
When \( P = 0 \) is measured, the state collapses to the eigenvector \( |e\rangle \), normalized as:

\[
|e\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal, with eigenvalues \( 1, 0, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( Q = -1 \) is \( |e_3\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the projection of \( |e\rangle \) onto \( |e_3\rangle \):

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = |\langle e_3 | e \rangle|^2.
\]

Compute \( \langle e_3 | e \rangle \):

\[
\langle e_3 | e \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Thus, the probability is:

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Joint probability
The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the two probabilities:

\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
