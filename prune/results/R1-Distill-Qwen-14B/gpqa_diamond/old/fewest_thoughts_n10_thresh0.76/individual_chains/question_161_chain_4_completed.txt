Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope setup. Let me try to break it down step by step. Mike is working with a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The goal is to minimize gas molecules so that the electron microscopy is better because there are fewer gas particles around for the electrons to scatter off.

But even after creating this vacuum, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike found the mean free path (which I remember is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions) of these gas molecules as λ1. He calculated this based on the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something odd. The mean free path changes to λ2, which isn't the same as λ1. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

Hmm, what determines the mean free path? I think the mean free path formula is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the collision diameter of the gas molecules, and P is pressure. Oh wait, but wait, I've also heard it as λ = (1)/(sqrt(2)*π*n*σ²), where n is number density and σ is the collision cross-section. Or maybe another version with pressure.

Wait, another formula I remember is the mean free path in a gas: λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact constants. Alternatively, a more familiar formula is λ = (1)/(sqrt(2) * π * n * σ²), where n is the number density and σ is the collision diameter. Because n is proportional to pressure (since n = P/(k*T)), then λ is inversely proportional to pressure. So as pressure decreases, λ increases.

Wait, but in the scenario, when the electron beam is on, what's happening? Oh, right, electrons are moving through the gas. So, the electrons themselves are interacting with the gas molecules. The question says that Mike found the mean free path based on electron scattering changed from λ1 to λ2.

Wait, so λ1 is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves before the electrons were on, right? Because he was considering the gas molecules' movement. But when the electron beam starts, the electrons are moving through the gas, so the gas molecules might be moving as well because of the electron beam's energy.

Wait, this could be about electron scattering. The mean free path for electrons would be different than for the gas molecules. So perhaps the question is about the electron's mean free path?

Wait, no, the question says that Mike accurately determined the mean free path of the gas molecules, which is λ1. But when he starts the electron beam, the mean free path (presumably for the electrons) is λ2. Wait no, the question says he made an observation about the mean free path based on electron scattering. So it's about the electron's mean free path.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read the question again.

Mike noticed that the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2. The question is about what can be concluded about λ2.

Wait, but the mean free path of the gas molecules or the electrons? The question says: "based on electron scattering with the gas molecules." So when the electron beam is on, electrons are scattering off the gas molecules. So the mean free path he's measuring is the electron's mean free path.

Wait, but earlier, he determined λ1 as the mean free path of the gas molecules. So when the gas is at a certain pressure, the mean free path of the gas molecules was λ1. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being ionized or are themselves moving more because of the electron beam's energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more energetic, increasing the rate of collisions—so the mean free path for the gas molecules would decrease, but the question is about the mean free path of the electrons.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again. The mean free path for the electrons is the average distance they travel without scattering. When the sample compartment is under high vacuum, the electron mean free path is longer, which is good because it reduces scattering and improves image resolution.

In the initial state, when Mike created the ultra-high vacuum, the gas pressure is very low. So, for the electrons, their mean free path would be longer. But when the electron beam is turned on, perhaps the gas is being excited or the pressure effectively increases.

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Oh, because the electron beam has a high energy (1000 kV is 1e6 eV per electron), which is pretty high. That's a lot of energy. High-energy electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize or even eject from the surface, but in this case, the compartment is already under high vacuum, so perhaps the electrons are causing the gas molecules to increase in velocity, which would affect their mean free path.

Wait, but the sample compartment's temperature remains the same, so the thermal motion of the gas molecules isn't changing. So why would the mean free path change?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of a strong electron beam introduces additional factors. For example, the electrons might impart momentum to the gas molecules, increasing their average speed. If the gas molecules are moving faster, their mean free path would be longer.

Wait, the mean free path for the gas molecules is λ1. But when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be moving faster because they're being hit by high-energy electrons. Would that increase their speed, thus increasing λ1? Or perhaps the electrons cause the gas to heat up, but the question states the temperature remains the same.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be ionized, creating charged particles. If the gas is a plasma, the mean free path could be different because charged particles interact more strongly.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the scenario again. Mike was using the mean free path of the gas particles (λ1) to model their behavior. But when he starts the electron beam, the mean free path for the electrons (not the gas) is λ2.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says that upon initiating the electron beam, he made an observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering. So, perhaps he's measuring the electron mean free path, which is different due to interactions with the gas molecules.

So the electron's mean free path is λ2. How does that compare to λ1?

The mean free path of electrons would be determined by the scattering events due to gas molecules. The formula for the electron's mean free path is λ_e = (1) / (n * σ_e), where n is the number density of the scattering particles (gas molecules) and σ_e is the cross-section for electron scattering.

In the initial state, the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ1. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons are scattering off the gas molecules. So the electron's mean free path would be λ2.

What affects λ2? Well, the number density n of the gas is the same, but electron scattering cross-section might depend on the electron's energy. At higher electron energies, the cross-section for scattering can decrease because the electrons are less likely to interact strongly with the gas molecules.

Wait, no. Wait, for low-energy electrons, the cross-section is higher because they're more likely to interact with the ions. But high-energy electrons have lower cross-sections because they penetrate the atoms more and don't scatter as much.

So if the electron's energy is high (1000 kV), the cross-section for scattering would be small. Thus, the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) would be longer because they're less likely to scatter, so they travel further before scattering.

Wait, but initially, Mike calculated the gas molecules' mean free path, λ1. The gas pressure is low, so λ1 is large. But when the electron beam is on, the electron's mean free path λ2 would be longer if the scattering is less.

Wait, but wait. The number density n is the same, but the cross-section for electrons, σ_e, might be lower because of higher energy. So λ2 = 1/(n * σ_e) would be larger than if σ_e was higher. So λ2 would be larger than λ1? Or wait, is λ1 for the gas, and λ2 for the electrons?

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again. The mean free path for the gas molecules, λ1, is determined by their own collisions. The mean free path for electrons, λ2, is determined by their scattering off the same gas molecules.

So, λ_e (electron's mean free path) = 1/(n * σ_e), where σ_e is the cross-section for electron scattering.

If the electrons have high energy, their cross-sections for scattering are smaller. So σ_e is smaller, meaning 1/(n σ_e) is larger. So λ_e (λ2) would be larger than if the electrons were at lower energy.

But wait, the gas's mean free path is λ1, which depends on their own collisions. So λ1 is (k*T)/(sqrt(2) π d^2 P). Since pressure P is low, λ1 is large.

But the electron's mean free path λ2 is 1/(n σ_e). Since n is the same (same pressure, same temperature), but σ_e depends on electron energy.

At higher electron energies, σ_e decreases. So λ2 increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1? Or maybe not. Because λ1 is the gas's mean free path, and λ2 is the electron's mean free path. They are for different entities.

So the question is, when the electron beam is on, the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) is now less than or greater than λ1?

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path for the electrons is actually less than λ1 because the electrons are more likely to interact with the gas. Wait, but wait, higher energy electrons have lower scattering cross-sections, so they would have longer mean free paths.

Wait, but another factor: when the electron beam is on, it might cause gas molecules to be ionized. If the gas becomes ionized, the free charges would affect the electron beam. But I'm not sure how that would impact the mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the electrons cause the gas to heat up, but the question states the temperature remains the same, so that's not the case.

Wait, let's think about the initial setup. Before the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are moving with a mean free path λ1. When the beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. The electrons' mean free path λ2 depends on how often they scatter off the gas molecules.

If the gas is at a very low pressure (so λ1 is large), but when the electrons are moving, they can still scatter off the gas. So the mean free path of the electrons would be longer than λ1, because λ1 is for the gas, and the electron's path is longer. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think in terms of number density. The gas's mean free path λ1 is inversely proportional to the number density n (since λ = 1/(n σ), where σ is the collision cross-section for gas molecules). The electron's mean free path λ_e is 1/(n σ_e), where σ_e is their cross-section for scattering.

So, if the number density n is the same, but σ_e is smaller (because higher energy), then λ_e is larger.

But what's the relationship between λ1 and λ_e? Well, λ1 is the mean free path for gas molecules, which depends on their own collision cross-section σ_g, which is probably larger than σ_e for electrons because gas molecules are much larger than electrons.

Wait, no, σ_e is the cross-section for an electron to scatter off a gas molecule. For high-energy electrons, σ_e is smaller because they're less likely to scatter.

So, λ_e = 1/(n σ_e). Since σ_e is smaller, λ_e is larger.

So, λ_e > λ1? Or no, because λ1 is for the gas molecules, which have a different cross-section.

Wait, but λ1 is determined by the gas's own collisions. So λ1 = 1/(n σ_g), where σ_g is the cross-section for gas molecule collisions. The electron's mean free path is λ_e = 1/(n σ_e).

If σ_e < σ_g, then λ_e > λ1.

Wait, but that depends on the relative sizes of σ_e and σ_g. So if the gas is, say, hydrogen, and the electron is high energy, the cross-section for electron scattering (σ_e) would be much smaller than σ_g for the gas. Thus, λ_e would be larger than λ1.

So, λ2 (which is the electron's mean free path) would be larger than λ1.

Looking at the options:

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1

Option C: λ2 < λ1

If λ2 is larger than λ1, then either A or another option. But why 1.22?

Wait, 1.22 is approximately sqrt(2)/sqrt(π) ≈ 0.797... Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the factor sqrt(2) comes in with the mean free path formula.

Wait, in the mean free path formula, σ is the collision cross-section, and the formula is λ = 1/(sqrt(2) n σ). Hmm, is that correct?

Wait, the mean free path λ is 1/(sqrt(2) n σ), where σ is the collision cross-section. So, the factor of sqrt(2) is involved.

Wait, but why 1.22? Hmm, 1.22 is approximately the square root of (π/2), which is about 1.2533. Wait, no, sqrt(π/2) is about 1.2533, which is close to 1.22. Or perhaps it's sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, but that's bigger.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting confused with the Debye length or something else.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ1, and the electron's mean free path is λ2. If the electron's cross-section is much smaller than the gas's, then λ2 would be much larger than λ1.

But the options don't include that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

Wait, so the options are about whether λ2 is bigger or smaller than λ1, and whether it's more than 1.22 times λ1.

Earlier, I thought that λ2 would be larger than λ1 because the electron's cross-section is smaller, leading to a longer mean free path. So λ2 > λ1.

But option A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1.

Option D says λ1 < λ2 <1.22*λ1, which would mean λ2 is a bit larger but less than 1.22 times.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path of the gas molecules and the electrons are related in a specific way.

Wait, another thought: in a gas, the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ1, which is large because the pressure is low. When you have an electron beam, the electrons are moving through this gas. The electrons' mean free path is λ2. But for high-energy electrons, the cross-section is lower, so λ2 is longer than λ1.

But why would that be? Because the gas's mean free path is λ1, but the electron's is λ2, which is longer.

Wait, but if the gas is at a pressure where λ1 is large, meaning low density, then n is small. So for the electron, n is small, so their mean free path λ2 would be even larger.

Wait, but Mike's observation is that λ changed from λ1 to λ2 when the beam was turned on. So what is causing λ2 to be different?

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Another angle: The mean free path for the gas molecules is λ1, which is determined by the gas's properties. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons are causing the gas to become excited, perhaps even ionizing some of the gas molecules. If that happens, the gas is less dense because some molecules are ionized and perhaps pumped away, or perhaps the effective number density decreases.

Wait, but the question states that the temperature remains the same. So if the gas is ionized, number density might decrease because ionized particles could be accelerated and removed, but in ultra-high vacuum, it's already low.

Alternatively, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules may be moving more, but the temperature is the same, so their average speed is the same. But the electron beam's energy could cause the gas molecules to have higher speeds through momentum transfer. But that would change the temperature, which the question says isn't the case.

Hmm. Another approach: the initial λ1 is for the gas molecules. When the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving so fast that their motion is much faster than the gas molecules. So perhaps the gas density as perceived by the electrons is lower. Because the gas molecules are moving slower compared to the electrons. Wait, but electrons are moving much faster than gas molecules, so the relative speed is high. So the effective cross-section for electron scattering may be lower.

Wait, but that's what I thought earlier: high-energy electrons have lower scattering cross-sections, leading to longer mean free paths. So λ2 would be longer than λ1.

But let's think in terms of the mean free path formula. For the gas molecules, λ1 = 1/(n σ_g), where σ_g is their collision cross-section. For electrons, λ2 = 1/(n σ_e). If σ_e is less than σ_g, then λ2 is greater than λ1.

But how much less is σ_e compared to σ_g? Well, electrons are much smaller than gas molecules, so σ_e should be much smaller, making λ2 much larger than λ1.

Wait, but in the options given, the only one that says λ2 is larger than λ1 is option A and D. Option A says λ2 is at least 1.22 times λ1, and D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

But why would the factor be 1.22?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the formulas. Let's write them out.

The mean free path of gas molecules: λ1 = 1/(n σ_g).

The mean free path of electrons: λ2 = 1/(n σ_e).

If σ_e = σ_g / 2, then λ2 = 2 λ1. Which is greater than λ1.

But why 1.22? Let me think about the relation between the mean free path of electrons and gas molecules.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron's mean free path is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass. Because the collision cross-section depends on sqrt(m), where m is the mass of the scattering particle.

Wait, the mean free path for electrons would be longer because the gas molecules are heavier. So for two particles, the cross-section for electron scattering would be smaller because electrons have less mass and move faster.

Wait, so perhaps λ2 is larger than λ1, but how much larger?

Alternatively, perhaps the factor between λ2 and λ1 is sqrt(m_e/m_gas), where m_e is the mass of the electron and m_gas is the mass of the gas molecule.

But m_e is about 1/1836 of a proton, so for a gas molecule like, say, H2 (which has two protons), m_gas is about 2 * 1.67e-27 kg. m_e is about 9.11e-31 kg. So m_gas/m_e ≈ (2 * 1.67e-27) / (9.11e-31) ≈ (3.34e-27)/(9.11e-31) ≈ approx 3666.

So sqrt(m_gas/m_e) is about 60.5.

So λ2 would be about 60.5 times longer than λ1. But that's not any of the options.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making this more complicated. The options don't have such a big factor. The options have 1.22 times. So maybe there's another factor.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ1, which is based on their own motion. The mean free path of the electrons is based on their scattering from the same gas. So the electron's mean free path would be longer because they're moving much faster than the gas molecules.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path of the electrons would be sqrt(2) times longer than that of the gas molecules. Because the electrons' speed is sqrt(2) times higher than the thermal speed of the gas (since electrons are much lighter). Hmm, but that might not directly apply.

Wait, the mean speed of gas molecules is v_gas = sqrt(8 k T / (π m_gas)) ), and the electron speed is v_e = sqrt(2 k T_e / m_e ), where T_e is the electron temperature. But in this scenario, the gas's thermal speed is given by the sample's temperature.

Wait, perhaps if the electron's speed is much higher, then the relative speed between electrons and gas molecules is higher, leading to a lower scattering probability. Thus, λ2 is longer.

But without knowing the exact relation between the two, perhaps the only conclusion is that λ2 is longer than λ1, which would make options A or D correct.

Looking at the options, only option A says λ2 is >=1.22 λ1. But why 1.22?

Wait, another thought: The mean free path for the gas is λ1. The electron's mean free path is λ2, which could be the same if the gas and electrons have same collision dynamics, but that's not the case. Or perhaps related by a factor.

If the gas's mean free path is λ1, the electron's mean free path would be λ_e = λ1 * (v_e / v_gas), where v_e is the electron velocity and v_gas is the gas velocity.

If the electron's velocity is much higher, say, v_e >> v_gas, then λ_e >> λ1.

But in reality, electron velocity is much higher than gas thermal velocities. For example, in a gas at room temperature, gas molecules have speeds of a few hundred m/s. Electrons in a 1000 kV beam have speeds near the speed of light, which is about 3e8 m/s. So v_e is about 1e6 times higher than v_gas.

So, λ_e = λ1 * (v_e / v_gas) ≈ 1e6 * λ1.

But that's way bigger than any of the options, so perhaps I'm way off.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path for the electron is determined by the same pressure and temperature as the gas's, but with a different formula.

Wait, perhaps using the same pressure and temperature, the electron mean free path is longer because the electron's cross-section is smaller. But without exact values, it's hard to compare.

Wait, another approach: The question says that Mike found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1, but became λ2. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2.

If the mean free path for the gas is λ1, and the electron's is λ2, and since the electrons have much higher energy, λ2 must be longer than λ1. So the options that have λ2 > λ1 are A and D.

But the options don't have a choice that says λ2 is much larger. So perhaps the actual conclusion is that the mean free path for the electrons is longer than λ1, but perhaps the factor is around 1.22 or so.

Wait, another thought: At high vacuum, the electron's mean free path can be longer than the gas's mean free path. However, if the gas's mean free path is already very large (since it's under high vacuum), the electron's mean free path might not be much larger than that of the gas.

Wait, but if the gas's mean free path is lambda1, and the electron's is lambda2, which would be longer because the electron's cross-section is smaller. But if the gas's mean free path is already long, then the electron's would be even longer.

But the question is about comparing lambda2 and lambda1. So, if lambda2 is greater than lambda1, which of the options is correct?

The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

So, if lambda2 is greater than lambda1, the correct option would be A.

But why 1.22? Hmm, perhaps it's a typical factor when comparing different particles. Wait, for example, if the electron's cross-section is about 1/ (1.22)^2 times that of the gas, then lambda2 would be 1.22 times lambda1.

But without more information, perhaps the correct conclusion is that lambda2 is larger than lambda1.

So, looking at the options, option A says lambda2 >=1.22 *lambda1.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas's mean free path decreases because the electron scattering might cause more collisions, but that would imply lambda2 < lambda1, which is option C. But that would contradict the earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: when the electron beam is on, the gas is being bombarded, which might cause gas molecules to be excited or even dislodge from surfaces, effectively reducing the number density. But the question states that the temperature is the same, so perhaps the number density doesn't change much.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to become more ionized, leading to a plasma state. In a plasma, the mean free path for electrons is shorter because they can scatter off ions, but for non-plasma conditions, it would be longer.

But the question doesn't mention ionization, so perhaps that's not the case.

Another angle: The mean free path for the gas is for their own collisions. The mean free path for the electrons is for their scattering off the gas. So, when the electron beam is on, the gas's mean free path doesn't change (it's still lambda1), but the electron's mean free path becomes lambda2, which is the quantity that changes.

So, if the electron's mean free path is longer than the gas's, lambda2 > lambda1. So option A or D.

But without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the only thing we can conclude is that lambda2 is larger than lambda1, but the options don't have a 'lambda2 > lambda1' option but rather options with specific relations.

Wait, the options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22*λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

So, the correct answer would be either A or C. But based on our earlier reasoning, lambda2 should be larger than lambda1. So option A would be correct.

But why 1.22? Maybe because the factor is due to the different collisional cross-sections. For example, if the gas's cross-section is sqrt(2) times the electron's cross-section, then lambda2 would be sqrt(2) times lambda1, which is about 1.414. But that's not 1.22.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The mean free path of the gas is lambda1. When the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. The probability of an electron scattering is lower, so their mean free path is longer. So lambda2 is longer than lambda1.

Therefore, the correct option is A: lambda2 >=1.22*lambda1.

But how does that factor come into play? Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path for the electron is sqrt(2) times longer than the gas's. Because in the gas's mean free path, the formula involves sqrt(2), so when it's for the electron, the factor comes into play.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path for the gas is lambda1, and the electron's is lambda2 = lambda1 * sqrt(m_gas/m_e), which would be much larger, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. The electron's mean free path is shorter than the gas's. But that would imply option C, which says lambda2 < lambda1. But why would that be?

If the electron's cross-section is larger than the gas's, then their mean free path would be shorter. But gas molecules are bigger than electrons, so their cross-section for collisions with each other is larger than their cross-section for scattering electrons. So, the gas's cross-section sigma_g is larger than sigma_e. Therefore, lambda1 = 1/(n sigma_g) is smaller than lambda_e = 1/(n sigma_e). So sigma_e < sigma_g => lambda_e > lambda1. So, lambda2 is larger than lambda1.

Therefore, the correct option is A: lambda2 >=1.22 * lambda1.

But the options don't have 'lambda2 > lambda1' without any condition. So among the given options, A is the only one that suggests lambda2 is larger than lambda1.

So the answer would be option A: λ2 >=1.22*λ1.


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV, Mike created an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment to minimize gas molecules, achieving a mean free path for the gas molecules, denoted as $\lambda_1$. Upon initiating the electron beam, Mike observed a change in the mean free path to $\lambda_2$, which was different from $\lambda_1$. The question asks how $\lambda_2$ compares to $\lambda_1$.

The mean free path for gas molecules, $\lambda_1$, is determined by their collision dynamics and is given by $\lambda_1 = \frac{1}{n \sigma_g}$, where $n$ is the number density of the gas and $\sigma_g$ is the collision cross-section of the gas molecules. When the electron beam is turned on, the mean free path for the electrons, $\lambda_2$, is determined by their scattering interactions with the gas molecules. The electron's mean free path is given by $\lambda_2 = \frac{1}{n \sigma_e}$, where $\sigma_e$ is the cross-section for electron scattering.

Key considerations:
1. **Electron Energy and Cross-Section**: High-energy electrons (1000 kV) have a much smaller scattering cross-section ($\sigma_e$) compared to the gas molecules ($\sigma_g$). This is because high-energy electrons penetrate gas molecules more effectively and are less likely to scatter.
2. **Comparison of $\lambda_2$ and $\lambda_1$**: Since $\sigma_e < \sigma_g$, it follows that $\lambda_2 > \lambda_1$. The mean free path for the electrons is longer than that for the gas molecules due to the reduced scattering probability for electrons.
3. **Factor of 1.22**: The factor of 1.22 likely arises from a typical ratio of $\lambda_2$ to $\lambda_1$ based on the relative scattering cross-sections of electrons and gas molecules. This factor aligns with the reasoning that $\lambda_2$ is significantly larger than $\lambda_1$ but not excessively so.

Given the options:
- **Option A ($\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1$)**: This is consistent with the reasoning that $\lambda_2$ is larger than $\lambda_1$ due to the smaller scattering cross-section of electrons.
- **Option C ($\lambda_2 < \lambda_1$)**: This is incorrect because the electron's mean free path is longer than the gas's mean free path due to the reduced scattering probability.
- **Option B ($\lambda_2 = \lambda_1$)**: This is incorrect because the electron beam introduces a different scattering dynamics, changing the mean free path.
- **Option D ($\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1$)**: This is incorrect because $\lambda_2$ is not strictly less than $1.22 \lambda_1$; it can be larger than this factor depending on the specific scattering properties.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that $\lambda_2$ is at least 1.22 times $\lambda_1$. 

Answer: A
