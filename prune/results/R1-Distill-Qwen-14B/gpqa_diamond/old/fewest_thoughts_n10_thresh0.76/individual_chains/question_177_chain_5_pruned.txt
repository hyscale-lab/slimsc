Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

So, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Then, their radial velocities are given. Star_1 has zero, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, but the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, but the actual emitted wavelengths would be different if their velocities are different because of the Doppler shift. But the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. So I might need to adjust the calculated temperatures considering the Doppler effect.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So if one star is moving towards us and the other is moving away, their observed λ_max would change. But in this case, Star_1 has zero radial velocity, so its observed λ_max is the same as its emitted. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s—wait, is that towards or away? Radial velocity positive usually means moving away, but I'm not entirely sure about the sign conventions. Let me check: if the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is blueshifted (λ decreases), and if moving away, redshifted (λ increases). 

So for Star_2, if it's moving away at 700 km/s, its observed λ_max would be longer (redshifted) than its emitted. But the problem says both stars have the same observed λ_max. So, in that case, Star_2's emitted λ must be shorter than Star_1's. Wait, but Star_1's λ is the same as its emitted because its velocity is zero. So, let me model this.
