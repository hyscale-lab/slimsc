Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? And they can eclipse each other, which is when one passes in front of the other from our point of view. The periods given are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. Oh wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses, so that's the orbital period for each system.

The question is about finding out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Both systems have two stars each. The mass of each system is the sum of the masses of the two stars.

The problem gives me radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. Radial velocity variations happen because the stars are moving towards and away from us as they orbit. The amplitude is the maximum speed each star reaches in their orbit.

I remember that in a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so it moves slower, right? Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So the less massive star has a larger orbit and higher velocity. So in system_1, the larger RV amplitude (10 km/s) would be the more massive star? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no, no—wait, that's not right. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, so lower velocity. So the star with the larger velocity is the less massive one. So in system_1, the 10 km/s star is less massive than the 5 km/s star. Because the 10 km/s star is moving faster, so it's less massive.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The center of mass is the balance point. So M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. So M1/M2 = a2/a1. Since a1 + a2 = a (the separation), the total separation is the sum of their individual orbits.

The velocities are v1 = 2πa1 / P, and v2 = 2πa2 / P. So velocity is proportional to a (since period P is the same for both). So from the RV amplitudes (v1 and v2), we can relate their masses.

Because M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, and a1/a2 = v1/v2 (since velocities are proportional to a1 and a2). So M1/M2 = a2/a1 = (v2 / v1).

Wait, let me make that clear. Let me write down:

v1 = (2π a1) / P
v2 = (2π a2) / P

So v1/v2 = a1/a2.

From the mass relation: M1 a1 = M2 a2 → M1/M2 = a2/a1 = (v2 / v1).

So M1/M2 = v2 / v1.

Wait, that's for a single system. But in the problem, we have two systems, system_1 and system_2. So I need to compute the mass function for each and then compare.

Wait, but each system's mass is the sum of the two stars. So for each system, let's find the masses of the two stars in terms of the RV amplitudes.

Let me think of system_1 first. Its RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. Let's denote the stars as Star A and Star B. So Star A has v_A = 10 km/s, and Star B has v_B =5 km/s.

So for system_1:

v_A = 10, v_B =5.

From the mass ratio: M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A = 5/10 = 0.5.

So M_A = 0.5 M_B.

The total mass of system_1 is M_1
