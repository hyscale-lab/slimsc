Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished. Hmm.

So, the problem states that there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. Wait, the lifetimes... I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates the energy of a particle to the precision of its measurement. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, but often approximated as ΔEΔt ≈ ħ. 

So, the uncertainty in energy depends on the lifetime of the state because the lifetime is the time over which the energy is measured. The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy can be measured because there's more time to observe it, leading to a smaller uncertainty. Alternatively, a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy.

The question is asking for the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve the two states. That means the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we wouldn't be able to distinguish them.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So the uncertainty in energy for each state would be based on their respective lifetimes. Let me think: for state E1 with a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(τ2), where τ2 is 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So we need the difference |E2 - E1| to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each's uncertainty? Or maybe the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime. Because the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. So if the difference is larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime, we can resolve them. Let me think more.

Suppose the two states have different uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger uncertainty (since ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, so shorter τ means larger ΔE). So if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states can be distinguished. Because even the state with the larger uncertainty would have a width that's less than the energy difference.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty of the measurement, which is determined by the instrument's time resolution. But in this case, each state has its own uncertainty. Hmmm.

Wait no, perhaps the way to look at it is that when you try to measure the energy of a system, the precision is limited by the time you have. So for a system with a short lifetime, the measurement time is short, leading to a larger uncertainty in energy. So to distinguish between two energies, the difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than the uncertainty of the measurement. But what's the measurement's uncertainty here?

Alternatively, maybe each state's energy has an uncertainty based on their own lifetime, and the energy difference must be larger than the sum of these individual uncertainties for them to be resolved. Or perhaps the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, here's another approach. The uncertainty principle is often written as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. The Δt here is the time over which the state is measured. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE = ħ/Δt. 

If the measurement is made for a certain time, say Δt, then the uncertainty would be ħ/Δt. But in this problem, each state has its own lifetime, which I think is the time it exists before decaying. So the energy uncertainty for each state is determined by their own lifetimes.

So for E1, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1. For E2, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2. 

But wait, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds. So τ2 is longer than τ1. So ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1. Because ΔE is inversely proportional to τ.

So which ΔE matters for resolving the two states? The larger ΔE is the one from E1. Because if the energy difference is larger than ΔE1, then we can distinguish E1 and E2.

Wait, but if the energy difference is larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or the individual ones? Let me think of an example. Suppose E2 - E1 is greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Then, even considering the uncertainties from both, the difference is still clear.

But maybe the correct approach is to consider the energy difference must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states' energies can be clearly separated.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in the system as a whole. Hmm, but the system's uncertainty would depend on the measurement setup's time resolution. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is likely assuming that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty from the shorter lifetime state.

Because the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger energy uncertainty. So for the two energies to be resolved, the energy difference must be larger than that larger uncertainty.

So in this case, E2 - E1 must be greater than ΔE1, which is ħ / (1e-9 s).

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the formula.

The uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. So for E1, τ is 1e-9 sec. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / 1e-9. Similarly, for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / 1e-8. Since ħ is about 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So let's compute ΔE1:

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) = 6.582e-8 eV ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV. So the larger uncertainty is from E1.

The energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or the maximum of the two? Wait, to resolve two peaks, the separation should be greater than the sum of their half-widths, perhaps. Because each peak has a certain width, and the separation needs to be enough so they don't overlap.

In other words, the energy difference (E2 - E1) should be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2). Because each state's energy has an uncertainty, and if the difference is larger than the sum, they don't overlap.

So, let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2:

6.58e-7 eV + 6.58e-8 eV = approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, but let me calculate that precisely: 6.58e-7 is 6.58 * 1e-7, and 6.58e-8 is 0.658 *1e-7. So adding them together gives (6.58 + 0.658) * 1e-7 = 7.238e-7 eV ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be greater than 7.24e-7 eV. Let's check the options:

Options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 eV is way smaller than 7.24e-7. So no.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV. 7.24e-7 is 0.000000724 eV. So 1e-4 is much larger. So yes, this is greater than the sum.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7.24e-7 eV. Because 7e-7 is 0.0000007, which is larger than 0.00000001.

Wait, but wait. If the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than the sum of uncertainties. So it would be clearly resolved. So option C is 1e-4 eV. But looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 0.0001 eV. That's much bigger than 7.24e-7 (0.000000724), so yes, it's sufficient.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question is about "could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So any value that is larger than the sum of the uncertainties would work. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option C is 1e-4 eV. That's 0.0001 eV. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, my calculation of ΔE1 was 6.58e-7 eV. So 6.58e-7 is 0.000000658 eV.

If the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, that's 100 times larger than ΔE1. So yes, that would be easily resolvable.

But wait, in the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 10^-4 eV. So yes, that's way above the required 7.24e-7 eV sum.

But wait, the question is phrased: "could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So any value greater than the sum of the uncertainties would work. So the only option that is larger than the sum is option C (1e-4 eV) and perhaps the others are too small.

Wait, but let's think about option D: 1e-8 eV is 0.00000001 eV. That's smaller than 7.24e-7, so it's not enough.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. But perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the energy difference only needs to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Because, when you have two peaks, each with their own width, the separation between their centers should be greater than the sum of their half-widths. So in that case, the energy difference (ΔE) should be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2? Or perhaps just the sum of the two.

Wait, let me think. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) for each peak would be about twice the uncertainty. So if each peak has a FWHM of 2ΔE, then to separate the two peaks, the separation should be greater than the sum of the FWHMs. So the energy difference should be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2) * 2.

Wait, but perhaps that's complicating it. Maybe the rule of thumb is that the separation should be more than the sum of the uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2), which is like the FWHM in each case.

Wait, but in any case, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than the sum of the uncertainties (about 7e-7 eV), so it's sufficient. The other options are too small.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \Delta t \approx \hbar
\]

Here, \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, and \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. For a system with lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

Given the lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties in energy for the two states are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, \( \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \), to ensure the energy levels do not overlap. Calculating the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is also much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is sufficient for resolution.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the only energy difference that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
