Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it. The question is about the uncertainty principle, right? I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in an electron's position and momentum. The problem states that the electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v, and we're given the uncertainty in its position, Δx. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, but how do I connect position uncertainty to energy uncertainty? Hmm. Oh right, the Uncertainty Principle says that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. And since momentum p is mass times velocity, maybe I can find the uncertainty in momentum first.

Let me jot down the given values. The speed v is 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in position Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh, wait, 0.1 nm is 0.1 nanometers, which is 1e-10 meters. So Δx is 1e-10 m. 

So first, calculate Δp. Using the Uncertainty Principle, Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Let me remember the value of ħ. Oh right, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So plugging in the numbers: ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) = (1.0545718e-34) / 2e-10. Let me compute that. 1.05e-34 divided by 2e-10 is about 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. So Δp is approximately 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

Now, knowing that the uncertainty in momentum Δp is related to the uncertainty in energy since energy is related to momentum via the kinetic energy formula. Wait, but the minimum uncertainty in energy would be the uncertainty in kinetic energy, right? Because the electron's kinetic energy is p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because when you
