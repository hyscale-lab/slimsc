Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to piece it together.

The scientist is making a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He does three technical replicates for each dilution. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect, so each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, which means the data fits the curve perfectly—so no scatter. The slope is -3.3. Wait, what's the significance of the slope in qPCR?

Oh right, the slope relates to the efficiency of the PCR. The formula for the slope in a standard curve is usually based on the efficiency. If the efficiency is 100%, that's 1, right? The standard formula is slope = -3.3219 / log(E), where E is efficiency. So if E is 1, log(E) is 0. Wait, that would cause a division by zero. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, for 100% efficiency, the PCR efficiency is E = 1, so log(E) = 0, which would make the slope undefined... but wait, no, I think I might be mixing up some formulas. Alternatively, maybe the slope is calculated using the data from the dilutions. Hmm.

Wait, the standard curve method uses a linear regression where the y-axis is Ct and the x-axis is log of the starting quantity. The equation is usually something like Ct = intercept + (slope * log(Q)). The slope is related to the efficiency. If efficiency is 100%, then the slope should be -3.3219 because each ten-fold dilution would give a change of +1 in log and a change of 3.3219 in Ct. So in this case, the slope is -3.3, which is close to -3.3219, so that makes sense. So the efficiency is correct.

Now, looking at the data. The Ct values for each dilution are in triplicates. Let's look at the first point: 100,000 copies per µl gives Ct around 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average is around 34.16. Next, 10,000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Average about 30.9. Then 1000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Average ~27.6. 100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6. Around 24.3. And 10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3. Average ~21.

So each dilution is a ten-fold decrease. So each dilution step should lead to an increase in Ct by about 3.3 cycles. Let me check the differences. From 100,000 to
