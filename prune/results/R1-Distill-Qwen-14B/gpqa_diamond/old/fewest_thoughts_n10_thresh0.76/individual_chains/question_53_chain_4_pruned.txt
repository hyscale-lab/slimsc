Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues are from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Let me break down the information given.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating an ester group. Ester groups typically have a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ due to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, the compound must have an ester functional group.

Next, the 1H NMR data. There are six signals in total. These are categorized as:
- Two aromatic-H signals.
- Two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets.
- Two –CH3 signals.

And importantly, there are no –CH2 signals. So, the molecule doesn't have any methylene groups (CH2). That's a key point because it restricts the possible structures.

Let me think about the structure. It's a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means two substituents are attached to the benzene ring. Since it's a six-membered ring, the substituents could be in para, meta, or ortho positions.

The presence of an ester group suggests that one of the substituents is an ester. Ester groups usually are R-O-CO-O-R' or wait, no. Wait, esters are R-O-CO-R', right? So, the ester group would be something like O-CO-O connected to something else. Wait, no, the ester functional group is R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups.

So, one substituent is an ester group. The other substituent, since the ring is di-substituted, must be another group. Let's think about the NMR signals.

In the aromatic region, two signals. That suggests that the two substituents are in positions that create two different environments for the aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be equivalent, giving a single peak. But if they are meta or ortho, maybe the symmetry is broken, leading to two different aromatic proton environments. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, like a vinyl group or a methyl group.

Wait, the NMR also shows two vinyl-H signals. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests that each vinyl proton has a different neighboring structure. Also, for vinyl groups, coupling between adjacent protons gives rise to splitting. In a double bond, each proton is coupled to the other, so for a trans configuration, each would be a doublet. But here, we have two different vinyl signals. Hmm, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, like a substituent that has a double bond. Or perhaps the ester group is part of a more complex structure.

Wait, another possibility: the ester
