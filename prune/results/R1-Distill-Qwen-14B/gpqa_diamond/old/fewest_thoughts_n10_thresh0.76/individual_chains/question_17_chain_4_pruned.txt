Alright, let me try to figure this out. Okay, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So, the solution has a Ca-EDTA complex, and we're given the concentration of that complex as 0.02 M. The problem gives the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. 

Wait, wait, what's the formation constant again? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For the reaction like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, the Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But in this solution, the complex is present at 0.02 M. And we're assuming that the pH is ideal, so I guess that means the EDTA is in its proper form, maybe as Y^4- since higher pH favors that. 

So, the complex is CaY²- (CaEDTA²-). The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Now, we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Let me set up an ICE table, maybe. The equilibrium is:

Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²-

The initial concentrations: Well, the complex is 0.02 M, so that's the initial concentration of CaY²-. But what about the initial concentrations of Ca²
