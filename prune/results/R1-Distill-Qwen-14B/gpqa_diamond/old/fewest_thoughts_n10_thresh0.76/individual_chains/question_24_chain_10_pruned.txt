Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. When this mixture is treated with platinum and heated, it forms another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids through a disproportionation reaction. The key thing is that mixture X decolorizes bromine water, but Y doesn't. Then, when both X and Y undergo hydrogenation with platinum under severe conditions, they each give only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, and it's a solvent that's part of mixture Y. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. No conjugated multiple bonds in X's compounds.

I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, the fact that mixture X decolorizes bromine water suggests that X has compounds with unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, since they can add across the double bonds in bromine. But mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine, implying that after the reaction, those unsaturated bonds are gone—they must have been hydrogenated or something.

Wait, but the question says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation to form Y. So, what kind of reaction is that? Disproportionation is when a species is both oxidized and reduced. For example, in the case of H2O2 decomposing into H2O and O2. Or maybe like in some redox reactions where the same element changes oxidation states.

But here, the mixture X is a mixture of two liquids. Let me think about possible reactions leading to that.

Another point is that after hydrogenation, both X and Y give the same product Z. So, perhaps X and Y have the same number of carbon and hydrogen atoms, but different structures—maybe alkenes and their dihydro derivatives?

Wait, but the mixture Y is from a disproportionation reaction of X. Let me think about what kind of reaction would cause that.

Another approach: since Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Let's calculate the molecular formula of Z. Let's assume Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is CnH2n+2 (saturated, since it's hydrogenated) or CnH2m, but wait, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's fully saturated—so it must be an alkane, so formula is CnH2n+2.

The hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%. So, (H mass)/(total mass) = 14.28/100 = 0.1428.

Hydrogen's molar mass is about 1, carbon is 12. So, for an alkane, the formula is CnH2n+2. Let's calculate the H mass fraction.

Hydrogen mass = (2n+2)*1 = 2n+2.

Total mass = n*12 + (2n+2)*1 = 12n + 2n + 2 = 14n + 2.

Hydrogen mass fraction = (2n +2)/(14n +2) = 0.1428.

So, let's set up the equation:

(2n + 2) / (14n +2) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2n + 2 = 0.1428 * (14n +2).

Calculate RHS:

0.1428 *14n = 1.9992n (since 14*0.1428 is about 2), and 0.1428*2=0.2856.

So, 2n +2 = 2n + 0.2856.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute 0.1428*(14n +2):

=0.1428 *14n + 0.1428 *2.

= (1.9992) n + 0.2856.

So,

2n + 2 = 1.9992n + 0.2856.

Subtract 1.9992n from both sides:

0.0008n +2 = 0.2856.

Subtract 2:

0.0008n = 0.2856 - 2 = -1.7144.

Hmm, that gives n negative, which isn't possible. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the formula isn't CnH2n+2
