Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they have properties that Gaussian states (like coherent states) don't. The question gives me a specific state and some parameters, so I need to figure out how to compute the non-Gaussianity measure called del_b.

The state is given as |psi> = ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. And N is the normalization constant sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). Oh right, because when you have a superposition of two coherent states, the normalization isn't just 1; you have to account for their overlap.

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So first, I should plug these values into the expression for N. Let's compute each part step by step.

First, calculate sin(2phi). Since phi is -pi/4, 2phi is -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. So sin(2phi) = -1.

Then, exp(-2alpha²). Alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25. Multiply by 2: 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So the denominator N is sqrt(1 + (-1)*0.6065) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935). Let me compute that: sqrt(0.3935) is approximately 0.6275. So N ≈ 0.6275.

So the state becomes (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ) / 0.6275. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the state is (0.7071|0.5> - 0.7071| -0.5> ) / 0.6275.

But how does this help me calculate the non-Gaussianity? The measure given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian state and rho is the non-Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between the state rho and the most Gaussian state tau. But wait, in the definition, tau is a Gaussian state, but which one? I think it's the Gaussian state that is the closest to rho in some sense, maybe the one that minimizes the relative entropy. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the thermal state or the coherent state that matches the first moments of rho?

Wait, but actually, I remember that for a cat state, the most Gaussian state would be the coherent state with the same first moments, perhaps. Alternatively, it's the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as the cat state, but that's not possible because the cat state isn't Gaussian. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the relative entropy is calculated between rho and the closest Gaussian state. Or perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one that minimizes the divergence, but I'm not quite sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the maximum entropy Gaussian state, but that's usually the thermal state. Alternatively, perhaps for a state like this, the reference Gaussian is the coherent state with the same mean as the non-Gaussian state.

Let me think about the structure of the state. The state is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, each with equal amplitude (after normalization). So the expectation value of the position and momentum (or the annihilation operator a) would be
