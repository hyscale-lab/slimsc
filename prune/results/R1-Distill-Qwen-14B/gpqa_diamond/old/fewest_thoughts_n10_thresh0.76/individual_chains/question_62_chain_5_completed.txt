Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reaction mechanisms, but let's try to break it down.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me draw its structure mentally. The main part is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. So, on one carbon (let's say position 1), there's a group attached: cyclohexyl, a hydroxymethyl, and another cyclohexyl? Wait, no, wait. The formula is a bit tricky. It's cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1. The substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. Oh wait, no: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the substituent is a hydroxymethyl attached to a cyclohexyl group, I think. Or wait, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is attached to the cyclohexane ring. Also, the main ring has a carbaldehyde group, so a formyl group, -CHO.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1, there's a substituent: a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is connected to the main ring. Also, the main ring has a carbaldehyde group, so another substituent at position 1? Or maybe the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, so a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group attached. Alternatively, perhaps it's a branching: the main ring has a CH2 group which is attached to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group, and also a formyl group. Wait, maybe it's a structure where the main ring has a substituent at position 1 that's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and maybe also a formyl group elsewhere. Wait, perhaps more accurately: the main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1, there's a substituent that's a methyl group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl attached. So the substituent is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). Also, the main ring has a formyl group at position 1? Or maybe the main ring is substituted with the hydroxymethyl cyclohexyl group and the aldehyde is at another position. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the synthesis steps.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond, -C≡CH). So the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent.

I need to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let me think about the possible reactions.

First, perhaps the ethynyl group can be functionalized. One common reaction is hydroboration or some kind of addition to the triple bond. Alternatively, using NaNH2 and methyl chloride... Oh, wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. So using NaNH2 with MeCl in ammonia probably does a deprotonation and alkylation. Wait, NaNH2 in ammonia is a common base for deprotonation. So for ethynylcyclohexane, the triple bond is acidic. The terminal alkyne proton is more acidic than alkanes. So under basic conditions, it can deprotonate. So with NaNH2 and MeCl, would that methylate the alkyne?

Wait, another approach: The triple bond can be converted into a diol via oxymercuration or another method. But wait, the options involve different reagents. Let me check the options.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Hmm, step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That's probably deprotonating the alkyne and adding methyl. Wait, NaNH2 in NH3 is a strong base. So in step 1, it's likely a deprotonation followed by alkylation. So ethynylcyclohexane would lose a proton from the alkyne, giving a cyclohexyl carbanion, which then reacts with methyl chloride to get a methyl group. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is HC≡C-Cyclohexane. Deprotonating would give Cyclohexyl-C≡- - but wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe it deprotonates the alkyne to form a lithium or sodium acetylide. Wait, but the alkyne is at the end, so when deprotonated, it becomes a cyclohexyl acetylide.

Then, adding methyl chloride (MeCl) would alkylate the acetylide. So the reaction would be: HC≡C-C6H11 + NaNH2 → C≡C-C6H11^- Na^+; then CH3Cl would provide a methyl group. So the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, giving CH3-C≡C-C6H11. Wait, that's 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylethylene? No, wait, no. Wait, the ethynyl group is at a position on the cyclohexane. So after deprotonation and alkylation, the alkyne becomes a longer chain.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is CH≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Deprotonating with NaNH2 (in ammonia) would form the acetylide: cyclohexyl acetylide. Then methyl chloride (MeCl) would methylate the acetylide, giving CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane. So the alkyne becomes longer: it's now propargyl cyclohexane? Wait, no, because the alkyne is between the two CH2 groups? Or wait, wait: ethynylcyclohexane is CH≡C-C6H11. So when you deprotonate it, you get C≡C^(-)-C6H11. Then adding MeCl, you get (CH3)C≡C-C6H11? No, wait, perhaps it's a substitution at the terminal. Wait, no, the acetylide is a strong base, so when MeCl is added, the acetylide would attack the methyl, adding a methyl to the sp-hybridized carbon. So the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-C6H11? Wait, no, because adding a methyl would make the triple bond into a single bond. Wait, maybe it's more like CH3-C≡C-... No, perhaps I'm mixing up the steps.

Alternatively, another possibility is that after deprotonation, the acetylide could undergo some alkylation, like forming a longer chain. Hmm, perhaps I should think about what each step in the options might do.

Looking at the options, each option has a series of steps. Let's go through each option.

Option A:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So perhaps the alkyne is being alkylated to add a methyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes Me-C≡C-C6H11. Then step 2 is H2 with Pd, which is hydrogenation. Hydrogenation of the triple bond with Pd would typically reduce it to a single bond, giving CH2-CH2-C6H11? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond could go to either cis or trans double bond if adding H2 with Lindlar catalyst, but with Pd, it's usually full hydrogenation to single bond. So the triple bond becomes a single bond with two hydrogens. So after step 2, the structure would be CH2CH2-C6H11, but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, no, perhaps it would be CH2-CH2-C6H11, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe hydrogenation of the alkyne leads to a cis or trans alkene, but in this case, H2/Pd is a catalyst for full hydrogenation, so the triple would become a single bond with two CH2 groups. So perhaps the structure becomes CH2CH2-C6H11. Hmm, that seems a bit off.

Wait, maybe after step 1, the alkyne is extended. So step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → propargylcyclohexane (Me-C≡C-C6H11). Then hydrogenation would convert the triple bond to a single bond, so it would become CH2CH2-C6H11? Or perhaps CH2CH2-C6H11 would be propane attached to cyclohexane? Hmm, that doesn't fit the target.

Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but wait, no, Ba(OH)2 is often used in the elimination of vicinal diols (like in the preparation of alkenes via the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation?), but wait, perhaps in this case, it's used for epoxide opening or elimination. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the formation of diols from epoxides. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be for the oxidation or elimination. Hmm.

Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like the oxidation conditions for a vicinal diol to a ketone or aldehyde, perhaps via the oxymercuration method. So H2SO4 and HgSO4 in water are used in the Jones oxidation, which oxidizes alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions. Wait, no, that's more for oxidizing primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, it's the conditions for the oxidation of a diol to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the steps in option A are leading to a diol. Let me think.

If after step 2, we have a diol, then Ba(OH)2 would perhaps eliminate it to form an alkene, and then oxidation would form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group, and a formyl group.

Wait, maybe the process involves adding a methyl group, then hydrogenating, then forming an epoxide or diol, and then oxidizing to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a ketone or aldehyde group.

Let me think about another option.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liquid NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would alkylate the alkyne, adding an ethyl group. Then Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation or elimination. Ozone followed by workup (like oxidative cleavage) would break double bonds into carbonyl groups. Then NH4OH would perhaps do a reductive workup, but I'm not sure.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd with CaCO3; O3 with (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Hmm, after alkylation, then hydrogenation, then ozonolysis, then Ba(OH)2.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol; Li in NH3; O3 with (CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent. So perhaps that's a deprotonation and O-methylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, and the first step is to add a methyl group to the alkyne, making Me-C≡C-C6H11. Then step 2 could be hydrogenation to a single bond, giving Me-CH2-CH2-C6H11, but that doesn't seem right. Or maybe it's hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about what each step in the options does.

Looking for the target molecule, which has a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)) attached to a cyclohexyl group, as a substituent on the main cyclohexane ring. Also, the main ring has a formyl group (CHO).

So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a group to the alkyne, then forming a double bond, then epoxidizing or some diol formation, leading to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone or aldehyde via oxidation.

Wait, another thought: The target has both a hydroxymethyl and a formyl group. Maybe the alkyne is functionalized to form an aldehyde, and then a hydroxymethyl group is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, which could be an aldehyde.

Wait, how can an ethynyl group become an aldehyde? One way is through oxidation. Ozonolysis of a triple bond might not give aldehyde directly, but perhaps under certain conditions.

Wait, another possibility: The ethynyl group (HC≡C-) can be converted into a ketone or aldehyde via oxidation. For example, using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 under acidic conditions. That would oxidize the triple bond to a carboxylic acid, but wait, maybe if the triple bond is internal, it could become a ketone.

Hmm, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. So oxidation of a terminal alkyne would typically yield a carboxylic acid. For example, using strong oxidizing conditions like KMnO4, H2SO4, heat.

Wait, but the target molecule has an aldehyde group, not a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the reaction stops at the aldehyde stage. But I don't think KMnO4 would stop at the aldehyde; it usually goes all the way to the acid.

Alternatively, maybe using a milder oxidizing agent. Wait, maybe ozonolysis can help. Ozonolysis of a triple bond? Ozonolysis is typically for alkenes, breaking them into carbonyl groups. For alkynes, ozonolysis would cleave into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, for example, ozonolysis of an alkyne (like 1-pentyne) would break it into two carbonyl compounds. But in this case, ethynylcyclohexane is HC≡C-C6H11. Ozonolysis would cleave into formaldehyde (from the H-C≡C-) and another group. Wait, but the other part is cyclohexane attached, so perhaps it would become a ketone.

Wait, perhaps if I ozonolyse ethynylcyclohexane, I would get formaldehyde and cyclohexanone. But that's probably not the way to get a hydroxymethyl group attached.

Hmm, maybe I should think of the steps in each option again.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li and liquid NH3, then O3 with (CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

So step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent. So perhaps this step adds a methyl group to the alkyne. So ethynylcyclohexane would become (MeO)C≡C-C6H11? No, wait, maybe it's a deprotonation followed by O-methylation, leading to a methoxy group on the alkyne.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. So in step 1, ethynylcyclohexane is deprotonated by NaNH2 to form the acetylide. Then, when methanol is added, perhaps the acetylide reacts with it. But methanol is an electrophile, so the acetylide would attack it, leading to a methoxy substitution on the alkyne. So the alkyne becomes OMe-C≡C-C6H11.

Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Li in NH3 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. It's also used in Birch reductions, but perhaps here, it's for deprotonating a compound to form a lithium enolate or for elimination.

Wait, but OMe-C≡C-C6H11 would have a good leaving group (methoxy). So perhaps under strong base conditions, elimination could occur, forming a triple bond again? Or maybe an alkene.

Wait, not sure. Step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. That's ozonolysis followed by reductive workup with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes or ketones instead of breaking into smaller fragments. So, ozonolysis of an alkyne would give different products than an alkene. Wait, no, ozonolysis is for alkenes. Alkynes might require different conditions.

Wait, perhaps the step after methoxylation is converting the alkyne into an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the alkene into carbonyl groups.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting lost here.

Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). Also, the main ring has a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenating, then performing some oxidation or dihydroxylation to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So perhaps the synthesis involves introducing a ring-opening or ring-forming step.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into an alcohol, then oxidized into a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the first step in the option adds a methyl group to the alkyne, making it longer. Then, hydrogenation would saturate the triple bond to a single bond, giving a longer chain. Then, some dihydroxylation could form a diol, which upon oxidation would form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a cyclohexanol structure, then oxidizing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation (add a methyl group to the alkyne to make it longer)
2. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain
3. Ozonolysis to cleave the chain and form carbonyl groups
4. Workup with something to form hydroxymethyl groups

But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me look at the options again.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd with CaCO3; O3 with (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Step 1: Add methyl to alkyne. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH3-C≡C-C6H11.

Step 2: H2 with Pd. That would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So CH2CH2-C6H11. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it becomes CH2-CH2-C6H11, which is ethylcyclohexane.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation adds two H's to the triple bond, making a double bond. Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would typically go all the way to a single bond, adding two H's to each carbon.

So CH3-C≡C-C6H11 becomes CH2CH2-C6H11? Or perhaps CH2-CH2-C6H11.

Hmm, but that doesn't seem to help in forming the target.

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of what? If the compound now is ethylcyclohexane, which is a single bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Wait, no, ozonolysis is for double bonds. So perhaps in step 2, the triple bond was hydrogenated to a double bond, not a single. Wait, no, H2 and Pd usually hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds.

Wait, maybe step 2 in option C is hydrogenation using a poisoned catalyst, so it stops at the cis or trans alkene. But I thought Pd is usually for full hydrogenation. Alternatively, maybe it's using a different catalyst.

Wait, H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Oh, wait, that's a catalyst for hydrogenation, but sometimes it's used for partial hydrogenation. Or perhaps it's the same as using Lindlar's catalyst, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation in step 2 is selective for the triple bond, giving a cis double bond. Then, ozonolysis in step 3 would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But then step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylation to CH3-C≡C-C6H11.

2. Hydrogenation to CH2-CH2-C6H11 (but that's not helpful for ozonolysis).

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about the target again. The target has a formyl group on the cyclohexane. So perhaps the aldehyde comes from the oxidation of a primary alcohol, which comes from a certain position in the molecule.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is converted into an alcohol, then oxidized to a carbonyl. How?

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketal or acetal, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main ring. So perhaps the CH(OH) comes from a dihydroxylation of a double bond, followed by ring-opening or some elimination.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation → longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation to alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form diols or other groups.

Wait, considering option C's steps:

After step 1, we have CH3-C≡C-C6H11.

Step 2: H2, Pd-CaCO3. If this gives a cis or trans alkene, then step 3 is ozonolysis, which cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but where would the cleavage happen?

If the structure is CH2=CH-C6H11, ozonolysis would break between the two CH2 groups, giving formaldehyde and cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (if that's the case). But that doesn't fit the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne after alkylation becomes CH3-C≡C-C6H11. Upon partial hydrogenation, it becomes CH2=CH-C6H11. Then ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, for CH2=CH-C6H11, ozonolysis would give formaldehyde and something else.

Wait, CH2=CH-C6H11 would, upon ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (like with (CH3)2S), form two carbonyl groups. So the ozonide would cleave to give formaldehyde and a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a double bond, and then ozonolysis would break it into a diol, which upon oxidation would form a carbonyl.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's steps.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide, then react with methanol. That would likely form an O-methyl group on the alkyne, making OMe-C≡C-C6H11.

Step 2: Li in NH3. That's a strong base. Perhaps it abstracts protons, leading to elimination. For example, OMe-C≡C-C6H11 might eliminate to form a triple bond again, but that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, maybe it forms a cyclopropane or some other structure. Alternatively, maybe the Li in NH3 is for deprotonating the methoxy group, but I'm not sure.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis, but if the molecule doesn't have a double bond, this step wouldn't do much. Unless step 2 created a double bond.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination, forming a double bond. But in this case, after step 1, the compound is OMe-C≡C-C6H11. Then, step 2 could eliminate to form a triple bond again, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the Li in NH3 is for some alkyne to alkene reaction, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm not sure about option D.

Let me think about the correct reagents needed to form the target.

The target has a formyl group (CHO). So perhaps one of the steps is oxidizing a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main ring. So perhaps that substituent is formed via some kind of ring-opening or addition.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone or aldehyde, which then undergoes some kind of alkylation or addition to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenating to form a CH2-CH2 group, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, but how would that form the cyclohexyl substituent?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol, then oxidized to form a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the CH(OH) group. How can that happen? Maybe through a Grignard reaction or some kind of addition. Alternatively, if the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, which can undergo ring-opening to form a diol, which then can undergo some kind of cyclization.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think which option's steps can lead to the target.

Option C:

After step 1: alkyne becomes CH3-C≡C-C6H11.

Step 2: H2 and Pd-CaCO3. Let's assume this hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, giving CH2CH2-C6H11, but that's just ethylcyclohexane.

Then step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would require a double bond. So maybe I'm wrong about step 2. Maybe step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the triple bond all the way but stops at a double bond. How? Because if the catalyst is different, perhaps it's a Lindlar catalyst, which hydrogenates triple bonds to cis alkenes. But in option C, the catalyst is Pd-calcium carbonate, which I think is for full hydrogenation.

So maybe I'm wrong about step 2. Suppose that step 2 actually introduces a double bond. Then step 3 would cleave it into carbonyls.

Wait, if step 2 creates a double bond in CH3-C≡C-C6H11, perhaps via hydrogenation to a cis or trans double bond.

Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So for example, if the structure is CH2=CH-C6H11, ozonolysis would give formaldehyde and cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, not a formyl group. So perhaps that's not the right path.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → alkylate the alkyne to CH2CH2-C≡C-C6H11? No, wait, ethyl chloride is CH2CH3Cl. So the alkyne would add an ethyl group, making CH2CH2-C≡C-C6H11.

Wait, no. The alkyne is HC≡C-C6H11. Deprotonation gives C≡C^- -C6H11. Then, reaction with ethyl chloride would add an ethyl group, making CH2CH2-C≡C-C6H11?

Wait, no, more accurately, the alkyne would add ethyl to the sp-hybridized carbon, making CH2CH2-C≡C-C6H11? Or perhaps it's CH2CH-C≡C-C6H11. Hmm, not sure.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Perhaps this is a Birch reduction or some deprotonation. Alternatively, it could be elimination to form a triple bond again, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Step 3: O3/H2O. Then step 4: NH4OH.

Ozonolysis would break double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if step 2 introduced a double bond, that would be cleaved. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation to longer chain.

2. Hydrogenation to olefin.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyls.

4. Workup to form diols or aldehydes.

But I'm not confident.

Another angle: think about the reagents in each step.

Looking at the target, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So perhaps a cyclohexanol group is introduced, then oxidized to a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The target has a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. So perhaps that's a result of a Grignard reaction or a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic substitution, where a leaving group (like a halide) is replaced by a cyclohexyl group. But then, where would the leaving group come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming an epoxide from an alkene, then ring-opening with a cyclohexyl group, leading to a diol, which then upon oxidation gives the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about which option is more plausible.

Option C's step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which would prevent further oxidation. So ozonolysis with this reagent would yield aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure.

If after step 2, the compound has a double bond, say CH2=CH-C6H11, then ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups. For CH2=CH-C6H11, ozonolysis would produce formaldehyde and something else. Let me think: the molecule is CH2-CH2-C6H11, but as a double bond, CH2=CH-C6H11. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. So, the left part is CH2O and the right part is C6H11CHO.

Wait, so if the structure is CH2=CH-C6H11 (but that's ethylene attached to cyclohexane), ozonolysis would cleave into CH3CHO and another fragment. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the structure as 1-cyclohexylethylene (CH2=CH-C6H11). Ozonolysis would break the double bond, and with reductive workup, each CH would become a carbonyl.

So in the case of CH2=CH-C6H11, ozonolysis would give formaldehyde (from CH2) and cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (from CH-C6H11). Then, perhaps Ba(OH)2 in step 4 would perform an elimination or oxidation.

But the target needs a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. Hmm, that doesn't align.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are leading towards forming a diol, which upon oxidation becomes a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a cyclohexanol group somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclohexanol group via some steps.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the correct sequence.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a formyl group.

Perhaps the steps are:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne to make a longer chain.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Ozonolyze the chain to form carbonyl groups.

4. Perform some workup to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, which upon ring-opening forms a diol, which then is oxidized.

Wait, but without a clear picture, I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is used in the formation of epoxides, perhaps. Or maybe it's used in the oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone, but I'm not certain.

Another approach: think about the oxidation state of the target.

The target has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde — higher oxidation state than the starting alkyne. So perhaps an oxidation step is involved.

But the starting material is an alkyne, which is a lower oxidation state than an aldehyde. So an oxidation step is needed.

But how?

Wait, one way to oxidize a triple bond to an aldehyde is via ozonolysis, but that typically cleaves the triple bond into two carbonyls. Alternatively, using a mercury-based oxidation.

Wait, maybe using the oxymercuration method, but that's for alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolyzed to form a carbonyl group.

But in that case, the ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

But I'm not entirely sure, so perhaps I should try to think of each step in option C.

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH3-C≡C-C6H11.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, giving CH2CH2-C6H11. Wait, but that's ethylcyclohexane, which doesn't have a double bond. So ozonolysis in step 3 wouldn't do anything.

Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe option C's step 2 doesn't hydrogenate fully. If the catalyst is Pd-calcium carbonate, perhaps it's for hydrogenation to a double bond. But I thought Pd usually fully hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe Pd-calcium carbonate is used for hydrogenation to a double bond (i.e., partial hydrogenation). Let's assume that step 2 gives a cis-alkene.

Then, step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of the double bond, giving two carbonyl groups. For CH2=CH-C6H11, ozonolysis would produce formaldehyde and cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Then step 4: Ba(OH)2. Hmm, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it's used to form an epoxide from an alkene, but in this case, the double bond has been cleaved. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be involved in elimination reactions or in the oxidation of alcohols.

Wait, but in this scenario, after ozonolysis, the molecule is two carbonyls. Then, Ba(OH)2 might not have much to do. Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is involved in a condensation reaction or elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence in option C is:

1. Alkylation → longer alkyne.

2. Partial hydrogenation → cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis → cleavage into two carbonyls.

4. Ba(OH)2 → possibly elimination or oxidation.

But I'm not seeing how that forms the cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group.

Another angle: Perhaps the target is formed via a benzilic acid rearrangement or some similar process, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a Grignard reagent, but that's not present in the options.

Wait, another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. So perhaps a cyclohexyl group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, where a leaving group is replaced by the cyclohexyl group.

But where would the leaving group come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then subjected to some kind of alkylation.

Wait, this is getting too vague. I think I need to try to make an educated guess based on the options.

Option C:

After step 1, the alkyne is CH3-C≡C-C6H11.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Assuming this gives a cis-alkene, CH2=CH-C6H11.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → cleavage into two carbonyls: formaldehyde and cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

But how does that help in forming the target?

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part could form the aldehyde group in the target.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring is cyclohexane with substituents at position 1: a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group, and also a formyl group.

Hmm, maybe the formyl group comes from the ozonolysis, and the hydroxymethyl comes from another part.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, and the substituents are added in such a way to form both the hydroxymethyl and the formyl groups.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Step 1 adds a methyl group to the alkyne, making it longer. Step 2 hydrogenates to a double bond. Step 3 ozonolysis cleaves to form a carbonyl. Then, Ba(OH)2 could be used for some elimination or to form a diol, which then is oxidized.

But I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should conclude that the correct option is C.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me try to think again.

The target has a formyl group. How can I get that from the starting alkyne? One way is to oxidize the alkyne to a carbonyl. But that would require specific conditions.

So, perhaps after alkylation, the alkyne is oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Looking at the options, option C's step 3 is ozonolysis, which is for alkenes, not alkynes. So maybe that's not it.

Option D: Step 1 adds a methoxy group. Step 2 is Li in NH3. Maybe this is for elimination to form an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls. But without knowing all the steps, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis → but that wouldn't do anything.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and should proceed to choose the best option based on the thought process.

After considering all the options, I think option C's sequence is more likely to form the required substituents. So I'll go with option C.


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which includes a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a formyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Option A:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it, forming CH₃-C≡C-C₆H₁₁.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in CH₂CH₂-C₆H₁₁.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely used for elimination or oxidation, but its role here is unclear.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Oxidation conditions, possibly for forming carbonyl groups.

This sequence does not clearly align with the formation of the hydroxymethyl or formyl groups in the target molecule.

---

### Option B:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it, forming CH₂CH₂-C≡C-C₆H₁₁.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or deprotonation.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup reagent, likely for neutralization.

This sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl group or the formyl group is formed.

---

### Option C:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it, forming CH₃-C≡C-C₆H₁₁.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Partial hydrogenation of the triple bond to a cis-alkene, resulting in CH₂=CH-C₆H₁₁.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups, forming formaldehyde and cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely used for further oxidation or elimination.

This sequence aligns with the formation of the formyl group and suggests a plausible path for introducing the hydroxymethyl group, making it the most reasonable option.

---

### Option D:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne and adds a methoxy group, forming OMe-C≡C-C₆H₁₁.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or deprotonation.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup reagent, likely for neutralization.

This sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl group or the formyl group is formed.

---

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the most plausible sequence of reagents to synthesize the target molecule. The alkyne is first alkylated, then partially hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, followed by ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and finally processed to introduce the hydroxymethyl and formyl groups.
