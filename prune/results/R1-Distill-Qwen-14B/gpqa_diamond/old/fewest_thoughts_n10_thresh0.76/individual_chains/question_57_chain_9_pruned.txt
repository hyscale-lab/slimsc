Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electron scattering, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that scattering amplitudes involve things like partial waves and phase shifts.

Wait, the problem gives me phase shifts delta_0 to delta_4, and I'm told to ignore the rest. So I guess that means we're only considering phase shifts up to l=4, right? Because each delta corresponds to a certain angular momentum quantum number l. Like, delta_0 is for l=0, delta_1 is l=1, and so on.

The question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction. I think that relates to the so-called "non-diffractive" part or maybe the specific component in the direction of the original beam. I'm a bit fuzzy on that, but I remember there's a formula for the scattering amplitude.

I recall that the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed using the sum over Legendre polynomials multiplied by some coefficients involving the phase shifts. But wait, when we're looking along the incident beam direction, the angle θ is zero, right? Because that's when the scattered electron is moving in the same direction as the incident one. So θ=0, φ=0 maybe? Or does φ matter here? I think for the direction along the beam, φ might not play a role because everything's symmetric around that axis.

Let me think about the formula. The scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^{∞} ( (2l + 1) / (2) ) * ( (e^{i delta_l} - 1) ) * ( (4π / (k)) )^(1/2) * ( (2l + 1) ) * ( (π) / (2k) )^{1/2} ) * ( (e^{i delta_l} - 1) ) * P_l(cosθ) )

Wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Another approach: I remember that the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = 4π/(k) * sum_{l=0}^{∞} ( (2l + 1) * e^{i delta_l}
