Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's read it carefully. The question is about the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options A to D.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. So, benzene ring with substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Let me note their positions. The numbering is given as 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, and 3-nitro. Wait, benzene's positions are in a ring, so let me see. If I number the ring, the substituents would be at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, adjacent to each other? Or arranged in a meta fashion? Let me think.

Now, benzene can undergo substitution reactions, and the order of adding substituents is important because substituents can direct the incoming groups. So, I need to figure out the right order of nitration, ethoxylation, and tert-butyl substitution.

Wait, benzene is the starting material. Let's think about how each substituent is added.

First, the nitro group. Nitro is a meta-directing group. So, if I add it first, the next substituent would go in a meta position relative to it. But wait, nitration is done under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe another substituent is added first that is activating or deactivating.

Wait, the target molecule has three substituents: nitro (deactivating, meta), tert-butyl (a bulky, deactivating group, since it's an alkyl group but attached to a carbon that's connected to three methyl groups; wait, no, tert-butyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl group, which is electron-donating by the inductive effect, but actually wait, no, wait: the tert-butyl group is a strong activating group because it's an alkyl substituent. Wait, no, wait
