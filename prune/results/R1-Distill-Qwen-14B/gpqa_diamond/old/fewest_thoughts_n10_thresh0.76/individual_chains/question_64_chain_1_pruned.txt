Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and try to understand what's going on.

Alright, the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that weigh 7.20 grams total. They're heated to 200°C without air. So, the setup is probably a decomposition reaction because heating salts often leads to decomposition. The result is a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes: first, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper.

The results are: tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2 doesn't change. Then, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (which is STP, so 22.4 L/mol). 

So, the goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out what each part of the setup is doing. Let's break it down.

First, the gases are passed through Mg(ClO4)2, which is a drying agent. Oh wait, but it's anhydrous. So Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent and can trap water molecules. So when a gas passes through it, if there's any water vapor, it would be absorbed, increasing the weight of the tube. So tube 1 gained 3.60g. That suggests that 3.60g of water was removed from the gases.

Then, the gas goes through Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight of this tube didn't change. Ca(OH)2 is used to absorb CO2. If the tube's weight didn't change, that means no CO2 was present in the gas mixture. Because if CO2 passed through, it would react with Ca(OH)2 solution, producing CaCO3 and water, increasing the tube's weight. Since it didn't change, there must be no CO2 in the gas.

Next, the gas passed through red-hot copper. Copper at high temperatures can react with certain gases. For example, it can react with H2S (hydrogen sulfide) to form CuS and H2. Or, if the gas is SO2, copper might be involved in some way. But the result is that 0.80g of CuO was formed. Wait, so if CuO is formed, the gas must have been something that reacts with copper to produce oxygen. Hmm, maybe the gas is a sulfur-containing compound because CuO is a product.

Wait, wait, when SO2 is passed through copper, I don't think that directly produces CuO. Alternatively, H2S might react with hot copper. Let me think. H2S is a reducing agent. When H2S reacts with hot copper, it might get oxidized. The reaction could be:

H2S + Cu (hot) → CuS (or maybe Cu2S) and H2O? Or perhaps:

H2S + 2 Cu → Cu2S + H2↑. But I'm not sure if that produces CuO. Alternatively, maybe the gas is SO2. Because when SO2 is passed through a solution, like in the second tube, maybe it didn't react, but when passed through red-hot copper, it could form CuO and S. Or perhaps another scenario.

Wait, the result is that CuO is formed, which suggests that O2 might have been involved. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is H2S. Because when H2S is passed through hot copper, it might be oxidized. Let me think of the possible reaction.

Another possibility: the gas is a mixture of H2S and another gas. But wait, the second tube didn't change, so maybe the gas mixture doesn't have CO2, but perhaps it has H2S and another gas?

Wait,
