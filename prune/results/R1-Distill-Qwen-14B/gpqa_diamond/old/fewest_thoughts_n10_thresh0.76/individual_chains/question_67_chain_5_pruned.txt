Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about electrons in p orbitals. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, which probably means we're focusing only on their orbital angular momentum here. The combined state is given as |1,1,2,-1>, where I think the first two numbers are the individual angular momenta (l1 and l2), then the total angular momentum l, and m is the z-component.

Wait, wait. So each electron is in a p orbital, which means each has l=1 because p orbitals have l=1. So l1 and l2 are both 1 each. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, because when you couple two l=1 particles, the possible total l values are 0,1,2. So the state is a combination of l=2.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>. So m is -1. Because m is the z-component of the total angular momentum, Lz.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. We need to find the joint probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ.

Hmm. So each L1z and L2z are the z components of each electron's orbital angular momentum. Since each electron is in an l=1 orbital, their possible m values are -1,0,+1. So for each electron, Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But wait, no. Let me correct that. The eigenvalues for Lz when l=1 are mħ, where m can be -1, 0, +1. So for each electron, the possible outcomes for Lz are -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But the combined state is |1,1,2,-1>. So when considering the total angular momentum, the state is a particular combination of the individual states.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the joint probability of both electrons having Lz = -ħ each. So each electron's m (individual) is -1. So the individual m1 and m2 would each be -1. Then, the total m would be m1 + m2, which is -2. But wait, the state has m = -1. So
