Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me read through it again.

The question says that there are five exoplanets with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All the planets have the same albedo. The question is asking for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The options are A to D, with some decimal numbers.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering energy from its star and its own heat emission. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - A) / (d^2) )^(1/4), but maybe I can simplify that.

Wait, another way I've heard it phrased: the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of the inverse of the orbital period. Or wait, no, the square root of the period is related to the semi-major axis, via Kepler's third law. Because Kepler's law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P² ∝ a³, right? So a ∝ P^(2/3). 

But wait, equilibrium temperature formula is usually given as T = T_eff * ( (R / a) )^(1/2), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature. But since the star's temperature and other factors (like albedo) are the same for all these planets, the ratio of their temperatures would depend on the square root of (a_i / a_j ), because T ∝ (1/a)^(1/2). Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) * ( L / (16πσ a²) )^(1/4). But if all the planets have the same albedo (A) and same star (so L and T_star are same), then the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (1/a)^0.5. So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

Alternatively, since a is proportional to P^(2/3) (from Kepler's third law), then T is proportional
