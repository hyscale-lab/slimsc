Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I remember that when a heavy nucleus undergoes fission, it splits into two smaller nuclei. The problem here says that the initial nucleus is at rest, and after fission, it splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. Oh, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. Interesting.

So the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. Wait, the rest mass energy is given by E=mc², right? But in this case, the nucleus is at rest, so all its energy is rest mass energy. Then, after fission, some energy is converted into kinetic energy of the two fragments. So I think I need to consider conservation of energy and momentum here.

Wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. Therefore, after fission, the total momentum must also be zero. That means the two fragments must move in opposite directions with momenta that cancel each other out. So their velocities are in opposite directions, and their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial mass: M
- Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus: 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments: one is twice as massive as the other. So let's say fragment 1 has mass 2m, fragment 2 has mass m.
- Sum of rest masses of fragments is 0.99 M. So 2m + m = 3m = 0.99 M ⇒ m = 0.33 M. So fragment masses are 0.66 M and 0.33 M.

Wait, wait. Oh, because 2m + m = 3m = 0.99 M. So m is 0.33 M. So fragment 1 is 0.66 M, fragment 2 is 0.33 M.

Now, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. The rest mass energies of the fragments after fission would be (0.66 M) c² and (0.33 M) c². But wait, that's their rest energy. But after fission, they have kinetic energy as well
