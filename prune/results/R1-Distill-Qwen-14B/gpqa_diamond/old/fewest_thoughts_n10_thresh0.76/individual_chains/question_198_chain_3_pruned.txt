Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. Higher β means the complex is more stable because it forms more readily from the ions. So the higher the β, the more the complex will form.

Wait, but wait. How are the complexes structured here? Oh right, for metal-ligand complexes, the stability constant β is for the stepwise formation. So for the first complex, Co(SCN)n, the β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)²+ from Co²+ and SCN-.

Wait, no. Let me think. The general formula for the nth complex would be Co(SCN)n²+ or something like that. The stability constants β1, β2, β3, β4 probably refer to the stepwise formation constants. So β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)²+, β2 is the constant for the next step, Co(SCN)₂²+, and so on up to β4 for Co(SCN)₄²+.

Wait, but wait, the numbering could vary. Sometimes the overall formation constant is given, but in this case, since they're called 'stability constants' and there are four values, it's likely that each βn is the stepwise constant. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, etc.

So the problem is about the distribution of cobalt species in solution, considering these complexes. And the specific question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is probably the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two
