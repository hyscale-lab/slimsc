Okay, so I've got this question about designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my virology, but let's think this through.

Retroviruses are RNA viruses, right? So their genetic material is RNA. When they infect a host, like humans, they use reverse transcriptase to make DNA from their RNA. This DNA then integrates into the host's genome. So, when designing a diagnostic test, I need to consider whether the virus is in its RNA or DNA form, or maybe the host's DNA after integration.

The question is about an outbreak, so they probably want a quick and accurate test. The options are about different methods: PCR, real-time PCR, nested PCR, and ELISA targeting IgG antibodies.

Option A says to use nested PCR based on symptoms. Nested PCR is a method where you do two rounds of PCR to increase specificity. But wait, I think for PCR-based diagnostics, you usually target a specific region, so you need to know the genetic sequence for that. Also, relying on symptoms might not be the best because symptoms can vary or overlap with other diseases. Plus, PCR is more direct in detecting the pathogen.

Option B suggests cDNA sequencing and then real-time PCR. cDNA sequencing would mean you're looking at the virus's RNA by converting it to cDNA first. Real-time PCR is good because it's quantitative and can give results quickly. Since retroviruses have RNA, making cDNA from their RNA makes sense. Then using real-time PCR for detection would be effective.

Option C is DNA sequencing and then PCR. Wait, if it's a retrovirus, the primary genetic material is RNA. Unless the virus has integrated into the host's genome, in which case DNA would be present. But for an acute infection, maybe they're in the RNA phase. So using DNA sequencing might not be the first step. Unless the test is for DNA, like after integration. But the question is about detecting the virus, not the integrated genome, I think.

Option D is about IgG antibodies. ELISA tests are serological, meaning they detect antibodies in the blood. IgG is one type, but these tests usually take longer because you need the immune response to develop. Also, in an outbreak, you might want to detect the virus quickly, not wait for antibodies. Plus, some people might not mount a strong antibody response, or maybe it's early stages and antibodies aren't present yet.

So, putting it all together. Retrovirus has RNA. To detect it, you can use PCR after reverse transcription. Real-time PCR is efficient and gives quick results. So the correct approach would be to first identify the virus via cDNA sequencing (to get the genetic info) and then develop a real-time PCR kit.

Looking at the options, option B does that. It starts with cDNA sequencing and then real-time PCR. That makes sense because you need the genetic sequence to design primers for the PCR.

Option D is about antibodies, which might not be the fastest or most direct method. Option A uses nested PCR, but I'm not sure why you'd go that route first. Also, relying on symptoms isn't the best for specificity.

So the best answer is B.


To design a molecular diagnostic kit for detecting a retrovirus, it is important to consider the nature of retroviruses, which are RNA viruses. They use reverse transcriptase to convert their RNA into cDNA, which can then integrate into the host genome. For quick and accurate detection, PCR-based methods are preferred over serological methods like ELISA, as they directly target the viral genetic material.

Option A suggests using nested PCR based on symptoms, but this approach is less reliable because symptoms can be non-specific and may overlap with other diseases. Additionally, nested PCR requires prior knowledge of the genetic sequence for primer design, which is not addressed here.

Option B involves cDNA sequencing followed by real-time PCR. This is a logical approach because retroviruses are RNA-based, and cDNA sequencing provides the necessary genetic information to design primers for real-time PCR. Real-time PCR is efficient, quantitative, and provides quick results, making it ideal for outbreak detection.

Option C proposes DNA sequencing and PCR, but this is less suitable for detecting the viral RNA in its native state. DNA sequencing would only be relevant if the virus has already integrated into the host genome, which is not the primary concern during an acute infection.

Option D focuses on detecting IgG antibodies using ELISA. While this method can identify past or current infections, it is less direct and slower than PCR-based methods, as it relies on the host's immune response, which may not be immediate or present in all cases.

Given the need for a quick and accurate diagnostic tool for an RNA-based retrovirus, the best approach is to first identify the virus through cDNA sequencing and then develop a real-time PCR kit for detection. This aligns with the steps outlined in Option B.

Answer: B
