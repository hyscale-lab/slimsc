Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) which is given by (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, energy spectrum usually relates to the possible energy levels the particle can occupy. So I think this involves solving the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates because the potential depends on r and θ.

Wait, but polar coordinates in two dimensions... So the particle is in a plane, right? So the system is two-dimensional, which probably means the potential has angular components.

Let me think about the potential. The given V(r,θ) is (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I can factor this a bit. Let me see:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Oh wait, no, wait, wait. Let's compute it again.

Wait, (1/2)kr² is the first term, and the second is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So adding them together, it's (1/2)kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Alternatively, I can write this as (kr²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ], but maybe that's not immediately helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can split the potential into two parts.

Wait, maybe this potential can be rewritten in terms of another coordinate system. Alternatively, perhaps it's a combination of harmonic oscillator potentials in different directions.

Wait, in 2D polar coordinates, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is the momentum operator. But when you separate variables in the Schrödinger equation for polar coordinates, you usually end up with the radial part and the angular part. The angular part often leads to the angular momentum operator, which gives quantized angular momentum levels.

But looking at the potential, I see it depends on r and cosθ. So perhaps it's easier to change to Cartesian coordinates. Because in Cartesian, cosθ can be
