Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one goes upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of these two photons.

Hmm, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. Since they're matter and antimatter, their annihilation should conserve energy and momentum. So I think I need to apply conservation laws here.

First, let's think about the initial momenta and energies of the electron and positron. Oh wait, Lorentz factors are given—gamma for each. The Lorentz factor gamma is equal to 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), right? But maybe I don't need to calculate the actual velocities since we can work with momentum in terms of gamma.

The rest mass of an electron (and positron) is the same, right? So m_e is approximately 9.11e-31 kg. So the momentum of each particle would be gamma * m_e * v. But wait, another way—since for relativistic particles, the momentum p is gamma * m * v, and energy E is gamma * m c². But wait, maybe I should express momentum in terms of gamma and rest mass.

Wait, another approach: since gamma = E/(m c²), so E = gamma m c². And the momentum p is gamma m v. But since v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²), perhaps? Or maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of momentum and energy.

Wait, perhaps using four-momentum would help here. The four-momentum is (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z). Since the particles are moving along the x-axis, their y and z momenta are zero. So for each particle, their four-momentum is (gamma m c, gamma m v, 0, 0). Wait, no, the momentum p is gamma m v, but wait, that's actually not correct. Because
