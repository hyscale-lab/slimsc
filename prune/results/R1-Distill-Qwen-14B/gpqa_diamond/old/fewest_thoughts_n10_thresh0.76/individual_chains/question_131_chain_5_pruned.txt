Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a reaction involving an anhydride and a cyclopentadiene derivative, and the analysis of the products using NMR techniques, specifically NOESY.

First, let me parse the information given. The starting point is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has an NMR that's a single peak in 1H (at 7 ppm) and two peaks in 13C NMR at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 

Wait, what does that tell me about the structure? The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's probably from a proton in a symmetrical environment. 7 ppm is usually aromatic or maybe an alkyne, but more likely aromatic. But if the anhydride comes from a dicarboxylic acid, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride. Wait, but the starting material had a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a cis-diol (like in a diacid) would lead to a cyclic anhydride. But the structure's symmetry might lead to a single proton peak.

Wait, for example, if the anhydride is cyclic and symmetrical, like a five-membered ring. Let's say, for example, the acid was cis-butenedioic acid. Dehydration would form a succinic anhydride, but that's a five-membered ring. The structure would be symmetric, leading to the 1H NMR showing one peak. Because in succinic anhydride, the two CH groups are equivalent, so the H's are all the same, leading to a singlet. But wait, succinic anhydride's structure is a five-membered ring with two ester-like groups. Its 1H NMR shows a singlet for the two equivalent CH2 groups. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

If the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR, that suggests that all the protons are equivalent. So, maybe it's a symmetrical structure. Let's suppose it's a four-membered ring, which would be unusual, but maybe. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is such that the protons are in an environment that causes them to be equivalent. For example, in a bridged structure, but I'm not sure.

Moving on to the 13C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl group, maybe from the anhydride. 137 ppm could be a sp2 hybridized carbon, perhaps from a double bond or an aromatic ring. But wait, the anhydride would have a carbonyl (like around 170-185?), but I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure again.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride has a benzene ring. Wait, wait, if the starting material was a cis-dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene, maybe it's something like cis-butenedioic acid, but that's a four-carbon chain. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexene-based acid. Hmm, not sure yet.

But perhaps I should focus on the next part. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. That's a diene, and the reaction is probably a Diels-Alder reaction. Because the anhydride is a dienophile. Oh right, anhydrides can act as dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions. So the reaction here would form a six-membered cycloadduct, probably.

The products are two, a major and minor, with the same molecular formula C1
