Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, let me see. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. Dipole transitions, specifically, have certain selection rules. For the principal quantum number n, the selection rule is Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but for dipole transitions, the allowed changes are Δn = ±1. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Dipole transitions have specific selection rules for l and m as well.

Oh right, the selection rules for dipole transitions (electric dipole) are:
- Δl = ±1 (so the orbital angular momentum changes by one unit)
- Δm = 0, ±1 (the magnetic quantum number can change by -1, 0, or +1)
And for the principal quantum number n, Δn can be ±1, ±2, etc., but in reality, the transitions are possible only if the energy allows it. Wait, no, the problem says it's a two-step transition, so from 3 to 1 in two steps, each being Δn ±1.

Wait, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So the transition is from 3 to 1 via two steps.

So each step must obey the selection rules. Let me think about the possible intermediate states.

In the first step, from n=3, l=0 (s orbital), the electron can transition to a state where l=1 (p orbital) because Δl=±1. So from l=0, it can go to l=1. And n can change by ±1, so from n=3, possible next n is 2 or 4. But since the final state is n=1, which is two steps below, it has to go through n=2 in the first step.

So first transition: 3,0,0 → 2,1, m? Let's see. For the first transition, n changes from 3 to 2 (Δn=-1). l changes from 0 to 1 (Δl=+1). So this is allowed. Now, what about m? The initial state has m=0. So in the first transition, m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, so first transition: m can go to m=0±1 or 0, so possible m values are -1, 0, +1. But wait, when l=1, the possible m values are -1, 0, +1. So after the first transition, the state could be any of those m states with l=1 and n=2.

Now, the second transition is from n=2, l=1, m=? to n=1, l=0, m
