Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question involves two reactions, Reaction A and Reaction B, and I need to determine their major products from the given options. The options are A, B, C, or D, each giving different products for A and B.

Let's break it down.

First Reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + THF, KH, H+ → A

Second Reaction: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) → B

Hmm. I need to figure out what each reaction does and choose the correct major products.

Starting with Reaction A: The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds are those where two rings are joined by a single atom, usually a carbon. So this molecule probably has two rings connected at one carbon atom.

The reagents are THF, KH, and H+. THF is tetrahydrofuran, a solvent. KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. H+ is probably a proton source, maybe in workup.

Wait, I think I remember that when spiro compounds react under certain conditions, like with strong bases, they can undergo ring-opening or rearrangement. Wait, but what's the exact process here?

Wait, another thought: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The structure would have a spiro junction, with one ring being 3-membered and the other 5-membered. The '1-vinyl' group suggests a double bond adjacent to the spiro carbon. So the structure is a spiro compound with a double bond and an alcohol group.

Reagents are THF, KH. Potassium hydride is a strong base, usually used for deprotonation. But in some cases, it can also induce elimination or other reactions.

Wait, but considering the conditions, perhaps this is a case for a pinacol-like rearrangement or some kind of elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a Baeyer-Villiger type of reaction, but I don't think that's it.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen-like rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the base could deprotonate the alcohol, making an alkoxide, which could then undergo some kind of cyclization.

Wait, the reaction is in THF, which is a good solvent for such reactions. The presence of a strong base like KH might deprotonate the alcohol to form an alkoxide, but then what happens next?

Wait, another possibility: the alcohol is adjacent to a double bond. The structure is 1-vinylspiro, so the spiro carbon is the same as the one with the vinyl group. The structure would be something like:

The spiro carbon is connected to a 3-membered ring (like cyclopropane) and a 5-membered ring. The vinyl group is attached to the spiro carbon, and there's an alcohol also on that carbon. So the structure is a spiro system with a CH2OH group, but wait, no: 1
