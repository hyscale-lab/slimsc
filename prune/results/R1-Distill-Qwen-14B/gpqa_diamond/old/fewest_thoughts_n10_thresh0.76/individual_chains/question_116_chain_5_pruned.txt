Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think this through.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals can give clues about the structure. Let me recall what these splitting patterns mean.

A triplet usually indicates that the protons are adjacent to a CH2 group because each H sees two neighboring Hs, giving n+1=3 peaks. Similarly, a quartet suggests they're next to a CH3, as each H would see three neighboring Hs, leading to n+1=4 peaks.

Looking at the integration: 6H and 4H. So, maybe the triplet is from two CH3 groups, each with 3H, totaling 6H. The quartet could be from a CH2 group adjacent to a CH3. So putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that might not fit the splitting.

Wait another thought: If the triplet is 6H, that's two sets of CH3 groups. The quartet is 4H, which could be two CH2 groups. So maybe the structure is two CH3 groups attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH2 group, which is attached to another CH3. No, that might not fit. Or perhaps it's a compound where a CH2 is between two CH3 groups and another CH2. Wait, maybe it's like (CH2CH3)2CHCH2CH3? I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted alkane. Let me think of a molecule with two CH3 groups attached to a CH2, and another CH2 attached to another substituent. Wait, maybe it's a structure like CH2CH2 where each CH2 has two CH3 groups? No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: The triplet at 0.9 ppm suggests these are likely CH3 groups that are next to a CH2. Because if a CH3 is next to a CH2, each of their pro
