Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants are related to how stable a complex is, right? So higher beta means the complex is more stable. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all species. 

Let me read the question carefully again. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) are given for each complex: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, but what are these complexes? I think β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]^2−, and β4 for [Co(SCN)₄]^2−. Or wait, maybe it's a different order. Because dithiocyanato would imply two SCN ligands. So the blue complex is probably the one with two SCN, maybe [Co(SCN)₂]^(n?), but I'm not sure about the charge.

Wait, the question specifies "dithiocyanato" meaning two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)₂]^0 perhaps? Or does it have a different charge? Let me think. Each SCN- is -1. So two of them would be -2. Co is +2, so overall charge would be zero. So that's [Co(SCN)₂]^0. Its stability constant is β2 = 40.

The task is to find the percentage of this complex relative to all the Co species. So all the possible species are the free Co²+ ion and the four complexes: [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)₃]^-, and [Co(SCN)₄]^2−. Wait, but the stability constants given are β1, β2, β3, β4. So β1 is for the first complex, which is with one SCN, so [Co(SCN)]^+ (since Co²+ plus one SCN- would be +1 charge). Then β2 is for two SC
