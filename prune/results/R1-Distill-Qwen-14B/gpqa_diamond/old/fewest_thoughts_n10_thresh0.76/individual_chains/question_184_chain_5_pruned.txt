Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question asks which sequence of reactions would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target molecule. So, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me draw the benzene ring. The substituents are: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering them correctly is essential. Wait, wait, in benzene, positions are numbered in a way that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. But in this case, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, so perhaps the numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. Alternatively, maybe the numbering is different. Let me think: the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2—so the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a meta arrangement?

Wait, no, the positions are 1, 2, 3, so that would make the substituents adjacent. Wait, perhaps the correct numbering is that ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the benzene ring would have these three substituents in the order 1, 2, 3. Hmm, so they are adjacent to each other. That might complicate things because when you do substitution reactions, each substituent directs incoming groups to certain positions.

But wait, wait, benzene is symmetric, so the actual positions depend on how the substituents are arranged. Let's think about the substituents. Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating group), nitro is deactivating (electron-withdrawing), and tert-butyl is bulky but also activating (since alkyl groups are activating through inductive effect? No, wait—tert-butyl is a strong activating group because it's a bulky alkyl group. Wait, no, actually, all alkyl groups are activating, ortho/para directors. So, the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are activating, while nitro is deactivating.

Wait, but nitro is a strong meta director. So, when a nitro group is present, the incoming electrophile will go to the meta position relative to it. But in this molecule, the nitro is at position 3, and the ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. So how did they get there?

But I'm
