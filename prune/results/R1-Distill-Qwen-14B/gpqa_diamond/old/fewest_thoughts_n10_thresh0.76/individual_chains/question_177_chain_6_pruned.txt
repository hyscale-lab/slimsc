Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Wait, radial velocity... I think that's about how fast they're moving away or towards us. But I'm not entirely sure how that plays into this.

The question is about the luminosity of the two stars. The astronomers computed that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's by a certain factor. The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35. Hmm.

So, I remember that luminosity for stars can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the luminosity depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem mentions that the stars' wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2?

Wait, but wait. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ_max for both is the same. So T1 = T2. Because λ_max = b / T → T = b/λ_max. So same λ_max means same T.

So if both stars have the same temperature, then the luminosity difference comes only from the radius. Because L = 4πσR²T⁴. So L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is the same for both, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2
