Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let's see what it says. Alright, two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periodsâ€”2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses, so that's the orbital period, right?

Then, there's the radial velocity data. For system_1, the velocities have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Oh wait, no, the other way around? No, the question says 'by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?' So I need to find mass ratio M1/M2.

Wait, but wait. How do radial velocities relate to mass in a binary system? Oh right, in a binary system, the two stars orbit a common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, and the less massive will have a larger orbit, right? So the radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass of the star. Because the more massive star doesn't move as much.

The formula I remember is that for each star, their velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to their mass. The mass of the star is inversely proportional to their velocity. So, K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because the more massive star (M1) has a smaller K.

Wait, let me think again. The total mass (M) of the system is M1 + M2. Each star's mass is proportional to the other star's velocity. Like, M1/M2 = K2/K1. Because the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses.

So for system_1: K1 is 10, K2 is 5. So M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So system_1's masses are in a 1:2 ratio. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = (0.5 * M2) + M2 = 1.5 * M2.

Wait, but wait. Let's step back. The system's total mass is the sum. But how does this relate to the orbital period? Oh,
