Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. 

I remember that for different crystal systems, the formulas for interplanar distances vary. Since this is a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of hexagonal crystal system, but wait, no, rhombohedral is actually part of the cubic system, right? Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, no, rhombohedral is a hexagonal system? Or is it a separate system? I'm a bit confused here. Oh wait, no, rhombohedral is a subclass of the cubic system when all edges are equal and angles are 90 degrees, but in this case, the angles are 30 degrees each. So the lattice is rhombohedral, which means it's a type of crystal system where a = b = c, but the angles are all equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron.

The formula for the interplanar distance d_hkl in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the structure factors divided by the lattice parameter squared. The formula is something like d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos(theta) ), but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, I think I need to refer to the general formula for interplanar spacing in a cubic system, but considering the angles in the unit cell.

Wait, no, the general formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma + kl cos alpha + lh cos beta) ) ), but wait, in a cubic system with all a's equal and angles, maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, another approach is to use the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system. Because in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and angles are all equal (alpha = beta = gamma). Let me think about this. The formula for interplanar distance in such a case might simplify because of the symmetry.

I recall that the general formula for d_{hkl} in a cubic system is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos gamma + kl cos alpha + lh cos beta)/(a²)

But in a rhombohedral system, alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, and a = b = c.

So substituting, the formula becomes:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2 [ hk cos(30) + kl cos(30) + lh cos(30) ] /a²

Factor out cos(30) from the terms:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2 cos(30) (hk + kl + lh) ] /
