Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, and the pion is at rest initially. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Hmm, but what about the neutrino? I remember neutrinos are tricky because they have very tiny masses, or maybe they're considered massless in some approximations.

So, the question is asking for the kinetic energies of the products. The options are A through D, each with two numbers, I guess the KE of each particle. But wait, in this reaction, the pion is at rest, so the products must move off in opposite directions because momentum must be conserved.

I think the key here is conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after the decay must be zero. So, the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But wait, neutrinos are leptons, and in many cases, their masses are neglected. I'm not sure if I should consider the neutrino's mass here. The problem doesn't specify, so I might have to make an assumption. Let's say the neutrino is massless for simplicity, as that's a common approximation in such problems.

So, let's start with the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy would be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy would be its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible or zero).

Wait, but in reality, the neutrino has some mass, but if it's very small, maybe we can approximate it as zero. If the neutrino's mass is m_nu, then its energy would be sqrt(p^2 c^4 + m_nu^2 c^4). But if m_nu is negligible, then E_nu ≈ pc. But again, without knowing m_nu, I'm not sure. Maybe the problem assumes m_nu is zero.

So, let's proceed under that assumption. Let me write down what I know.

Initial energy (E_initial) = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

Final energy (E_final) = E_mu + E_nu
E_final = (gamma m_mu c²) + (E_nu)

But since the pion is at rest, the total momentum must be zero. So, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite. So, p_mu = p_nu. Because momentum is a vector, their directions are opposite, so p_mu = -p_nu.

But for a massless neutrino, E_nu = p_nu c. And for the muon, E_mu² = (p_mu c)² + (m_mu c²)².

So let's set p_mu = p (a positive value), then p_nu = p as well. So E_nu = p c.

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( p² c² + (105.7)^2 )

The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu.

So, E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

139.6 = sqrt( p² c² + (105.7)^2 ) + p c.

Hmm, since units are in MeV, let's make sure about the units. c is in units where c=1 (natural units), so MeV is the unit of energy, mass, and momentum as well.

So, the equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p.

We can square both sides to eliminate the square root, but this might get a bit messy. Alternatively, let me rearrange the equation.

Let me denote sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) as A. So,

A + p = 139.6.

Rearranging, A = 139.6 - p.

Now square both sides:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2 *139.6 * p + p².

So,

p² +
