Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The problem says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, they checked using TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to determine which of the given options could be the products.

First, let me try to draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, the benzene ring has an oxygen attached to it, which is connected to a butenyl group.

Breaking down the substituent: 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. The butenyl group has four carbons. The double bond is between C3 and C4 (since it's but-3-en-1-yl), so the structure would be CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? Wait, maybe I should think again. No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but with substituents.

Wait, the substituent is 2,2-dimethyl. So the main chain is four carbons, starting from the point of attachment (the 1-yl). So the structure should be:

O

|
Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2

Wait, no, because but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But with 2,2-dimethyl, so the substituents are on C2.

So the structure is:

O

|
Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-

Wait, but that would make the substituents on C2, which is the second carbon from the oxygen. So the structure is Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no, but wait the butenyl group has four carbons, so the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me write it out more clearly.

The butenyl group is but-
