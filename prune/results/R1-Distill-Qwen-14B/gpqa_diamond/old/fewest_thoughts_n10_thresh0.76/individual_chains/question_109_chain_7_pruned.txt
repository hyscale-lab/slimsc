Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see what I can figure out. 

The question says the system is in a 1S0 state and emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin T(NN), angular momentum L(NN), and spin S(NN) of the final state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I think that's a condition for the symmetry of the overall wavefunction because of Pauli's exclusion principle, considering the identical particles involved.

So the initial state is 1S0. Since 1S0 is a term symbol, I think the breakdown is (2S+1)L(J). Wait, 1S0 would mean 2S+1=1 → S=0. So the spin is zero. The L is S, which is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. So in 1S0, L is 0 (since S is the spectroscopic notation for L, I think). So the initial state has S=0, L=0. Then J is 0, because J is the total angular momentum, which is S + L. So J=0.

The system emits a particle X. The final state is NN with T(NN)=0. So the isospin of the NN system is zero. And the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each showing a transition to a different state and a possible particle emitted, with the lowercase letter indicating the angular momentum state of X.

Wait, the options are something like 1S0 → 7D1 + p, etc. So each option represents the initial state (1S0) emitting a particle X, resulting in a final state. The letters p, s, f, etc., refer to the orbital angular momentum quantum number l. So p is l=1, s is l=0, f is l=3, d is l=2, maybe? Wait, no: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc.

Wait, but the problem says the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So in each option, the emitted particle X
