Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

Alright, the question describes a reaction involving a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. This acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride has some specific NMR characteristics: a single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the 13C NMR. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, yielding two products—a major and a minor. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3.

The major product's NOESY NMR shows a cross-peak, which the minor doesn't. The question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, the starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride is important here. The NMR data might help determine its structure.

The 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a region where aromatic protons typically appear, but since it's an anhydride, maybe it's something else. Wait, anhydrides can have carbonyl groups, but protons at 7 ppm... Maybe it's an aromatic ring, but if the starting material was a cis-dicarboxylic acid, perhaps the dehydration leads to a cyclic anhydride. Alternatively, maybe the proton is from an alkene or an aromatic ring.

Wait, the 13C NMR has peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. 165 is probably a carbonyl group, like an anhydride or ketone. 137 ppm is around where a carbonyl-adjacent carbon (like a CH next to a carbonyl) would be. So maybe the anhydride has a structure where two carbonyl groups are connected. Also, the 1H NMR has a single peak, which suggests symmetry. So perhaps the anhydride is cyclic and symmetrical.

Wait, another thought: if the starting acid is a cis-dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene, perhaps the structure is something like HOOC-CR2-CH2-COOH, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexene derivative. Wait, no—dehydration of a diacid with a cis-alkene would form a cyclic anhydride. For example, if the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's a trans-alkene, perhaps. Wait, no, the starting acid has a cis-alkene.

Wait, no, the acid is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-
