Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Hmm, let's think about each one step by step.

First, I remember that the position of substitution in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions depends on the directing groups present on the benzene ring. The substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they direct incoming electrophiles to ortho, meta, or para positions.

So each substance is a benzene ring with a substituent. Let me list them again:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Each of these substituents will direct the incoming Br2 to certain positions. Since bromine tends to add once in excess, but for substitution, each substituent will influence where the Br adds.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So I need to find out for each compound whether the major product is para, and how much of the para isomer is formed. Then arrange them from the least to the most in terms of the weight fraction of para.

Wait, or is it the other way around? The question says 'increasing the weight fraction of the para-isomer.' So from the smallest to the largest fraction.

Let me think about each substituent.

1) Methyl group (CH3): It's an activating group, ortho/para-directing. So when Br adds, it will prefer to go to the para position because the methyl group is an activating group, and in electrophilic substitution, the para position is more favored in such cases. Wait, but actually, for mono-substituted benzene rings with an activating group, the para is often the major product, but sometimes ortho can be significant, especially when steric hindrance is a factor. For methyl, which is small, the para product is major, but ortho can also be
