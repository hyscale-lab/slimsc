Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and molecular symmetry. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, let's read the question again. It's about a series of reactions leading to a product E, and we need to find its molecular symmetry group. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) Dâˆžh, D) C2v.

First, I'll try to break down the reactions given.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe it's a polymerization reaction or something involving a metal with a gas, like maybe sulfur trioxide or something else. But I'm not sure yet.

Next, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E, which is extremely hazardous. E sounds dangerous, so maybe it's something like a toxic gas or a highly reactive compound. But I can't place it exactly yet.

Then, C reacting with water reforms A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, etc. Weak acids are like CH3COOH or HNO2. So when C reacts with water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. This suggests that C could be a compound that, upon hydrolysis, releases acids. Maybe a metal oxide or something similar?

Wait, but C is a product from A and B. So if C is a metal oxide, perhaps. Let me think, maybe B is an acid or a base. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is something like Cl2 or SO3.

Wait, another clue: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents could be something like water, ethanol, etc. If B and D react in a 1:1 ratio, maybe they form something like HCl (if B is H2 and D is Cl2?), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps B is H2O and D is something else. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is something like H2S, but that might not form a common solvent.

Wait, let's think about the possible reactions
