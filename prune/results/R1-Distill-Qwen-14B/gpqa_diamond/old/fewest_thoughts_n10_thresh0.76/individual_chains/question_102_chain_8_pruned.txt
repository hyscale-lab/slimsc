Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why there's no green signal when they looked at the mice under the confocal microscope. Let me go through the problem step by step.

First, the setup: They have a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with 8 alpha helices, 4 extracellular, and 3 beta sheets. They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. 

The vector has two ORFs: the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. So I'm thinking that the CBA promoter will drive the transcription of both the ligand and the receptor because the IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be translated after the ligand. 

But wait, there are stop cassettes in between. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So, when Cre is present, it would recombine the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes and allowing the fusion proteins to be expressed. 

They used this vector in primary astrocyte culture and checked expression via Western blot. The antibodies worked because they saw signals proportional to actin, which suggests their expression is working. So, the problem isn't in the initial construct expression.

Now, they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct on a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre would be expressed in neural crest-derived cells, including the cells expressing this ligand and receptor.

The offspring should have the Cre recombinase active in the right cells, which would excise the stop cassettes. So, the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP constructs should be expressed.

But when they looked under the confocal, there's no green signal. The eGFP isn't showing up. So what's wrong?

Let's look at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression of the receptor-eGFP. If the ligand is expressed in another cell, that shouldn't affect the receptor's expression in their own cell. So this might not explain the lack of eGFP.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the GFP wasn't expressed, or the receptor wasn't trafficked properly, you wouldn't see fluorescence. But in the Western blot, they probably saw the eGFP (if the antibody is there). But the problem is in the mouse model. Wait, noâ€” when they transfected into astrocytes, they saw signals. So during transfection, the proteins are expressed. But in the mouse, maybe the expression isn't happening because of the Cre issue.

Wait, but the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre. So the Cre should be active in the intended cells. Maybe the Cre isn't working? Or perhaps the stop cassettes aren't being excised.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic with lox sites. The ligand is first, with a loxP stop before mCherry, and the receptor has a lox2272 stop before eGFP. LoxP and lox2272 are different sites; Cre recombinase can only recognize loxP. So the lox2272 site won't be cut by Cre. So the stop cassette in front of the receptor-eGFP isn't being removed. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop remains.

Wait, but the vector is set up so that both the ligand and the receptor are under the same promoter, with the IRES allowing the receptor to be translated. But the stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272, which are different. So, if they use Cre, which only cuts loxP, then the ligand's stop cassette would be removed, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop cassette is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the receptor-eGFP would not be expressed. So in the mouse, the eGFP wouldn't be made because the stop remains.

So
