Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. The question is about the para-substitution in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Substances 1-6 are given, and each undergoes this reaction with excess bromine. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield.

Hmm, first I should remember that electrophilic substitution reactions on aromatic rings are influenced by the substituents already present. The substituents can be activating or deactivating and can direct incoming electrophiles to specific positionsâ€”ortho, meta, or para.

Let me list out the substances again to understand each one:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The substituent is a methyl group, which is an activating group because it's an electron-donating group (since it's an alkyl group). So it should direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. But which is more favored? I think activating groups like methyl usually lead to more para substitution than ortho because the para position is less hindered, especially in cases where the substituent is bulky. But wait, in toluene, the methyl is a small group, so maybe the ortho and para are about equally likely. Wait, no, I think in the case of activating groups, para tends to be the major product because the ortho positions can sometimes be hindered, but maybe more importantly, for meta directors, but methyl is an ortho/para director.

Wait, no. Oh wait, methyl is an activating group (since it donates electrons), so it's an ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, the major products would be the para and ortho isomers. For toluene, I think the para isomer is more major than the ortho, but I'm not sure about the exact distribution.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's phenyl acetate. The substituent is an ester group, O-CO-OEt. Ester groups are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So they are meta directors. So the incoming electrophile would go to the meta position. But wait, wait, wait. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) because of the carbonyl. So as a deactivating,
