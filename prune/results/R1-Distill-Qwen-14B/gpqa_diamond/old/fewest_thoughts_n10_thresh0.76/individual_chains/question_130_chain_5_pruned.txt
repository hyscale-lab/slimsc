Okay, so I've got this question about detecting neutral hydrogen clouds using optical telescopes. Hmm, I remember that neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs light at a specific wavelength. Oh right, the Lyman alpha line is at about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, the question is about absorption, which I think happens in the Lyman series. So when a quasar's light passes through a cloud of hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs that light at 1216 Angstroms.

Now, the problem is about detecting these clouds with optical telescopes. Oh wait, optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere blocks it. So the light we receive from these clouds after being redshifted needs to fall into the optical range. That makes sense.

Redshift, z, relates the observed wavelength (λ_observed) to the rest wavelength (λ_rest). The formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z). So we want the observed wavelength to be in the optical range, which I think is about 400-700 nm. Let me convert that to Angstroms because the rest wavelength is in Angstroms. 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms.

The rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. So we have λ_obs >= 4000 Angstroms. Wait, no, because the observed wavelength needs to be longer than the rest wavelength because of redshift. So 1216 * (1 + z) >= 4000. Solve for z.

Let me compute that: 1 + z = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.286. So z ≈ 2.286. But wait, that's the minimum z where the wavelength just enters the optical. But the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected. So any z higher than this would also be detectable, but lower z would make the observed wavelength still in UV, which optical telescopes can't see.

Wait, but optical telescopes can't see below 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). So the Lyman alpha absorption would be at 4000 Angstroms or longer. So the minimum z is when 1216*(1+z) = 4000.

So z = (4000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 3.286 - 1 ≈ 2.286. So the redshift must be at least around 2.286. So the lower limit is about 2.286.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4 and option D is 1.9. So 2.286 is between 2 and 2.4. So the lower limit would be when z is about 2.28, which would mean the cloud must have a redshift higher than this to be detected.

Wait, but the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift of the object. So the object's redshift must be higher than that. So the minimum z is approximately 2.286. So any z greater than that would be detectable. So the lower limit is that value.

Looking at the options, the closest higher value is 2.4 (option C) and 1.9 is lower. So if the redshift is 2.4, that's above the required 2.28, so it's detectable. But wait, the question is about the lower limit. So the minimal z is about 2.286. So the object must have a redshift greater than this. So the lower limit is 2.286.

But the options don't have that exact number. So the options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the correct answer would be the smallest z value that is above 2.286. The options
