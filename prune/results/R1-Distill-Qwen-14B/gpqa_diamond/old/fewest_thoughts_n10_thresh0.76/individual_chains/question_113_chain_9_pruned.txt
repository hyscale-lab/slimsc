Okay, I need to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the question also mentions two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl group (C=O), which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest conjugation or another type of carbonyl. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a conjugated carbonyl group. Hmm.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. So maybe it's an ester with a double bond? Or perhaps a ketone with a double bond nearby.

Now, the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z =45. I'm trying to think what that could correspond to. The molecular ion peak isn't given, but the fragment at 45 could be a common fragment. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 could be something like (CH₂)₂O, since the molecular formula for that would be C₂H₄O. Wait, but let me calculate: for (CH₂)₂O, the formula is C₂H₄O. The molecular weight is (2*12) + (4*1) +16 = 24 +4 +16 =44. Hmm, that's 44, not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2O, which is 46 (12*2 + 3*2 +16 =24 +6 +16=46). No, that's not 45.

Wait, another approach. What about an ethyl group? No, 45 doesn't correspond to that. Or maybe a ketone fragment. Let me think about the possible molecular formula options. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Wait, possible molecular formulas.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O, the degree of unsaturation would be (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2= 2. So two rings or double bonds. If the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, that's one double bond. So maybe one ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

For C6H12O2: Degree of unsaturation is (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so that's one double bond. So maybe
