Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to parse through it step by step. The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength lambda. The problem is asking about the fraction of the maximum radiated power that's emitted at a specific angle theta, which is 30 degrees here. Also, it's asking what the possible form of the function f is, which describes the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function of lambda and theta.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit radiation, and the power emitted depends on the angle theta from the axis of oscillation. For a dipole radiator, for example, the radiation pattern is such that the power is maximum along the axis (theta=0) and decreases as we move towards the equatorial plane (theta=90 degrees). But wait, this is a spheroid—so maybe it's a dipole-like radiation?

Wait, the charge distribution is spheroid, so it's symmetric around the z-axis. So perhaps it's a dipole oscillating along the z-axis. Dipole radiation patterns are known to have a certain angular dependence.

The maximum power, A, is given. So the question is, what fraction of A is radiated at theta=30 degrees. Also, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f would be P/(dOmega), where dOmega is the solid angle element.

Wait, wait. The power per unit solid angle is the radiation intensity, usually denoted as I. And the total power is the integral of I over the entire solid angle.

I think the formula for the radiation intensity (I) for a dipole is proportional to (1 - cos^2(theta)), right? Because the maximum emission is along the axis, and it decreases as theta increases. Wait, no, wait. Or is it the opposite? Because a dipole's radiation pattern has maximum at theta=90 degrees—wait, no, wait no. Wait, actually, for an oscillating dipole, the radiation is maximum along the equatorial plane, which would be theta=90 degrees. Oh wait, that's correct. So for a dipole, the radiation intensity is proportional to (1 - 3 cos^2(theta) + 2 cos^4(theta)) or something like that. Wait, I might be mixing it up. Hmm.

Alternatively, the radiation pattern for a dipole is I proportional to sin^2(theta), which is maximum at theta=90 degrees. Wait, so for theta=0, the intensity is zero. That makes sense because the dipole's direction is along the z-axis, and the radiation is strongest perpendicular to it. So for a dipole, I is proportional to sin^2(theta), right?

Wait, but wait, that would mean that the intensity is maximum at theta=90 degrees. So the intensity as a function of theta would have maximum there. So if the maximum power is A, then A would be the integral of I over all solid angles. Wait, but I is the power per unit solid angle, so the total power
