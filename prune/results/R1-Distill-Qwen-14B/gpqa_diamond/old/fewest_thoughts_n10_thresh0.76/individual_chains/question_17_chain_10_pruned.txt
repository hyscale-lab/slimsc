Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, right, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (Kf) is a measure of the stability of the complex. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex. So, in this case, Kf is pretty large, which means the complex doesn't dissociate much. But wait, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions, I think.

Wait, the solution has a Ca-EDTA complex. So the complex is CaEDTA^2- maybe? Because EDTA is usually in the deprotonated form when it complexes with metals. So, the formula would be CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4− ion. 

So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But because the complex doesn't dissociate much (since Kf is high), the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be really low. I think I need to use the formation constant expression to find the free [Ca²+].

The formation constant Kf is calculated as [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). Wait, but in solution, the concentration of the complex is the sum of all the complexed forms, right? But in this case, they probably assume that the complex is fully formed because Kf is so large, so [CaEDTA²−] ≈ 0.02 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M.

The formation constant Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). But I don't know [EDTA^4−]. Hmm, but wait, if the complex is in solution, then the EDTA that's not part of the complex is [EDTA^4−] = (some value). But without knowing the initial concentration of EDTA, this seems tricky. Wait, but the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. Does that mean that EDTA is present in excess, and the only other thing is the complex? Or is the EDTA and Ca²+ coming from the complex?

Wait, maybe I need to think about the dissociation of the complex. Since Kf is very large, the reverse reaction (dissociation) is not favored. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4− would be very low.

But wait, the problem is about the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So when the Ca-EDTA complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But because Kf is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So, [Ca²+] would be very small.

So, let's model this. Let’s say that the complex dissociates to a small extent. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So,

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is tiny)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x (assuming that all EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex)

Wait, but wait. EDTA has multiple protons. At pH such that it's in the Y^4− form. Assuming pH is ideal, which probably means that the solution is at the EDTA's fourth dissociation pH, so EDTA is present as Y^4−. So, the concentration of EDTA^4− would be
