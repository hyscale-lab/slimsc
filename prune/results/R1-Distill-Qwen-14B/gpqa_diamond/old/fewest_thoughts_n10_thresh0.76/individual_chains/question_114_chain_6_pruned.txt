Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. Butan-2-one is a ketone, so reacting with NaCN should add the cyanide ion to the carbonyl group. But wait, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So maybe it's a condensation reaction or something else.

Wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN (not NaCN, but maybe under certain conditions), it forms a cyanohydrin. Oh wait, but NaCN in a protic solvent? Or maybe in the presence of an acid? Oh right, the formation of cyanohydrins from ketones usually uses a strong acid as a catalyst. So for the first reaction, reagent A might be an acid, like H3O+.

So for reaction 1, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN in acidic conditions (H3O+) to form a cyanohydrin. The product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would have a nitrile group (CN), a hydroxyl (OH), and a methyl group attached to the same carbon. So yeah, that makes sense. So A is probably H3O+.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is a butanoic acid with the same substituents. So the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group.

Wait, what's the typical way to convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid
