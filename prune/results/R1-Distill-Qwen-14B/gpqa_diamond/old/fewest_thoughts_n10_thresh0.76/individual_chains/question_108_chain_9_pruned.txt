Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They mention small values of m, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. Hmm, paramagnetic coupling term—wait, paramagnetism is related to the interaction of atomic electrons with an external magnetic field. Oh right, the Zeeman effect maybe? The Zeeman effect is when the energy levels of an atom split in a magnetic field.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is probably the Zeeman term. The transition energy ΔE is given for hydrogen. The question is comparing the magnitude of this coupling term with ΔE. The options are whether the coupling is much larger, much smaller, roughly equal, or greater than ΔE.

Wait, so first I need to calculate both terms. Let's start with the transition energy ΔE for hydrogen. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which is the Balmer series, right? Because 486 nm is the Balmer-alpha line (H-alpha), corresponding to a transition from n=3 to n=2.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Let me plug in the numbers. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1e-9 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9). Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 is 1.9878e-25. Divided by 486.1e-9 is the same as multiplied by 1e9/486.1. So 1e9 is 1e9, 486.1 is about 4.861e2. So 1e9 /4.861e2 ≈ 2.057e6. Multiply that by 1.9878e-25: 1.9878e-25 * 2.057e6 ≈ 4.08e-19 J.

Wait, but wait, the energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n^2. The transition from n=3 to n=2. Let me compute that. E3 is -13.6/(3)^2 = -13.6/9 ≈ -1.511 eV. E2 is -13.6/(2)^2 = -13.6/4 = -3.4 eV. The transition energy ΔE is E2 - E3 = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV. But since energy differences are positive, it's about 1.889 eV.

Wait, but I just calculated using E=hc/λ and got about 4.08e-19 J. Let me convert that to eV to compare. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 4.08e-19 /1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. Hmm, that's close but not exactly matching. Maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, the wavelength corresponds to the photon emitted during the transition, so ΔE is the energy difference. So perhaps I should compute both ways. Let me recalculate E=hc/λ.

λ = 486.1e-9 m.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

So E = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (486.1e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (486.1e-9) 

Wait, 486.1e-9 is 4.861e-7 meters. So E = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = ?

Let me compute 1.9878e-25 divided by 4.861e-7. That's 1.9878 / 4.861 ≈ 0.4088, and exponents: 1e-25 / 1e-7 =
