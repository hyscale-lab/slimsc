Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. Hmm, partition functions are about summing over all possible states, each weighted by their Boltzmann factor, right?

Wait, the system has three spins, each with two possible states, so the total number of states should be 2^3 = 8. So I need to consider all 8 possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.

But wait, maybe it's easier to categorize the states based on the number of aligned spins or something. Because calculating each one individually might take time, but maybe grouping them would help.

The energy is E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Let me compute each term for each possible state.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state. Because the energy depends on that sum.

Each S_i is either +1 or -1. So S_i * S_j can be +1 (if same) or -1 (if different). So each term in the sum S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 is either +1 or -1. So the sum could be 3 (all same: all +1 or all -1), 1 (two same, one different), or -1 (two different, one same), or -3 (all different).

Wait, let me think again. Each product S_i S_j can be +1 if S_i = S_j, or -1 if they're opposite. So for each pair, it's either +1 or -1. The sum is adding three such terms.

Let me consider all possible configurations:

Case 1: All spins are the same. Let's say all are +1. Then each product is +1, so the sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Case 2: Two spins are +1, one is -1. How many such states are there? Well, there are 3 choose 1 = 3 possibilities (the -1 could be in S1
