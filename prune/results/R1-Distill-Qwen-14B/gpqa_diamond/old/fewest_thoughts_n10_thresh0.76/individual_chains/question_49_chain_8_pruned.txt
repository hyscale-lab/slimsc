Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction where a pi bond moves to a sigma bond. The examples given are Cope and Claisen rearrangements, and these are usually thermodynamically favored.

The problem has three parts, each with a starting material and some conditions, and I need to figure out what products A, B, and C are from the given options. Let's tackle each one separately.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol with H+ and heat. The product is A.

Hmm, wait, I think this involves the formation of an oxonium ion or perhaps some kind of rearrangement. Let's see. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like (CH3O)2CHNH2. When it reacts with but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2CH2C(OH)CH2... No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH. Oh wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, butenol. Structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OH? No, wait. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, numbering. Let me think: but-3-en-2-ol would be the dienol? Wait, but but has four carbons. So position 3 is the double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3, but wait that can't be. Oh wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me draw it.

But-3-en-2-ol: the double bond starts at C3, so structure is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait but but has four carbons. So positions are 1, 2, 3,4. The double bond is between 3 and 4? No,
