Okay, so I have this genetics question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

So, the setup is about white lupine and resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. The experiment involves creating knockout mutants for three genes: G1, G2, G3. They also made double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. The results show the resistance levels of these mutants compared to the wild-type, which is 100%.

The data is:
- g1: 75% (so, 25% reduction)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (halved resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

Hmm, I remember that in genetics, when you have epistatic interactions, the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that could indicate epistasis.

So, looking at the data, the single mutants have varying resistances. The double mutants: g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance. And g1g3 has 10%. 

Wait, so g2g3 is 0%—same as g2. That probably means that in the presence of a non-functional G2, G3 doesn't contribute anything. So G3's function is downstream of G2, maybe.

Similarly, g1g2 is 0%—same as g2. So when G1 is knocked out along with G2, the phenotype is the same as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G1's function is downstream of G2, or maybe G1 is not doing anything unless G2 is active.

Alternatively, if G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1, then knocking out G2 would disable the pathway, making G1's knockout redundant. So that when both are knocked out, the phenotype is the same as when only G2 is knocked out. That makes sense.

Wait, another approach: think about epistatic relationships. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of A masks B when both are mutated. So, if the double mutant A B has the same phenotype as A, then A is epistatic to B.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance (same as g2). So the double mutant looks like g2. That suggests that g2 is epistatic to g1. Because the presence of g2's mutation masks the effect of g1. So G2 is epistatic to G1. So in the pathway, G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0% (same as g2). So again, G2 is epistatic to G3. So G2 is upstream of G3.

What about g1g3? Their resistance is 10%. That's lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, it's worse than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be in the same pathway and perhaps function redundantly. Or, they might be in parallel pathways contributing to resistance.

Wait, but the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So one of them is a transcription factor. Let's see.

In the single mutants, g2 has 0% resistance. That's a big drop. So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that's necessary for the resistance pathway. Because without G2, the plant can't resist the disease
