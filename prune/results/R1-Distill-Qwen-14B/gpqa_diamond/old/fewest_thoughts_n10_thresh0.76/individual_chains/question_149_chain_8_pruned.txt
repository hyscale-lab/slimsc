Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound mostly matches what's expected, except for two peaks that belong to the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Oh wait, the problem says that the integrals are roughly equal, so together they make sense for a single proton. But why two peaks?

They mention that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So it's not like those two peaks are from a coupling between protons. Spin-spin coupling would usually split a peak into multiple, but here it's two. Hmm.

Then the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule. So the same mass is present in both peaks, but why two?

Let me think about possible explanations. The options are A to D.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. That would mean the impurity is a different compound, probably with a different mass. But the LC-MS shows same mass, so A is probably not it.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in the NMR, the peaks would appear as the same because each proton environment is identical. But wait, in achiral conditions, do enantiomers split into separate peaks? Wait, no, because enantiomers are not separated under normal HPLC conditions unless it's a chiral column. If the LC is normal, two enantiomers would co-elute, so the same peak. But here, LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity. Oh wait, but the question says the LC-MS was done at elevated temperature. Maybe it's a racemic mixture, but would that cause two peaks? Normally, without a chiral column, you wouldn't separate them. So perhaps B is not the right choice.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not too familiar with this term. Double coupling might refer to some kind of coupling in the reaction steps. Like maybe a side reaction where two different bonds form, leading to a diastereomer or something. Or perhaps it's about the NMR splitting. Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. If it's double coupling, maybe the proton is coupling with two different sets of protons, but the problem states that spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So perhaps this is not likely.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would separate on a normal HPLC. Each would have a different NMR spectrum. So in the NMR, the same alpha proton would split into two due to different diastereomeric environments. But wait, in D, the mixture would have two diastereomers, each causing the alpha proton to shift a bit. So in the NMR
