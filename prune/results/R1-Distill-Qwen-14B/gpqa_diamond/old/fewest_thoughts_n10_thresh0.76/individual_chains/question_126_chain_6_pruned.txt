Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that an organic chemist performed two reactions. Reaction I is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II is treating pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. The question is about how many peaks the chemist would observe in each chromatogram.

First, I think I need to figure out what each reaction produces. Let's start with Reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the starting material is a ketone at position 3. The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. When LAH reduces this, the ketone group (C=O) at C3 becomes a CH2OH group because LAH usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, no, wait. Wait, LAH is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols, yes. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, the configurationâ€”since the starting material is (S) configuration at C5, how does the reduction affect it? Wait, the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, so the ketone is at C3. The methoxy is at C5. So when LAH reduces the ketone, that would form an alcohol at C3. The starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product will be a secondary alcohol with the same configuration as the ketone.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The ketone is at C3. So when reduced, the structure becomes CH2(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2
