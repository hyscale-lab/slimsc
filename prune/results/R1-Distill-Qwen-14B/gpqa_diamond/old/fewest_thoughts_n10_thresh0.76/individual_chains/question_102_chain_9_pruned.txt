Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetic constructs. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a scenario where a new ligand-receptor pair has been identified, and they're initially expressed in neural crest cells. The goal is to understand their developmental fate. 

The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets making a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices.

The setup for the experiment: they created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one construct. So here, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that the CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter, so it should drive expression of the ligand. The receptor is upstream of an IRES element. IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry sites, so they can drive expression of a second gene in a bicistronic construct, especially in situations where the first gene's expression is terminated.

Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop cassette with lox2272. I'm thinking that these stop cassettes are probably under the control of a lox site, which could be excised by Cre recombinase. So when Cre is present, the stops are removed, allowing the fusion proteins to be expressed.

They raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them in Western blot. After transfecting into primary astrocytes, they see signals proportional to actin loading. So the proteins are being expressed, at least in culture.

Then they bred mice homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre here is probably under the control of SOX10 regulatory elements, meaning it's active in neural crest cells. 

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for fluorescence. They expected to see green (from eGFP) but didn't. Why?

The options are A to D. Let's analyze each.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. If that's the case, maybe the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells. But the construct has both ligand and receptor on the same vector. If the Cre is active (from SOX10-Cre), both might be expressed. So why no eGFP? This might not directly explain the lack of fluorescence.

Option B: receptor-eGFP construct stuck in the Golgi. The eGFP is at the C-terminus, which for a transmembrane protein would be inside the cell. If it's stuck in the Golgi, the eGFP wouldn't be on the cell surface, so the antibody wouldn't detect it in Western? But the question says they tested expression in culture using Western blot and saw signals. If the construct was properly processed, the Western would detect the fusion proteins. If the eGFP is not being expressed, maybe because the stop cassette isn't removed, but that's another issue.

Option C: enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand. If the enhancer is missing, perhaps the receptor isn't expressed. But in the Western blot, they saw expression after transfection. Maybe the construct isn't properly expressed in the mice. But I'm not sure.

Option D: receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the receptor's ORF is not in frame with the eGFP, then the fusion protein might not be made correctly. But in the construct, the receptor is at the 3' end of the vector, with the eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor's ORF is in frame with eGFP? If not, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed as a fusion. But wait, the vector is bicistronic. The receptor is a separate ORF, right? Or is it a fusion?

Wait, the question says the ligand ORF is at the 5' fused to mCherry. The receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. So the receptor is a separate ORF, not a fusion with eGFP. So the eGFP is downstream of the receptor. Wait, no, the way it's written: the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP. Oh, so that would suggest that the receptor is a fusion with eGFP on its C-terminus. So the receptor is at the 3' end, and eGFP is added after it. So the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor? Or is it a separate ORF? Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear.

Wait, the construct is a bicistronic vector, meaning two ORFs. Each would have their own start codons. The ligand is at 5', then a stop with loxP. Then the receptor is at 3' with its own start, and then eGFP is after that, but with a stop in lox2272.

Wait, no. The way it's constructed is that the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop with loxP. Then the receptor's ORF is after the IRES element. So the ligand is driven by the CBA promoter, then the stop. The receptor is after the IRES, so perhaps the IRES allows for translation of the receptor. So when Cre is present, the loxP sites are removed, allowing the stop cassettes to be excised, allowing expression of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

Wait, but the stop is between ligand and mCherry. So if the loxP is removed,
