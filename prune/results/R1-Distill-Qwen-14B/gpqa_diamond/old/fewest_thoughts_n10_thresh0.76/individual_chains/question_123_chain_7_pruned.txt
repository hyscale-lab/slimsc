Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the setup is that a supernova occurred in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames. Oh wait, inertial frames are ones that are either stationary or moving at constant velocity relative to each other, so no acceleration involved here.

From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the ejecta's reference frame, the galaxy is approaching at that speed. But the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait a second, there's a time difference here because of relative motion. Since the frames are moving relative to each other, the time experienced in each frame isn't the same. But wait, no, time dilation comes into play when there's acceleration or gravity, but the problem says to ignore gravity and any rotation or revolution. Hmm, but wait, the problem says both are inertial frames, so they're moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. So, maybe there's no gravitational time dilation, but would there be any other time difference?

Wait, no, the problem doesn't mention any acceleration, so perhaps the time experienced in each frame is the same in terms of their own measurements. Or wait, no, that's not right. If you have two inertial frames moving relative to each other, each frame will see the other's clock as running slower. Oh, but wait, the problem says to ignore gravity and other motions, so maybe we're supposed to treat this as a simple relative velocity problem without worrying about relativity effects like time dilation.

Wait, the question is asking for the distance in the galaxy's frame. Let me think. So, from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards it. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them. So, perhaps we can model this using classical mechanics, assuming that the speeds are non-relativistic. But wait, 60,000 km/s is way more than the speed of light. Oh no, wait, that can't be right. Because the speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,0
