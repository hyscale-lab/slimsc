Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets in a system of five exoplanets. They're discovered via the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not too sure about that. Anyway, the main point is that these planets are in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a specific ratio.

The periods are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planets 1 through 5. So Planet_1 has the shortest orbital period, and Planet_5 the longest. The question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, which probably simplifies things.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * ( ( L_star / (16πσ) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - albedo) / (distance)^2 )^(1/4) )? Or wait, maybe it's more straightforward. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_eff * ( (1 - A) / (4 * D^2) )^(1/4), but I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I think the formula is T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ), but I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, perhaps I should go back.

The standard formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet is:

T = T_star * ( (1 - A)^(1/4) ) / sqrt( (2 L / (4πσ))^(1/4) ) * (D / R_star)^(-1/2) )

Wait, maybe that's not the easiest way. Another approach: the equilibrium temperature relates to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The key is that the planet's temperature depends on the square root of the ratio of the star's luminosity to the distance squared. Or wait, the formula is T = T_sun * ( (L / L_sun) / ( (D / AU)^2 ) )^(1/4 ), but I'm getting a bit muddled.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the inverse square law.
