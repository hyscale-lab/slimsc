Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, I think. Oh wait, the products are mu(+) and nu, but I'm not sure what kind of neutrino it is. Maybe it doesn't matter for this calculation.

The problem states that the Pi(+) is stationary at rest. So, the initial momentum is zero because the pion isn't moving. That probably means the products have to move in opposite directions so that their momenta cancel each other out. Momentum conservation, right?

Given data: the rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, so the pion is heavier than the muon. But the neutrino has a very small mass, almost negligible. So in the decay, the pion's rest mass energy is converted into the masses of the muon and the neutrino, plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I remember that for decay problems, especially when the parent particle is at rest, we can use conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to sum to zero.

Let me think about the energies. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Energy conservation: E_pion = E_mu + E_nu.

Momentum conservation: Since pion is at rest, the vectors add to zero. So, the magnitude of p_mu = p_nu. But neutrino is massless, I think. So, for neutrino, E_nu = p_nu * c, but since we're working in MeV units and c is set to 1, E_nu = p_nu.

But for the muon, its energy is given by E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c^2)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but again, since c=1, E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 ).

Wait, but in particle physics units, c is taken as 1, so energies and masses are in MeV, and momentum in MeV/c, but when multiplied by c, it's energy. Hmm, sometimes it's easier to set c=1, which simplifies equations.

So let's proceed with that. So, E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p_nu. Also, p_mu = p_nu, because of momentum conservation. Let's call this common momentum p.

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

But the total energy must equal the rest energy of the pion: 139.6 MeV.

So, sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, this is an equation in p. Let me let x = p.

So, sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

I think I can solve this for x. Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + 105.7² ) = 139.6 - x.

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So, x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

Cancel x² from both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute the squares.

105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let me compute that.

100^2 = 10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49=11172.49.

Wait, no, 105.7 squared is (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49 MeV².

Similarly, 139.6 squared: Let me compute that.

139^2 is 19321 (since 140^2=19600, so 140-1 gives 19600 - 2*140 +1=19600-280+1=19321). Then, 0.6^2=0.36. Then the cross term is 2*139*0.6= 2*83.4=166.8. So 139.6^2 = (139 +0.6)^2= 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 +0.6^2 = 19321 +166.8 +0.36= 19488.16 MeV².

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.

Rearranging,

2*139.6 x = 19488.16 -11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49: Let's subtract.

19488.16  
-11172.49  
= 8315.67.

So,

2*139.6 x =8315.67.

So x=8315.67/(2*139.6).

Let me compute denominator: 2*139.6=279.2.

x=8315.67 / 279.2. Let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 831.567 /27.92.

Hmm, 27.92 * 29.7 is approximately 831.567? Let me check:

27.92 *30=837.6, which is a bit higher. So, 29.7?

27.92 *29 = 810 (approx), 27.92 *0.7=19.544 → 810+19.544=829.544. So 27.92 *29.7= approx 829.5 + (27.92 *0.07)= 829.5 + 1.9544=831.4544. That's very close to 831.567. So x≈29.7.

So x ≈ 29.7 MeV/c, since p is in MeV/c units.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 279.2 * x =8315.67 → x=8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

But 279.2 *29 =8096.8.

But 279.2 * 29.7 = 279.2*(29 +0.7) =8096.8 + (279.2
