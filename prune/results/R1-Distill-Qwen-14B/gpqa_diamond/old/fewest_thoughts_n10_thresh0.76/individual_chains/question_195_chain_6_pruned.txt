Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the setup is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, is in a circular orbit, has a transit impact parameter of 0.2, and an orbital period of 3 days. The star has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. Now, there's a second planet with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, also in a circular orbit with the same orbital plane. The question is asking for the maximum orbital period of this second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that transits occur when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and occultations are when the planet passes behind the star, becoming hidden. So for both events to happen, the planet's orbital period must be such that its orbital speed allows it to both move in front and behind the star relative to us.

I think the key here is the concept of synodic periods. Wait, no, maybe it's about orbital speeds and whether the second planet is either faster or slower. Wait, to have both transit and occultation, the orbital period of the second planet must be such that it's either shorter or longer than the first planet's period but in a way that allows alignment for both events.

Wait, another thought: the star's position relative to the observer affects the transit impact parameter. The first planet's impact parameter is given as 0.2. Impact parameter is the distance (in units of the star's radius) that the planet's path misses the center of the star. For the planet to transit, its orbital plane must be aligned so that it passes in front of the star. The impact parameter being 0.2 suggests that the planet's orbit is such that it's not perfectly central but still passes in front.

But how does that affect the second planet? Well, both planets are in the same orbital plane, so they must have the same inclination relative to our line of sight. So their transits (if any) would happen along the same path.

Wait, but occultation is when the planet is behind the star. For that to happen, the planet must be on the same orbital plane, and the observer must see the planet pass behind the star. So, for both
