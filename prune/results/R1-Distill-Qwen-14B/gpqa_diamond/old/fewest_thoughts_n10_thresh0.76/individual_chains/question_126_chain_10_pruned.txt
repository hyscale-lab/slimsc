Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it again.

So, the chemist does two reactions. Reaction I is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II is treating pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4 and then acidic workup.

After both reactions are complete, the products are combined. Then they run them on two HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is how many peaks each will show. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. For NaBH4, I think it's a milder reducing agent. It usually can't reduce ketones as effectively as LAH? Or wait, no, NaBH4 can reduce ketones too. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, sodium borohydride can reduce ketones but maybe not esters or amides. Oh wait, LAH is stronger and can reduce esters, maybe even some other groups.

So, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Structure-wise, that's a six-carbon chain, with a ketone group on carbon 3. And a methoxy group on carbon 5. So, the structure is: CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3. Wait, let me count. Carbon 1: CH3-, carbon 2: CH2-, carbon 3: C=O, carbon 4: CH2-, carbon 5: OCH3 attached to the next CH2? Wait, perhaps I should draw this.

But regardless, when treated with LAH, the ketone group (C=O) would be reduced to an alcohol. So, the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, the reduction of a ketone with LAH would give a secondary alcohol. So, the configuration would change? Wait, the starting material is an S configuration. Wait, but after reduction, will it retain the configuration?

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the ketone is at C3, and the meth
