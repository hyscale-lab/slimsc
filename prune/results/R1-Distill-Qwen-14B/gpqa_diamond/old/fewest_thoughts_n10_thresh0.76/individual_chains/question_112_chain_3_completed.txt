Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question involves an electron state described by |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator and also the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix elements are given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. The options are A to D, each providing two probabilities and an average value.

Wait, first, I need to understand what the operator looks like. The matrix representation is zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we're dealing with spin-1/2 states, right?), the matrix would be:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Oh wait, the operator is such that when i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2, else zero. So that's the matrix. But wait, what does this operator represent? It looks familiar. Oh wait, this is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1 off-diagonal. So A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yes, A is (ħ/2) times that.

So the eigenstates of A would correspond to the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because σ_x flips the spin and its eigenstates are superpositions of up and down.

Wait, but wait. The problem says, "the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by A_ij..." So the operator in question has eigenvectors that are those states. So when we measure the operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, which for σ_x are ±1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the question is about measuring the state in the eigenstates of this operator. So the possible states are the eigenstates of A, which are the |+x> and |−x> states, right?

So the first part is to find the probabilities of measuring the electron in each of these eigenstates.

But wait, the given state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize this state. Because the problem says it's proportional, meaning that |alpha> is equal to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> multiplied by some normalization constant.

Let me compute the normalization. The normalization factor is 1/sqrt(|1+i|^2 + |2−i|^2).

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2−i|^2: (2)^2 + (−1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the denominator is sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Hmm, right. So now, to find the probability of measuring the state in each eigenstate of A (which are the |+x> and |−x> states), I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2)σ_x, the eigenstates are the same as σ_x's, so we can compute the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate.

Wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the probability of measuring +ħ/2 (the eigenvalue) is the square of the amplitude of |+x> in |alpha>, and similarly for |−x>.

So let me compute < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >.

First, compute < +x | alpha >.

< +x | is ( < up | + < down | ) / sqrt(2).

So,

< +x | alpha > = [ ( < up | + < down | ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

So that becomes [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Simplify numerator: (1+i)+(2−i) = 3.

So < +x | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait wait, no, wait. Wait, let me compute that more carefully.

Wait, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So when I take < up | alpha >, it's (1+i)/sqrt(7). Similarly, < down | alpha > is (2−i)/sqrt(7).

So < +x | alpha > is the sum of < up | alpha > and < down | alpha >, divided by sqrt(2):

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2−i)/sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)

= [ (3)/(sqrt(7)) ] / sqrt(2)

= 3/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

So the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14), and the probability is (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428... Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 0.64, which is close to that. But let me compute all steps again to make sure.

Wait, let me recompute < +x | alpha >.

< +x | is ( < up | + < down | ) / sqrt(2).

So,

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up |alpha> + < down |alpha> ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i + 2−i) / sqrt(7) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [3 / sqrt(7) ]

= 3/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) ) = 3/sqrt(14).

So yes, the square is 9/14 ≈0.642857. So that's about 0.64, which is option A's first value. But let's check for the other eigenstate.

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up |alpha> - < down |alpha> ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i - 2 + i) / sqrt(7) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(7) ]

So the amplitude is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is [ (-1 + 2i) ] * [ (-1 -2i) ] / (14).

Compute numerator: (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-2i) + (2i)(-1) + (2i)(-2i)

Wait, wait, perhaps better to compute the magnitude squared.

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (14) = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.6428) and 5/14 (≈0.3571). So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. So that would fit, but let's check the average value.

Wait, the average value is the expectation value of operator A. So <A> is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, <A> is (ħ/2) <sigma_x>.

And sigma_x's expectation value is <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Alternatively, because |alpha> is already normalized, <A> = (ħ/2) [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) multiplied by [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7}.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write |alpha> as |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2−i)/sqrt(7).

Then, <sigma_x> = <up| + <down| over sqrt(2) multiplied by the coefficients.

Wait, wait, no. The expectation value of σ_x is <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

σ_x is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], so it swaps |up> and |down>.

So:

< alpha | σ_x | alpha > = (a^* b + b^* a )

Because σ_x |alpha> swaps the components, so it's b |up> + a |down>. Then taking the inner product with alpha gives a^* b + b^* a.

So let's compute a and b:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7); a^* = (1-i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2-i)/sqrt(7); b^* = (2+i)/sqrt(7)

So a^* b = [ (1-i)(2-i) ] /7

= (2 -i -2i +i^2 ) /7

i squared is -1, so numerator is 2 -3i -1 =1−3i.

So a^* b = (1-3i)/7.

Similarly, b^* a = [ (2+i)(1+i) ] /7.

Multiply out: 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2 → 2+3i−1=1+3i.

So b^* a = (1+3i)/7.

Adding them together: (1−3i +1+3i)/7 = 2/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

So <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A has average hbar/7 and probabilities 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, the options are:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

B) 0.54, 0.46 and 3hbar/sqrt(7)

C) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar/sqrt(7)

D) 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar/sqrt(7)

So option A matches the probabilities and the average. Hmm, but wait, the probabilities I got were 9/14 (≈0.6428) and 5/14 (≈0.3571), which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, so that would be option A.

But wait, the options for the probabilities are given as two probabilities, and the average. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Why does option A have 0.64 and 0.36 for the probabilities? Because 9/14 is about 0.6428, which rounds to 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So that seems correct.

So the answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given state and operator systematically:

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The state is given as proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). Normalization involves calculating the normalization constant. The squared magnitudes of the coefficients are:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5
\]

Thus, the normalization factor is:

\[
\sqrt{|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2} = \sqrt{2 + 5} = \sqrt{7}
\]

The normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

This is equivalent to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are the spin states along the \( x \)-axis:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

These are the eigenstates of \( A \), with eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the overlap between \( |\alpha\rangle \) and these eigenstates.

#### For \( |+x\rangle \):
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow|\alpha \rangle + \langle \downarrow|\alpha \rangle \right)
\]

From \( |\alpha\rangle \), the coefficients are:
\[
\langle \uparrow|\alpha \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad \langle \downarrow|\alpha \rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}
\]

Adding these:
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probability is the square of the magnitude:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64
\]

#### For \( |-x\rangle \):
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow|\alpha \rangle - \langle \downarrow|\alpha \rangle \right)
\]

Subtracting the coefficients:
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probability is the square of the magnitude:
\[
P(-x) = \left| \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36
\]

### Step 4: Average value of the operator A
The expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha \rangle
\]

Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), we compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \). Using the normalized state \( |\alpha\rangle = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = a^* b + b^* a
\]

Calculating \( a^* b \) and \( b^* a \):
\[
a^* b = \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} = \frac{1-3i}{7}, \quad b^* a = \frac{(2+i)(1+i)}{7} = \frac{1+3i}{7}
\]

Adding these:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{1-3i}{7} + \frac{1+3i}{7} = \frac{2}{7}
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
