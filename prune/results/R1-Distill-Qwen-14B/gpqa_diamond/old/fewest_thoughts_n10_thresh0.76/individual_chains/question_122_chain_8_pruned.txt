Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is acetic acid. Let me think about each reaction step.

Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Oh right, I remember that this is a common acetylation reaction. Acetic acid has an -OH group, which can undergo acetylation. So when you treat it with acetic anhydride in the presence of a base like pyridine, the acid's -OH gets acetylated. Wait, but wait, acetic anhydride usually acetylates the oxygen. So acetic acid (CH3COOH) would form CH3CO-O-COCH3? No, wait. Wait, acetic anhydride is (AcO)2O. When you react it with an acid, like acetic acid, but wait, wait. Acetic acid has a carboxylic acid group. Oh wait, but in this case, maybe it's about the hydroxyl group. Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a carboxylic acid, not an alcohol, but in this case, perhaps... Oh wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, acetic acid is CH3COOH. When it reacts with acetic anhydride and Br2 with pyridine, perhaps it's an acetylation of the hydroxyl group. But wait, acetic acid's OH is in the carboxylic acid. Oh wait, but wait, if you have acetic acid reacting with acetic anhydride, maybe it's forming something else. Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more about the bromination.

Wait, another thought: pyridine is often used to absorb HBr in such reactions. So perhaps the reaction is a bromination. Oh, wait, when you brominate an acetic acid, wait, but I think that acetic acid is a good leaving group in certain reactions. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetylation followed by bromination.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about replacing the -OH with a bromide. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, acetic acid has a structure of CH3COOH. When it's treated with
