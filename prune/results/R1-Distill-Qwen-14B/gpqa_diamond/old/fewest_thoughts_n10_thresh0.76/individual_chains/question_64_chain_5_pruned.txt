Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about salts A and B that are heated, and then some reactions happen in tubes. I need to find the total number of atoms in the salts. Hmm.

Alright, let's start by breaking down the problem. So, they have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams. When heated, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through three tubes: first, Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. 

The results are:
- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60g.
- Tube 3 (copper) gains 0.80g of CuO.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2) doesn't change.
- 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temp and pressure (STP).

So, I think each tube is reacting with certain gases from the mixture. Let's think about what each reagent does.

In tube 1, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can react with water vapor. So, any water vapor in the gas would be absorbed here. The weight gain is 3.60g, which probably corresponds to the water that was absorbed. So, water would be H2O. The mass of H2O is 3.60g. Let me calculate the moles of water. Molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol, so 3.60g /18g/mol = 0.2 mol. So, 0.2 moles of H2O.

Then, tube 3 is red-hot copper. Cu is in a +2 oxidation state in CuO. The gas that reacts here is likely CO2 because CO2 reacts with copper at high temperatures to form CO and CuO. But wait, the mass gain is 0.80g. Let me check the molar masses. CuO is 80 g/mol, so 0.80g is 0.01 mol. So, 0.01 mol of CuO. But the reaction would be CO2 + Cu → CuO + CO. So, for every mole of CO2 consumed, one mole of CuO is formed. So, 0.01 mol of CO2 reacted here.

Wait, but CO might not react with Cu. So, the reaction is CO2 + Cu → CuO + CO. So, each CO2 produces one CuO. Therefore, the amount of CO2 is 0.01 mol.

Now, what about tube 2, Ca(OH)2 solution. Since it's a solution, if the gas is CO2, it would form a precipitate. But in this case, the weight didn't change. So, no reaction happened here. That implies that all CO2 was either absorbed elsewhere or didn't react here. Wait, but if CO2 passed through, it should react with Ca(OH)2. But since the weight didn't change, maybe all CO2 was already reacted in another tube or there was none. Hmm, perhaps the CO2 was already absorbed in tube 3, so when it comes to tube 2, there's nothing left to react. Alternatively, maybe the gas isn't CO2. Alternatively, perhaps the gas that's reacting in tube 3 isn't CO2. Let me think again.

Wait, when a gas passes through a solution of Ca(OH)2, if it's CO2, it would form CaCO3 precipitate, increasing the solution's weight. But in this case, the weight didn't change. So, no CO2 passed through here. But wait, the CO2 was consumed in tube 3. So, the CO2 went into tube 3, leading to a gain of 0.80g
