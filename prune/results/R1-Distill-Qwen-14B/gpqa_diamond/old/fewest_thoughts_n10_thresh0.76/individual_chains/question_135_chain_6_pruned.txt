Okay, so I have this physics problem about boson decay, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I should parse this. Wait, I think the interaction term is probably something like ψ† X ψ, which would imply that the boson X couples to fermions. So the X boson can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion pairs are possible when X decays.

Kinematic allowance depends on conservation laws and energy. For a boson (like X here) to decay into two fermions, the fermion masses must be less than half the mass of X. Because in a decay, each fermion would get some energy, but the rest mass must be less than the available energy. So for X → f f̄, each f must have mass m_f such that 2 m_f ≤ m_X. Otherwise, it's not possible.

So m_X is 6 GeV. Let me list the masses of all known fermions (leptons and quarks). 

Quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) and leptons (e, mu, tau, etc.):

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV (so ~0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): about 173 GeV

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.000511 GeV
- Muon (mu): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (tau): ~1.777 GeV

So for each fermion pair, check if 2*m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

Let me go through each option.

Option A) X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, e+ e−.

Check the masses:

b: 4.5 GeV. 2*4.5=9 GeV >6 GeV. So can't decay into b b̄. So Option A is out.

Option B) X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Check c: mass ~1.5 GeV. 2*1.5=3 GeV ≤6. Yes. s: 0.1 GeV, 2*0.1=0.2 ≤6. u and d same, even less. Tau: 1.777 GeV. 2*1.777 is about 3.554 GeV ≤6. So possible. Mu: 0.105 GeV. 2*0.105=0.21 ≤6. e: negligible, so yes. So B looks possible. But wait, what about the decay into c c̄? Oh yeah, because 3 GeV is allowed. So B includes c c̄, which is allowed.

But wait, wait. Let me think about the possible fermions. The interaction term in the Lagrangian is given as -λ f f̄ ψf (y)(υ + X) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the term. The term is probably something like X ψ ψ. So the X couples to fermions in a Yukawa-like interaction. So for each fermion species f, if there is a coupling λ_f, then X can decay into f f̄.

So the allowed decays are for all fermions f where the coupling is present. But the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the couplings, so perhaps I can assume that X couples to all fermions, but kinematics (mass) limits the possible decays.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply about what fermions have masses such that 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So back to the options.

Option B includes decay into c c̄, which is allowed (as 3 Ge
