Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that scattering amplitude has something to do with partial waves and phase shifts. 

Wait, right! The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the partial waves, each multiplied by some spherical harmonics and exponential terms. But I think for this problem, we're focusing on the imaginary part, so maybe there's a specific formula for that.

Let me think. Oh right, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 (along the incident direction) is related to the sum of the phase shifts. The formula I remember is something like:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * sum_{l} (2l + 1) * sin(δ_l)

Where k is the wave number, and δ_l are the phase shifts for each orbital angular momentum l. But wait, in the options, the answers are in femtometers (fm). Since k has units of 1/fm, that would make sense because the sine terms are dimensionless, so the sum multiplied by 1/(2k) would have units of fm.

Wait, but in the question, the phase shifts given are δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, δ4. So they correspond to l=0,1,2,3,4. So I need to sum (2l+1)*sin(δ_l) for each l from 0 to 4, then multiply by 1/(2k), and that's the imaginary part of f(0).

But what's the value of k? The electrons have energy 50 MeV. The energy is related to the momentum via E = (p²)/(2m). Wait, but electrons are relativistic? Hmm, 50 MeV is a lot for an electron. The rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, so this is definitely relativistic. So maybe I should use the relativistic expression for momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation k = (sqrt(2mE))/(ħ c) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Compton wavelength or something else. Alternatively, the wave number k can be approximated as sqrt(2mE)/ħ. Let me recheck: the kinetic energy E = (p²)/(2m), so p = sqrt(2mE). And since ħ is the reduced Planck constant, k = p/ħ.

Wait, but the units are a bit tricky. Let me calculate it step by step. 

First, the mass of the electron is m_e = 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg. The energy E is 50 MeV. Let me convert E to joules. 1 eV is 1.60218 × 10^-19 J, so 50 MeV is 50,000,000 eV = 5e7 eV. So E = 5e7 * 1.60218e-19 J = 8.0109e-12
