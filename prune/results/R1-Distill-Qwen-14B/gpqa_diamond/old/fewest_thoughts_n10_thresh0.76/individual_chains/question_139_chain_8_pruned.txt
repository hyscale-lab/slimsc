Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that two compounds A and B are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. After this treatment, two different diketones are produced. I need to find out which starting materials A and B are, from the given options.

Wait, wait. So the reagents used are HCl, NaNO2, and H2O. Hmm. I remember that nitrous acid (HNO2) is formed when NaNO2 is treated with HCl. Nitrous acid is commonly used in some substitution reactions, maybe in the formation of diazonium salts, but that's usually with amines. Wait, but in this case, the products are diketones. Diketones have two ketone groups. So I'm thinking, how do the reagents lead to the formation of diketones?

Oh! Maybe these reagents are involved in some kind of oxidation or cleavage reaction. Wait, another thought: I recall that when amines are treated with nitrous acid, especially primary aliphatic amines, they form diazonium salts, which can undergo various reactions like hydrolysis, especially under acidic conditions. But in this case, the products are diketones, which suggests some kind of cleavage of a diol or some structure that can form two ketones upon treatment.

Wait, wait a second. Oh! Maybe it's the Stephen reduction or something else
