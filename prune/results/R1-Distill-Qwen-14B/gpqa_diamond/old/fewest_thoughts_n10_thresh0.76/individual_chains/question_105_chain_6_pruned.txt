Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, the question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius but has some dark spots on one hemisphere. These spots have a filling factor of 20%, and their temperature is 1000K less than the star's effective temperature of 6000K. The scenario is that when the star rotates, these spots cause brightness variations, which can look like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The question is asking what the radius of such an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Wait, okay, so I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness, or the dip, is what we detect. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is delta F (the change in flux) is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

But in this problem, the star has spots. So, instead of a planet, the spots are causing the brightness variation. The filling factor is 20%, which I believe is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Since it's one hemisphere that's spotty, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, changing the observed brightness.

Wait, the spots are cooler than the rest of the star. So when a spot is facing us, the star appears a bit dimmer than when the spot is on the far side. But how does this affect the overall brightness variations? The total flux from the star would change as more or less of the spotted area is visible.

So the star's total brightness without spots is based on its effective temperature, Teff. The spots are at Teff - 1000 K, which is 5000 K. The area of each spot is the filling factor times the hemisphere area. Wait, the filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere is covered. But the hemisphere itself is half the star's surface. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) because a hemisphere is
