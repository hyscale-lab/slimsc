Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that a chemist did two reactions. Each reaction uses a different reducing agent. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The starting materials are compounds A and B, each reacted with a different reducing agent—LiBH4 and BH3 respectively.

Wait, wait. I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but they have different behaviors in certain situations. Oh right, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for reducing carbonyl groups. But BH3 is often used in more specialized reductions, like in the case of ketones or aldehydes. Oh, wait, no—LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and can reduce ketones, but BH3 might be used under different conditions, perhaps in a way that affects the stereochemistry more?

Wait, no, actually, BH3 is a reagent used in the formation of alkenes from epoxides. Or maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, BH3 is used in the hydroboration-oxidation reactions, where it adds to alkenes in a way that depends on the geometry. Oh wait, but in this case, maybe it's used for reducing ketones. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: the products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. They're ketones, but as diastereomers. Wait, no, the products have R and S configurations, so they're enantiomers. Because the product is a single enantiomer each time. So, the starting materials must have been something that, upon reduction, leads to different configurations.

Wait, the products are 4-ethyl tetrahydro pyran-2-one. Pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen. So, it's similar to a cyclic hemiacetal or something. Let me think: pyran-2-one is a lactone? Or maybe a cyclic ketone.

Wait, the starting materials are treated with LiBH4 and BH3 plus H+ to form these products. So, perhaps the starting materials
