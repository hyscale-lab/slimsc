Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The question asks about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved here, which are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, beta values are the stability constants for the complexes, right?

So first, let's get the problem clear. We have Co(II) ions and SCN- ions. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are [Co(SCN)_2]²+ or something similar. Wait, dithiocyanato means two SCN ligands, right? So the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ where n varies from 1 to 4, given the four beta values. So n=1,2,3,4.

I think the first step is to figure out the distribution of the complexes. The total cobalt is the sum of all the species: Co²+ plus all the complexes. So the sum [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) + [Co(SCN)_3]^(3+) + [Co(SCN)_4]^(4-) equals 0.01 M. But wait, wait, the charges might not matter for the distribution but the formation of the complexes does.

Stability constants (β) are given by the formula where each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So βn = [Co(SCN)_n^(charge)] / ([Co^(2+)] [SCN-]^n). Wait, for each step. Oh wait, no, stability constants are for each step. So the formation of each complex from the previous one. For example, β1 is for the first complex: Co²+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)²+ → β1 = [Co(SCN)]/([Co²+][SCN⁻]).

Wait, no, maybe I should think of the stepwise formation. So for the first complex, it's β1 = [Co(SCN)]/( [Co²+][SCN⁻] ). For the second, β2 is the formation of the second SCN⁻ adding to the first complex. So [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co(SCN)][SCN⁻]) ) = β2. And so on. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, but wait, I think the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of β1*β2*…*βn. So for each n, the formation constant K_n is the product up to βn. For example, K1=β1, K2=β1β2, K3=β
