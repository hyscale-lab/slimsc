Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's see what I can do.

The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember potentials in polar coordinates can sometimes be split into radial and angular parts, which might simplify the problem.

Wait, right! The particle is moving in two dimensions, so maybe I can separate the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts. That would help because then each part can be solved independently.

Let me recall the form of the potential. V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I can factor out r²: so it becomes r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ]. Hmm, that might be useful.

Wait, but in polar coordinates, the potential is a function of r and θ. So when solving the Schrödinger equation in 2D, the equation usually separates into radial and angular parts. The potential here has terms in r² and cos²θ. But wait, let me think about the form.

Wait, the potential can be written as V(r,θ) = (k/2) r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, that might not directly help, but perhaps I can think about whether this potential can be transformed into something that's separable, like a sum of functions each depending only on r or θ.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite the potential in terms of cos²θ. I remember that cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (k/2) r² [1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ)].

Wait, let me compute that correctly. Let me recast the original V(r,θ):

V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. 

Expressing cos²θ as (1 + cos2θ)/2:

= (1/2)kr² + (3/2) kr² * [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ]
= (1/2)kr² + (3/(4)) kr² (1 + cos2θ)
= (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ
= [ (1/2) + (3/4) ] kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ
= (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, so V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, but that doesn't immediately seem separable. Because it's r² multiplied by cos2θ. So perhaps I need to think about whether this potential can be rewritten in a way that allows the Schrödinger equation to separate into radial and angular parts.

Wait, perhaps the potential isn't spherically symmetric. I know that in spherical symmetry, the potential only depends on r, and the solutions are products of radial and angular parts. But here, there's a dependence on θ as well. So maybe the problem uses a different coordinate system or transformation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to simplify the problem. Let me think about the angular part. If the potential has a cos2θ term, maybe the solution's angular part relates to higher-order Bessel functions or something like that. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach: maybe I can express the potential as a sum of terms that depend on just r and terms that are functions of θ. But the way it's written, it's r² multiplied by a function of θ. So perhaps the potential can be written as V(r,θ) = A r² + B r² cos2θ, where A and B are constants.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to proceed with separating the Schrödinger equation in this case. Maybe I should look for a coordinate transformation or a change of variables.

Wait, another thought: the potential might be expressible in terms of a shifted angular coordinate. Like, if I make a substitution φ = 2θ, maybe that would simplify the cos2θ term. But I'm not sure if that would help with separation of variables.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of a different angular variable. Let me think about the structure of the potential. The cos²θ term suggests some kind of anharmonicity, but the presence of the r² term complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the potential can be rewritten as a sum of two parts: one that depends only on r and another that depends on θ. But in this case, both terms are multiplied by r², so it's not directly separable.

Wait a minute, another approach: perhaps using a substitution that combines r and θ. For example, if I define a new variable that includes both r and θ, but I'm not sure if that would be helpful.

Alternatively, maybe this potential can be expressed in terms of a shifted oscillator. Let me think about the form of the potential. The first term is (1/2)kr², which is the standard harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, perhaps the total potential can be thought of as a combination of radial and angular oscillators.

Wait, let's consider expanding the potential in terms of multiple variables. Suppose I use a coordinate system that includes both r and θ. But I'm not sure which would be the best way.

Wait, maybe I can separate the potential into a radial part and an angular part, but each multiplied by r². Let me see:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ
= r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

Hmm, but that doesn't seem to help in separation. Because both terms depend on θ.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the angular part as a perturbation. But that might not be the case here, since the potential could be exactly solvable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this potential as a sum of functions that are products of r^m and θ-dependent terms. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Since the potential is in two dimensions, maybe the problem can be transformed into a one-dimensional problem by considering the effective potential in some direction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the form of the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian for a particle in two dimensions would have the kinetic energy term in polar coordinates: (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r,θ). So,

H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. But perhaps I can factor out some terms or find a way to separate variables.

Wait, perhaps I can write the potential as V(r,θ) = [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ] r².

But this doesn't seem to directly help with separation. Because the [1 + 3 cos²θ] term complicates things.

Wait a minute. Let me think about the angular part. If I have a cos²θ dependence, perhaps the angular part of the wavefunction can be represented using higher-order Bessel functions or higher spherical harmonics, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution for the angular variable. Let me consider θ as a variable and see if the potential can be expressed in terms of θ and r in a way that allows separation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the potential can be rewritten as a sum of two terms, each depending on a different linear combination of r and θ. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can perform a change of variables, such as defining a new angular variable φ = 2θ, so that cos2θ becomes cosφ, which might make the potential terms more manageable.

But I'm not sure if that would help in separating the variables.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again about the form of the potential. It's given in polar coordinates, V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me think about whether this can be expressed as a product of functions, one depending on r and the other on θ.

No, because both terms are multiplied by r^2, so it's a sum of terms that are both multiplied by r^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out r², as I did earlier, and then see if the remaining θ-dependent part can be written as a function that allows the equation to separate.

Wait, perhaps I can think of this as a perturbation. The main term is (1/2)k r^2, which is the standard 2D harmonic oscillator. The other term is (3/2)k r^2 cos²θ, which is like a perturbation that depends on θ.

But wait, in 2D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E = (n_x + n_y +1) ℏω, where ω = sqrt(k/m). But this would be for the isotropic case, where the potential is symmetric.

In this problem, the potential isn't isotropic because of the cos²θ term. So the energy levels might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in a way that allows for separation of variables. Let me think about whether the potential can be rewritten as a function that depends on (r cosθ) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps using the substitution u = r cosθ. But I'm not sure if that would help. Alternatively, maybe using a shifted coordinate system.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the potential can be seen as a sum of two terms, each involving r and a multiple of cosθ. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of a new variable like x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, but that would take us into Cartesian coordinates, which may complicate things further.

Wait, maybe in Cartesian coordinates, the potential would be easier to handle. Let me try that.

In Cartesian coordinates, r = sqrt(x² + y²), and cosθ = x/r. So,

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

So, V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = (2k x² + k y²)/2.

Wait, that simplifies to V(x,y) = ( (2k) x² + k y² ) / 2.

Wait, so the potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x,y) = (2k x² + k y²)/2.

Which can be written as (k/2) x² + (k/2) y² + (k/2)(x²) because 2k x² /2 is k x².

Wait, let me compute again.

Wait, no, more accurately, V(r,θ) in Cartesian is:

(1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Which is (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + (3/2 k x²) = ( (1/2 + 3/2 ) k x² ) + (1/2 k y² )

= (2k x²) + (1/2 k y²).

So V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2) k y².

Wait, that's interesting. So the potential in x and y is 2k x² in the x-direction and (1/2)k y^2 in the y-direction. So it's a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Let me check again.

Wait, the original potential is (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Expressed in Cartesian, r² = x² + y². cosθ = x/r. So,

V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x² + y²) (x²)/(x² + y²)
= (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

So, yes, V = (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + (3/2 k x²) = ( (1/2 + 3/2) k x² ) + (1/2 k y²) ) = (2k x^2) + (1/2 k y^2).

So, the potential is V(x) = 2k x², V(y) = (1/2)k y².

Ah! So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is separable into x and y parts. So the problem becomes a simple two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, but with different frequencies in x and y directions.

Wait, that makes it much simpler. So each direction (x and y) is a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different spring constants.

So the energy for each direction is quantized separately. For the x-direction, the energy is (2n_x +1/2) ℏ ω_x, where ω_x = sqrt( (2k)/m ), because the potential is (1/2)(2k) x². Similarly, for y-direction, the energy is (2n_y +1/2) ℏ ω_y, with ω_y = sqrt( ( (1/2)k ) / m ) = sqrt(k/(2m)).

Wait, let's compute the frequencies. For the x-direction, the potential is (2k) x^2 /2, which is (k x²). So the spring constant is k_x = 2k.

Wait, no, wait. The standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω² x². So if V(x) = (1/2) m ω_x^2 x², then ω_x = sqrt( (k_x)/m ), where k_x is the spring constant. So for the x-direction:

V(x) = 2k x². So that's (1/2) m ω_x^2 x² = 2k x^2. So,

(1/2) m ω_x^2 = 2k → ω_x^2 = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for the y-direction, V(y) = (1/2)k y^2. So,

(1/2) m ω_y^2 = (1/2)k → m ω_y^2 = k → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy is the sum of the energies from each direction.

So the energy for x is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x +1) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, wait a second. Because for a 1D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E = (n + 1/2) ℏ ω.

So, for the x-direction, ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), so E_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x +1) * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, the y-direction has ω_y = sqrt(k/m), so E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy is E_x + E_y = (2n_x +1) ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, let me compute that:

E_total = [ (2n_x +1) + (n_y + 1/2) ) ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Simplify the terms inside the brackets: 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So, E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, but let me check the options.

Option C is E = (2n_x + n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Yes, that's exactly what I got.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). To solve this, the potential is analyzed and rewritten in Cartesian coordinates by expressing \( r \) and \( \cos\theta \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \). This transformation reveals that the potential becomes separable:

\[
V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This shows that the system is a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator, where the \( x \)-direction has a spring constant \( 2k \) and the \( y \)-direction has a spring constant \( k \). The energy levels for each direction are quantized as follows:

- For the \( x \)-direction: \( E_x = (2n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), where \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).
- For the \( y \)-direction: \( E_y = (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), where \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

The total energy is the sum of the contributions from both directions:

\[
E = E_x + E_y = (2n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).**

Answer: C
