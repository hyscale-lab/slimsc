Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given state. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me try to work through this.

So the setup: there's an operator P with components Px, Py, Pz. The matrix forms of these operators are given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, uncertainty in Pz. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩², where A is the operator in question. So I need to compute ⟨Pz²⟩ and ⟨Pz⟩, then subtract and take the square root.

First, I should write down the matrix for Pz. Let me look back. Oh right, Pz's matrix is diag(ħ, 0, -ħ). Its diagonal because the basis is the eigenvectors of Pz. So, the state is an eigenstate of Px, but to find uncertainty in Pz, I need to compute expectation values in the given state.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector. Let me write it out:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

I can check if this is a normalized state. Let's compute the sum of squares: (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2. That's 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 =1. Oh, so it's normalized. Good.

Now, to find ⟨Pz⟩, we compute ψ† Pz ψ. Similarly, ⟨Pz²⟩ is ψ† Pz² ψ. Since Pz is diagonal, Pz² is just each element squared.

Let me compute ⟨Pz⟩ first.

Pz is diagonal, so ψ† Pz ψ is sum over each component ψ_i * Pz_ii * ψ_i.

So:

First component: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = ħ * (1/4)
Second component: (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) = 0
Third component: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = ħ * (1/4) but wait, wait... Wait, hold on.

Wait wait, the third component is (-1/2) times (-ħ) times (-1/2). Let me compute that:

(-1/2) * (-ħ) = ħ/2, then multiplied by (-1/2) again. So (ħ/2) * (-1/2) = - ħ/4.

Wait, but wait no. The Pz matrix is [ [ħ, 0, 0], [0,0,0], [0,0,-ħ] ].

So the third component of ψ is -1/2. So Pz for third component is -ħ.

So contribution is (ψ_3)^2 * (-ħ). Since ψ_3 is -1/2, squared is 1/4. So 1/4 * (-ħ) = - ħ/4.

Wait no, wait. Wait, ⟨Pz⟩ is ψ† Pz ψ. Since Pz is diagonal, each term is ψ_i * Pz_ii * ψ_i^* because ψ is a column vector, ψ† is the conjugate transpose. But in this case, all the components are real, so ψ_i^* = ψ_i.

So ψ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So the first term: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ.

Second term: (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) = 0.

Third term: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (-ħ/4).

Wait, wait a second. So the third term is (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = [ (1/2) * ħ ] * (1/2) ? No, wait:

Wait, no. Let me calculate it step by step.

Pz_33 is -ħ, and ψ_3 is -1/2.

So ψ_3 * Pz_33 * ψ_3 = (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) 

= (1/2 * ħ) ) * (-1/2) 

= ħ/2 * (-1/2) 

= - ħ/4.

So now, ⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0.

Hmm, okay. So the expectation value of Pz is zero.

Now, what about ⟨Pz²⟩?

Since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared is each element squared.

So Pz² is diag( (ħ)^2 , 0, (-ħ)^2 ) = diag( ħ², 0, ħ² ).

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is sum of (ψ_i^2) * Pz_ii².

Wait, again, it's ψ† Pz² ψ.

So each term is ψ_i * Pz_ii^2 * ψ_i.

First term: (-1/2)² * ħ² = (1/4) * ħ².

Second term: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0.

Third term: (-1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4) * ħ².

So ⟨Pz²⟩ = (1/4 + 0 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So, now the uncertainty is sqrt( ⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩² ). Since ⟨Pz⟩ is zero, this becomes sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = sqrt(1/2) * ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait a minute, looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches my calculation.

So the uncertainty ΔPz is ħ divided by sqrt(2). So the correct answer is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal:  
\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state of the system is given as:  
\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Since $P_z$ is diagonal, $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:  
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \sum_{i} \psi_i P_z^{ii} \psi_i.
\]
- First term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \hbar \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{4}$.
- Second term: $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \cdot 0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 0$.
- Third term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot (-\hbar) \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{\hbar}{4}$.

Adding these contributions:  
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is obtained by squaring the diagonal elements of $P_z$:  
\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Using the same state $\psi$, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is computed as:  
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \sum_{i} \psi_i^2 P_z^{ii^2}.
\]
- First term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.
- Second term: $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 = 0$.
- Third term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Adding these contributions:  
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is given by:  
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]
Substituting the values:  
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$.
