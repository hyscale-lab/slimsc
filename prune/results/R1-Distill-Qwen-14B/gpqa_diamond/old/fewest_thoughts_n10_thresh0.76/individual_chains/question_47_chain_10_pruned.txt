Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's see. The options are all organic compounds, mostly aromatic with substituents.

First, looking at the IR data. The strong bands at around 3420 and 3325 cm^-1 suggest N-H or O-H stretching. The medium to strong intensity might mean it's either N-H (like an amide or amine) or maybe O-H like a carboxylic acid. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see any carboxylic acids. The other big IR peak is at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong band. That's in the range for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide. Since the molecular formula has two oxygen atoms, maybe an ester or amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: That's likely a CH3 group connected to something electronegative, maybe an ethyl group, like OCH2CH3. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so maybe the ethyl is split into triplet for the CH3 and a quartet for the OCH2.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Broad singlet for 2H could be something like an amide's NH2, but wait, the IR had a strong peak at 3420 which might be N-H. Or maybe it's an OCH2 group, but the triplet at 1.20 would fit with that. Alternatively, maybe the oxygenated CH2 in an ester.

Wait, in the options, some have ethoxy groups. Like option A is 3-ethoxybenzamide, which would have an ethoxy group.

The quartet at 4.5 ppm, 2H: Quartet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. So maybe it's a CH2 next to another CH2. Like in an ester, maybe OCH2CH2O... No, wait, or perhaps an amide's structure. Alternatively, think about OCH2 connected to something else.

The aromatic region:
- 7.0 ppm, doublet (2H)
- 8.0 ppm, doublet (2H)
So, that's a symmetrical substitution on the benzene ring. Since it's two doublets each integrating to 2H, it's likely a para-substituted benzene. So, in the benzene ring, the substituents are in para positions. So, for example, one substituent is in position 4 and another in position 1? Wait, no, para would be positions 1 and 3 or 2 and 4? Wait, wait, the doublets suggest coupling with one neighboring proton each. So perhaps meta? Wait, no, if it's a doublet of two protons each, maybe it's a para substitution with two substituents each having two protons that are adjacent. Hmm, maybe two substituents on the benzene ring, each having two protons?

Wait, no. Let me think. For a para-substituted benzene, the protons on the ring would each be ortho to the substituent. So if there's an electron-withdrawing group like a nitro or carbonyl, the ring protons would split into two doublets. Like in a para-substituted benzamide, the two sets of protons would each be a doublet.

Wait, looking at the options: option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would have a benzoate ester group. So the structure would be O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached at the para position to an amino group.

Wait, but the NMR shows 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet for 2H. If that's the OCH2CH3, then the triplet at 1.20 would make sense. But in option D, the ester would be OCH2CH3, so the OCH2 would be around 4.1 or 4.2 ppm, maybe a quartet. Hmm, but in the NMR data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm for 2H. So perhaps that's the OCH2 from the ester.

Wait, the quartet at 4.5 ppm for 2H could be the -OCH2COO- group. For example, in an ester like ethyl something. Let me think: for an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 group would have the CH2 at around 4.0-4.2 ppm, as a quartet, and the CH3 at ~1.3 ppm as triplet.

But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, and the triplet at 1.20. So perhaps it's not the ethyl ester's CH2. Maybe another group. Let me think about other possibilities.

Looking at the NMR again:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl CH3
4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): maybe an OCH2 or NH2 group
4.5 ppm (q, 2H): perhaps another CH2 group, maybe adjacent to an O or N.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an amide. For example, benzamide derivatives. The amide group would have a CONH2. But the IR shows a strong band around 3420, which could be N-H stretching. So, if it's an amide, the N-H would
