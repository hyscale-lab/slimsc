Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm a bit confused about how all these groups are arranged.

First, the question says that the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde group attached to the benzene), and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So, meta positions are every third carbon apart. Hmm, but wait, wait a minute. The benzene ring is six-membered, so if three groups are meta to each other, they'd form a sort of triangle. But I think I need to fix the numbering based on the substituents.

Wait, the question goes on to describe more substituents. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Oh, and the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. That's a bit to unpack.

Let me try to visualize the benzene ring. I'll imagine the ring with substituents at various positions. Let me assign numbers 1 through 6 to the ring positions. Let's start by considering the carboxylic acid as the first group. Let's place the carboxylic acid at position 1. Then, the substituents attached ortho to it (positions 2 and 6) would be the hydroxyl and the dimethyl amino group. But wait, the question says both are ortho to the carboxylic acid, so they must be in positions 2 and 6. But the problem says the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano group are meta to each other. So, the other two substituents (the aldehyde and nitrile) must be in positions that are meta relative to each other.

Wait, but the ring has three substituents that are meta to each other. So, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the other two (aldehyde and nitrile) must be at positions 3 and 5, because those are meta to each other and also meta to position 1. Wait no, because position
