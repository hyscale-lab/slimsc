Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

So, two stars are being studied. Star 1 has iron atoms in the photosphere that are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to Star 2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which I think means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. The question is about finding the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2.

Hmm, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, in LTE, the population of energy levels depends on temperature. The formula is probably something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels.

The Boltzmann factor is (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are energies, k is Boltzmann constant, T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference delta E is given. Let's call E_i the higher energy level, and E_j the lower. So, the population ratio n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -delta E/(k T) ).

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in Star 1 are twice as excited. So I think that means the population of the higher energy level in Star 1 is twice that in Star 2. Or maybe I should consider the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, the question says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, for a specific energy level, n1 is twice n2. Or maybe it's the excitation in that level, so the population is twice. Assuming g is same for both stars? Because same element, same energy level probably same g.

So the ratio would be (n1/n2) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T1) ) / exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T2) ) )

Wait, let me think. The population for each star would be n_i = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -delta E/(k T) ). But if the energy levels are the same in both stars, then g
