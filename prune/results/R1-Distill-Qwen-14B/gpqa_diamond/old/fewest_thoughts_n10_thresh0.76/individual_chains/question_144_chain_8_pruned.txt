Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. Let me think about the steps I need to take to solve this.

First, the problem gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so the mean decay distance is going to be a very small number, which makes sense because particles decay quickly.

Wait, the mean decay distance is the average distance the meson travels before decaying. I think the formula for that involves the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, the mean lifetime (tau) is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. I remember that the natural linewidth is given by Γ = ħ / tau. So tau is ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, I should double-check. The relation between the decay width and the lifetime is Γ = ħ * (1/tau), so tau = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that's correct.

Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance (d) would be the speed (v) multiplied by the lifetime (tau). So d = v * tau.

But wait, the meson is moving relativistically, right? Because its energy is much higher than its mass. So I need to calculate its velocity using relativistic
