Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution here. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium, which the question states is the case (LTE, Local Thermal Equilibrium).

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), right? Where n_i and n_j are the number densities of the two energy levels, g is the statistical weights, E is the energy, and T is the temperature. Since the question is about the same energy levels, I think the statistical weights might be the same, or maybe we can ignore them because they're the same for both stars. Let me check: no, wait, the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given. So E_i is higher than E_j by the given delta E.

In this problem, the excitation is twice as high for star_1 as star_2. So, n1/n2 = 2. Wait, no, wait. The problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, n1/n2 = 2. Or is it the ratio of excitation for the same level in each star? Hmm. Wait, perhaps the question is saying that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or maybe the excitation potential? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me rephrase. The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, perhaps the population of that energy level is higher. Let me model this.

Let me denote for star_1, the number is n1, and star_2, it's n2. The ratio is n1/n2=2.

But wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. So, delta E = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J.

So for each star, the ratio of populations is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1: n1 / n2 = exp( -delta E/(k T_1) ) / exp( -delta E/(k T_2) )? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, no. Each star has its own temperature. The Boltzmann equation for each star would have their respective temperatures. So for star_1, the ratio (n1_high)/(n1_low) is proportional to exp( -delta E/(k T_1) ), and similarly for star_2, (n2_high)/(n2_low) is proportional to exp( -delta E/(k T_2) ).

But the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, but excitation in the same energy level? Maybe the ratio of the number in that level to another level is given.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the number of atoms in a specific excited energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let's say that in star_1, level i has n1, and in star_2, the same level has n2. So n1 = 2 n2.

But each star's level's population depends on their own temperature. So for each star, (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), assuming same statistical weight g_i = g_j, which I think is a fair assumption here since it's the same element and same energy levels.

Wait, so for star_1, n1/n_ground = exp( -delta E / (k T1) )

For star_2, n2/n_ground = exp( -delta E / (k T2) )

Wait, but wait, perhaps the 'ground' level is the same for both stars, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of n1 to n2 is 2. So, n1/n2 = 2.

But each n is given by their respective Boltzmann factors. So n1 = (something) * exp( -delta E/(k T1) )

n2 = (something) * exp( -delta E/(k T2) )

Assuming that the same level is being considered, the 'something' might be the same for both stars, but perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio n1/n2 is 2, so (exp(-delta E/(k T1))) / (exp(-delta E/(k T2))) ) = 2.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the ratio of (n_i)/(n_j) for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. Wait, no, the question states that the number in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1 = 2 n2. So the ratio (n1)/(n2) = 2.

But n1 is proportional to exp(-delta E/(k T1)), and n2 proportional to exp(-delta E/(k T2)).

So (n1)/(n2) = [exp(-delta E/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-delta E/(k T2)) ]

Which simplifies to exp( delta E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

So,

2 = exp( delta E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking natural log of both sides,

ln 2 = (delta E)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, delta E is 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So delta E is k * (some temperature) * something.

Wait, let's compute delta E/(k).

delta E = 1.38e-23 J

k = 1.38e-23 J/K, so delta E = k * (1 K) * 1, so delta E/(k) = 1 K.

So,

ln 2 = (1 K) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but wait, I have (1/T2) - (1/T1) in the equation.

So,

ln2 = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm, let's rearrange that.

We can write this as:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2

Or,

( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln 2

Because,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

So,

ln2 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, so we can write this as:

ln2 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Alternatively, ln2 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Yes, that's exactly what we have.

Option D is option D.

Wait, but wait, let me check the options again.

Option D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2) ]

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the population of energy levels in thermal equilibrium, and the ratio of the number of excited atoms in a specific energy level for the two stars is given as 2 (i.e., star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2). The energy difference between the considered energy levels is provided as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).

Using the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) \bigg/ \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right),
\]

where \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) are the populations of the excited energy level in star_1 and star_2, respectively, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), and \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are the effective temperatures of the two stars. Simplifying the ratio:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \), we have:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rearranging this:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options can be ruled out as they do not align with the derived relationship.
