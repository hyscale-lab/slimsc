Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and it's a bit complex, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So, Y is some element that forms multiple compounds with F. The compounds are labeled A1, A2, A3, A4, A5. 

The first part says that A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing usually means it's a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is a noble gas, so it doesn't react easily. So A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, when Y reacts with fluorine, it forms A3. So A3 is probably YF_x, like a fluoride of Y.

Then, by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. So, when Y is added to A4's solution, it produces A5. Also, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So A5 is probably YF_x or some other compound that breaks down when in water.

The question is to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me think about the possible elements Y that form multiple fluorides. The question mentions five binary compounds. Well, I remember that elements like chlorine, oxygen, nitrogen, and others can form multiple fluorides. But wait, chlorine forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7? Wait no, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like iodine? Or maybe another element.

Wait, another thought: Xenon is a noble gas, and it can form compounds under certain conditions. So maybe Y is an element that forms compounds with F and can also react with xenon. Another possibility is fluorine itself, but the compounds are binary with fluorine, so Y is the other component.

Wait, the problem says binary compounds of fluorine with Y. So each compound has Y and F. So possible candidates for Y could be elements in the halogen family or perhaps something else.

Wait, let's think about the reactions. A1 is a bright red substance. Hmm, I recall that some fluorides are colored. For example, KClO3 is a solid that's a strong oxidizer, but I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, maybe A1 is ClF3? But I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let's try to consider the information given.

A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So the decomposition reaction could be something like A1 → A2 + F2. So A1 has more fluorine atoms than A2. Or maybe it's the reverse? Wait, but when a compound decomposes into another compound and F2, perhaps F2 is being released. So if A1 is a higher fluoride than A2.

For example, let's say A
