Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reactions. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, right? The nucleophile is usually a enolate ion. So, the setup is that we have three different reactions (A, B, C) and their products, and we need to choose the correct options from A to D.

Let me look at each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) and ethanol. So, what's going on here?

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile for the Michael reaction because it's a dienolate. Wait, no, wait. Dimethyl malonate is a diester, and under basic conditions like NaOEt, it should form an enolate. The enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. 

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is between the CH2 and the carbonyl. So, when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks, it should add to the beta position.

Let me draw this out in my mind. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups on a central carbon. When deprotonated at the alpha position (the central carbon), it becomes a strong nucleophile, the enolate. This would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So, the acrylate is CH2=C-(p-tolyl)COOCH3. The enolate of malonate will attack the CH2 part, adding to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So the product would be a new carbon-carbon bond between the malonate enolate and the acrylate.

Wait, but wait. The product after the Michael addition would then
