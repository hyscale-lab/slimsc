Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so that the researchers should observe that one. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully to get all the details.

Alright, so there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and their orbital periods. They have the same mass, so that's a given. But their orbital periods are differentâ€”Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, then Planet_1's is P/3.

Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies some calculations because eccentricity isn't a factor here. The host stars have the same radii, but different masses. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of the one hosting Planet_2. Hmm, same radius but higher mass for Planet_1's star. 

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. But since RV method has already detected them, their orbits must be edge-on enough for RV signals, but does that translate to higher transit probability?

Wait, no. RV detects the Doppler shift based on the planet's mass and the velocity of the star. The required inclination for RV detection is lower than that needed for transits. So even if a planet is detected via RV, it doesn't necessarily have a high chance of transiting because the inclination might not be exactly 90 degrees. But in this problem, are they assuming that the planets have the same inclination? Or does the transit probability depend on other factors?

Wait, no. The transit probability is calculated regardless of whether the planet is detected via RV. Because the RV method can detect planets in a range of inclinations, but the transit method requires a specific alignment. So the probability of transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

Wait, but wait. The transit probability (P) is given by the formula: P = (R_p / a) / (1 + R_p/a)^2, but wait, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Or is it the probability that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough such that it passes
