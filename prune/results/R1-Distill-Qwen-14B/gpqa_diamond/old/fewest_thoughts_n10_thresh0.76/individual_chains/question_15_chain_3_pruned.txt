Okay, so I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit based on the given information. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question says that both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. They were detected via the RV method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. The key factors here are the orbital period and the host star's characteristics.

Planets:
- Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is P1 = P2 / 3.

Host Stars:
- The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So, M1 = 2 * M2.
- Both host stars have the same radius, R1 = R2.

Wait, stars with higher mass usually have larger radii, but in this case, they have the same radius. That might be because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Oh right, evolved stars sometimes expand, so even if their mass is lower, their radius might be the same or larger.

Transit probability is something I remember depends on the orbital distance and the size of the star. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on, and the planet is more likely to pass in front of the star from our perspective. But how do the orbital period and star properties affect the probability?

I think the transit probability (p) is given by the formula p ≈ (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by some function of the orbital distance and star's radius. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_p / a)², where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. 

Wait, another approach: The transit probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital plane's inclination that allows transit. But that's more about the geometric probability. The geometric probability (p_geo) is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. Wait, no, perhaps it's more precise to say that p_geo ≈ (R_p / a)², but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another formula I recall is p = (R_star / a) * (R_p / R_star), which simplifies to (R_p / a). But I'm a bit confused about the exact expression.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about the probability in terms of the planet's orbital distance and the star's size. The more tightly a planet orbits its star, the higher the chance that it will pass in front of the star from our point of view, assuming other factors are equal. Because a closer planet has a shorter orbital period, so maybe that's a clue.

But wait, the orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planets have the same mass (Earth-like), and M is the star's mass, which is 2M for Planet_1 and M for Planet_2.

So, for each planet, a is the semi-major axis, which is what we need for the transit probability.

So let's model this. For Kepler's third law, P² is proportional to a³/(M_star). So, for Planet_1,
