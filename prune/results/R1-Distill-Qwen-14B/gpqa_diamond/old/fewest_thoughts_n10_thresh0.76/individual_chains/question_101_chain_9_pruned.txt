Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction using 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. We need to find out which reagent (A) and catalyst (B) were used.

Hmm. So the reaction conditions are acid-catalyzed, so probably an acid like TsOH or acetic acid is the catalyst. The options give choices between these.

I remember that when amines react under certain conditions with carbonyl compounds, they can undergo various reactions. Wait, but the product here looks like it's an annulation or a ring expansion. Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me draw the structure in my mind.

3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring, pyrrolidine, with a methyl group on the third carbon. The product has a cyclohexylidene group attached. Cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexene group, like a cyclohexene ring as a substituent. Specifically, the substituent is attached as a methylene group connected to the cyclohexene ring. So it's like a cyclohexene (a six-membered ring with a double bond) connected via a methylene (-CH2-) group to the pyrrolidine ring.

Wait, but how does that happen from 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A?

I think this might involve a reaction where the amine acts as a nucleophile. Another thought is that this could be a Gabriel synthesis or some kind of alkylation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldol-like condensation, but that usually involves aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, the product structure suggests that a new ring is formed. The starting material is a pyrrolidine, which is a five-membered amine. The product has a six-membered ring attached via a methylene group. So perhaps this is an example of a ring-forming reaction, like a Robinson annulation, but I'm
