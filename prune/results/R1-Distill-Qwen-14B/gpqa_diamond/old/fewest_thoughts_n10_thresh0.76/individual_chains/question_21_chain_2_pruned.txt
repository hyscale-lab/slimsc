Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomersâ€”specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But more importantly, it's giving me a scenario where I have to determine which compounds don't show tautomerism and which show optical isomerism. Hmm, okay. 

The problem has two parts: part A and part B. 

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism?

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism?

I need to figure out each part separately.

Starting with part A. I remember that tautomerism is when a compound can convert from one structure to another by the shifting of a hydrogen and the reorganization of double bonds. A classic example is between keto and enol forms. So, for a compound to show tautomerism, it should have adjacent double bonds and hydrogens that can move.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a derivative of benzene with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho. But regardless, it's a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. So, does it have any double bonds adjacent to the carbonyl groups? Well, the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, the carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons in the ring?

Wait, isn't benzoquinone a di-ketone in a benzene ring? So, the ring is fully conjugated. So, the structure is like O=C6H4=C=O or something like that. Wait, no. Benzoquinone is more like two ketone groups on adjacent carbons in a six-membered ring. So, the structure would have two carbonyl groups attached to the benzene ring, but they are in positions that are adjacent, making it a conjugated system.

Wait, but can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? I think tautomerism requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group because the hydrogen moves, and the double bond shifts. In
