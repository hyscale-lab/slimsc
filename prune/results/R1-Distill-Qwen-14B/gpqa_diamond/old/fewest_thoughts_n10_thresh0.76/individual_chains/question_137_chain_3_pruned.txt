Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles, like protons. But wait, what's a synchrocyclotron specifically? Oh right, it's a type of cyclotron that uses a varying magnetic field, I think, which allows it to accelerate particles to much higher energies than a regular cyclotron.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy. So its initial energy is basically zero, and it's accelerated to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The applied voltage is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where U0 is 190 kV and Φ0 is π/4.

The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. The options are A) 1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

First, I need to recall how synchrocyclotrons work. In a regular cyclotron, the frequency of the electric field is fixed, and the particles move in a circular path with a constant magnetic field. But as the particles gain energy, their radius increases, and their period changes. However, in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field isn't constant; it's varying to keep the particles in phase with the accelerating electric field. That way, they can keep accelerating as they go around.

So, the key here is finding the number of revolutions the proton makes as it goes from zero energy to 950 MeV. Each revolution allows the proton to gain energy, I believe. So I need to find out how much energy it gains per revolution and then figure out how many are needed to reach 950 MeV.

Wait, but the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(...). The kinetic energy gained by the proton each time it goes through the potential difference would be eU, right? But wait, in a cyclotron, the particles go through each gap between the dees where the electric field is applied. Each time they cross this gap, they gain a certain amount of energy.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the electric field actually changes as the proton gains energy because the magnetic field is changing
