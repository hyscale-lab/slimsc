Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass. The question gives me data about two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods, which I think is the orbital period because the period between primary eclipses should be the orbital period.

The periods are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. Then, the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes are given. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So, the mass ratio is system_1 mass divided by system_2 mass.

Wait, I think the radial velocity method in binary stars relates to the masses. Because each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass since they orbit the same center of mass. The more massive star moves slower, right? So if one star has a higher RV amplitude, it's less massive.

The formula I remember is that the ratio of the masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of the velocities. So, m1/m2 = v2/v1. Because m1 * v1 = m2 * v2, so m1/m2 = v2/v1.

But wait, in the problem, system_1 has two stars with RV amplitudes of 10 and 5. So their velocities are in the ratio of 2:1. So m1/m2 would be (v2)/(v1) = 5/10 = 0.5. So the masses are in a 1:2 ratio. So system_1's total mass is m1 + m2 = m1 + 2m1 = 3m1. So the mass of the system is 3m1.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in system_1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5. So the more massive star has the smaller velocity. So star A (10 km/s) is less massive than star B (5 km/s)? No, wait, no. Because if m1 is the mass of the star with velocity v1, then m1 * v1 = m2 * v2, so m1/m2 = v2
