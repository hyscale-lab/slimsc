Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what it's about. The question is about meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and resonance has to do with their unstable states. 

The problem gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. So I need to find the mean decay distance, which I think relates to how far the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, I think the mean decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its speed. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βc), where β is v/c. So the decay length L is approximately c * τ * β.

But wait, I need to find τ. How does that relate to the given parameters? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but in particle physics, the relation is usually Γ ≈ ħ / τ. Or more accurately, Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So τ is ħ divided by Γ.

Wait, no, wait. The mean lifetime τ is given by τ
