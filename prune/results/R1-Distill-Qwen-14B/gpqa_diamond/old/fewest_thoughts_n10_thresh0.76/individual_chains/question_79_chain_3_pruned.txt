Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR spectra after a reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think.

The compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in reactions like the deprotection of silyl ethers or maybe in some elimination reactions. Wait, or maybe it's part of a Wittig reaction? Oh, wait, no, the Wittig is usually with triphenylphosphine. Alternatively, 1,4-diazabicyclo is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, so it's used in deprotonation steps. Oh right, it's used in the Corey-Fuchs reaction or maybe in epoxide ring-opening? Or perhaps in elimination reactions.

Wait, but the product has a certain NMR. So, let me look at the NMR data given.

The 1H NMR has the following signals:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): a singlet, probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded but not near any protons. Maybe an aromatic ring's methyl substituent?
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): another singlet, another methyl group, maybe attached to something else. Wait, same shift? Or similar. Maybe it's a geminal di-substitution? Or perhaps two different methyl groups in similar environments.
- Then, we have several aromatic signals:
  - 6.75 (1H, d)
  - 7.08 (2H, d)
  - 7.68 (1H, d)
  - 7.71 (2H, d)
So, that's four sets of aromatic protons. Let me think about the splitting. The doublets suggest coupling between two sets of protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene, but with substituents that lead to a di-sub
