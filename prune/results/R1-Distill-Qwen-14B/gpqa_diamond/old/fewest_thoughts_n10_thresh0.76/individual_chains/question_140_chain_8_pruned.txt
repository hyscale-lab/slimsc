Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius. I remember that water freezes at 273 K, which is 0 degrees, so 277 K is just a bit above that. So maybe B is something that's solid at that temperature but just starts to melt a bit, or maybe it's another substance with a similar melting point.

The question also mentions that gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Since the molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons, that makes me think of a molecule where each atom has equal numbers. The simplest would be something like H2O, but wait, the number of protons and neutrons in each atom. Let's think. For example, if W is H2O, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (since they're protium, the lightest isotope). O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (like O-16). So each molecule has 2 H and one O. But the total neutrons and protons per molecule: H has 1p and 0n each, O has 8p and 8n. So total protons: 2*1 +8=10. Total neutrons: 0*2 +8=8. Wait, that doesn't match. So H2O doesn't have equal protons and neutrons in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps W is something like NH3? Let's see: N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (so 14 N would have 7 each?), and H has 1 each. So for NH3: 1 N and 3 H. Protons: 7 + 3*1 =10. Neutrons:7 (from N) + 3*0=7. So total protons=10, neutrons=7. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe it's something else. What about CO2? Each O has 8p 8n. C has 6p 6n (if it's ^12C). So CO2: 1 C and 2 O. Protons:6 + 2*8=6+16=22. Neutrons:6 (from C) + 2*8=6+16=22. Oh, that works! So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in total. So gas W could be CO2.

Wait, but if W is CO2, then what's the reaction? Because when X reacts with Y, CO2 is released. Let me think about what reactions produce CO2 as a gas. Acid reacting with carbonate? Like an acid (maybe Y is an acid) reacting with a carbonate (could X be a carbonate?), but wait, the precipitate G forms. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal and Y is acid, releasing CO2.

Wait, but in the problem, X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm. Maybe X is a heavier isotope of something else. Like, perhaps it's sodium, but with a heavier isotope, like ^23Na instead of ^23Na? Wait, sodium is Na, which is ^23 normally. Maybe X is something like lead? Or wait, perhaps it's a transition metal. Maybe it's something else.

Wait, the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Keto acid— like a ketone acid, which would have a ketone group and a carboxylic acid. Wait, maybe it's a reaction where X is a reducing agent. For example, maybe X is a metal that reduces something in the keto acid.

But let's go back to the reaction: X reacts with Y to release W (CO2), and form G. Then, when G is heated, it releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. Let me think of substances that melt around that temperature. Water is 273 K, so maybe B is some form of water? Or something else. Wait, maybe B is carbon dioxide solid? No, CO2 solid is dry ice, which sublimes at lower temperatures. Alternatively, maybe B is something like ice? No, because ice melts at 273 K, but the problem says 277 K. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is something else. Let me think of other substances. Oh, maybe B is sodium chloride? No, NaCl melts at much higher temperatures. What about something like glucose? No, that's not right. Or maybe a different chemical—like maybe B is a metal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if G is a precipitate, perhaps it's a carbonate. When you heat a carbonate, it can decompose into CO2 and the metal oxide. So if Y is an acid, like HCl, and X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, the reaction would be Na2CO3 + 2HCl → 2NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O. The precipitate G might not form in this case because all products are soluble, but maybe if Y is a different acid or X is a different carbonate.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide. Wait, but heating a hydroxide might not release CO2. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, Y is an acid, and the reaction releases H2 gas? But earlier I thought W was CO2.

Wait, perhaps W is another gas. Let me reconsider. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. So looking for a molecule where total protons = total neutrons. Let's see:

Another option is CH4. Each CH4 molecule has 6 (from C) + 4 (from H) =10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 in ^12C, H has 0. So 6 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, maybe H2O is not working, but what about O2? O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons total per molecule. But O2 is O=O, each O has 8p and 8n (like O-16). So O2 has 16p and 16n. So total protons and neutrons are 16 each. That fits the condition. So
