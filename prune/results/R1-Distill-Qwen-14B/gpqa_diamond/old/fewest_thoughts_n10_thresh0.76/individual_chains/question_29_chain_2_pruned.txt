Okay, so I've got this genetics question in front of me. Let me read through it carefully. Hmm. The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The problem is that this compound makes the barley unsuitable for food. They found the gene responsible for producing this compound, which has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by using EMS mutagenesis.

So the approach taken is to create a bunch of mutants and then sequence the target gene in all of them. They found mutations at the beginning of the gene's sequence in the first exon. We need to pick which mutation would probably eliminate the compound.

Looking at the options, the question gives four mutants (1-4) and the intact gene sequences. I'll need to analyze each mutant's changes and see which one is likely to disrupt the gene's function.

First, I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so any mutation there can potentially affect the protein product. Since the question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound, disrupting the gene's function (like a loss-of-function mutation) should be the aim. So we’re looking for a mutation that changes the protein enough to either stop its production or make it non-functional.

Let me look at each option's mutant.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA. So comparing to the intact, let's see where the differences are.

Looking at the first part: the intact is ATGTTT CTCGCT G..., and mutant 1 is ATGTT CTACGC T... Wait, let me line them up.

Intact: positions 1-30 maybe?

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, the first few nucleotides:

Intact: positions 1-9: ATGTTTCTC
Mutant1: ATGTTCTAC

Wait, let me count. Intact is ATG TTT CT C GCT... So positions 1-4: ATG T, then TTT, CT, etc.

Wait, perhaps better to compare each part:

Looking at the beginning:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So, the first part differs. Let me break it down.

Intact: starts with ATGTTTCTC...
Mutant1: starts with ATGTTCTAC...

So, the first 6 nucleotides: Intact is ATGTTT, Mutant1 is ATGTTT? Wait, no: Intact is ATG TTT, so positions 4-6 are TTT. Mutant1: positions 4-6 are TCT. Wait, no, let's count each letter.

Intact: 1-5: A T G T T
Mutant1: 1-5: A T G T T ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the mutations are.

Looking in the first part:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGG...
Mutant1: ...TCTACGCTGG...

So, in the intact, it's TTTCTC GCTGG.

Mutant1 has TCTACG CTTCT.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compare each segment:

Let's say the first part is:

Intact: ...TTT CTC
