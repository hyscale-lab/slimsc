Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which usually happens if the molecule has chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry leading to non-superimposable mirror images.

Let's look at each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-C(Cl)(CH3)? Or maybe I should draw it. Oh wait, but wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is a double bond. So the structure is Cl-C=C-CH2CH3? Wait, no, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So structure is Cl-C=C-CH(CH3)? No, wait, 2-methyl means the second carbon (the one adjacent to the double bond) has a methyl. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituents: the first carbon (CH2) has Cl, and the second has a methyl. So it's Cl on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is CH2Cl. Then 2-methyl would be a methyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, that can't be right because that would make the double bond between C1 and C2. Oh wait, no, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon (CH2Cl group), and 2-methyl would be a methyl on the second carbon. So structure would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But wait, that's but-1-ene, so four carbons. So is there a double bond between C1 and
