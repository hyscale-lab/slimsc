Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR questions can get tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a reaction involving a dicarboxylic acid that's been dehydrated to an anhydride. Then this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products. The major and minor products have the same molecular formula, which is C13H16O3. The key clue here is the 2D NOESY NMR spectra, where the major product has a cross-peak but the minor doesn't. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

First, I should probably think about the structure of the starting materials. The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene would form an anhydride. Wait, how does that work? When a diacid with adjacent carboxylic groups (like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH) is dehydrated, it can form an anhydride. But if the diacid has a cis-alkene, maybe it's something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in the middle, like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH becomes HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH after dehydration? No, wait, no. Oh wait, maybe the diacid has a structure like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond, so it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, which would form an anhydride upon dehydration. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but more likely the diacid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, which upon dehydration would lose water and form an anhydride, which would have the structure O=C-O-C-O=C-O, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, the anhydride's NMR is described. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. 7 ppm is typical for aromatic protons, but wait, an anhydride might not have any aromatic groups. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol ether or some conjugated system. Hmm. Or perhaps the anhydride has some kind of double bond. Wait, in the 13C NMR, there are two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 165 is probably a carbonyl group—like an ester or ketone. 137 is in the range of sp2 carbons, perhaps a double bond. Wait, but the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm. So maybe the anhydride has an aromatic ring? Or maybe it's a cyclic anhydride with some symmetry.

Wait, but the reaction is with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. That's a diene, probably undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction. So the anhydride would act as the dienophile. So the dienophile is the anhydride, and the diene is the cyclopentadiene.

Wait, the starting anhydride. Let's think about its structure. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene—so the dicarboxylic acid has a cis double bond. When it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. The dehydration typically occurs between the two carboxylic acid groups, removing an -OH from each and forming an anhydride bridge. So if the original structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-C
