Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. Okay, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun—same radius. Half of one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. They're saying that because of these spots, when the star rotates, it causes brightness variations that look like an exoplanet transit. The question is, what would be the radius of a planet that would produce the same signal in the light curve?

Wait, so the problem is comparing two scenarios: one where spots cause the variation, and the other where a planet transiting in front of the star does. We need to find the planet's radius relative to the star such that the brightness dip is the same.

First, I remember that the brightness change (or the amplitude of the light curve) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula (Rp / Rstar)^2. That's because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio. So the deeper the dip, the bigger the planet relative to the star.

But here, the spots are the cause. So I need to figure out how the spots affect the observed brightness. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, so one hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface, right? Because the star is a sphere, so half of it is one hemisphere. So if one hemisphere has 20% spots, that's 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 or 10% of the star's surface covered by spots.

Each spot is cooler. The star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K less, so 5000 K. The flux from the star without spots would be based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. Since the spots are cooler, their contribution is less.

When the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. The brightness variation is due to the change in the observed flux as the spots rotate in and out of view. Because the spots are cooler, when they're on the side facing us, the total brightness decreases.

So the observed flux will vary depending on how much of the spotted area is visible. Since the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, each rotation will bring that hemisphere into view. Wait, but the star is rotating, so each spot is in view for a certain time, causing a dip. But how does this compare to a planet transit?

Wait, maybe I should model the scenario where the spots cause a dip in brightness when they're on the visible side. The dip's amplitude would be the difference in flux when the spots are visible versus when they're not.

So the star's total flux without any spots is F0 = σTeff^4. The spots have a lower temperature, so each spot's flux is F_spot = σ(Teff - delta_T)^4. The total area of the spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2), because one hemisphere is 50% of the surface area. Oh wait, wait—no, the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * ( (4π R^2 ) / 2 ) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². Wait, no: the entire surface area is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2π R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². So the area of the spots is 0.4 π R².

Each spot emits less flux than the rest of the star. So the total flux when the spots are facing us is F_total = F0 * (1 - (F_spot / F0) * (A_spot / A_star
