Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about particles in a detector. Let me read through it again and think about what each part means.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But more importantly, I think this has to do with time dilation and the particles' decay length.

Wait, right. The particles are unstable and decay over time. The distance they travel before decaying depends on their speed (gamma) and their proper lifetime (tau). The decay length L is approximately gamma * c * tau.

So, the idea is that when a particle is produced at the center of the detector, it moves outward. If it doesn't decay before reaching the detector's wall, it would be detected. The fraction that reaches the wall depends on how much time they have before decaying.

In the initial case, with gamma =20, only 1/3 reach the wall. So, I think that when gamma increases, more particles will reach the walls because they have a longer lifetime (since L is proportional to gamma).

Wait, let's think about it. The decay length is L=gamma * c * tau. The detector has radius R=30 m. So, if L is greater than R, the particle will decay before reaching the wall. Wait, no, if the lifetime is longer, the decay length is longer, meaning they can go further before decaying. So, higher gamma means the particles can go further. So for a given R, if L is larger than R, more particles reach the wall. Wait, but if L is larger, the particles would travel further, but if R is fixed, then even if L is larger, the particles may not need to live that long. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The proper lifetime is tau. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = R / (v). Since v is approximately c (ultra-relativistic), t ≈ R/(c). So, the particle will decay if its lifetime (gamma tau) is less than the time it takes to reach the wall.

Wait, no. Wait, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. The time available for the particle to reach the wall is t = R/(v) ≈ R/(c). So, the decay probability depends on whether the lifetime is longer than the time to reach the wall. If the lifetime is longer, the probability of decaying before reaching the wall is higher, so fewer particles reach the wall. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that
