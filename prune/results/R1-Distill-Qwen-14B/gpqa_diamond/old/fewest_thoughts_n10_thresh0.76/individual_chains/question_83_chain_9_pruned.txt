Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, the pH goes up because the acid becomes less concentrated, making it weaker. So the initial solution before any NaOH is added will have a certain pH, but after dilution, it's lower in concentration, so pH isn't as low as concentrated solution.

First, let's calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ and the final volume after adding 20 cm³ of water is 40 cm³. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2.

So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but when we titrate this with NaOH, we're going to neutralize some of the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Let me find out the moles involved.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles (because 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So NaOH added is 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH used at 25% titration can be calculated, but maybe I don't need that right now. Because I just need the moles for the solution.

So after adding 25% of the NaOH, the reaction will convert 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

So, the moles remaining of CH3COOH will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

And the moles of CH3COO^- formed will be 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume of the solution will be the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but wait. How much volume of NaOH is added at 25% titration?

Wait,
