Okay, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, so the question is about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons in a specific state. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember the concepts.

So the initial state is a 1S0 state. Wait, I think the notation is (2S+1)L(J). The 1S0 means that the spin is zero because (2*0 +1)=1, so S=0. The orbital angular momentum L is S, which is 0. So the total angular momentum J is 0 as well. So the initial state is spin 0, orbital 0, and total J is 0.

They emit a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the emitted particle is -1.

The Pauli statistics part says that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, T is isospin, S is the spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So for the final NN state, T must satisfy T = S + L +1 mod 2.

The final NN state has T=0. So substituting, 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. Which implies that S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S + L must be odd. So S and L must be of opposite parity. Either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.

Now, the problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. Partial waves are denoted by their angular momentum quantum number l, like S (l=0), P (l=1), D (l=2), F (l=3), etc. So each option gives a transition where the NN system goes from 1S0 to some state with certain L and S, plus the emission of a particle X in a specific angular momentum state.

Wait, but the system emits a particle X. So the process is NN â†’ NN' + X. Or wait, the initial state is NN in 1S0, and they emit X, so the final state is another NN pair in some state plus X.

Wait, I might be getting the setup wrong. Let me re-read the question. Oh, the question says the bound system emits a particle X, so the final state is the two nucleons in some state and X.
