Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. So the question is about finding the mean decay distance of this meson X. 

The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. I think I need to figure out how far this meson travels before decaying. 

Wait, how do particles decay? I recall that the mean lifetime is related to the decay width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by τ = ħ / Γ. Once I have the lifetime, I can find the distance by multiplying by the velocity. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

So, the mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ. Since Γ is given in MeV, I need to convert that into appropriate units. But let me get the steps straight.

First, calculate the lifetime τ. The formula is τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the mean decay distance L is the product of the lifetime τ and the velocity v of the meson: L = v * τ.

But wait, what's the velocity of the meson? Since we're given the production energy and the rest mass, perhaps I can find the velocity from that. The energy of a relativistic particle is the total energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So E = gamma m c². 

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, gamma = E/(m c²). But since the units are given in GeV and MeV, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let's see, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma would be 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... Approximately 6.6667.

Once I have gamma, I can find the velocity. Because gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so solving for v:

v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) * c.

Alternatively, for high gamma, v is approximately c, but let's compute it accurately.

Wait, another approach: Using beta = v/c. Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So let me compute beta. Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So 1/gamma² is (1.2/8)^2 = (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887, which means v ≈ 0.9887c. So about 0.989 times the speed of light, which is roughly 3e8 m/s * 0.989 ≈ 2.967e8 m/s.

Now, let's compute the lifetime τ. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Because when working with particle physics, these units are handy. So Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ.

So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

Calculating 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 0.32 * 20.56875 = 6.582. So 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s. Which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, no, because 6.582 / 0.32 = let me calculate it more accurately. 0.32 is 32e-2, so 6.582 / 0.32 = (6582e-3) / (32e-2) )= (6582 / 320) e-1. 6582 divided by 320. Let's see: 320 * 20 = 64
