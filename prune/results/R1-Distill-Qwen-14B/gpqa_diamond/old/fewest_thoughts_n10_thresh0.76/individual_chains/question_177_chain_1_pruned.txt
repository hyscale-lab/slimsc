Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's see.

So the question says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. Interesting. But wait, the question is about luminosity, so I think the mass might not directly come into play here, maybe only the radius? Or maybe it's a red herring. I'll have to remember that.

The problem also mentions that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a star's emission is determined by its temperature. I remember this is from Wien's Law. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars emit most strongly at the same wavelength, their temperatures must be the same as well. So T1 = T2. That's an important point.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, but how does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, Doppler shift. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and if moving away
