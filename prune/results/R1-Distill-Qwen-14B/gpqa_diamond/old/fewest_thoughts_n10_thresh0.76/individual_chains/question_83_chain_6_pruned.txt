Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, you're doing a neutralization reaction. The problem gives me some specific concentrations and volumes, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, each with two pH values.

Let me break down the problem. First, the initial solution: 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ or 0.040 liters.

Wait, when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. Since the volumes are equal, the concentration of the diluted acetic acid would be halved. So the initial concentration becomes 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. Right, because concentration is moles over volume, and the volume doubles, so the concentration halves.

But wait, maybe I should compute the moles first. Let's see. Moles of acetic acid initially are 0.02 liters * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 moles. Then, after adding 20 cm³ water, total volume is 40 cm³, so the new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, same result. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. At 25% titration, how much NaOH is added? Hmm, let me think about the moles involved.

The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 mol. So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Since NaOH is a strong base and reacts 1:1 with acetic acid, the equivalence point requires 0.001 mol of NaOH. 

But wait, the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed to reach equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³.

So 25% titration means they've added 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So the volume added is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but when calculating pH at 25% titration, I need to find the concentrations of the species in solution at that point.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutral
