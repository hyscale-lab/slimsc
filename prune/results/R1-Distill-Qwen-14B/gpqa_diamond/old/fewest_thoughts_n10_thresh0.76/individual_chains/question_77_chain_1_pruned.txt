Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. There are two parts: A and B. The first part involves a compound reacting with BuLi and then H+, and the second part is a Cope rearrangement with heat.

Starting with part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, let me draw that structure to visualize it better. So, benzene ring attached to a CH2-O- group. The oxygen is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me break that down: the enyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. Wait, no, wait. 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2 with a double bond at position 2, and a methyl branch on carbon 3. Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with a methyl on carbon 3. Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So the chain is four carbons long? No, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, but but is four carbons. Oh, wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that's five carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be the group starting at carbon 1, so carbon 1 is CH2-, carbon 2 is double bond (CH), and the rest. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no. No, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but
