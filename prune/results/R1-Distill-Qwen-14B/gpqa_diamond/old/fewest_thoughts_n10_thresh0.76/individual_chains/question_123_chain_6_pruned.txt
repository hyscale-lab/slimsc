Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames. Right, inertial frames are non-accelerating, so no acceleration here. That probably means we can ignore any relativistic effects like time dilation or length contraction because maybe the speed is too high for that? Wait, 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. Hmm, so maybe we need to consider relativity after all.

Wait, the question is about how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, we're dealing with time in different frames. In the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass, but in the Galaxy's frame, time would be different because of time dilation.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is approaching quickly. So, the ejecta and the Galaxy are moving toward each other at 60,000 km/s, right? Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at that
