Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I remember that the TTV method is used to detect exoplanets by looking at the gravitational interactions causing Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum. But the question is about the orbital periods, so I probably need to think about Kepler's laws.

Alright, the problem gives me the ratios of the equilibrium temperatures between the planets. Planet1 and Planet2 have a ratio of 1.4, Planet2 and Planet3 have a ratio of 2.3. Also, the mass ratios between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. All albedos are 0.3, same as Earth.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I think the equilibrium temperature formula is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16πσ D²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star. Since all albedos are the same, the ratio of temperatures will depend on the square root of the inverse square of their distances. So T1/T2 = sqrt( (D2/D1)^2 ), wait no, wait the formula rearranged: T is proportional to sqrt( (L/(D²)) ), because the other terms are same. So T is proportional to sqrt(1/D²) )? Or wait, no, T is proportional to sqrt(L/(16πσ D²)) )^(1/4) ? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature equation is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). So when comparing two planets, T1 / T2 = [ ( L/(D1²) ) / ( L/(D2²) ) ]^(1/4) ) multiplied by sqrt( (1 - a1)/(1 - a2) ) but since a is same for all, that part is 1. So T1/T2 = ( (D2²/D1²) )^(1/4 ) ) = (D2/D1)^(1/2). So T ratio squared is D ratio inverse. So D1/D2 = (T2/T1)^2.

Wait, let's make it concrete. Suppose Planet1 has temperature T1, Planet2 T2. So T1 / T2 = sqrt( (D2/D1) ). Wait, no: Let's compute T1 and T2.

T1 = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D1²) ]^(1/4)
T2 = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D2²) ]^(1/4)

Divide T1 by T2: T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1).

Wait that can't be right. Let me re-calculate.

Ratio T1/T2 = [ ( (L (1-a))/(16πσ D1²) ) ]^(1/4) / [ ( (
