Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I know that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. The first part is to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Then we also need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let's take it step by step.

First, I need to normalize the state |alpha> since it's given as proportional. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So the normalization factor would be the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

Let me compute the coefficients. The coefficient for |up> is (1+i), so its magnitude squared is |1+i|². Let's compute that: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1 = 2. Similarly, for |down>, the coefficient is (2-i). The magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 + 5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is sqrt(7), making the normalized state |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, but the question only says it's proportional, which means we might need to normalize it. So the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7), correct.

Next, I need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the given operator. The operator's matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what are the indices here? Since |up> and |down> are the basis, the matrix is 2x2. So for a 2x2 matrix, the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements are zero.

So the operator A has the matrix:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0 ]

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe I should think about what this operator represents. Oh, wait a second, because the eigenstates of this operator would be the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, but scaled. Because the Pauli X has off-diagonal 1s and 0s on the diagonal. So the matrix A looks like (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

The eigenstates of the Pauli X are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively, when multiplied by the Pauli X. But since our matrix A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X, the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), that is, hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but wait again. The problem says we need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of Pauli X, but normalized, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitude of |alpha> in each eigenstate.

So let me denote the eigenstates as |+x> and |-x>, where:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> and then find the probabilities.

So first, let me compute the expansion of |alpha> in the |+x> and |-x> basis. Alternatively, compute the inner products of |alpha> with each of these eigenstates.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the components of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

Let me write |alpha> as a vector. In the computational basis (|up>, |down>), |alpha> is (1+i, 2-i) divided by sqrt(7) as the vector. So the vector is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, which in the computational basis are (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2))^T and (1/sqrt(2), -
