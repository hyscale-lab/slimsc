Okay, I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. Let's see what the question is all about.

So, the problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to figure out what compound X was.

Hmm, the reaction conditions might be important here. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base. Oh wait! I remember that's a common reagent for epoxide ring opening. But wait, wait. Or is it used for something else? Let me think. Oh, right, sometimes it's used in the Nazarov cyclization, but that's for cyclic dienophiles. Wait, no, actually, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (which is sometimes called DBU) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So if compound X is undergoing a reaction with DBU, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed reaction, but DBU is a base, so perhaps it's deprotonating something.

Wait, but looking at the product's NMR, the theoretical data is given. So the product might be an epoxide or the result of an epoxide ring opening. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination or an addition. Hmm.

Let me look at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has peaks at:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So, the peaks between 6.75-7.71 are all in the aromatic region. The two singlets at around 2.28 and 2.31 each for 3H suggest two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals—maybe two different methyl groups attached to
