Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this science question about rotavirus and some processes happening in the mice. Let me go through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: They tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and give them to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they see some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They check the fluorescent Peyer patches, isolate the proliferating cells, and sequence their variable heavy chain genes, finding high variability.

Hmm, so the question is about which process is taking place. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Okay, so first, I need to understand what each process is.

VDJ recombination is a process during the generation of the immune receptors (like B cell receptors) where variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are combined. This happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. I think it's part of the initial diversification of the B cell receptor.

Somatic hypermutation is another process that occurs after an antigen is encountered. It's a mechanism that introduces mutations into the variable region of the B cell receptor, allowing for affinity maturation. This happens in the germinal centers, mainly in secondary lymphoid organs like lymph nodes and Peyer's patches.

Class switching recombination, also known as isotype switching, is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG) without altering the variable region. This is directed by cytokines and happens after the initial response, often in the same germinal center reactions.

Complement activation is part of the innate immune response, where complement proteins are activated and help in opsonizing pathogens or causing lysis. It's not directly about the variability of the B cell receptors.

In the question, the GFP-tagged proteins are given orally. Rotavirus is a pathogen that primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract. The fact that some GFP is destroyed by stomach acid and some by mucus suggests that not all antigens make it to the lymphoid tissues. But the ones that do reach the Peyer patches (which are a type of secondary lymphoid organ in the gut) are isolated, and their variable heavy chains are sequenced showing high variability.

High variability in the variable regions is a hallmark of processes that diversify the immune response. Somatic hypermutation is a key process that introduces this variability. VDJ recombination occurs earlier, when the B cells are first developing, so maybe that's less likely once the cells have already been activated and are in the germinal centers. Class switching doesn't change the variable regions, so that's probably not the main factor here.

Wait, but Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. In these patches, B cells encounter antigens, and this is where a lot of the immune response is initiated. The proliferating cell population they isolate—like B cells that are activated—would undergo somatic hypermutation to increase the diversity and affinity of their receptors.

So the process that's causing high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is likely somatic hypermutation. That's process A.

Another thought: Are germinal centers active in Peyer patches? I think they are. Germinal centers are sites within lymphoid tissues where B cells undergo proliferation and somatic hypermutation. So yes, the cells in the Peyer patches that are proliferating would be undergoing this process.

So, putting it all together, the high variability in the variable regions is due to somatic hypermutation. Therefore, the correct answer should be A.


The question involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence is observed in the Peyer patches, and sequencing of the variable heavy chain genes in the proliferating cell population shows high variability. The task is to identify the process responsible for this variability.

1. **Somatic Hypermutation (Option A):** This process occurs in germinal centers, where B cells undergo proliferation and mutation in the variable region of their receptors. This process increases the diversity and affinity of antibodies and is consistent with the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes.

2. **Complement Activation (Option B):** This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly contribute to the variability of B cell receptors. It is unrelated to the observed fluorescence or gene variability.

3. **Class Switching Recombination (Option C):** This process changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) without altering the variable region. It does not explain the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

4. **VDJ Recombination (Option D):** This process occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J gene segments are combined. It is a primary diversification mechanism but occurs earlier in development, not during the observed proliferative response in the Peyer patches.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in germinal centers within secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer patches. This process is responsible for the observed diversity in the B cell receptor variable regions.

Answer: A
