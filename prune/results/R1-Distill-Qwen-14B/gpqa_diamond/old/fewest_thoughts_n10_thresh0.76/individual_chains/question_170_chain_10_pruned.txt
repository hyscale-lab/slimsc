Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says: An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are A to D, with some expressions involving hbar.

Hmm, wait, the spin state is given as (3i,4). I think that's a two-component vector, right? So in quantum mechanics, the spin state for an electron is often represented as a two-component spinor. The components correspond to the spin-up and spin-down states along a certain axis, typically the z-axis.

But the question is about the expectation value of S_y, which is the spin operator along the y-axis. So I remember that the spin operators for an electron are given in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form for the spin operator is S = (ħ/2) * σ, where σ is the Pauli matrix.

So for S_y, it would be (ħ/2) times σ_y. Let me write down the σ_y matrix. Oh right, the problem provided it:

σ_y is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

Now, the expectation value of an operator is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator, multiplied by the state vector. Wait, more accurately, the expectation value <S_y> is given by ψ† S_y ψ, where ψ is the state vector.

Wait, but wait, the state is given as (3i,4). Let me denote this as a column vector: ψ = [3i; 4]. So the components are the first component 3i and the second component 4.

Since the state is a column vector, the conjugate transpose (bra vector) would be [3i*, 4*], which would be [-3, 4], because 3i* is -3i^0? Wait, no, wait: 3i is a complex number. The complex conjugate of 3i is -3i? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3i is a purely imaginary number. Its complex conjugate is -3i. So the top component becomes -3i, but wait, wait no: 3i is a scalar; the conjugate of 3i is -3i. So the conjugate transpose would be [ -3i , 4 ].

Wait, but wait, the state is (3i,4). So the first component is 3i. Its complex conjugate is -3i. So the bra vector is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Then, ψ† S_y ψ would be the expectation value. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute it as (ψ†) (S_y ψ). So first, compute S_y ψ, then multiply by ψ†.

Let me compute S_y ψ first.

S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y, which is (ħ/2) *
