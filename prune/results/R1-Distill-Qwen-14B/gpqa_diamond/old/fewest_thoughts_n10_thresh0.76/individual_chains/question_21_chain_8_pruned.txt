Okay, I need to solve this chemistry problem about isomers, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that compounds have isomers. It explains constitutional and stereoisomers. But the question is about two specific pairs of compounds and their properties regarding tautomerism and optical isomerism.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's break them down.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which one does NOT show tautomerism.

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one will show optical isomerism.

I need to figure out each part and then match the options.

Starting with Part A: Tautomerism. Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, leading to a different structure, like in keto-enol tautomerism. It usually happens in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups or where a hydrogen is next to a carbonyl.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which is an aromatic compound with two ketone groups. Quinones can undergo tautomerism. For example, benzoquinone can tautomerize to benzobenzoquinone or something similar, but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, it's possible that benzoquinone doesn't have adjacent groups that allow for keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups opposite each other. So the structure is O=C6H4=C=O, but actually, it's O=C6H4- with two ketones. But for tautomerism, I think the molecule must have a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: Quinones can have enol tautomerism. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups in para positions on a benzene ring. Hmm, the structure is O=C6H4=O but maybe it's more accurate to say it's a 1,4-diketone. So, do they have alpha hydrogens that can tautomerize? Let me think. The carbonyl groups are on the benzene ring. The adjacent
