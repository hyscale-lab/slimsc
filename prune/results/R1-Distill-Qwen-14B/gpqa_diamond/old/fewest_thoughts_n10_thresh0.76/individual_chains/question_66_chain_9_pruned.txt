Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model with higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond the Standard Model physics. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I should start by recalling what each symmetry entails. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime.

CP symmetry is charge conjugation followed by parity, right? And CPT symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. I remember that in the Standard Model, CPT is a symmetry, but CP isn't necessarily.

Now, SMEFT is built by adding operators of higher dimensions to the Standard Model. The structure of these operators must respect certain symmetries. I think that any effective theory must respect the symmetries of the underlying theory. The Standard Model has certain symmetries, so SMEFT's operators must reflect that.

Wait, the Standard Model (and hence SMEFT) respects Lorentz symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must preserve Lorentz symmetry. That makes sense because effective theories are supposed to be Lorentz invariant.
