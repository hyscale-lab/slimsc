Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these types of questions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each with a pH and volume.

Hmm. Right, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide. I remember that when a metal hydroxide reacts with an acid, it typically produces a salt and water. So Fe(OH)3 reacting with a strong acid like HCl would produce FeCl3 and water.

The reaction equation should be something like: Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Fe(OH)3 is a strong base, right? Or is it a weak base? Wait, no, metals hydroxides can vary. Iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, I think is a weak base because it's not one of the strong bases like NaOH. So it doesn't dissociate completely in water.

So when you add a strong acid, it will react with the Fe(OH)3. Since it's a weak base, it might not require as much acid as a strong base would. But wait, in this case, maybe the acid will donate H+ ions which will react with the OH- ions from Fe(OH)3. But because Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, it might not release many OH- ions on its own, so the acid will have to protonate it.

Wait, maybe I should think about the molar amounts. Let's start by calculating the moles of Fe(OH)3.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH is 17.01 g/mol. So 55.85 + 3*(17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass. That's 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol. Let's say approximately 9.358e-4 moles.

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and HCl would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O.

Wait, but because Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, perhaps it doesn't fully react in one step. Or maybe it's more accurate to think in terms of the acid-base reaction, considering the OH- ions. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 can donate 3 moles of OH-.

Wait, but in solution, Fe(OH)3 is only partially dissociated. So when you add a strong acid, the H+ will react with the available OH- from Fe(OH)3. But since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, maybe the amount of OH- it can provide is limited, so the reaction might not proceed to completion unless you add enough acid to fully protonate all the OH- groups.

Wait, but the problem says "dissolve" Fe(OH)3. To dissolve it, perhaps it needs to react completely with the acid. So I think I should proceed under the assumption that the reaction goes to completion, meaning all Fe(OH)3 is converted into Fe^3+ ions.

So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, you need 3 moles of HCl to fully protonate it.

So moles of HCl needed would be 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3.

Moles of HCl = 3 * 9.358e-4 ≈ 0.0028074 mol.

The HCl solution is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration.

Volume (L) = 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028074 L = 28.074 cm³. Wait, but wait, the options don't have exactly that number. Let me look.

Option C is 28.05 cm³. Close. So that would be the volume. But wait, wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Because Fe(OH)3 might not completely dissociate, so maybe more acid is needed. Wait, no, the question is about the minimum volume needed to dissolve, which probably implies complete dissolution. So perhaps 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, but let me think again. Fe(OH)3 has a solubility product, but maybe in the presence of acid, it's more soluble. So perhaps the minimum volume refers to the amount of acid needed to just dissolve all the Fe(OH)3, which would require sufficient H+ to react with all the OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the Fe(OH)3 can't fully dissolve without excess acid? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to approach it another way.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ (from HCl, which is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely).

So the H+ required is 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3.

Moles of HCl needed: same as moles of H+ needed, since each HCl provides one H+.

So yes, same calculation as before: 0.0028074 mol HCl, which is 28.074 cm³ of 0.1 M HCl.

So the volume is approximately 28.07 cm³, which is close to option C's 28.05. So the minimum volume would be about 28 cm³.

Now, about the pH of the resulting solution.

After adding the acid, the solution contains FeCl3, which is the salt of a strong acid (HCl) and a weak base (Fe(OH)3). So FeCl3 will hydrolyze in water to produce an acidic solution.

Fe^3+ ions are the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3. So in solution, Fe^3+ will hydrolyze:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

This will produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. So we need to calculate the pH based on the concentration of Fe^3+.

First, find the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution.

The total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³ (original solution) plus the volume of acid added (28.05 cm³), but wait, the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³. Wait, the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. Oh, wait, perhaps I misread that.

Wait, the problem says: dissolve in 100 cm³ total volume. So when we add the acid, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the acid volume is added to 100 cm³? Or is the 100 cm³ the final volume?

Wait, the question says "0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume." So the total solution after adding the acid and dissolving Fe(OH)3 is 100 cm³.

So the solution is made by adding HCl to a solution in which the total volume is 100 cm³. So I need to find the volume of HCl (V) such that when it's mixed with the solution, the total volume is 100 cm³. Wait, but that complicates things. Because the volume of the acid added plus the volume of the solution would be 100 cm³.

Wait, maybe the initial solution is some volume, and then adding enough acid to reach 100 cm³. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final volume, so when we add V cm³ of HCl, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the resulting solution is 100 cm³, with some volume V of HCl added.

Wait, but how is that possible? Because the Fe(OH)3 is being dissolved in 100 cm³ of solution, which includes the HCl. So the total volume after adding the HCl is 100 cm³. So the volume of HCl added is V, and the total volume is V + (volume of Fe(OH)3 solution before adding acid) = 100 cm³. But perhaps the initial solution is just water? Or maybe the Fe(OH)3 is being dissolved in 100 cm³ of solution, which includes the acid. Hmm, perhaps it's better to model it as the final solution being 100 cm³.

So the moles of Fe(OH)3 are 0.0009358 mol. The reaction with HCl requires 3 moles of HCl per mole of Fe(OH)3, so 0.0028074 mol HCl needed.

But the HCl is 0.1 M. So volume of HCl (V) = 0.0028074 / 0.1 = 0.028074 L → 28.074 cm³.

Wait, but if the total solution volume is 100 cm³, then the volume of HCl added would be less, because the 100 cm³ includes the HCl. Wait, no, the HCl is added to the solution which already has some volume. Hmm, perhaps the initial solution is 100 cm³ minus the volume of HCl added. But if the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³, then the volume of HCl is V = 28.07 cm³, as earlier.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me proceed under the assumption that the HCl volume is 28.07 cm³, and the total solution is 100 cm³.

So the concentration of Fe^3+ in solution is moles / total volume. Moles of Fe^3+ is 0.0009358 mol, and volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.

So concentration is 0.0009358 / 0.1 = 0.009358 M.

But wait, that's only if all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, which it is, because we used enough acid. Now, let's compute the pH.

Fe^3+ is a weak acid in water because it's the conjugate acid of a weak base (Fe(OH)3). The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

We can model this using the hydrolysis constant. The K for this reaction is the inverse of the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the Ksp of Fe(OH)3. I remember Fe(OH)3 has a low solubility. Its Ksp is about 6e-38 at 25°C. Let me check, but I think it's around 1e-37 or similar. Alternatively, perhaps it's K_b for Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.0 × 10^-38. So the reaction Fe(OH)3 ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- has Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

But since the solution is acidic, the OH^- comes from water. Alternatively, I think the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ would produce H+ ions, so maybe I should find the K for that reaction.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+. The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]^1.

But since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, perhaps the K for this hydrolysis would be related to the K_b of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, another approach: the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered in two steps. The first step is Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

But maybe it's easier to find the Ka for Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the K_b for Fe(OH)3 would be K_b = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 / [Fe(OH)3]. Since K_sp is 6.0e-38, and K_b is for the base reaction Fe(OH)3 + H+ → Fe^2+ + H2O (or something else?), I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the hydrolysis using the K value. Let me think: if the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M, and the hydrolysis produces H+.

The hydrolysis reaction:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction would be K = ( [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+] .

But since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, perhaps K is small, but I'm not sure of the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the K using the K_sp and the ionization of water.

Wait, another approach: since Fe(OH)3 is sparingly soluble, maybe the hydrolysis will produce a certain concentration of H+.

Let me denote the concentration of Fe^3+ as c = 0.009358 M.

In the solution, each Fe^3+ ion can donate 3 H+ ions, but in reality, the extent of hydrolysis will be small. So let's assume that x is the concentration of H+ produced per Fe^3+.

So, the equilibrium expression would be:

K = ( [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+] ≈ ( (x) ( (3x)^3 ) ) / (c - x) )

But if x is very small compared to c, then we can approximate c - x ≈ c.

So K ≈ ( x * (27 x^3) ) / c = (27 x^4 ) / c.

But what is K here? I think K for the hydrolysis is equal to Kw / K_sp, perhaps. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps K = Kw / K_b, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, let's think about the hydrolysis of Fe^3+:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction can be found as K = Kw / K_sp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, K_sp is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6.0e-38.

The reaction for Fe(OH)3 dissociating into Fe^3+ and OH^- is:

Fe(OH)3 ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-.

The K_sp is 6.0e-38.

The reverse reaction would be the hydrolysis of Fe^3+:

Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3.

But that's not our reaction; our reaction produces H+.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the K for the reaction Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+. The K for this reaction would be Kw^3 / K_sp.

Wait, because:

[Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = K_sp = 6e-38.

The reaction Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ can be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction would be K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But [Fe(OH)3] can be written in terms of K_sp and [Fe^3+], because K_sp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: since the solution is acidic, [H+] is high, which would suppress the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed with the assumption that the hydrolysis is minimal, so x is small compared to c.

So, let's write the expression:

K = ( [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+] = (x) ( (3x)^3 ) ) / (c - x) ≈ (27 x^4) / c.

But what is K? Let's express K in terms of K_sp and Kw.

Wait, the reaction Fe(OH)3 ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- has K_sp = 6e-38.

The reverse reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- ↔ Fe(OH)3, which has K = 1/K_sp = 1.666...e37.

But our hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+. Let's write this as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But [Fe(OH)3] is equal to [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 / K_sp (from K_sp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38).

So [Fe(OH)3] = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 / K_sp.

Substituting into K:

K = ( [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 / K_sp ) * [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] )

Simplify: K = [OH^-]^3 [H+]^3 / K_sp.

But [OH^-] [H+] = Kw = 1e-14. So [OH^-]^3 [H+]^3 = (Kw)^3 = (1e-14)^3 = 1e-42.

So K = (1e-42) / (6e-38) ) = (1e-42) / (6e-38) ) = (1/6) * 1e-4 = approximately 1.6667e-5.

So K ≈ 1.67e-5.

So our K for the hydrolysis reaction is approximately 1.67e-5.

So now, we can set up the equation:

K = 27 x^4 / c, where x is [H+] contributed per Fe^3+.

Wait, because each Fe^3+ releases 3 H+, so [H+] = 3x.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

In the hydrolysis, each Fe^3+ ion produces 3 H+ ions. So if the concentration of Fe^3+ is c, and the hydrolysis produces x moles of Fe^3+ reacting, then [Fe^3+] decreases by x, and [H+] increases by 3x.

So the expression is:

K = (x * (3x)^3 ) / (c - x) ) ≈ (27 x^4) / c.

But since K is small, x is small compared to c, so c - x ≈ c.

So,

27 x^4 / c = K → x^4 = (K * c) / 27.

We have K ≈ 1.67e-5, c = 0.009358 M.

So x^4 = (1.67e-5 * 0.009358) / 27.

Calculating numerator: 1.67e-5 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.56e-7.

Divide by 27: ≈ 5.77e-9.

So x^4 = 5.77e-9 → x = (5.77e-9)^(1/4).

Let me compute that. The fourth root of 5.77e-9.

Hmm, 5.77e-9 is 5.77 x10^-9.

The fourth root of 1e-8 is 1e-2 (since (1e-2)^4 = 1e-8). So the fourth root of 5.77e-9 is slightly less than 1e-2.

What's the fourth root of 5.77e-9?

Well, let me take natural logs:

ln(5.77e-9) = ln(5.77) + ln(1e-9) → approx 1.753 + (-20.723) = -18.97.

So ln(x) = (-18.97) /4 ≈ -4.7425.

Exponentiating: e^(-4.7425) ≈ 7.1e-3 → 0.0071.

Wait, but that's the fourth root of 5.77e-9.

Wait, let me compute 0.0071^4: (0.0071)^2 = approx 0.00005; then (0.00005)^2 = 2.5e-9. Hmm, but 5.77e-9 is higher, so perhaps I need a higher x.

Wait, let me compute 0.008^4: (8e-3)^4 = (8)^4 * (1e-3)^4 = 4096 * 1e-12 = 4.096e-9. That's larger than 5.77e-9, so x is less than 0.008.

Wait, perhaps 0.0075^4: (0.0075)^2=5.625e-5; then squared: (5.625e-5)^2 = 3.164e-9. That's lower than 5.77e-9. So x is between 0.0075 and 0.008.

Let me try 0.0077^4: (0.0077)^2 = 5.929e-5. Then (5.929e-5)^2 = approx 3.515e-9. Still lower than 5.77e-9.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the approximation for small K.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a third-order reaction. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed with an assumption that x is small, so [H+] = 3x, and [H+] ≈ sqrt(3cK)^(1/ something). Wait, perhaps the approach is flawed, and I should instead use the formula for a salt hydrolysis.

Another approach: The concentration of H+ can be calculated using the formula for a salt of a weak base and strong acid. The pH can be found using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa - log c )

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ as a triprotic acid, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: since the hydrolysis is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+, and the initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M, we can write the expression as:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = 1.67e-5.

Assuming that x is the concentration of Fe^3+ that reacts, so [Fe^3+] = c - x ≈ c, and [H+] = 3x.

So substituting:

( x ) * ( (3x)^3 ) / c ≈ K → (27 x^4 ) / c = K.

So x^4 = (K c ) / 27.

Plugging in K=1.67e-5, c=0.009358 M:

x^4 = (1.67e-5 * 0.009358) / 27 → 1.67e-5 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.56e-7; divided by 27 → ~5.77e-9.

So x^4 =5.77e-9 → x = (5.77e-9)^(1/4).

Compute that:

Take the square root twice. First, sqrt(5.77e-9) is about 7.59e-5. Then sqrt(7.59e-5) is about 8.71e-3. So x ≈ 8.71e-3 M.

Thus, [H+] = 3x = 3 * 8.71e-3 ≈ 0.02613 M.

Then, pH = -log(0.02613) → let's compute that.

Log(0.02613) is log(2.613e-2) = log(2.613) + (-2) → 0.4169 -2 = -1.5831 → pH = 1.5831.

Wait, that's around pH 1.58. But none of the options are that low. The options are 2.04, 2.69, 3.16, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's double-check.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the K calculation. Let me re-calculate K.

Earlier, I thought K = ( [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+ ].

But [Fe(OH)3] is equal to [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 / K_sp, from K_sp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

So substituting:

K = [ ( [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 / K_sp ) * [H+]^3 ] / [Fe^3+] )

Simplify: [Fe^3+] cancels out, so K = [OH^-]^3 [H+]^3 / K_sp.

But [OH^-][H+] = Kw = 1e-14 → [OH^-]^3 [H+]^3 = (Kw)^3 = (1e-14)^3 = 1e-42.

So K = 1e-42 / K_sp → K_sp is 6e-38, so K = 1e-42 / 6e-38 = (1/6) * 1e-4 = 1.6667e-5. So that part was correct.

So K is 1.67e-5.

Then, x^4 = (1.67e-5 * 0.009358) /27 → 1.67e-5 * 0.009358 is approximately 1.56e-7.

Divided by 27: 5.77e-9.

x^4 =5.77e-9 → x = (5.77e-9)^(1/4).

Let me compute this more accurately.

I know that 1e-9 is (1e-3)^3. The fourth root of 5.77e-9 is the same as (5.77)^(1/4) * (1e-9)^(1/4).

(1e-9)^(1/4) = (1e-3)^(3/4) = (0.001)^(0.75) ≈ 0.000316.

(5.77)^(1/4): sqrt(sqrt(5.77)) ≈ sqrt(2.399) ≈ 1.549.

So x ≈ 1.549 * 0.000316 ≈ approx 0.000491 M.

Then [H+] =3x= 0.001473 M → pH = -log(0.001473) → log(1.473e-3) → log(1.473) is approx 0.168, so pH ≈ 3 - 0.168 = 2.832.

Wait, that's about pH 2.83. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is pH 2.69 with 30.09 cm³. Option C is 2.04 with 28.05 cm³.

Wait, but according to this, pH is around 2.83, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that x is small is not valid, and we need to consider a more precise calculation.

Another thought: perhaps I should consider that the hydrolysis produces H+ which affects the OH- concentration. Alternatively, maybe using the exact formula for a weak acid.

Wait, another approach: The concentration of H+ can be found using the formula for a salt of a weak base and strong acid. The formula is:

[H+] = sqrt( (Kw^3 * c) / K_sp )

Wait, does that make sense?

Wait, let me think: for a salt of a weak base (like Fe^3+), the H+ concentration can be found using:

[H+] = sqrt( (Kw^3 * c) / K_sp )

Plugging in the values:

Kw = 1e-14, c=0.009358, K_sp=6e-38.

So:

[H+] = sqrt( ( (1e-14)^3 * 0.009358 ) / 6e-38 )

Compute numerator: (1e-42) * 0.009358 = 9.358e-45.

Divide by 6e-38: 9.358e-45 /6e-38 = (9.358/6) * 1e-7 → approx 1.5597e-7.

So [H+] = sqrt(1.5597e-7) ≈ 1.249e-3.5 → wait, no, sqrt(1.5597e-7) is sqrt(1.5597) * 1e-3.5.

Wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2? Wait, 1e-7 = (1e-3.5)^2? Because (1e-3.5)^2 is 1e-7.

Wait, 1e-3.5 is approximately 3.16e-4.

So sqrt(1.5597e-7) = sqrt(1.5597) * 1e-3.5 → approx 1.249 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 3.95e-4.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me compute this correctly.

Wait, 1.5597e-7 is 1.5597 × 10^-7.

The square root of 1.5597e-7 is sqrt(1.5597) × 10^(-7/2) = approx 1.249 × 10^-3.5.

But 10^-3.5 is 10^(-3) × 10^(-0.5) → 0.001 × 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-4.

So 1.249 × 3.162e-4 ≈ 3.95e-4 M.

So [H+] = 3.95e-4 M → pH = -log(3.95e-4) → log(3.95e-4) is log(3.95) + (-4) → 0.6 -4 = -3.4 → pH=3.4.

Wait, that doesn't match any of the options either. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Perhaps the correct formula is:

[H+] = sqrt( (Kw * c) / K_sp )^(3/2) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the solubility equation.

Wait, another approach: the solution contains Fe^3+ at a concentration of 0.009358 M, and the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The expression for this is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

But we can express [Fe(OH)3] in terms of K_sp and [Fe^3+ ].

From K_sp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 → [OH^-]^3 = K_sp / [Fe^3+ ].

But [OH^-] = Kw / [H+ ] → [OH^-]^3 = (Kw)^3 / [H+]^3.

So,

K_sp = [Fe^3+ ] * (Kw^3) / [H+]^3 → [H+]^3 = (Kw^3 [Fe^3+ ]) / K_sp.

So,

[H+] = [ ( Kw^3 [Fe^3+ ] ) / K_sp ]^(1/3).

Plugging in the numbers:

Kw = 1e-14, [Fe^3+ ]=0.009358 M, K_sp=6e-38.

So,

[H+] = ( ( (1e-14)^3 * 0.009358 ) / 6e-38 ) )^(1/3).

Compute numerator: (1e-42) * 0.009358 = 9.358e-45.

Divide by denominator: 9.358e-45 / 6e-38 = (9.358/6) * 1e-7 → approx 1.5597e-7.

So [H+] = (1.5597e-7 )^(1/3) → cube root of 1.5597e-7.

Cube root of 1e-6 is 1e-2. Cube root of 1.5597e-7 is approximately 5.38e-3. Because (5.38e-3)^3 ≈ 1.56e-7.

Wait, 5.38e-3 is 0.00538 M.

So [H+] ≈ 0.00538 M → pH = -log(0.00538) → log(5.38e-3) is log(5.38) + (-3) → 0.731 + (-3) = -2.269 → pH=2.269.

So approximately pH 2.27.

Looking at the options, option C is pH 2.04, and option B is 2.69. So 2.27 is closer to option C, but option C has a lower pH.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, [H+] = cube root of ( (1e-42 * 0.009358) /6e-38 ) → (1e-42 * 0.009358) = 9.358e-45, divided by 6e-38 is 1.5597e-7.

Cube root of 1.5597e-7 is approximately 5.38e-3, as before. So pH=2.27.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the reaction is incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is simplified, and the concentration of H+ is calculated using the formula for a weak acid with the given K.

Wait, let's try using the formula for a weak acid where [H+] = sqrt( c * K_a ), but this is usually for a monoprotic acid. However, Fe^3+ can release 3 H+ ions, which complicates things.

Alternatively, considering that each Fe^3+ can donate 3 H+, maybe the solution's [H+] is 3 times the square root of (c * K_a), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the solution as a strong acid due to the Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the strong acid. Wait, but the HCl is a strong acid, and in the solution, the moles of HCl are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So moles of HCl (H+) is 3 * 0.0009358 =0.0028074 mol.

The total volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L → concentration of H+ from HCl is 0.0028074 / 0.1 = 0.028074 M.

But wait, that's if all the HCl remains in solution, but some of it is neutralized by Fe(OH)3.

Wait, no, HCl is a strong acid, which donates H+ and Cl-.

The reaction with Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So the moles of H+ needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3 are 3 * 0.0009358 =0.0028074 mol.

The moles of H+ from HCl added is 0.0028074 mol.

So in the solution, after neutralization, the moles of H+ from HCl would be 0.0028074 - 0.0028074 = 0. So the remaining H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but that can't be right, because if all H+ is used up, the solution would be neutral. But Fe^3+ is acidic, so that can't be.

Ah, wait, no. The HCl provides H+ to react with Fe(OH)3. So the reaction consumes H+ and Fe(OH)3, producing Fe^3+ and water.

So the moles of H+ from HCl = 0.0028074 mol.

The Fe(OH)3 is 0.0009358 mol, which requires 0.0028074 mol of H+ to react. So all the H+ from HCl is consumed in this reaction, and the solution now contains Fe^3+ and excess H+ from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, that can't be. Because Fe^3+ is a weak acid; it will release some H+ into the solution.

Wait, but the initial H+ from HCl is exactly the amount needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3.

So, after the reaction, the solution contains Fe^3+ and any excess H+ from the acid. But since the H+ from HCl was exactly consumed, the only H+ in solution comes from water autoionization and the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Therefore, I should calculate the H+ produced by Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Earlier, I calculated [H+] ≈ 0.00538 M, leading to pH≈2.27.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the required volume is incorrect. Let me recalculate the volume.

Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.

Each mole needs 3 moles of HCl, so 0.0028074 mol HCl.

Volume of HCl (0.1 M): 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028074 L → 28.074 cm³.

That's correct, and option C is 28.05 cm³. So the volume is option C's value.

Now, the pH calculation. Maybe I was wrong earlier; perhaps the pH is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that after adding HCl, the solution contains excess H+.

Wait, but that's not possible because the moles of HCl added exactly match the moles required to react with Fe(OH)3. So the H+ from HCl is consumed, and the only H+ comes from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

So the initial calculation of [H+] ≈0.00538 M, pH≈2.27, but none of the options match, which is a problem.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach, considering the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ as a weak acid, using the formula for a triprotic acid but perhaps simplifying.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH can be found using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + log c )

Wait, but that's for a salt of a weak base and strong acid. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, perhaps the pH can be found using the formula:

[H+] = sqrt( (Kw^3 * c) / K_sp )

Wait, earlier I used this approach and got [H+] ≈ 3.95e-4 M, pH≈3.4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

[H+] = ( (Kw^3 * c) / K_sp )^(1/3).

Which would give [H+] = cube root( (1e-42 * 0.009358) /6e-38 )

= cube root( (9.358e-45)/(6e-38) )

= cube root( 1.5597e-7 )

= approx 5.38e-3 M, pH=2.27.

But again, this doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that Fe(OH)3 is amphoteric and can also act as an acid, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem assumes that the solution is diluted after adding the acid and that the concentration of Fe^3+ is lower, leading to a lower pH.

Wait, no, the concentration is fixed by the moles and the total volume.

Wait, the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of HCl added is 28.07 cm³, making the total volume 100 cm³.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the pH using the K_sp of Fe(OH)3 and the concentration of Fe^3+.

The K_sp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 =6e-38.

In solution, [Fe^3+] = 0.009358 M.

So [OH^-]^3 = K_sp / [Fe^3+] = 6e-38 / 0.009358 ≈ 6.408e-36.

[OH^-] = cube root(6.408e-36) ≈ 4.00e-12 M.

pOH = -log(4e-12) ≈ 11.6 → pH=2.4.

Wait, because pH + pOH =14. So pH=14-11.6=2.4.

But this approach doesn't align with the earlier calculation either.

Wait, but this would suggest a pH of 2.4, which is close to option C (2.04) and option B (2.69).

Hmm.

But I'm getting conflicting results, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the assumption that the solution is diluted, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04.

But according to my calculation, the pH is around 2.27, which is closer to option C's pH of 2.04, but not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the K for the hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, another approach: Let me assume that the solution is 0.009358 M Fe^3+ and find the pH based on that concentration.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = Kw^3 / K_sp.

Which is (1e-14)^3 / 6e-38 = 1e-42 /6e-38 = (1/6) *1e-4 → 1.6667e-5.

So K =1.67e-5.

The expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

Assuming that [Fe(OH)3] is x, and [H+] = 3x (since each Fe^3+ donates 3 H+), and [Fe^3+] = 0.009358 - x ≈ 0.009358.

So,

1.67e-5 = (x) * (3x)^3 / 0.009358 → 1.67e-5 = (27 x^4 ) / 0.009358 → x^4 = (1.67e-5 * 0.009358) / 27 → x^4 = (1.56e-7) /27 → 5.77e-9.

So x = (5.77e-9)^(1/4) → approximately 0.000491 M.

Then [H+] =3x = 0.001473 M → pH = -log(0.001473) → pH≈2.83.

But this is also not matching any options.

Hmm. Well, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH calculation is incorrect and the correct pH is around 2.27, but since none of the options match, perhaps I made an error in the initial steps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution is more dilute. Let me check the concentration again.

Wait, the total volume is 100 cm³, and the moles of Fe^3+ are 0.0009358 mol. So concentration is 0.0009358 / 0.1 = 0.009358 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the hydrolysis is more extensive, so the approximation x << c is not valid. Let's try without that approximation.

So the equation is:

1.67e-5 = (27 x^4) / (0.009358 - x).

Assume x is not negligible compared to 0.009358.

But solving this exactly is complicated. Let's try plugging in x ≈ 8.7e-3, which would give 0.009358 - 0.0087 ≈0.000658. Then,

Left side:1.67e-5.

Right side:27*(8.7e-3)^4 /0.000658.

(8.7e-3)^4 = (8.7^4)*1e-12 → 8.7^2=75.69 → 75.69^2 ≈5730. So 5730e-12=5.73e-9.

27 *5.73e-9= 1.547e-7.

Divide by 0.000658: 1.547e-7 / 6.58e-4 = approx 2.35e-4.

So 2.35e-4 → which is larger than 1.67e-5.

Hmm. So the value of x is smaller than 8.7e-3.

Wait, perhaps x is around 4e-3.

Compute RHS:27*(4e-3)^4 / (0.009358-0.004)= 27*(256e-12) /0.005358 = 6.912e-9 / 0.005358 ≈ 1.29e-6.

Which is larger than 1.67e-5.

Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm not getting anywhere with this. Perhaps it's better to accept that the correct pH is around 2.27, and none of the options match, but the closest option is C: pH 2.04, but that's a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 30.09 cm³ and pH 2.69. But according to the initial calculation, the HCl needed is 28.07 cm³, which is option C's volume.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the HCl needed. Wait, another thought: Fe(OH)3 has a formula weight of 106.88 g/mol. So 0.1 g is 0.1 /106.88 = 0.0009358 moles.

The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009358=0.0028074 mol.

Since HCl is 0.1 M, volume needed is 0.0028074 /0.1 = 0.028074 L → 28.07 cm³.

So the volume is correct as 28.05 cm³ in option C.

But then, the pH is 2.27, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as assuming that the H+ concentration is determined by the excess HCl.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggests that the HCl is exactly neutralized by Fe(OH)3, so no excess H+ from HCl.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's an error in the K_sp value. Maybe the K_sp of Fe(OH)3 is higher than I thought, which would result in a higher [H+].

If K_sp were, say, 1e-35 instead of 6e-38, the pH would be lower.

Wait, let me try with K_sp =1e-35.

Then K =1e-42 /1e-35 =1e-7.

So x^4 = (1e-7 *0.009358 ) /27 → (9.358e-10)/27 →3.466e-11.

x = (3.466e-11)^(1/4) → approx 2.43e-3.

[H+] =3x=7.29e-3 → pH=2.13.

Still doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the K_sp is much lower, like 1e-40.

Then K =1e-42 /1e-40=1e-2.

So x^4 = (1e-2 *0.009358)/27 →(0.009358e-2)/27 →9.358e-5 /27→3.466e-6.

x = (3.466e-6)^(1/4) → approx 4.3e-2.

Then [H+] =3*4.3e-2=0.129 M → pH=0.89, which is more acidic, but again not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I think I should go with the volume as 28.05 cm³ (option C) and pH around 2.27, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, considering the closest pH and volume.


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, we first calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:

\[
\text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃} = 55.85 + 3(17.01) = 106.88 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
\[
\text{Moles of Fe(OH)₃} = \frac{0.1}{106.88} \approx 0.0009358 \, \text{mol}
\]

The reaction between Fe(OH)₃ and HCl is:

\[
\text{Fe(OH)₃ + 3HCl → FeCl₃ + 3H₂O}
\]

From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of HCl. Therefore, the moles of HCl required are:

\[
\text{Moles of HCl} = 3 \times 0.0009358 = 0.0028074 \, \text{mol}
\]

Given that the HCl solution is 0.1 M, the volume of HCl required is:

\[
\text{Volume of HCl} = \frac{\text{Moles of HCl}}{\text{Concentration of HCl}} = \frac{0.0028074}{0.1} = 0.028074 \, \text{L} = 28.074 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

This matches closely with the volume of 28.05 cm³ in option C.

Next, to calculate the pH of the resulting solution, we consider the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ in water:

\[
\text{Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O ↔ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺}
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is derived from the solubility product of Fe(OH)₃:

\[
K_{\text{sp}} = [\text{Fe³⁺}][\text{OH}^-]^3 = 6 \times 10^{-38}
\]

The hydrolysis constant \( K \) for the reaction is related to \( K_{\text{sp}} \) and the ionic product of water (\( K_w = 10^{-14} \)):

\[
K = \frac{K_w^3}{K_{\text{sp}}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
K = \frac{(10^{-14})^3}{6 \times 10^{-38}} = \frac{10^{-42}}{6 \times 10^{-38}} = \frac{1}{6} \times 10^{-4} \approx 1.67 \times 10^{-5}
\]

The concentration of Fe³⁺ in the solution is:

\[
[\text{Fe³⁺}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe³⁺}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.0009358}{0.1} = 0.009358 \, \text{M}
\]

Using the hydrolysis equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{Fe(OH)₃}][\text{H⁺}]^3}{[\text{Fe³⁺}]}
\]

Assuming \( [\text{Fe(OH)₃}] = x \) and \( [\text{H⁺}] = 3x \), and substituting \( [\text{Fe³⁺}] \approx 0.009358 \), we solve for \( x \):

\[
1.67 \times 10^{-5} = \frac{(x)(3x)^3}{0.009358}
\]
\[
1.67 \times 10^{-5} = \frac{27x^4}{0.009358}
\]
\[
x^4 = \frac{(1.67 \times 10^{-5})(0.009358)}{27} \approx 5.77 \times 10^{-9}
\]
\[
x \approx (5.77 \times 10^{-9})^{1/4} \approx 8.7 \times 10^{-3}
\]

Thus, \( [\text{H⁺}] = 3x \approx 2.61 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log(2.61 \times 10^{-2}) \approx 1.58
\]

However, this value does not match any of the given options. Reassessing the problem, the closest match for the volume is 28.05 cm³ (option C), and the pH of 2.04 in option C is the most reasonable estimate based on the calculations.

**Answer: C**
