Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate them. But how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. The four equations are about divergence of E and B, the curl of E and B, and Gauss's laws for charge and magnetic monopoles.

Oh right! In our world, magnetic monopoles don't exist, so one of Maxwell's equations says that the divergence of B is zero. Because if you have a magnetic monopole, you'd have a divergence in B, similar to how electric charge has divergence in E.

So the question is, if in this universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that means magnetic monopoles exist. So Maxwell's equations would have to account for that. 

Let me think about each equation. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law: div E = rho/epsilon_0
2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: div B = 0 (in our universe)
3. Faraday's Law: curl E = -dB/dt
4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): curl H = J + dE/dt

If magnetic monopoles exist, then div B wouldn't be zero. So equation 2 would change. Right now, equation 2 is div B = 0. With monopoles, it would become div B = rho_m, where rho_m is the magnetic charge density.

Wait, but how does the existence of monopoles affect the other equations? Let me think. Faraday's Law (equation 3) and Ampère's Law (equation 4) involve time derivatives and curls. Do they change?

Hmm, when magnetic monopoles are present, besides changing Gauss's Law for B, another equation might change. Oh, right! In the presence of magnetic current (like a current made of moving monopoles), the Maxwell-Ampère Law would also change. 

Wait, let me think again. In our universe, the Ampère-Maxwell Law is curl H = J + dE/dt. If there's a magnetic current, then the equation for the curl of E might change. Because Faraday's Law would now have a term
