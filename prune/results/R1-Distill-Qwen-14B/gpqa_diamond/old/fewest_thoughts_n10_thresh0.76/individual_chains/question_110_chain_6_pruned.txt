Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, including maybe detecting exoplanets or measuring stellar velocities.

The question gives me five stars with different parameters, and I need to figure out which ones are detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. The key factors here are the apparent V magnitudes, I think. Because the question mentions that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag in V, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. So, the stars must have apparent V magnitudes less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Because both have to detect them. So the star must be detectable by both, meaning its apparent magnitude must be within the range both telescopes can observe. So, the star's V magnitude must be brighter than both 17 (for ESPRESSO) and 16 (for HIRES). Oh wait, no, wait. Because the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed by ESPRESSO", meaning that ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag. Similarly, HIRES can see up to 16 mag. So, a star must have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 to be seen by HIRES. Because HIRES can't see beyond 16, but ESPRESSO can go as faint as 17. So if a star is 17 mag, it can be seen by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES. But for both, the star's apparent mag must be <=16, because that's the stricter condition. Or wait, no. Let me think again. The brighter the star, the lower the magnitude. So if a star is magnitude 15, it's brighter than 16, which is brighter than 17. So, if a star has an apparent V magnitude that's <=16, then it's bright enough for HIRES, but also for ESPRESSO, since 16 is less than 17. So for both to detect, the apparent V mag must be less than or equal to 16 mag. But wait, the question says "brighter than 17" can be observed by ESPRESSO. Wait, that's confusing. Because in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So if a star is brighter than 17 in V, that means it's magnitude is less than 17, right? So the limit is that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <=17, and HIRES can observe V <=16. So, to be detected by both, the star's apparent V mag must be <=16. Because if it's between 16 and 17, it's visible by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.

Wait, but the question says, stars with V brighter than 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because higher magnitudes are fainter. So if a star is brighter than
