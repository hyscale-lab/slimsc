Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2 given a specific metric. Hmm, okay, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's involving dx and dy. So, this is probably describing some kind of surface embedded in higher dimensions, maybe like a sphere but in a different geometry.

I recall that in differential geometry, the area of a surface can be found using a double integral over the metric. The formula for the area element in two dimensions is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor. So, first, I need to compute the determinant of the metric tensor here.

The metric tensor components are functions of x and y. Let's write it out. The given metric is diagonal, so it's g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). The off-diagonal terms (g_xy and g_yx) are zero because there's no cross term. So, the determinant of g, det(g), is (g_xx * g_yy) - (g_xy^2 + ... ) but since g_xy is zero, det(g) is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Wait, no, wait. The determinant of a diagonal matrix is just the product of the diagonal elements. So yes, det(g) = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². Therefore, the area element becomes sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So sqrt([32/(4 - x² - y²)]²) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So, the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, the area of the pseudosphere would be the integral of dA over the entire surface. So I need to set up the limits of integration. What are the allowed values for x and y? The denominator is 4 - x² - y², which can't be zero because that would make the metric blow up. So, 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So
