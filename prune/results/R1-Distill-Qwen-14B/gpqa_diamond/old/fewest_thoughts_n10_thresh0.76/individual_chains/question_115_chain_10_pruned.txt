Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I need to find the angle between the directions of these two photons. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since an electron and a positron are involved, they annihilate each other, releasing energy in the form of photons. I think this process must conserve both energy and momentum because those are always conserved in closed systems.

So, the problem states that the electron is moving to the right (since it's coming from the left) with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2. Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But maybe I don't need to calculate their velocities directly. Wait, but I probably need their momenta and energies.

Let me break this down. Each particle (electron and positron) has a certain energy and momentum. When they annihilate, the photons must carry off the total energy and momentum of the system. Since the photons have the same energy, but their directions are given relative to the axes, I need to figure out how that works.

The problem says the two photons have the same energy. So each photon's energy is half of the total energy of the system. Wait, not necessarily, because the initial particles have rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But since they have different Lorentz factors, their total energies are different.

Wait, electrons and positrons have the same rest mass, right? So the electron's rest mass is m_e, same as the positron. So their rest energies are same, but their total energies depend on their gamma factors.

So the electron's total energy is gamma_e * m_e c². Similarly, the positron's is gamma_p * m_e c². So the total energy before collision is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m_e c².

Gamma for electron is 4, positron is 2. So total energy is (4 + 2) m_e c² = 6 m_e c². When they annihilate, the photons carry this energy. Since the electrons and positrons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. Wait, but because of their different speeds, their momenta might not be equal and opposite
