Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect shifts in the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a Neptune-mass planet. Both planets have circular orbits.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's. The options are A to D, some numbers.

Wait, but how do these shifts relate to the orbital period? I think the RV method's measured velocity amplitude (K) is what's important here. The formula for K, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, is given by some equation. Let me recall that.

Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ (1 AU is the unit?) Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact exponents.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (which for this problem, since the shifts are detected, probably sin i is the same, like i=90 degrees for both, so sin i=1), and the period of the planet. 

The formula is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) * ( (4π²) / (P^2) )^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something). Maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))) ), but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: for two planets, K1 and K2, the ratio K1/K2 would relate to the ratio of their (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))) ) terms.

Wait, in this problem, both planets have the same mass (Neptune), and the stars have the same mass (solar). So M_p1 = M_p2, and M_star1 = M_star2. So the ratio of K1 to K2 would be (P2/P1)^(1/3), because the other factors are the same. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so if K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3), then (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait, wait, let me get the exact relationship. The formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star (Neptune is much less than Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So we can simplify to K ≈ ( (27 pi G )^(1/3) ) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) * (1/c).

Wait, but constants won't matter when taking the ratio. So when comparing K1 and K2, since M_p1 = M_p2 and M_star1 = M_star2, the ratio K1/K2 = (1 / (P1^(1/3)) ) / (1 / (P2^(1/3)) ) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → which can be rearranged as (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait wait, no. Let me think again.

Let me write the ratio K1/K2:

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1) / ( M_star1^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (M_p2) / ( M_star2^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) ) ]

But since M_p1 = M_p2 and M_star1 = M_star2, this simplifies to:

K1/K2 = (1 / P1^(1/3)) ) / (1 / P2^(1/3)) ) = [ P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) ) ] = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, that's correct. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

But wait, in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, and K2 is 7. So K1 =5, K2=7. So K1/K2 =5/7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). We need to find P2/P1.

So cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait, no, because 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait no, no. Wait, let me see:

Wait, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So if I cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait, that would be (5³)/(7³) = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is ~0.364 times that of planet #1. So the question asks: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So that would be P2 / P1 = 0.364, which is about 0.36. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's.

Wait, but the question is "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So it's P2/P1. So 0.36 times as long. So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. The problem states that the shift for planet #1 is 5, and for planet #2 is 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is7.

So K1/K2 =5/7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So to find P2/P1: (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1, meaning planet #2 has a shorter period than planet #1. So the question asks how many times longer is planet #2’s period: it's 0.364 times, which is shorter. So the answer is ~0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options: option A is ~0.36, which is what I calculated.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{M_{\text{star}}^{2/3} P^{1/3}}
\]

Since both planets have the same mass (\( M_p \)) and orbit stars with the same mass (\( M_{\text{star}} \)), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) simplifies to:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides gives:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately \( 0.364 \) times that of planet #1. This means planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. The question asks how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1, so the ratio is \( P_2 / P_1 = 0.364 \), which corresponds to option A.
