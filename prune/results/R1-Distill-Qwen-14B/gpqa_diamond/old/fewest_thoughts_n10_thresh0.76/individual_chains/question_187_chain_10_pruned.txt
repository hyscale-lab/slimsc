Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the listed stars meet the S/N ratio condition with ESPRESSO when coupled to an 8m VLT telescope. The criteria is a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

First, I should probably recall what ESPRESSO is capable of. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. It's used for a variety of astronomical observations, including measuring the radial velocities of stars, which helps in detecting exoplanets. 

The key here is the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). The higher the S/N, the easier it is to detect a star. The question specifies a minimum S/N of 10 per binned pixel. So I need to determine for each star whether, with a 1-hour exposure, the S/N would meet or exceed this threshold.

Let's think about the factors that influence S/N. The S/N ratio depends on the brightness of the star, the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area (which affects how much light it gathers), the spectrograph's efficiency, and the noise sources like background radiation or the star's own noise (like photon noise). 

Wait, absolute magnitude relates to the intrinsic brightness of a star. The formula for calculating apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d/10), where M is absolute magnitude and d is distance in parsecs. So for each star, I can compute their apparent magnitude.

But how does apparent magnitude relate to S/N? Because brighter stars (lower apparent magnitude) will have higher S/N. So I need to figure out for each star what their apparent V magnitude is, then determine if the S/N is at least 10.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to estimate the S/N based on the star's apparent brightness. I remember that the S/N for a star in a spectrograph can be approximated by a formula involving the exposure time, the system's efficiency, and the star's flux.

The formula I vaguely remember is S/N = (flux * exposure time * efficiency) / sqrt(flux * exposure time * efficiency + noise^2). But maybe for simplicity, it's often approximated as S/N proportional to sqrt(exposure time) and sqrt(flux). Wait, but when the noise is dominated by the Poisson noise (photon noise), then the S/N scales as sqrt(n), where n is the number of photons detected. So S/N is proportional to sqrt(flux * t), where t is exposure time.

Wait, but for a fixed telescope and instrument setup, the flux a star provides depends on its apparent brightness. The brighter the star (lower magnitude), the more flux, so higher S/N.

But how do I relate apparent magnitude to S/N? Let's think about the relation between magnitude and flux. The formula for flux is f = f0 * 10^(-0.4*m), where m is the
