Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are one upper-right and the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.

Wait, so Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Which is the factor by which time, length, and mass change in special relativity. So gamma equals total energy divided by rest mass energy. For an electron, the rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, I think. But wait, since we're dealing with their energies, maybe I can get their total energies from the Lorentz factors.

So the electron is moving left to right (from the left) with gamma_e =4. The positron is moving right to left (from the right) with gamma_p=2. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so its velocity is opposite to the electron's. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

When they collide, they annihilate. So the total energy and momentum must be considered here. Because in annihilation, the conservation laws must hold: conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.

The problem says that the two photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So, the photons are moving in opposite vertical directions but both to the right. Wait, no, upper-right and lower-right imply that both are moving to the right but one up and the other down. Hmm, but that can't be right because if both are moving to the right, their momenta would add in the same direction. But since the problem states they have the same energy, maybe their angles are symmetric in some way.

Wait, but the two photons would have to carry away the total energy and momentum of the system. Let's think about the initial system before annihilation.

The initial system consists of an electron and a positron moving towards each other. So we need to calculate their energies and momenta.

Let me denote the speed of light as c. But since we
