Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: We have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. We need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, right? So the benzene ring has two substituents attached. The total number of carbons is 8, including the benzene's 6 carbons. That means each substituent must have a total of 2 carbons? Wait, because 6 + 2 (from substituents) = 8. No, wait, maybe each substituent has a certain number of carbons. Let me think again.

Wait, the compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6 carbons, so the substituents add 2 carbons. But since it's di-substituted, each substituent would contribute one carbon each. Wait, but substituents can sometimes be more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are groups like -OCH3 (methoxy), but that's a single carbon. Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none? No, wait, no. Because it's di-substituted
