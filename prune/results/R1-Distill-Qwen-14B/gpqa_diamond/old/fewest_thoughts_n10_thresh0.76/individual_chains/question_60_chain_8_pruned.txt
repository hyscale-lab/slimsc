Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about an astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth in a super fast spacecraft. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective. The options are whether they'll die before reaching, or if it takes 72, 81, or 77 years.

Wait, but first, some background. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, special relativity comes into play. Specifically, time dilation and length contraction effects. So, I think I need to consider these relativistic effects here.

Let me jot down what I know:

- The spacecraft speed, v = 0.99999987 * c. That's really, really close to the speed of light. So relativistic effects will be significant, but not infinitely so.

- The astronaut's age is 22, but we're looking at how much time passes for them. So from their frame of reference, how much time does the trip take?

Wait, but wait. The problem says the spacecraft is traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. I think I need to figure out the distance between these two places first. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, right? How far is it?

Hmm, I think the average distance is about 160,000 light-years. Let me see. Yeah, I've heard that it's roughly 160,000 ly away. So, from Earth to LMC is about that distance.

So, the distance D is approximately 160,000 light-years. But wait, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. So, let's calculate the time from Earth's frame of reference first, then apply the time dilation.

Wait, but the astronaut's time is their proper time, which is shorter than the time measured in Earth's frame because of time dilation. Or is it the other way around? No, wait. Proper time is the shortest time. So, the astronaut's own clock runs slower compared to Earth's frame. No, wait, no.
