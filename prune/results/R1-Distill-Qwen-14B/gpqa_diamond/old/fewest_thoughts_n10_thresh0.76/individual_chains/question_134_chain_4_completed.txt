Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. 

The question says: Calculate the enthalpy when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D, some in kcal and others in kJ. Wait, units are mixed here. Oh, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually in kJ/mol, but some options have kcal. I'll have to pay attention to that.

First, I need to figure out what's happening when these acids and base are mixed. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is also a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. When they're mixed, an acid-base neutralization reaction should occur.

So, let's write down the acids and the base. Each will contribute H+ ions. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when HCl and H2SO4 react with Ba(OH)2, they'll donate H+ and the base will donate OH-.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So each molecule can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and each formula unit can provide two OH- ions because it's Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH⁻.

So, I need to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, the neutralization will involve H+ + OH- → H2O. But since H2SO4 provides two H+, each mole gives two H+.

Wait, but wait a second: when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction might be a bit more involved. Let me think about the reaction stoichiometry.

HCl is a monoprotic acid. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a base that gives two OH- per mole.

So, total H+ from HCl and H2SO4, and total OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but when mixing, the H+ and OH- will combine. The total moles of H+ and OH- will determine which is the limiting reactant.

Wait, let's calculate each.

First, let's find the moles of each substance.

Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters)

For HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is monoprotic, 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since it's diprotic, each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 ×2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles of OH-.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant.

So, all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+ to form water. The remaining H+ is 0.08 moles.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. Because H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it's fully ionized. Same with HCl and Ba(OH)2.

So, the reaction will proceed as follows: H+ + OH- → H2O.

The total amount of H+ available is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So, OH- is limiting. So, 0.2 moles of H+ will react, producing 0.2 moles of H2O, and 0.08 moles of H+ will remain unreacted.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because H2SO4 is diprotic, but when it's a strong acid, it fully dissociates in two steps? Or does it just donate both H+ ions completely?

Wait, actually, for H2SO4, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait. No, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or is it H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^-? I think I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation step. The first H+ comes off completely: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or wait, no. H2SO4 is a strong acid for the first H+, so it dissociates completely to H+ and HSO4^-.

Wait, so the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, that can't be right because I think H2SO4 is a diprotic acid where the first H+ is strong, and the second is weaker. So first, H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or split into steps.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For sulfuric acid, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait. Actually, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- and that's complete. The second dissociation, HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-, is not complete but for the purpose of strong acids, I think H2SO4 is considered to donate two H+ when in solution. Wait, no. Wait, in reality, the first H is very strong, the second is weaker but still somewhat strong. So in dilute solutions, the second H+ may dissociate to a significant extent, but not completely.

But in this problem, since H2SO4 is a strong acid, I think it's considered to fully ionize both H+ ions. So, each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

So, with that in mind, the earlier calculation holds: H2SO4 contributes 0.18 moles of H+, HCl contributes 0.1, total H+ is 0.28.

Ba(OH)2 contributes 0.2 moles of OH-.

So, when they mix, OH- will react with H+.

Each mole of OH- reacts with one mole of H+ to form H2O.

So, 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

So, that leaves 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait. The H+ comes from two sources: HCl and H2SO4. So, which H+ is left? Well, it doesn't matter; they're all H+ ions.

So, the total H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So, 0.2 H+ reacts with 0.2 OH- to make 0.2 H2O.

Wait, but wait, what about the excess H+? Because you have 0.08 moles H+ left, which is acidic.

So, the solution will be acidic because there's more H+ than OH-.

But for the purpose of calculating enthalpy of neutralization, I think we only consider the reaction that happens, which is the neutralization part.

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form water.

So, the amount of heat released depends on the amount of H+ and OH- that actually react.

So, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change per mole is usually around -57 kJ/mol (but I think sometimes it's -55.8 or similar, but I'll use -57 for simplicity).

So, for each mole of H+ and OH- that react, we release 57 kJ (exothermic, so negative sign).

In this case, 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH- react, so the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, so maybe I should double-check the units.

Wait, wait a second! Oh, the options have some in kcal and some in kJ. So, I need to make sure which unit is correct.

Wait, the question is to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given in kJ/mol H+.

Wait, let me think again. The enthalpy change for the reaction H+ + OH- → H2O(l) is about -57.3 kJ/mol. So, per mole of H+ that reacts, it's -57.3 kJ.

So, in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ reacted, so 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is way higher, so that doesn't fit. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, so perhaps I should convert kJ to kcal?

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So, 11.46 kJ is how many kcal?

11.46 kJ / 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ 2.736 kcal. But wait, that's positive, but our value is negative. So, the enthalpy change would be -2.736 kcal. Which is close to option A: -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but I thought earlier I had -11.46 kJ.

Hmm, the options are a bit confusing. Let's make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in considering the moles.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, let's recalculate:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since it's HCl → H+ + Cl-, so 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-, so 0.09 *2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-; so 0.1 *2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

So, correct earlier.

So, moles of H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So, OH- is limiting. So, 0.2 H+ reacts with 0.2 OH-.

So, the reaction produces 0.2 moles of H2O.

So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

That's approximately -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, -11.42 kcal would be about (-11.42) *4.184 ≈ -47.8 kJ. That's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of acid, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the neutralization in terms of the actual reaction between the specific acid and base.

Wait, maybe I should think about the stoichiometry of the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Because H2SO4 is diprotic, and Ba(OH)2 is diprotic as well. So, the reaction could be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, let's write that balanced equation.

H2SO4 (aq) + Ba(OH)2 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2 H2O (l)

So, that's the net ionic reaction.

In this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with a mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce 2 moles of H2O.

So, the enthalpy change for this reaction is the enthalpy of neutralization for this specific acid-base reaction.

But wait, the problem is mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So, perhaps the HCl and H2SO4 will both donate H+ ions, and the Ba(OH)2 will donate OH- ions.

But the neutralization would involve all the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 with all the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but in that case, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

Which is the limiting reagent?

Yes, as before, OH- is less. So, all OH- reacts, 0.2 H+ reacts, 0.08 H+ remains.

So, the total moles of H+ that have been neutralized are 0.2. So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) kJ = -11.46 kJ.

So, that's about -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ.

Looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.42 *4.184 ≈ -47.7 kJ. Not matching.

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher; perhaps it's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the fact that H2SO4 is diprotic, and thus each mole contributes two equivalents of H+.

Wait, but I did account for that. H2SO4 gives 0.18 moles of H+.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to calculate the total equivalents of acid and base.

HCl: 0.2 M *0.5 L = 0.1 equivalents (since 1:1).

H2SO4: 0.3 M *0.3 L = 0.09 equivalents, but since diprotic, 0.09 *2 = 0.18 equivalents.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L =0.1 equivalents. Since it's diprotic (each OH- is 1 equivalent), 0.1 *2= 0.2 equivalents.

So, equivalents of acid: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28.

Equivalents of base: 0.2.

So, the acid is in excess by 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 equivalents.

So, the neutralization reaction would involve 0.2 equivalents of H+ and OH-, releasing 0.2 *57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ of energy (exothermic, so -11.46 kJ).

Hmm, so that's -11.46 kJ. None of the options exactly match, but perhaps the closest is option B in kcal. But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me compute what -11.42 kcal is in kJ.

1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So, 11.42 kcal is 11.42 *4.184 ≈ 47.8 kJ. So, if the enthalpy is -47.8 kJ, which would correspond to about -11.42 kcal. But wait, no: the enthalpy in my calculation is -11.46 kJ, which would be about -2.736 kcal.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Because 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ.

So, 11.46 kJ is how many kcal? 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.736 kcal. So, the enthalpy change is -2.736 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. Close enough, considering rounding.

But wait, why is that the case?

Oh, perhaps I messed up the units. Because the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ or per mole of reaction.

Wait, another approach: the total moles of H+ produced (from both acids) is 0.28. The moles of OH- is 0.2.

So, the neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

Each such mole reaction gives off 57.3 kJ. So, 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ. So, the total enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the question expects the total enthalpy in kcal.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.736 kcal. So, approximately -2.74 kcal. Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close. So, is that the correct answer?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options also have D as -16.0 kJ. So, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total heat released considering the contributions from each acid and the base.

Wait, but HCl and H2SO4 are both acids, and Ba(OH)2 is the base. So, perhaps the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is more complicated. Let me think about the neutralization reaction.

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction is known as the enthalpy of neutralization for this specific acid-base pair.

But wait, in this problem, we have excess HCl. So, perhaps the HCl will also react with any remaining OH- after the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Hmm, that's a possibility. So, maybe first, H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react, and then the remaining OH- reacts with HCl.

Let me approach it step by step.

First, find out how much Ba(OH)2 is present. It's 0.1 moles.

H2SO4 is 0.09 moles. The reaction between them is 1:1.

So, all 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2.

So, moles of Ba(OH)2 used: 0.09.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 remaining: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles.

So, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles. Each mole produces 2 moles of H2O, so 0.18 moles of H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 reacting releases a certain amount of heat. What is the enthalpy change for this reaction?

The standard enthalpy of reaction for H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

I think the enthalpy change for this reaction is about -2.72 × 10^3 kJ per mole? Or wait, I'm not sure. Let me think: the enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, but in this case, each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-. So, the reaction produces 2 moles of H2O.

So, the enthalpy change for this reaction would be 2 * (-57.3) kJ = -114.6 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

But wait, that can't be right because the reaction produces two moles of H2O, each with a ΔH of -57.3 kJ per mole H+.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate based on the moles of H+ and OH-.

In this specific reaction, each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So, when they react, 2 H+ + 2 OH- → 2 H2O. So, that's 2 moles of H+ reacting, releasing 2 ×57.3 = 114.6 kJ. So, the ΔH for this reaction is -114.6 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

So, for 0.09 moles of H2SO4 reacting, the ΔH would be 0.09 × (-114.6) kJ = -10.314 kJ.

After this reaction, how much OH- is left?

We started with 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.2 moles of OH-.

0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2 reacted, which uses 0.18 moles of H+ (from H2SO4) and 0.18 moles of OH- (since each Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-; 0.09 ×2=0.18 moles OH-).

So, initial OH-:0.2 moles.

After reaction: 0.2 -0.18 =0.02 moles of OH- left.

Now, the remaining OH- (0.02 moles) will react with the H+ from HCl.

HCl contributes 0.1 moles of H+.

So, OH- is 0.02 moles. So, it will react with 0.02 moles of H+.

So, the second reaction is between HCl and the remaining OH-.

Each mole of H+ reacts with OH- to produce H2O, releasing 57.3 kJ per mole.

So, 0.02 moles reaction: 0.02 × (-57.3) = -1.146 kJ.

So, total enthalpy change is the sum of both reactions.

First reaction: -10.314 kJ.

Second reaction: -1.146 kJ.

Total ΔH = (-10.314) + (-1.146) = -11.46 kJ.

Which is approximately -11.46 kJ.

Looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.8 kJ, so not matching.

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach where H+ from both acids and OH- from the base are considered together is correct, but it leads to an answer not exactly matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the enthalpy per mole of the reaction, not per mole of H+.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually for the reaction H+ + OH- → H2O(l), which is -57.3 kJ/mol.

So, in our case, we have 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, so the total is 0.2 × (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

So, that's about -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct choice is between the options given.

Looking the options:

A) -2.72 kcal ≈ -11.46 kJ (since 1 kcal ≈4.184 kJ), but wait, 2.72 ×4.184 is about 11.44 kJ. So, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.44 kJ.

So, the answer is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, the calculation is 0.2 ×57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ, which is -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal (since 11.46 /4.184≈2.736, but option A is -2.72, which is close enough).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but none of the options match. Let me look again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, like -55.8 kJ/mol.

So, 0.2 moles × (-55.8) = -11.16 kJ.

Which would be about -2.67 kcal (11.16 /4.184≈2.67).

Closest to option A) -2.72 kcal.

Thus, the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but why is option B present as -11.42 kcal? Because if someone thought in terms of kcal, but 11.46 kJ would be about 2.73 kcal, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the total heat released from all possible reactions, but I think the initial method is correct.

So, I think the correct answer is option A) -2.72 kcal.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (monoprotic):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (diprotic):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since Ba(OH)₂ is diprotic, it contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

   Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Identify the limiting reactant:**  
   OH⁻ is the limiting reactant because it is present in fewer moles (\( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \)) compared to H⁺ (\( 0.28 \, \text{moles} \)).

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change for neutralization:**  
   The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \), and the standard enthalpy of neutralization is \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   Since \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H⁺ and OH⁻} \) react, the total enthalpy change is:  
   \[
   \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57.3) \, \text{kJ} = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
   \]

4. **Convert to kcal (if necessary):**  
   \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \), so:  
   \[
   -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.736 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

5. **Match with the options:**  
   The closest option to \( -2.736 \, \text{kcal} \) is **A) -2.72 kcal**.

Thus, the correct answer is **A) -2.72 kcal**.

Answer: A
