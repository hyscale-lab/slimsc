Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The problem is about some reactions and determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are various symmetry groups, so I think I need to figure out what E is first.

Let me list out the given information:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. So, let's try to figure out what these substances could be.

First, reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Bright red product... I'm thinking maybe a transition metal compound. Common bright red solids include things like Fe2O3 (but that's reddish), or maybe something like copper compounds. Alternatively, think about lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown, but not red. Oh wait, maybe it's something like sulfur? No, sulfur is yellow. Wait, maybe it's a reaction involving lead or iron. Alternatively, thinking about metal sulfides? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, if A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl₂), but 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl₂ per mole of Na. That would produce NaCl as the product, but I don't think that's red. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide reacting with something else.

Wait, let me think about the second reaction: C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. So, what's a reaction that produces a hazardous product? Maybe C is a metal chloride, and D is something else. Or perhaps C is a sulfide.

Wait, the fourth point says that D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, if B is a diatomic gas (like O₂, N₂, or Cl₂), and D reacts with B in 1:1, perhaps D is H₂O? No, because H₂O and O₂ would form H2O2? But H2O2 is not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is something like H2S, but that's a gas, but reacting with B as O2, would form H2O. Hmm, but H2O is a solvent.

Wait, but if D is H2S and B is O2, then D (H2S) + B (O2) → H2O? But that's not a direct 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe D is something else.

Wait another angle: looking at reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. Strong acid is like HCl, H2SO4, etc. Weak acid is like H2CO3 or
