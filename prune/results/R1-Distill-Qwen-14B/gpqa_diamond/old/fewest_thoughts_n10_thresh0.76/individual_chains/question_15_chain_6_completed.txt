Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the planet's orbital parameters.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter, I think. Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, same radius but different masses. I remember that more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe Planet_1's star hasn't expanded yet because it's not evolved, while Planet_2's is slightly evolved. So same radius now.

The question is about transit probability. I think the probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Oh wait, no, I think it's more about the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But that's the geometric probability, right?

The formula I remember is the probability P ≈ (R_star / a) * (something else?), where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, I think the geometric probability is roughly (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital radius. So a bigger a (farther planet) would mean a lower probability. But wait, no—because the planet's orbital plane must be aligned for a transit. So the chance is higher when the planet is closer because a is smaller, so R*/a is larger.

Wait, let's get this straight. The transit probability P is approximately (R* + R_p) / a, where R_p is the planet's radius. But since Earth-like planets are small compared to stars, R_p is negligible, so P ≈ R*/a. So if a is smaller, the probability is higher.

So the probability is inversely proportional to a. But wait, a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. The law states that a^3 ∝ (M_star) * (P)^2. So a = [ (G M_star (P/(2π))^2 ) ]^(1/3). Or maybe more accurately, the formula is a^3 = [ G (M_star) P^2 ] / (4π²), so a = [ (G M_star P²) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3).

Wait, but since a is the semi-major axis, and P is the period, a scales with (M_star * P²)^(1/3). So for two planets with same mass, but different periods and host masses, we can compare their a.

Given that, let's compute the a for both planets.

For Planet_1: P1 = P, since it's three times shorter than Planet_2's. Let me clarify: the question says Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has period P, Planet_1 has P/3.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." Oh right, that means Planet_1's period is P1 = (1/3)*P2. Because if P1 is three times shorter, it's a third of P2.

So P2 = 3 * P1. Wait, no, let me think again. If Planet_1 has a period of, say, 10 days, then Planet_2 has 30 days—so Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So P1 = P2 / 3.

But let's get the actual a for each.

For each planet:

a1 = [ (G M1 P1² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)
a2 = [ (G M2 P2² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

But M1 is twice M2. So M1 = 2 * M2.

And P1 = (1/3) * P2.

So plugging in:

a1 = [ (G * 2 M2 * ( (P2/3) )^2 ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)
= [ (G M2 P2^2 * 2 ) / (4 π²) * (1/9) ) ]^(1/3)
= [ (2/(9)) * (G M2 P2²) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3)
= [ (2/9) / (4) ) * (G M2 P2²)/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3)
Wait, perhaps simplifying more carefully.

Let me factor out the constants:

a1 = [ (2 * (P1^2) ) / (9) ) * (G M2 P2²) ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3) ? Hmm, maybe I should calculate the ratio a2 / a1.

Wait, better approach: calculate a2 in terms of a1.

Wait, let's compute the ratio a2/a1.

a2 = [ (G M2 P2²)^(1/3) ) / ( (4 π²)^(1/3) ) ]

Similarly, a1 = [ (G * 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) ]^(1/3) / (4 π²)^(1/3)

So a1 = [ G * 2 M2 * (P2² / 9) ) ]^(1/3) / (4 π²)^(1/3)

So a1 = [ (2/9) * G M2 P2² ]^(1/3) / (4 π²)^(1/3)

a2 is [ (G M2 P2²) ]^(1/3 ) / (4 π²)^(1/3 )

So the ratio a2 / a1 is [ (G M2 P2²) / ( (2/9) G M2 P2² ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Inside the brackets: (1) / (2/9) ) = 9/2.

So it's (9/2)^(1/3) = cube root of (4.5) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ a1 * 1.65.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute a2 / a1:

a2/a1 = [ (G M2 P2²) / ( (2/9) G M2 P2^2 ) ) ]^(1/3)

= [ (1) / (2/9) ) ]^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, but wait, no: a2 is larger than a1 because a2 = 1.65 a1. So the semi-major axis of Planet_2 is about 1.65 times that of Planet_1.

But transit probability is proportional to R*/a. Since both stars have same R*, but R* is same for both, so P ∝ 1/a.

So P1 is higher if a is smaller.

Because the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So P1 = R* / a1

P2 = R* / a2

So P1 / P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2 / a1 = 1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait, the ratio is a2 = 1.65 a1. So P1 = R*/a1, P2 = R*/a2 = R*/(1.65 a1) → P2 = (1/1.65) P1.

So P1 is higher than P2. So Planet_1 has higher probability.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher by a factor of approximately 1.65 times.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is cube root of 20 or something, but our calculation gives 1.65.

So the correct choice is C. Researchers prefer Planet_1.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \), with smaller \( a \) leading to higher probabilities.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* \cdot P^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period, we calculate the semi-major axes for Planet_1 and Planet_2. Planet_1 has a period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (three times shorter than Planet_2's period) and a host star mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \). Substituting these values:

\[
a_1 \propto \left( M_1 \cdot P_1^2 \right)^{1/3} = \left( 2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} M_2 \cdot P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

\[
a_2 \propto \left( M_2 \cdot P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Taking the ratio \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \):

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{\left( M_2 \cdot P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}}{\left( \frac{2}{9} M_2 \cdot P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}} = \left( \frac{1}{\frac{2}{9}} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{9}{2} \right)^{1/3} \approx 1.65.
\]

Thus, \( a_2 \approx 1.65a_1 \). Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the probability for Planet_1 is higher than that for Planet_2 by a factor of approximately 1.65.

Given the options:

- **A)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher probability.
- **B)** Incorrect. The probability difference is not 1.5 times.
- **C)** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
- **D)** Incorrect. The probability difference is not 2.7 times.

The researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher transit probability.
