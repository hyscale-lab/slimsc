Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to pick which combination is correct.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible interactions (operators) consistent with the Standard Model symmetries, but beyond the SM scale. So the SM itself has certain symmetries, and SMEFT should respect those as well, right?

Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, which includes rotations and boosts. So all the operators in SMEFT must also be Lorentz-invariant. That makes sense because if the theory didn't have Lorentz symmetry, it wouldn't be a valid relativistic theory. So operator 1 must be respected.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shift in position, which gives momentum conservation). Since SMEFT is a effective field theory, it's based on the same principles as the SM, which includes Poincare symmetry. So all operators must respect this as well. So option 2 must be respected.

Wait, wait. But wait a second. I'm a bit confused between Lorentz and Poincare. Because Lorentz is a subgroup of Poincare. Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. So if a theory respects Poincare symmetry, it automatically respects Lorentz. But does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? Because when you write down the SMEFT Lagrangian, you have to include all possible terms respecting the symmetries of the SM, which include Poincare. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are 1 and 2 as separate. For example, option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1,2,4. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, I thought that sometimes people talk about Lorentz symmetry and Poincare separately. Because Poincare includes translations, which involve
