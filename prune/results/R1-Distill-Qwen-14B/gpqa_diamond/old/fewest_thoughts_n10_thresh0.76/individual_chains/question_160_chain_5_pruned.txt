Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length, a. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ hits this aperture along the z-axis, it creates a diffraction pattern with maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large, which I think means the aperture becomes a circle because a polygon with infinitely many sides is a circle. Oh wait, but wait, let me think again. No, actually, when N approaches infinity, a polygon becomes a circle, right? So the aperture is effectively a circular one.

Wait, but wait. The problem says all apothems are the same. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular N-gon, all apothems are the same, which makes sense. But if N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle because the sides become infinitesimally small. So the effective shape is a circle with radius equal to the apothem a?

Wait, no, not quite. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius (the distance from the center to a vertex) R. The apothem a = R * cos(π/N), I think. But when N is very large, π/N becomes very small, so cos(π/N)≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²) → 1 as N→infinity. So a ≈ R, but wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, wait. The apothem (a) is the radius of the inscribed circle, while the radius of the polygon (from center to a vertex) is R. So for a regular polygon, as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem a becomes equal to the radius of that circle. So the effective aperture is a circle with radius a.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. For a regular polygon, the relationship between the apothem 'a' and the radius 'R' (the distance from center to a vertex) is a = R * cos(π/N). So as N approaches infinity (polygon becomes a circle), π/N approaches zero, and cos(π/N) approaches 1. So a approaches R. So the radius of the circle is a, right?
