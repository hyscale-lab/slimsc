Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that entropy for a black hole is related to its area, thanks to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, right? So I need to find the area of the event horizon to get the entropy.

Wait, the question gives me the angular size θ and the distance d. Oh right, because the event horizon's size as seen from Earth is an angle θ, so I can use that to find the actual size. I think the formula for the linear size from angular size is approximately L ≈ d * θ, but I should be careful about the units.

Let me think about the units. The distance d is given in parsecs, and the angular size is in degrees. I need to convert these into meters and radians because the formula requires SI units. Oh yes, 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. And to convert degrees to radians, I multiply by π/180.

So first, let's compute the actual size of the event horizon, which is the diameter of the event horizon. The formula for angular size is θ ≈ L / d, so solving for L gives L ≈ d * θ. Wait, but wait, that's a small angle approximation, right? So for very small angles, sinθ ≈ θ ≈ tanθ. So yes, L ≈ d * θ.

Wait, no, actually the event horizon radius is R = 2 G M / c², but I don't know the mass here. Alternatively, the angular size can give me the radius. Hmm, so maybe the diameter is L = 2 R, so R would be L/2. But let me proceed step by step.

Calculating L:

d = 1e10 parsecs. So in meters, that's 1e10 * 3.086e16 m/pc. Let me compute that. 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters.

Angular size θ is 1e-17 degrees. To convert that to radians: θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180) ≈ 1e-17 * π/(180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So L = d * θ_rad ≈ 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad ≈ 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 = Let's compute that. 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 = (3.086 * 1.745) * 1e7. 3.086 * 1.745 is approximately 5.37. So 5.37e7 meters. So L is about 5.37e7 meters.

Wait, that's the linear size as observed. But wait, no
