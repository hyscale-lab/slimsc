Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what I can do. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying hydrogens and oxygens.

First, I'll read the question again to make sure I don't miss any details.

The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there are usually due to O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peak could also be from an alcohol, maybe. Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, those numbers ring a bell. 1700 is often a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with something else. Wait, 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated groups, like in a conjugated ketone or maybe an amide, but amides have N-H which we might see in IR as well. But wait, in this case, the IR has a broad peak at 3000 which might not fit an amide. Let me think: amides have N-H which usually show up around 3300 as sharp peaks, but a broad peak at 3000 might suggest O-H, like an alcohol or carboxylic acid.

But wait, another thought: 1700 is a strong carbonyl. If there are two peaks, maybe one is a carbonyl and another is an adjacent group. Oh, wait, 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group attached? Like a ketone or an ester or something.

Moving on, the 1H NMR has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene. So that suggests the presence of a double bond, probably in the structure.

The Mass Spectrum shows a fragment peak at m
