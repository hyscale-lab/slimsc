Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian here, and I need to find the mass dimension of κ and figure out if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about Lagrangians and renormalizability.

The given Lagrangian is 𝒜_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which are the commutators of the gamma matrices. So σ is antisymmetric, which probably relates to the field strength tensor F.

Wait, F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. F^{μν} = ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ, right? So this interaction term is between a fermion current and the electromagnetic field.

But wait, no, because the Lagrangian is given as an interaction term. So maybe this is a term that's beyond the minimal coupling? Oh, wait, no—wait, the minimal coupling usually replaces the partial derivatives with covariant derivatives, but this looks like a different kind of term. Oh, right, this looks similar to the term in the Dirac equation when you have a tensor current, maybe something like the spinor current interacting with the electromagnetic tensor.

Anyway, to find the mass dimension of κ. I think the way to do this is to ensure the entire Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action must be dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1).

So each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4. So let's break down the dimensions of each part in the term.

The Lagrangian term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's find the dimensions of each part.

First, I know that the fermion fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2 each. Because in four dimensions, a Dirac spinor field has mass dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ would have the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2.

σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (since they're just matrices). The commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] is also dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is dimensionless too. So when we have ψ̄ σ ψ, that would be (3/2) + (3/2) = 3 for the ψ terms, and σ is 0, so that part is 3. Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. F has the same dimension as the derivative of the gauge field A. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1, because the covariant derivative is ∂ + i e A, and ∂ has dimension 1. So F is ∂A, which would have dimension 2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

So putting it all together, the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions: κ * (3) * (2) = κ * 6. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So κ*6 = 4 → κ has dimension 4/6 = 2/3... Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 2/3. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, wait. Let's double-check. Maybe I messed up the dimensions of F. Because F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Each term is ∂μ acting on Aν, which is (∂) * A. ∂ is dimension 1, A is dimension 1, so each term is dimension 2. So F has dimension 2. So that part is correct.

Wait, but the term is F^{μν}, which is dimension 2.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has
