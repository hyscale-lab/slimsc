Okay, so I'm trying to answer this nuclear decay question. Let me read it carefully.

The decay process is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. And in the variant, it's 2A → 2B + 2E + M, where M is an exotic, massless particle. The question is about how the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles changes.

Hmm, I remember that in nuclear decays, the energy distribution of emitted particles can be continuous or discrete. For example, in beta decay, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because the process involves a lot of energy that's shared in various ways.

In the original decay (2A → 2B + 2E + 2V), the E particles have a continuous spectrum with an endpoint Q. So why is that? Oh right, because when multiple particles are emitted, like two E and two V, the energy can be shared among them. This usually leads to a continuous spectrum because the particles can take different amounts of energy as long as the total energy and momentum are conserved.

Now, in the variant, two V particles are replaced by a single massless M. Let me think about that. Wait, the original decay emits two V particles, and the variant emits one M instead. So the change is from 2V to M, which is massless and exotic. Since M is massless, it's probably similar to a photon or a neutrino in terms of dynamics.

Wait, but the original decay has two Vs. Now it's one M. So the number of emitted particles is different. Let me consider the conservation laws here. Energy and momentum must be conserved. But since M is massless, maybe it behaves like a photon, which carries energy and momentum but has no rest mass.

In the original case, the system emits multiple particles (two E and two V). So the E particles would have a range of energies because the energy can be partitioned in different ways among the emitted particles. That's why their spectrum is continuous.

In the variant, instead of two V particles, we have one M. So the number of particles is different. Let me think about how that affects the energy spectrum of E.

Wait, the original decay has 2E. So in the original, the decay products include 2E and 2V. Now in the variant, it's 2E and one M. So perhaps the number of particles that
