Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclooctatetraene and going through several steps to form a final product. I need to determine the structure of the major isomer of product 3, which is the final product. There are four options given, each with a name and a SMILES notation. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, let me break down the problem into the individual steps.

Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene is heated with maleic anhydride in a 1:1 ratio to form product 1.

Hmm, cyclooctatetraene is a conjugated eight-membered ring with four double bonds. Maleic anhydride is a dienophile. So, heating them together in a 1:1 ratio probably leads to a Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, but cyclooctatetraene is a diene? Or maybe not. Wait, no, cyclooctatetraene has four double bonds in a conjugated system. So maybe it can act as a conjugated diene in some fashion.

Wait, the Diels-Alder reaction is between a diene and a dienophile. Cyclooctatetraene has four double bonds, but for the Diels-Alder, you usually need a conjugated diene (like 1,3-butadiene) and a dienophile like maleic anhydride.

Wait, cyclooctatetraene is a cyclic molecule with alternating double bonds. So perhaps it can undergo some ring-opening to form a diene, or maybe it can act as a diene in a different way. Alternatively, maybe it's undergoing a [4+2] cycloaddition with maleic anhydride as the dienophile. But wait, cyclooctatetraene is a non-aromatic, tub-shaped molecule, right? So maybe it can act as a conjugated diene.

Wait, another thought: cyclooctatetraene can act as a
