Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about diffraction patterns created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating intensity maxima and minima. The question is specifically about the angular distance between the first two minima when the number of sides N is infinitely large. Oh wait, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle.

Wait, but wait. No, actually, the question says the polygon has all apothems of the same length a. Apothems are the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, all apothems are the same. So if N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle, but the apothem (which would be the radius for a circle) is a.

But wait, no. Because for a circle, the apothem is the same as the radius. So the radius r is equal to a in this case. So the aperture is a circle with radius a. But wait, no, wait. Because for a circle, the apothem is the same as the radius. So if all apothems are the same length 'a' for any regular polygon, when N approaches infinity, the radius of the circle is 'a'. So the circle's radius is 'a'.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a circle, this would be the radius. So in this case, for the circle, the radius r is equal to a.

But wait, another thought: when light is diffracted by a circular aperture, the pattern on the screen is called the Airy disk. The first minimum occurs at an angle given by the formula θ ≈ 1.22 λ / (diameter), right? Because the formula for the first minimum in a single-slit diffraction is a sinθ = λ, but for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ where (π a sinθ) = λ, but wait, no. Wait, I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let me think. In single-slit diffraction, the intensity minima occur where a sinθ = mλ, m=1,2,... So the first minimum is at θ where sinθ = λ/a. But for a circular aperture, the situation is a bit different because it's two-dimensional.

Oh right, the far-field diffraction pattern (Fraunhofer diffraction) for a circular aperture is an Airy disk. The first dark ring occurs at an angle θ given by a sinθ = 1.22 λ, where a is the radius of the aperture. So θ ≈ 1.22 λ / a, since for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ in radians.

Wait, but the question is about the first two minima. Oh wait, for a circular aperture, the central maximum is the brightest spot, surrounded by rings of intensity. The first minimum is the first dark ring. But I think the far-field pattern has the central maximum, then the first dark ring, then a brighter ring, and so on. So the first minimum is the first dark ring, and the second minimum might be the next dark ring. But wait, actually, I think the first minimum is the outer edge of the central maximum, so the first minimum is a single point, but perhaps the next minima are higher order. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem states that the angular distance between the first two minima. Hmm, perhaps I should think about it more in terms of the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. But wait, the question says that when N is infinitely large, the shape is a circle. So I can model it as a circular aperture.

In that case, the angular positions of the minima for a circular aperture are given by the Bessel function zeros. The first minimum occurs at θ where a sinθ = 1.22 λ, so θ ≈ 1.22 λ / (a), because when angles are small, sinθ ≈ θ and a is the radius.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the angular distance between the first two minima. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. For the circular case, there's only one minimum at a certain θ. So maybe the question is referring to the first minimum when considering multiple apertures or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's not a circle but another shape as N approaches infinity.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the given aperture is a regular polygon with N sides, and when N approaches infinity, it becomes a circle. So the problem reduces to finding the minima for a circular aperture.

Wait, but for a circular aperture, the minima occur at specific angles determined by the Bessel functions. The first minimum is at θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ/(a), and the next minima are at higher angles, but I think their positions are further out. So the angular distance between the first and second minima would be the difference between their θ values.

Wait, but for a circular aperture, the minima occur at θ where the Bessel function J1 has zeros. The first zero of J1 is at x≈3.8317, but dividing by π gives the first minimum at approximately 1.22 λ/(2a), wait no. Wait, the condition is J_1(k a sinθ) = 0, where k = 2π/λ. The zeros of J_1 are at x = 3.8317, 7.0156, etc. So the first minimum is at x = 3.8317, so:

k a sinθ = 3.8317
(2π/λ) a sinθ = 3.8317
sinθ = (3.8317 λ) / (2π a)
For small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) ≈ (3.8317/6.2832) λ/a ≈ 0.610 λ/a.

Wait, that's the first minimum. What about the second minimum? The next zero of J_1 is at x≈7.0156. So:

k a sinθ =7.0156
sinθ = (7.0156 λ)/(2π a)
θ ≈ (7.0156 λ)/(2π a) ≈ (7.0156/6.2832) λ/a ≈ 1.116 λ/a.

Wait, so the first minimum is at θ1≈0.610 λ/a, and the second minimum is at θ2≈1.116 λ/a. So the angular distance between them is θ2 - θ1 ≈ 1.116 - 0.610 = 0.506 λ/a.

Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ /a. So the answer would be D.

But wait, another perspective: perhaps the problem isn't referring to the circular case, but another case, like a slit. But the question says N is infinitely large so the polygon becomes a circle. So the initial approach was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a single slit with width a, in which case the minima are at a sinθ = mλ, m=1,2,3... So the first minimum at θ1 = λ/a, second at θ2 = 2λ/a, so the distance is λ/a. But that's not one of the options except for option B. But wait, the options don't have λ/a. Oh wait, options are:

A) 0.610 λ / a

B) 0.500 λ /a 

C)1.220 λ /a 

D)0.506 λ / a

So if the problem were about a single slit, the first minimum is at θ=λ/a, but the second at 2λ/a, so the difference would be λ/a. But that's not an option except... wait, none of the options have λ/a. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So in the case of a single slit, the first minima is at θ1 = λ/a, the second at θ2=2λ/a, so the distance is θ2 - θ1 = λ/a. But that isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is not a single slit but a circular aperture.

In the circular case, the first minima is at θ1 ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a. The second minima is at θ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(2π a) ≈ 1.116 λ/a. So the difference is 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

So the answer must be D.


When light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a pattern of intensity maxima and minima in the far field. For a regular N-sided polygon with all apothems of length \(a\), the shape approaches a circle as \(N \to \infty\). The problem involves determining the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern for this circular aperture.

For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is characterized by the zeros of the Bessel function \(J_1\). The minima occur at angles where \(J_1(k a \sin\theta) = 0\), where \(k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\) and \(a\) is the radius of the aperture. The zeros of \(J_1\) are well-known: the first zero occurs at \(x \approx 3.8317\), and the second zero occurs at \(x \approx 7.0156\). 

Using the small-angle approximation (\(\sin\theta \approx \theta\)), the angular positions of the minima are given by:

\[
\theta_m = \frac{x_m \lambda}{2\pi a},
\]

where \(x_m\) is the \(m\)-th zero of \(J_1\). For the first minimum (\(m = 1\)):

\[
\theta_1 = \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{2\pi a} \approx 0.610 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

For the second minimum (\(m = 2\)):

\[
\theta_2 = \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{2\pi a} \approx 1.116 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

The angular distance between the first two minima is:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 \approx 1.116 \frac{\lambda}{a} - 0.610 \frac{\lambda}{a} = 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately \(0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}\), which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
