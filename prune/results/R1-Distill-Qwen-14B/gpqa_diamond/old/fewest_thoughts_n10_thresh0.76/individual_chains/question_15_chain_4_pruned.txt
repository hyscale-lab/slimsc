Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about planet transits. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is one way to detect exoplanets. The idea is that when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. But the probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, same masses, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 is closer to its star since the period is shorter.

They also have circular orbits, which simplifies things. The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's interesting. So even though the star for P1 is more massive, it's the same size. Wait, more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe it's a main-sequence star or a subgiant or something. Oh, the question says the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, which might mean it's a bit larger, but both stars have the same radii. So maybe Planet_1's star is a main-sequence star with higher mass but same radius as the slightly evolved star? Not sure if that's relevant.

The key thing here is figuring out the transit probability. I remember that the probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's size. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star) squared times (a / R_star), where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or maybe it's more about the relative sizesâ€”larger planet or smaller star increases the probability. Also, the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. For a circular orbit, the probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since the planet's size is much smaller, it's roughly (R_star / a), but wait, no, the probability is actually (R_p / R_s)^2 times (a/(R_s)) /
