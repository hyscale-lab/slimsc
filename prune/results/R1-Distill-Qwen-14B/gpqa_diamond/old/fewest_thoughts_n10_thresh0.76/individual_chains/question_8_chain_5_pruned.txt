Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

Alright, the question is about three genes, G1, G2, G3, and their knockout mutants. The experiment measures their resistance to anthracnose. The control has 100% resistance, which I assume means they're highly resistant. The lower percentages mean lower resistance. So, the more the percentage, the better the resistance.

The data given is:
- g1: 75% → that's 3/4 of control. So, less than wild type but not super bad.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible. They can't resist at all.
- g3: 50% → halfway resistance. Worse than wild type but better than g2 and g1g3.
Now the double mutants:
- g1g3: 10% → very low resistance.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g2:0% → same as g2.

From the question, we know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, TFs are regulatory proteins that turn genes on or off. If a TF is knocked out, the genes it regulates won't be expressed. So, if G2 is the TF, then knocking it out would disable the downstream genes.

Looking at the data, g2 has 0% resistance. So knocking out G2 makes the plant completely susceptible. What about the double mutants? Let's see. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both also have 0% resistance. Hmm. 

Wait, let me think about epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, if Gene A is epistatic over Gene B, the phenotype of Gene B's mutations can't be seen when Gene A is also mutated.

In terms of resistance, if a gene's product is upstream, its mutation would hide the effect of downstream genes. So, imagine G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3. Then, if G2 is knocked out (g2), neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed. So any mutation in G1 or G3 wouldn't matter because their expression is already gone.

Looking at the data: g2 is 0%, and all the double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) are also 0%. That suggests that when G2 is knocked out, the resistance plummets, and the other genes can't compensate. So maybe G2 is the transcription factor that's upstream of G1 and G3.

Now, what about when only G2 is not working (g2), resistance is 0. But when G1 is knocked out (g1), resistance is 75%. That's better than g3's 50%. So, G1's knockout is less severe than G3's.

Wait, but when G1 and G3 are both knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10% which is even worse. So, perhaps G1 and G3 contribute additively. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, and when both are missing, the effect is more severe.

But the key is to see which gene is epistatic. So, let's think about which double mutant has a more severe phenotype than either single mutant. 

For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as the more severe single mutant. Let me think.

Wait, the g1g3 resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both are knocked out, it's worse than either alone. That suggests that their functions are additive, or perhaps they're in parallel pathways.

But let's get back to the question. The options are about which is the TF and the relationships between the other genes.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic over G1.

Wait, if G1 is the TF, knocking it out would mean G2 and G3 can't be expressed. But in the data, g2 is 0, which would imply that without G2, everything fails. Hmm, but if G1 is a TF for G2 and G3, then g1 would have 0%, but in the data, g1 is 75%. So that can't be right
