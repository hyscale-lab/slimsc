Okay, so I've got this physics question about oscillating charge distributions and the radiation they produce. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my electromagnetism classes that when charges oscillate, they can radiate energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. The question is about the power radiated in different directions and how it depends on wavelength and angle.

The setup is a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along the z-axis. So the symmetry is along the z-axis. That probably means the radiation pattern isn't isotropic, right? Isotropy would be like a sphere, but here it's spheroidal, so maybe the shape affects how the power is distributed in different directions.

The problem mentions that in the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle depends on a function f of lambda and theta, where theta is the angle from the z-axis. They're asking for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of f.

Wait, the options give options for both the fraction and the form of f. So I need to figure out both parts.

I think about the dipole radiation formula. For an oscillating dipole, the power radiated in a particular direction is given by the dipole radiation formula. The power pattern from a dipole is sin^2(theta), where theta is the polar angle. But wait, I'm not sure if this is a dipole or a quadrupole situation. The shape is spheroidalâ€”maybe it's a dipole-like distribution.

Wait, the problem says it's an oscillating charge distribution, so it's probably a dipole. So the radiation pattern for a dipole is symmetric around the z-axis. The maximum power would be along the equator, at theta = 90 degrees, but wait, no, wait. Wait, dipole radiation has maximum intensity at theta = 90 degrees, because the radiation is perpendicular to the dipole's axis. So in that case, if the maximum is at 90 degrees, then at 30 degrees, the power would be lower.

Wait, no, wait. The dipole's radiation pattern in terms of intensity (or power per unit solid angle) is proportional to sin^2(theta). So the maximum would be when sin(theta) is 1, which is theta = 90 degrees. The minimum is at theta=0 (along the dipole axis) and theta=180 degrees.

But wait, the question states that the maximum power is A. So A would be the maximum value of the power per unit solid angle? Or wait, the maximum power radiated, so maybe I'm mixing up total power and power per solid angle.

Wait, the question says, "the maximum power thus radiated is A". So A is the maximum power per unit solid angle? Or is it the total maximum power? Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me re-read.

It says, "the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta = 30 degrees." So 'A' is the maximum power per unit solid angle. So the function f would vary, and the maximum of f is A.

Wait, but then the question says, "the fraction of A that will be radiated" at theta=30. So if A is the maximum value of f, then the fraction would be f(theta=30)/A. So I need to find f(theta=30) and see what fraction of A it is.

So for a dipole, the power per unit solid angle (let's call it P) is proportional to (d^2 f/dt^2)^2, but the exact expression is more detailed. Alternatively, the radiation pattern of a dipole is P proportional to sin^2(theta). So the function f(theta, lambda) would have a dependency on sin^2(theta). Wait, but what about the dependence on lambda?

Wait, the dipole radiation formula is P proportional to (sin^2(theta)) * (omega^4 / c^6) * (d^2 p/dt^2)^2, where p is the dipole moment. But in terms of the radiation pattern, the dependence on omega (which relates to lambda, since lambda = 2pi c / omega) comes in as omega^4. So as omega increases (shorter wavelength), the power increases as omega^4.

Wait, in terms of lambda, since omega = 2pi c / lambda, omega is proportional to 1/lambda. So omega^4 is proportional to 1/lambda^4. So the power per unit solid angle would go as 1/lambda^4.

Wait, wait, but in the options, some are lambda^-4, others lambda^-3, etc. So my initial thought is that the power per unit solid angle (f) would depend on lambda^-4.

But wait, let's think: the power radiated is also proportional to the square of the acceleration (or the second derivative of the dipole moment), so if the oscillation is at a certain frequency, that would affect the power. But the question says the oscillation is such that it radiates at a wavelength lambda. So perhaps the function f is a function of lambda, so for a given theta, f ~ 1/lambda^4.

So if f(theta) = k * sin^2(theta) / lambda^4, then the fraction at theta=30 degrees would be (k sin^2(30))/lambda^4 divided by (k sin^2(90))/lambda^4. Oh wait, but A is the maximum, which would be when sin(theta)=1, so A = k / lambda^4.

So the fraction is [k sin^2(30)/lambda^4 ] / [k / lambda^4 ] = sin^2(30 degrees). Sin(30) is 0.5, so sin^2(30) is 0.25. So the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/4 and lambda^-4. That would be the correct option.

Wait, but wait! Another thought: dipole radiation's power per unit solid angle is indeed proportional to sin^2(theta) and 1/lambda^4. But maybe I'm forgetting any other dependencies. For example, the radiation from a dipole is P ~ (1/(4pi epsilon0 c^2)) * (d^2 p/dt^2)^2 (sin^2 theta)/c^2, but I might be mixing up the terms. Alternatively, the power might be proportional to omega^4, which is (2pi c / lambda)^4. So omega^4 is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

But to make sure, let's think of the formula for power radiated by a dipole. The average power P_avg is ( ( (e^2 a^2 ) / (6 pi epsilon0 c^3) )) multiplied by some terms. But wait, a is the acceleration, which is related to the second derivative of the position. But in terms of the radiation pattern, the power per unit solid angle depends on sin^2(theta), as I thought.

Alternatively, for an oscillating dipole, the far field (radiation) electric field is E = ( ( ( (d^2 p/dt^2) ) / (4 pi epsilon0 c^3 r )) ) * sin(theta) e_r (or some similar expression), and the power per unit solid angle (intensity) would be proportional to E^2 multiplied by r^2, which is sin^2(theta) * 1/(c^2) * (omega^4), since d^2 p/dt^2 is related to the second time derivative, which for oscillations at frequency omega would involve omega^2. So, (d^2 p/dt^2) ~ p0 omega^2 sin(omega t), so when squared, it's proportional to omega^4.

So putting it all together, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) would be proportional to (omega^4) sin^2(theta)/lambda^4 (since omega is 2pi c / lambda, so omega^4 is proportional to 1/lambda^4). So yeah, f(theta,lambda) is proportional to sin^2(theta) * lambda^-4.

Therefore, the fraction would be sin^2(30) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, and the form of f is lambda^-4. So the correct option is C: 1/4 and lambda^-4.


The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution shaped as a spheroid, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. The charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves with a wavelength \(\lambda\). The radiated power per unit solid angle is a function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power radiated is given as \(A\), and the task is to determine the fraction of \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the form of \(f\).

For an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is symmetric around the z-axis, and the power per unit solid angle is proportional to \(\sin^2(\theta)\). The maximum power occurs at \(\theta = 90^\circ\), where \(\sin^2(90^\circ) = 1\). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\sin^2(30^\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\).

The power per unit solid angle also depends on the wavelength \(\lambda\). For dipole radiation, the power is proportional to \(\omega^4\), where \(\omega = 2\pi c / \lambda\). Therefore, \(\omega^4 \propto 1/\lambda^4\), and the power per unit solid angle scales as \(1/\lambda^4\). This implies that the function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) has the form \(f \propto \sin^2(\theta) / \lambda^4\).

Combining these results, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\), and the function \(f\) depends on \(\lambda^{-4}\). Among the given options, the correct choice is:
