Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are those that can be described by a Gaussian wavefunction, like coherent states or squeezed states. Non-Gaussian states are more exotic, like cat states, which are superpositions of coherent states.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/ N. I think |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. So this state is a superposition of two coherent states with amplitudes alpha and -alpha, modulated by the coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi).

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). Wait, let me think about that. The normalization comes from the inner product of the state with itself. So <psi|psi> would be [cos(phi)^2 <alpha|alpha> + sin(phi)^2 < -alpha| -alpha> + cross terms]. Since coherent states are orthogonal only when their amplitudes are zero or the same, but wait, actually, coherent states are not orthogonal, so <alpha| -alpha> is exp(-|alpha|^2 - |-alpha|^2) times something... Wait, maybe I should calculate it properly.

Wait, the inner product <alpha|beta> is e^{-(|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2} e^{alpha* beta}. So here, <alpha| -alpha> would be e^{-(alpha^2 + alpha^2)/2} e^{alpha*(-alpha)} = e^{- alpha²} e^{- alpha²} = e^{-2 alpha²}.

So the normalization squared is |cos(phi)|² + |sin(phi)|² + 2 Re[cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| -alpha>]. Since <alpha| -alpha> is e^{-2 alpha²}, which is a real positive number. So N squared is cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha²}.

But wait, cos² + sin² is 1. So 1 + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 alpha²} = 1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha²}, because 2 cos sin is sin(2 phi). Oh wait, but wait, in the problem statement, N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). So that matches. So N squared is 1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha²}, which makes sense. So N is the square root of that.

Now the question is to compute the non-Gaussianity 'nG' using the relative entropy measure. The relative entropy is defined as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the state of the non-Gaussian state (the cat state), and tau is the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, non-Gaussian
