Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I need to figure out the minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is involved here. Let me think about how this works.

The problem states that an electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula I remember is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I can probably use Δx * Δp = ħ/2. But how does that translate to energy uncertainty?

Oh right, the uncertainty in energy comes from the uncertainty in momentum because energy and momentum are related, especially for particles moving at non-relativistic speeds. The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to the uncertainty in momentum Δp.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate Δp using the uncertainty principle.
2. Use Δp to find ΔE.

First, let's get the values straight. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. The mass of an electron m is 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg.

Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters.

So, using the uncertainty principle:
Δp = ħ/(2Δx)

Plugging in the numbers:
Δp = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9)
Let me calculate that denominator first. 2 * 0.1e-9 is 0.2e-9 = 2e-10.

So Δp = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-10) = approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, let me double-check that division. 1e-34 divided by 2e
