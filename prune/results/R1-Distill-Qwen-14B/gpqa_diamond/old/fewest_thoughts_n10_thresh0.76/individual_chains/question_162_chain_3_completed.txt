Okay, so I've got this question about general relativity or differential geometry, I'm not exactly sure. The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that in 2D, a metric like this is usually written in terms of differentials, and the area element can be found using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, this is for a 2-dimensional space, right? So the metric is for a 2-sphere or something similar, but since it's a pseudosphere, it's probably a hyperbolic space.

Wait, wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface of constant negative curvature, right? So maybe this metric represents a hyperbolic space. But I'm not too sure. Let me think about the form of the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²) which is similar to the Schwarzschild metric's denominator, but this is in two dimensions. Wait, no, Schwarzschild is 3+1D. Hmm.

Wait, maybe this is a 2D metric. So the line element is given in terms of x and y coordinates. To find the area, I need to compute the area element, which for a metric g_{ij} is sqrt(det g) dx dy. The determinant of the metric tensor here would tell me the factor by which the area is scaled.

The metric is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the coefficients. Looking at the metric, the coefficients for dx² and dy² are both (32)/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant would be [32/(4 - r²)]² where r² = x² + y². Wait, but r is not a variable here; x and y are. So the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy, which is [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. Hmm, but wait, the area of the pseudosphere... Wait, pseudosphere, maybe it's a 2D surface, so perhaps the area is an integral over the space.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but in the metric, the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which is 4 - r². So when r² approaches 4, the denominator goes to zero, which might mean a singularity at r=2. Because 4 is 2 squared. So the radius here is 2.

So the area would be the integral over x and y of the area element. Let me set up the integral. Since the metric is symmetric in x and y, it's probably in polar coordinates. Let me switch to polar coordinates where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The area element dA becomes [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So dA = [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ. The area A is the integral over all r and θ where the denominator is positive, because otherwise the metric would be imaginary, which doesn't make sense. So 4 - r² must be positive, so r² <4, so r <2. So the integration for r is from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute the integral. First, the θ integral is straightforward: integrating 1 over 0 to 2π gives 2π.

So A = 2π ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → r dr = -du/2.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ (r=0→2) [32 r / u ] dr = ∫ (u=4→0) 32/(u) * (-du/2) )

The negative sign flips the limits, so:

= ∫ (u=0→4) [32/(u)] (du/2) )

= 16 ∫ (0→4) (1/u) du.

Wait, 32 * (du/2) is 16 du. So the integral is 16 ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to 4.

Wait, but the integral of 1/u is ln|u|, so:

16 [ ln u ] from 0 to 4. Hmm, but ln(0) is negative infinity. So as u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln(u) approaches negative infinity. So the integral diverges. So the entire area becomes infinite. So the area is infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infinity. So the answer must be D.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. In 2D, the area of such a surface would be infinite, right? Because as you move away from the center, the circumference increases exponentially. So the total area is infinite. So that aligns with the integration result I did earlier.

So the area is indeed infinite. So the correct answer is D.


The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional space. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we compute the area element \( dA \), which is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( g \) is the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant of \( g \) is the product of the coefficients of \( dx^2 \) and \( dy^2 \), which are both \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta, y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element transforms to:

\[
dA = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integration limits for \( r \) are from \( 0 \) to \( 2 \) (since \( 4 - r^2 > 0 \) implies \( r < 2 \)), and for \( \theta \), they are from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \). The total area \( A \) is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \( \theta \):

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Next, integrate over \( r \). Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| \), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 16 \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

As \( \ln 0 \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Therefore, the total area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

This result aligns with the properties of a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature. Such surfaces have infinite area because their circumference grows exponentially as one moves away from the center.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
