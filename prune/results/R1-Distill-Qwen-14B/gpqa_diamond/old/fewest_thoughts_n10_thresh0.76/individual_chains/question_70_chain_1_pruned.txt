Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The question is about a series of reactions, and based on those, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of a product E. The options are various symmetry groups, so I'll have to figure out what E is first.

Let me break down the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. So the reaction is A + 8B → C.

2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So the reaction is C + 2D → E.

3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. So C + H2O → A + F + G.

4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D + B → H.

I need to figure out what each of these substances could be. Let's start with the fourth reaction because it's a 1:1 ratio between D and B to form H, a solvent. Solvents could be something like water, alcohol, maybe something else. But D and B are gases reacting to form a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. If H is a solvent, perhaps it's something like ethanol or something else. Let me think about common solvents. Water is one, but D and B are gases. So B and D are likely simple gases. What gases react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent? Maybe H is something like H2O, but then D and B would have to be O2 and H2? Or perhaps if H is something like CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but that would require B and D to be something like C2H5OH when reacted, which doesn't make much sense since they're gases.

Wait, another possibility. What if H is something like H2SO4? No, that's a liquid but not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe H is NH3, but that's a gas at room temperature. Hmm. Alternatively, if H is something like NH4OH, but that's a weak acid. Alternatively, maybe H is HCl, but that's a gas. Wait, no, HCl is a gas but a strong acid, but the question says H is a solvent. Maybe H is something like ethanol. Let's think: if B is H2 and D is CO, then H could be CH3OH. But I'm not sure. Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Let me think about the first reaction. Solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. The product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like a metal oxide, perhaps. Wait, copper(II) oxide is black, not red. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not sure if that's bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a different compound. Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a nitrate or sulfate? Or perhaps it's a sulfide, but sulfides are usually not bright red. Wait, maybe C is a transition metal complex. For example, some cobalt or chromium compounds have intense colors. Or perhaps C is something like Fe(OH)3, but that's reddish-brown, not bright red.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a manganese compound. Manganese(II) oxide is black, but permanganate is purple. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a copper compound, but copper(II) oxide is black. Wait, maybe C is a nitro compound? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a product of a reaction that forms a sulfide. Wait, but sulfides aren't typically bright red. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate? No, those are usually white or off-white. Wait, maybe C is a different kind of oxide, like perhaps a mixed oxide.

Wait, another angle: the second reaction of C with D in a 2:1 ratio to form
