Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. I need to find the energy spectrum of a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, that looks like a combination of terms. I remember that in polar coordinates, potentials can sometimes be broken down into radial and angular parts.

Let me rewrite the potential to see if I can separate it. So, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I can factor out k r², which gives me V(r,θ) = k r² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Hmm, maybe I can split this into a radial part and an angular part. 

Wait, cos²θ can be expressed using a double angle identity. Oh right, cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V(r,θ) = k r² [1/2 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that: 1/2 + (3/2)(1/2) is 1/2 + 3/4 = 5/4. And the other term is (3/2)(cos2θ)/2 which is (3/4)cos2θ. So overall, V(r,θ) = k r² [5/4 + (3/4) cos 2θ]. That simplifies to V(r,θ) = (5/4 k r²) + (3/4 k r² cos 2θ).

Wait, but wait, another way to look at this potential is to consider it as a sum of two terms. The first term is (1/2)k r², and the second is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Alternatively, maybe it's more helpful to think of it as a function that's separable into radial and angular parts.

Wait, but the first term is purely radial. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ, which can be rewritten in terms of cos(2θ), as I did before. So perhaps the potential can be expressed as a sum of a function only in
