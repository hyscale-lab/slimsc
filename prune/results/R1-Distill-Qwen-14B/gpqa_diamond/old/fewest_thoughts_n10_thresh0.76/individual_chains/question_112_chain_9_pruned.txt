Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on quantum mechanics, but I'll take it slow.

So, the problem is about an electron's spin state and finding the probabilities of measuring certain eigenstates, along with the average value of an operator. Hmm.

The given state is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's not normalized yet. So, I think I'll need to normalize it first before proceeding.

Let me write down the state. Let me denote |up> as |↑⟩ and |down> as |↓⟩. So, |alpha> = (1+i)|↑⟩ + (2 - i)|↓⟩. But since it's proportional, I need to find the normalization constant.

The normalization condition is ⟨alpha|alpha⟩ = 1. So, I'll compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself.

Calculating the inner product: (1 - i)*⟨↑| + (2 + i)*⟨↓| multiplied by (1+i)|↑⟩ + (2 - i)|↓⟩.

Expanding this, the inner product is (1 - i)(1 + i) * ⟨↑|↑⟩ + (1 - i)(2 - i) ⟨↑|↓⟩ + (2 + i)(1 + i) ⟨↓|↑⟩ + (2 + i)(2 - i) ⟨↓|↓⟩.

Wait, but ⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1, and ⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0 because they are orthonormal. So, the cross terms vanish.

So, only the first and last terms matter. Let's compute each part.

(1 - i)(1 + i) = (1)^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Wait, no, wait: (1 - i)(1+i) = 1*(1) + 1*(i) -i*(1) -i*(i) = 1 +i -i -i². The i terms cancel, and i² is -1, so 1 - (-1) = 2.

Similarly, (2 + i)(2 - i) = (2)^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the inner product is 2 + 5 = 7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so |alpha⟩ is (1+i)|↑⟩ + (2 - i)|↓⟩ divided by sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |↑⟩ + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |↓⟩.

Alright, now I need to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of the operator A with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. Wait, matrix elements. Since the state is in spin space, which is 2-dimensional (|↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the basis), the operator A is a 2x2 matrix.

So A has zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. So,

A = [ [0, ħ
