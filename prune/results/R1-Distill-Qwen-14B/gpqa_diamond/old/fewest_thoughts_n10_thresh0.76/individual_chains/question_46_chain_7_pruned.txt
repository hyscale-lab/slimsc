Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, wait, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. From what I remember, Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, typically used in ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. Oh right, and in the case of alkenes, it can cause the breaking and reforming of double bonds, often leading to ring formation or different chain structures.

The starting material here is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. Pent-1-ene has a double bond starting at the first carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-something? Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent has five carbons. So, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So carbon 1 is double bonded to 2, then 3 has a methyl group. So structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, pentane is five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but 3-methyl would mean a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the molecule is:

CH2=CH - CH(CH3) - CH2CH3.

Wait, no, wait, the formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me count the carbons. The parent chain is five carbons long, with a double bond starting at position 1. The substituent is a methyl group on position 3.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Now, adding a methyl group
