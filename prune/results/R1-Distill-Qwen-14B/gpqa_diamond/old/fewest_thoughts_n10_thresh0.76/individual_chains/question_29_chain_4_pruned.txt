Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Let me think through this step by step.

The setup is that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has this bad compound that makes it unusable for food. So, they found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a method that causes random mutations, typically point mutations because it's an alkylating agent affecting DNA.

The question is about which mutation in the target gene would eliminate the compound. They sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon area. So the issue is probably in the coding region of the gene, since exons are coding regions.

Looking at the wild-type and mutant sequences:

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Change seems to be in the third codon. Let me break it down. The wild-type starts with ATG (which is the start codon, methionine). The next part, let's look at each mutant.

Mutant 1: The first part is ATGTTCTACG... So after ATG, the next triplet is TTCT (wait, no, maybe I should look at each triplet). Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compare each mutant's sequence to the wild-type.

Let me parse the sequences:

Looking at each mutant's first part:

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGC … TGA
Wait, maybe I should write each sequence in triplets to see the codons.

Wait, let's see each one:

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Breaking into triplets:
ATG TTT CT ACG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, that doesn't seem right because the first part is ATG followed by TTT. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me align them properly.

Let me write both the wild-type and each mutant in triplets:

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGC … TGA
