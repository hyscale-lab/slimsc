Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says: If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to bring the charges from infinity to their positions. But here, we have a conducting sphere. Oh right, a conducting sphere in electrostatic equilibrium has the charge distributed on its surface. Also, since it's grounded, the sphere can lose or gain electrons to maintain zero potential on its surface.

So when the charge q is placed near the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere. But because the sphere is grounded, the charges can flow in or out until the sphere's potential is zero. Wait, but the charge q is outside the sphere, so how does that affect it?

Wait, another thought: The sphere being grounded means its potential is zero. So, any induced charges on the sphere must adjust so that the potential remains zero.

But the potential energy of the system... Hmm. I think of the potential energy as the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so initially, it has no net charge. When we bring the charge q near it, the sphere will induce charges. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can
