Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. But the main point here is about their orbital periods and equilibrium temperatures.

So, there are five planets, Planet_1 to Planet_5, in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The question is asking about the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. And all the planets have the same albedo, which I think means they reflect the same amount of light, so that factor won't complicate things.

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * ( (L/L_sun) / (a^2) )^(1/4), but wait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Oh right, the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) ), but wait, if the star's luminosity is the same for all planets, since they're around the same star, then maybe it's easier to think in terms of the inverse square law for the flux.

Wait, another approach. The equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), but since L (the star's luminosity) is the same for all, the ratio of temperatures will depend on the inverse square of the orbital period, but wait, no. Wait, the orbital period relates to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. Oh right, Kepler's law says that P² is proportional to a³, assuming the same star (so same mass). So, P² = (4π²/GM) a³. So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So, the semi-major axis a is proportional to P^(2/3). 

But the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance a. Since temperature scales with (L/(a²))^(1/4), and L is the same for all, the ratio of temperatures between two planets would be ( (a2/a1) )^(-0.5), because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).

Wait, let me get that straight.
