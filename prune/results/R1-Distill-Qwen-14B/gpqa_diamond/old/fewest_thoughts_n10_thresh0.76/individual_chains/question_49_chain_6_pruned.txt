Alright, so I've got this question about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through each part step by step.

The question has three reactions, and I need to determine the products A, B, and C. The options are a bit complicated, but I'll take them one by one.

Starting with the first reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A

Hmm, I'm thinking about possible reactions here. The starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol. The other molecule is a diamine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon.

Oh wait, when I see an alcohol and some kind of amine, maybe it's an example of the Claisen or Cope rearrangement. But wait, no, the Claisen is usually between esters, but maybe there's a related process here.

Wait, another thought: the presence of H+ and heat suggests an acid-catalyzed reaction. Also, the term "sigmatropic rearrangement" comes to mind. So perhaps this is a Cope or Claisen type, where a sigma bond shifts with a pi bond moving.

But wait, the starting materials don't look like the typical ones I know for Claisen. Oh, wait, the other molecule is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That's like an ethyl group with two methoxy groups on the same carbon and an amine. Maybe that's a di-substituted amine with two methoxy groups.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the formation of an oxaziridine or some kind of ring formation. Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is an allyl alcohol. Maybe it's a hemiacetal formation? Or perhaps a more complex rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: the two starting materials could be undergoing a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. Let me think about the structures.

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is (CH3O)2CH-NH2.
