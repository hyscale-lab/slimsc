Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see. Alright, the question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. I remember that spin-half particles can be either up or down, and their states are represented by |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. These are eigenstates of the σz operator, which makes sense because σz is the Pauli z-matrix.

The state given is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, I should check if this is normalized. To normalize, the sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1. So (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. Adding them gives 1, so it's already normalized. Good.

The problem asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Oh right, expectation value is ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩. Since expectation is linear, I can split this into 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Wait, I think the expectation of σz and σx can be found separately. Let me think about each part.

First, for σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, calculating ⟨σz⟩ for the state will be straightforward. The expectation value of σz is the coefficient of |↑⟩ squared times +1 plus the coefficient of |↓⟩ squared times -1, because σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

So the coefficient for |↑⟩ is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25. For |↓⟩, coefficient is sqrt(3)/2, so (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, for σx. Hmm, the expectation value of σx is a bit trickier. I remember that σx is the Pauli x matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this as a column vector. |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1). So ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Now, σx is [[0 1],[1 0]]. So ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)*] times σx times ψ.

Wait, actually, when computing ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, it's the same as ψ† σx ψ. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, another approach is to note that σx has eigenstates that are the spin states in the x-direction, but I'm not sure if that's easier. Alternatively, applying σx to |↑⟩ gives |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ gives |↑⟩.

So let's compute it step by step.

Compute σx |ψ⟩: σx (0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩ ) = 0.5 σx|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) σx|↓⟩. Since σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩, this becomes 0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩.

Then, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the inner product of ψ and σx|ψ⟩. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and σx|ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Wait, wait. Let me write this out more carefully.

The vector ψ is [0.5, (sqrt(3)/2)].
σx ψ is [ (0)(0.5) + (1)(sqrt(3)/2), (1)(0.5) + (0)(sqrt(3)/2) ) ] → [ sqrt(3)/2 , 0.5 ].

So the inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5).

Which is 2 * [0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ] = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2. So sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but wait a second, I'm getting this result, but I thought σx has expectation values that are real numbers, which makes sense here. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Wait, let me recheck my calculation because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute each term again.

The inner product is [0.5 , sqrt(3)/2 ] · [ sqrt(3)/2 , 0.5 ].

So it's 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Which is (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = same as 2 * (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) = 2*( sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. So that's correct.

So putting it all together: the expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = (-5) + (5 * 0.866) ≈ (-5) + 4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but let me compute it more precisely. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. 5 * 0.866 is 4.33. So 10⟨σz⟩ is -5, adding 4.33 gives -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but the options don't include -0.67. Let me check the options again. The options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.

Hmm, the closest option to -0.67 is C) -0.7. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: when you have a spin state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is ( |a|^2 + |b|^2 )? No, that's not right. Wait, no. I think the formula for ⟨σx⟩ is 2 Re(ab*) when the state is a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, but I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: when you have ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is 2 Re( a b* ) because σx has elements that mix the up and down states.

Wait, let me think. Since σx in matrix form is [[0 1],[1 0]], so ψ is [a, b]^T. Then, σx ψ is [b, a]^T. So ψ† σx ψ is a* b + b* a = 2 Re( a b* ). So yes, that's correct.

So in this case, a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So a b* is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4. So 2 Re(a b*) is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, which matches what I had earlier.

So ⟨σx⟩ is 0.866, so 5 times that is 4.33.

Wait, but that gives an expectation value of -0.67, which is approximately -0.7. So the answer would be option C, which is -0.7.

But wait, let me check if I miscalculated the σz part. Because the σz expectation is -0.5, correct?

Yes. Because the state is a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, with a=0.5 and b=sqrt(3)/2. So a² is 0.25, b² is 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ is 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So 10 times that is -5.

So the total expectation is -5 +4.33 = -0.67, which is approximately -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.

But wait, I'm getting 10σz +5σx, so 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = -5 +4.33= -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So yes, option C is correct.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) correspond to eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in the state \( \psi \) are \( 0.5 \) and \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2(+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2(-1) = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

Thus, \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) swaps the spin states \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) for the state \( \psi \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2\,\text{Re}(ab^*),
\]

where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2\,\text{Re}\left(0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

Thus, \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5(0.866) \approx 4.33 \).

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounded to one decimal place, this gives \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The closest option to the computed value is:

**C) -0.7**
