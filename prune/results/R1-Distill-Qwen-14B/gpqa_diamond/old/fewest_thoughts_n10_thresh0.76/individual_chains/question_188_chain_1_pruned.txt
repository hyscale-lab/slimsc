Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D.

I remember that interplanar distances in crystals are calculated using the formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Wait, the formula is something like d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) ) multiplied by some factor involving the angles. Or maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, no, for a cubic crystal, it's simpler. But rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal, isn't it? Or wait, rhombohedral is a special case where all edges are equal and all angles are equal. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma. So it's like a cube that's been deformed a bit.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system is given by the Bragg's law equation, but wait, no, Bragg's law relates to the diffraction angles, but the interplanar distance (d-spacing) is given by another formula.

Oh right, the interplanar distance d_hkl for a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by the formula:

1/d² = (h²/a²)(1/(sin² α)) + (k²/b²)(1/(sin² β)) + (l²/c²)(1/(sin² γ)) ) - 2*(h k cos γ)/(a b) - 2*(h l cos β)/(a c) - 2*(k l cos α)/(b c) )

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Another approach: for a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is not cubic, but a special case where a = b = c and all angles equal. So maybe there's a simplified formula for rhombohedral systems.

Wait, I think the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be derived using the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. Since all a, b, c are equal
