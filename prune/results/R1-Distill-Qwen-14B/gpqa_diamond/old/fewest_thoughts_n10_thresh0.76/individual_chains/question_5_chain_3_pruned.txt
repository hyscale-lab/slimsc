Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are used for spin operators. So maybe this operator P is related to the spin in some direction.

They give me the components of the operator P: P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down to get a clear picture.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P is a vector operator, meaning it's like a vector in space, and its components are these matrices. So the operator along an arbitrary direction n (which is in the x-z plane) would be the sum of the components multiplied by their respective direction cosines. Wait, right, any vector can be expressed in terms of its components. Since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if I'm using spherical coordinates, but perhaps that depends on the convention. Wait, actually, if it's in the x-z plane, direction θ is measured from the z-axis, so n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ). But since the direction is arbitrary but in x-z, maybe we can just express the operator P along n as P·n, which would be P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z, because n_y is zero. Wait, no, wait. Wait, n is a unit vector. So if n is in the x-z plane, it has components (a, 0, b), where a² + b² = 1. So n_x = a, n_z = b. So the operator along n is P · n =
