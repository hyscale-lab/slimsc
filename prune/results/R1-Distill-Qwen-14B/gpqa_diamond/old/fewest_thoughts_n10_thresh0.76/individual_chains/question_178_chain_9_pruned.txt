Okay, so I have this question about the Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in quantum field theory, the renormalizability depends on the dimensions of the coupling constants. The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ σ_mu nu ψ F^{mu nu}.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action S is dimensionless, and S = ∫ d^4 x L, so each term in the Lagrangian must have [L] = [Mass]^4.

Let me break down each part of the term. The term is κ multiplied by ψ, then σ_mu nu, then ψ, and F^{mu nu}.

Wait, ψ is a spinor field. The mass dimension of a Dirac spinor ψ is 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the action has to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4. So each field in the term contributes to that.

Looking at the structure: the term is κ ψ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Wait, σ_{mu nu} is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu], which is an antisymmetric tensor of rank 2. So it's a Lorentz tensor with two indices. But in terms of dimensions, the gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're part of the Clifford algebra, right? So σ_{mu nu} would be dimensionless. Because γ matrices don't contribute to mass dimension; the dimension comes from the fields and F.

F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism (or another abelian field). The field strength F has mass dimension 2. Because the electromagnetic field A_mu has dimension 1, and F^{mu nu} is the derivative of A, so each derivative brings a mass dimension of 1. So F has dimension 2.

So adding up the dimensions:

The term is κ multiplied by ψ (dimension 3/2) times another ψ (another 3/2), times F^{mu nu} (dimension 2).

Wait, wait, but σ_{mu nu} is a Lorentz structure, so it's dimensionless. So the term inside the Lagrangian
