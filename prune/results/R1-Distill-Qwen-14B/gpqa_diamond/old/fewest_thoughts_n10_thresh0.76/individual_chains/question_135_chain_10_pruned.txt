Okay, so I have this physics problem here about boson decay. Hmm, let me think. The question gives me an interaction Lagrangian between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decay channels at the lowest order.

Alright, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f f_bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, wait. Maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh, perhaps it's written as L(y) = -λ f f_bar (something with X and the fermions). Or maybe it's -λ times the product of two fermion fields ψ_f and ψ_f bar, multiplied by (v + X(y)). Hmm, perhaps it's a Yukawa interaction term. So the interaction term would look like λ ψ_f ψ_f^† X, or something similar. Because in Yukawa couplings, the scalar field (like X here) couples to a fermion-antifermion pair.

Wait, the general Yukawa Lagrangian is L = g ψ ψ^† φ, where φ is the scalar (boson) field. So in this case, the interaction term is proportional to X times the product of a fermion and its antifermion. That would mean that the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it couples to. So the possible decay products depend on which fermions are involved.

But the question is about the possible decay channels. So for X to decay into a pair of fermions f and f_bar, the product of their masses must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Because in decay, the rest mass of the parent must be at least twice the mass of the child particles (if they're identical particles like fermion and antifermion, their masses are the same, so 2m_f <= m_X).

Wait, no. Since each fermion has mass m_f, the total mass needed is 2m_f (because the fermion and antifermion each have mass m_f). So m_X must be >= 2m_f. So I need to find all fermions where 2m_f <= 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the fermions in the problem... the Lagrangian shows ψ_f, which I think is the fermion field. So which fermions are we considering here? The problem doesn't specify, but since the interaction is given, perhaps X couples to all the fermions in the Standard Model up to a certain mass.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is more about knowing which fermion pairs are possible for decay. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where 2m_f <= m_X.

So first, list the possible fermions and their masses. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions:

Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV (negligible)
Muon (mu): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (tau): ~1
