Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene and ending with product 5. I need to figure out what product 5 is based on each reaction step.

Alright, the first step is benzene treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, which forms product 1. I remember that HNO3 is a nitrating agent, and H2SO4 is the catalyst. So when benzene undergoes nitration, it typically forms nitrobenzene. Nitration typically occurs at the meta position with benzene if there's no directing group, but wait, benzene itself is activated towards nitration. Wait, no, benzene is actually meta directing? Or wait, benzene doesn't have any substituents, so the nitration would occur in a particular position. Oh wait, benzene is symmetric, so the nitration would add the nitro group in such a way that it's para or meta, but since benzene is symmetric, it just becomes nitrobenzene, which is a single product with the nitro group in any position—oh, wait, actually, nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene as a single product because the ring is symmetric. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next step: product 1 treated with Br2 and Fe, which forms product 2. Wait, Fe in presence of Br2—oh, that's a brom
