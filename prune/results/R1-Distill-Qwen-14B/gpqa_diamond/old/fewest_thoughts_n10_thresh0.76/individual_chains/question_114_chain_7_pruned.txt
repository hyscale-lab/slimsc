Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options given are A, B, C, D, each providing A and B reagents. I need to choose between these options.

Hmm, let's break this down. I think the first reaction is a substitution. Butan-2-one is methyl isopropyl ketone, right? The structure is (CH3)2CO. When ketones react with CN- (from NaCN), perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones usually undergo nucleophilic addition, but under certain conditions.

Wait, but after adding NaCN, the product is a cyanohydrin. Oh right, cyanohydrin formation. That's when a ketone reacts with cyanide in a basic or acidic condition. The reaction typically involves the addition of CN- to the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin.

But under what conditions does this happen? I remember that in acidic conditions, the carbonyl oxygen becomes protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, so the nucleophilic attack by CN- is more likely. So the reagent A here is probably an acid catalyst. Looking at the options, H3O+ is an option (A and B options have A as H3O+), but option C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not a simple acid-catalyzed addition. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's using a sulfonic acid as the catalyst. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which can act as an acid. Or maybe it's a different condition.

Wait, no. The formation of a cyanohydrin usually requires an acid catalyst. Like H2SO4 or H3O+. So in the first step, the reagent A is probably H3O+.

So then, looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. So that narrows it down to A or B.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. And the product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So, it's a nitrile converting to a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B is involved in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic or basic conditions. But the presence of water (H2O) as a reactant is given. Let's think about the conditions for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids.

Under acidic conditions, nitriles can be hydrolyzed with concentrated H2SO4 and heat. Alternatively, using HCl (HCl and H2O) could be a possibility. Or perhaps using a strong acid like H2SO4 along with water.

Wait, but looking at the second reaction, the starting material already has a hydroxyl group. So when the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid, the hydroxyl group remains in the structure. So we have 2-hydroxybutanoic acid derivative.

So the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid. The typical reagents for that are either strong acid (like H2SO4) with water and heat, or using HCl (concentrated) with water and heat.

Looking at the options, reagent B is either HCl, CH3COOH, or HCl in some other option. Wait, looking
