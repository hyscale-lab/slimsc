Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in various compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical activity comes from chirality, which means the compound has a chiral center. But wait, I also think there are some other factors, like the possibility of having multiple stereocenters but still no overall chirality if they're symmetrical. Let me go through each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, let me draw the structure. So, it's CH2Cl attached to a double bond. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents are Cl on C1, a methyl group on C2, and two CH3 groups? Maybe. Wait, but wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have the structure Cl-C double bond C-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or wait, butene is four carbons. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 which has a methyl. So the structure is Cl-C(=CH2-CH2-CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl attached to a double bond, so maybe it's (Z) configuration. But wait, for a compound to have optical activity, it must have a chiral center. Does this compound have any chiral centers?

Wait, the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-C=C-CH(CH3)-? No, wait, butene is four carbons. Oh wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. But wait, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So it's Cl attached to carbon 1, which is double bonded to carbon 2. Carbon 2 has a methyl group and another substituent. But wait, let's think of the structure as CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, 2-methylbut-1-ene would have the double bond at position 1, so the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-C(=CH2)CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is Cl attached to a carbon which is double bonded to another carbon that has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-C(=CH(CH2? )).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about whether this compound has a chiral center. A chiral center requires four different groups attached. Let's see: for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

Carbon 1 has Cl, double bond to C2, and two other substituents. Wait, but if it's but-1-ene, the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So the structure is Cl-C(=CH2-CH2CH3)? Or perhaps it's Cl-C(=CH(CH2CH3))CH3? I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about whether there's a stereogenic center here.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case where the double bond is geometrically isomerizing, but geometric isomerism (E/Z) doesn't create chiral centers. So even if the molecule is (Z) or (E), it's about the arrangement around the double bond, not the presence of a chiral center. So this compound might not have any chiral centers. Wait, but wait, let me check the structure again. If the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then the structure is Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3. But wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would have Cl on the first CH2? No, because but-1-ene's structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, but that's butane. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that would make the double bond between C2 and C3. No, because but-1-ene's double bond is between C1 and C2. So the molecule would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and is attached to C3 and C4. So, Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group, and is connected to C3 (which is CH2) and C4 (CH3). So the groups on C1 are Cl, a double bond to C2 (which has a methyl and two other substituents), and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me try to structure it as:

Cl
|
C1 = C2(CH3)
|
C3
|
CH2CH3

Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Replacing the H on C1 with Cl gives ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, that can't be because in but-1-ene, C1 is CH2. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe this molecule doesn't have a chiral center because the Cl is on a carbon that's attached to two identical groups. For example, if the Cl is on a carbon that's connected to two CH2 groups and a double bond, then that carbon wouldn't have four different groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to a double bond. Let me think: the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that can't be because but-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. So, the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1: Cl, double bond to C2, and two adjacent CH2 groups? Or maybe C1 has Cl, double bond, and two CH2's, making it CH2Cl attached to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should move on for now and come back. The key point is whether this molecule has a chiral center. If not, it won't be optically active. So, if the Cl is on a carbon that's attached to two identical groups, like two CH2 groups, then it's not a chiral center. So this compound probably doesn't have a chiral center, so it's not optically active.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down. It's a hexahydro compound, which suggests a six-membered ring, possibly with some hydrogenated parts. The substituent is chloromethylene, which is Cl attached to a methylene group (CH2Cl). The descriptors are R and S for some stereocenters, and E geometry. 

Wait, but the molecule has multiple rings and substituents. The presence of E indicates that it's a double bond with a certain geometry. But whether there's a chiral center depends on the substituents. So, if the molecule has any carbon atoms with four different groups, it's chiral.

But given the formula, I'm thinking that chloromethylene (Cl-CH2-) is attached to the ring. The ring structure may have multiple stereocenters because of the R and S designations. So, if the molecule has a stereocenter (like the 3aR and 7aS), then it's chiral. So this compound would be optically active. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, if the molecule is symmetric, the stereocenters could cancel each other out. But with R and S designations, it's less likely. So I'll tentatively say this compound is optically active.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So if we add methyl groups on C2 and C3, the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has groups: CH(CH3). Let's look for chiral centers. For C2: attached groups are two CH2 (from the succinic acid), the methyl, and the rest? Wait, wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So if you have 2,3-dimethyl, then each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH2 groups? No, wait, no. Let me think about the structure:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each middle carbon (C2 and C3) has four substituents. C2 has:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (same as C3)
- Two methyl groups?

Wait, no. Wait, C2 is CH(CH3) in the middle. So the groups on C2 are:

- One -CH(CH3)- (the same as C3)
- Two CH2 groups? No, because the structure is between two CH(CH3) groups.

Wait, no, each C2 and C3 have the same substituents. Let me think again. For C2: groups are:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (connected to C3)
- Two CH2 groups? No, because C2 is connected to C1 (which is a COOH group), and C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups from the methyl substituents? Wait, no. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each CH(CH3) is connected to:

- The HOOC (carboxylic acid) group on C1
- A CH(CH3) on C3
- Two CH2 groups? No, because the CH(CH3) is attached to C2 and C3. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, each CH(CH3) has four substituents: 

- One -CH2- (from the succinic acid chain)
- Two methyl groups (from the CH(CH3))
- Another group from the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each middle carbon (C2 and C3) has the following substituents:

C2: attached to C1 (which is a COOH group), C3 (which is another CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? No, that's not possible. Wait, every carbon in a chain must have four bonds. So, the structure is:

C1: HOOC-
C2: CH(CH3)-
C3: CH(CH3)- 
C4: COOH.

So for C2, the substituents are:

- One from C1: -CH2COOH (since the chain is -CH2-CH2- normally, but now with methyl substitution).

Wait, perhaps another approach. In succinic acid, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When you have 2,3-dimethyl, the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) have the following substituents:

C2: two CH(CH3) groups (but wait, no, because each CH(CH3) is a substituent on C2 and C3).

Wait, no, each CH(CH3) is a substituent on C2 and C3. So for C2, groups are:

- One COOH group (from C1)
- One CH(CH3) group (connecting to C3)
- Two CH3 groups? No, that can't be. Because each CH(CH3) is a single substituent.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about whether C2 and C3 are chiral centers. Each has four substituents: for C2, it would have:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (connected to C3)
- Two methyl groups (from CH(CH3))

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Each CH(CH3) is a single substituent. So for C2:

Groups attached are:

- One from C1: -CH2COOH (but wait, no, because the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (which is HOOC-) and C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and two H's? No, that's impossible because in that case, it's CH2.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to think of the structure again. The correct structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has the following substituents:

C2: connected to C1 (HOOC-), C3 (CH(CH3)-), and two CH3 groups. Wait, but that would make four substituents: HOOC-, CH(CH3)-, two CH3's. So that's four different groups? No, because CH(CH3) is a single group. So:

Wait, the groups on C2 are:

1. The carboxylic acid group (HOOC-) at C1.
2. The CH(CH3) group at C3.
3. Two methyl groups (from the CH(CH3) substituent).

Wait, no, because CH(CH3) is a substituent, so the actual groups are:

- The rest of the chain on the left (C1: -COOH)
- The substituent on the right (C3: -CH(CH3)-)
- Two CH3 groups attached to C2.

But wait, that would mean C2 has four substituents: -COOH (from the left), -CH(CH3)- (right), and two -CH3 groups. So four substituents. Are any of them the same? The two CH3 groups are the same, so substituents are:

- -COOH (left)
- -CH(CH3)- (right)
- -CH3 (twice)

So that's three unique groups plus two same. So for a chiral center, all four substituents must be different. Here, two substituents are the same (the two CH3 groups), so C2 is not a chiral center. Similarly, C3 is the same as C2. So both C2 and C3 have two identical substituents, so neither is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound lacks chiral centers and is not optically active.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because in the structure, each CH(CH3) is attached to another CH(CH3). So perhaps each C2 and C3 has four substituents: a COOH group, a CH(CH3) group, and two CH2 groups. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's move on and come back.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Structure is the same as the previous compound, but with R configuration on both C2 and C3. So again, same structure as above. So same reasoning: each C2 and C3 has two CH3 groups, so no chiral centers. So this compound is also not optically active. Wait, but wait! The previous compound was (2R,3S), but the configuration doesn't matter if the substituents are the same. So both compounds are not chiral because they lack chiral centers. So both 3rd and 4th compounds are not optically active.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So a cyclohexene ring with substituents. The substituents are an OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. Let's see, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has the OH on carbon 1, and the double bond between 3 and 4. Now, is this molecule chiral? For a cyclohexene, will the substituents create a chiral center? The OH is on C1, which is attached to two CH2 groups (on either side of the ring), the OH, and the double bond.

Wait, the structure would be a six-membered ring with double bond between C3 and C4. The substituents on C1: OH, two CH2 groups, and another group from the ring. So, wait, for C1, what are the substituents? Let me imagine the cyclohexane ring with substituents. The ring is:

C1 (OH) connected to C2, C6, and the ring. C2 is connected to C3, which is double bonded to C4.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. So, C1 has OH, connected to C2 and C6. C2 is connected to C3, which is double bonded to C4. So, for C1, the substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- The rest of the ring (but that's part of the same structure). Wait, no, each CH is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So, at C1, the four substituents are:

1. OH
2. C2 (which is CH2)
3. C6 (which is CH2)
4. The ring structure (but perhaps that's considered as the fourth substituent?)

Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So, for C1, the substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- The ring (the double bond is at C3-4, which is in the ring).

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C1 are: OH, two CH2 groups (from adjacent carbons), and the ring. But if the ring is symmetric, then maybe C1 isn't a chiral center. But wait, let me think about the ring structure. The double bond is between C3 and C4, which would make the ring non-planar and perhaps create some asymmetry. But for C1, the substituents are OH, two CH2 groups, and the rest of the ring. If the two CH2 groups are identical, then C1 would have three substituents: OH, two CH2, and the ring. Wait, but that's four substituents. Wait, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So for C1, the substituents are:

- OH
- C2 (CH2)
- C6 (CH2)
- The rest of the ring, which is a bridge between C2 and C6, but that's part of the ring structure, so perhaps C1 is connected to two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), the OH, and the ring itself. But the ring itself forms a structure, so perhaps the substituents are:

1. OH
2. C2 (CH2)
3. C6 (CH2)
4. The ring (but that's a larger group, but perhaps not a unique substituent).

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. If the cyclohexene ring has a double bond, it's not symmetric. So for C1, are the two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6) identical? Because the ring is not planar, the substituents on either side might be different. For example, C2 is connected to C3, which is part of the double bond. C6 is connected to C5, which is another part of the ring. So perhaps the substituents on C1 (the CH2 groups from C2 and C6) are not identical, making C1 a chiral center.

Wait, but what defines the substituents? If C2 is connected to a CH2 group that's next to a double bond, and C6 is connected to a CH2 that's on the other side, then those two substituents (from C2 and C6) are not identical. So, C1 would have four different substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (which are different because one leads to a double bond and the other doesn't), and the ring. Wait, but wait, the ring is a single substituent? Or do I count the two adjacent carbons as separate substituents?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Perhaps it's better to think of this: if the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. The (R) configuration suggests it has a chiral center. So perhaps C1 is a chiral center in this case. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the structure. With the OH on C1 and the double bond at C3-4, would the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents on either side of C1 are mirror images, then it might not be chiral. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Since the configuration is given as R, that suggests it is chiral, so this compound is optically active.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So, a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. Let's see if this molecule is chiral.

The substituents are OH on three alternate positions. So, the cyclohexane ring has OH on C1, C3, and C5. Now, does this create a chiral center? Each of these carbons is attached to an OH group. Let me check if any of them are chiral centers.

For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. Let's take C1. It's attached to:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- The ring structure, which may be symmetrical.

Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, the substituents on either side could be the same or different. For C1, the substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and the ring. Are the two CH2 groups the same? If the ring is symmetric, perhaps the groups are the same. For example, in a chair conformation, the substituents around the ring could lead to symmetry. So, if the substituents on C2 and C6 are the same, then C1 would have two identical CH2 groups, making it not a chiral center.

Similarly, C3 and C5 would have the same situation. But wait, the substituents on C3 would be OH, and the adjacent CH2 groups from C2 and C4, which might be the same. So, all three OH-bearing carbons (1,3,5) would each have two identical substituents, making them not chiral centers. Therefore, the molecule as a whole is not chiral and thus not optically active.

Wait, but wait. If all three OH groups are on alternate positions, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, if the molecule is symmetric along a certain axis. So, if it's (1s,3s,5s), the arrangement could be such that each OH is in a position that creates a symmetrical structure. Thus, the molecule isn't chiral. So, this compound wouldn't be optically active.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure: a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butanone. So, the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2? Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CHCO, so perhaps it's cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1). So, the carbonyl is at C1, which is connected to a cyclopentyl group and a CH2CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, the structure is:

O
||
C1 (connected to cyclopentyl and CH2CH(CH3)2?)

So, the groups on C1 are:

- Cyclopentyl
- Carbonyl (O)
- Two other substituents from the butanone chain.

Wait, no, but butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, so the structure would be:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but the question says 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So butan-1-one is O=C-R, where R is a three-carbon chain. So, 3-methyl would mean a methyl branch on the third carbon of the butanone. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, butan-1-one is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's pentan-2-one. Wait, no. Butan-1-one would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CHCO something? I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's pentan-2-one. Wait, butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's impossible because butanone has four carbons. So, butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? That's five carbons. Hmm. Maybe I should think of it as O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl. No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

The key point is whether there's a chiral center. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is connected to:

- Cyclopentyl group
- O=C- group
- Two other substituents.

Wait, but the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it can't be a chiral center. So, any chiral centers would be elsewhere.

Looking at the butanone chain: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure would be:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but that's four carbons in the butanone. So, the carbons are:

C1: O=C-

C2: connected to C1 and C3.

C3: connected to C2, C4, and a methyl group.

C4: connected to C3 and a cyclopentyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl. Wait, that would make it 4-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether any carbon in this molecule has four different substituents. The carbonyl carbon is C1, which is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. The cyclopentyl group is attached to C1, so maybe C1 is connected to O, cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups. So, perhaps C1 is connected to O, cyclopentyl, CH2-CH(CH3)2, and another CH2. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the butanone chain is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Wait, that makes the structure O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-C5H9 (cyclopentyl). So the substituents on the carbons:

C2: O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-C5H9.

Wait, but the substituents on C2 would be:

- O=C-CH3
- CH(CH3)
- CH2-C5H9
- And a hydrogen?

No, because C2 is CH2, which is attached to C1 (O=C-) and C3 (CH(CH3)), and two H's. So, C2 has substituents: O=C-, CH(CH3), two H's. So, not a chiral center.

C3: attached to C2, C4, a methyl group, and a CH2 group leading to cyclopentyl. So substituents are: CH2 (from C2), CH(CH3), CH2 (from C4), and a methyl group. Wait, that's four different substituents? Let's see:

- One substituent: CH2 (from C2)
- Second: CH(CH3)
- Third: CH2 (from C4)
- Fourth: CH3.

Wait, no, because the substituents would be:

- From C2: CH2
- From C4: CH2
- Methyl group
- And the rest of the substituent (the CH2 leading to cyclopentyl). Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps C3 is connected to:

- C2 (CH2)
- C4 (CH2)
- A methyl group (CH3)
- And a CH2 group leading to cyclopentyl.

Wait, the substituents on C3 would be:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C4)
- CH3
- CH2-cyclopentyl.

So, four different substituents. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center. Hence, this compound would be optically active.

Wait, but wait: if C3 has four different groups, then yes. Let me confirm:

- CH2- (from C2)
- CH2- (from C4)
- CH3
- CH2-cyclopentyl.

Yes, all four are different. So this compound has a chiral center and is optically active.

Wait, but wait another moment. The substituents are:

- One substituent: CH2 connected to C2 (which is connected to C1, O=C-)
- Second: CH2 connected to C4 (which is connected to cyclopentyl)
- Third: CH3
- Fourth: the rest of the chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, but I think C3 is a chiral center because all four substituents are different. So this compound is optically active.

Now, let's make a list of which compounds are optically active:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Not active (no chiral center)
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Active (has stereocenters)
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Not active (no chiral centers)
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Not active (no chiral centers)
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Active (chiral center at C1)
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Not active (no chiral centers)
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Active (chiral center at C3)

So, counting the active ones: compounds 2, 5, 7 are active. That's three.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check each.

Compound 2: It has multiple stereocenters (3aR,7aS), so it's chiral. So active.

Compound5: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. Does it have a chiral center? Earlier reasoning said yes. So active.

Compound7: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: has a chiral center at C3. So active.

So three compounds are optically active: 2,5,7.

Wait, but looking back, what about compound 2: it's (3aR,7aS,E). The E refers to the double bond's geometry, but the R and S indicate stereocenters. So yes, it's chiral.

Wait, but I thought the first compound (1) didn't have a chiral center. So yes, only three are active.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about compound5, I wasn't completely sure. Let me reassess that.

Compound5: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.

The structure is a cyclohexene ring with an OH on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.

Is C1 a chiral center? For that, it needs four different substituents.

Substituents on C1:

- OH
- Two substituents from the ring (C2 and C6)
- The ring structure (but that's a single substituent?)

Wait, perhaps C1 is connected to:

- OH
- C2 (which is connected to C3, which is part of the double bond)
- C6 (which is connected to C5, which is another part of the ring)
- And the rest of the ring (which is a bridge between C2 and C6).

So, if C2 and C6 are attached to different groups (due to the double bond), then the substituents on C1 (from C2 and C6) would be different. So, C1 would have four different substituents: OH, C2 (with a certain structure), C6 (another structure), and the ring.

Wait, but the ring is a single substituent, but the two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) are attached to different substituents.

So, substituents on C1 are:

1. OH
2. -CH2- (connected to C2, which is connected to C3 in the double bond)
3. -CH2- (connected to C6, which is connected to C5)
4. The ring (but perhaps that's part of the same structure, so maybe not considered a separate substituent).

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, perhaps in the cyclohexene ring, C1 is connected to two CH2 groups, the OH, and the ring, making it a chiral center if the two CH2 groups are different.

If the ring's double bond creates asymmetry, then the substituents on C2 and C6 would be different, making the two CH2 groups on C1 different. Hence, C1 would have four different substituents: OH, two different CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and the ring. Therefore, it's a chiral center, making the compound optically active.

So, three compounds are active: 2,5,7.

Wait, but wait. Let's recount:

1. Not active
2. Active
3. Not active
4. Not active
5. Active
6. Not active
7. Active

So three active compounds. So the answer should be 3, which is option B.

But wait, the options are:

A)5

B)3

C)2

D)4

So the correct answer would be B)3.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires at least one chiral center (a carbon atom with four different substituents). Optical activity arises when a compound has chirality and no symmetry that cancels it out. Let us evaluate each compound:

---

### 1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
The structure of this compound is **Cl-CH=C-CH(CH3)-CH3**. The carbon with the double bond (C1) is attached to:
- A chlorine atom,
- A methyl group,
- Two identical CH3 groups.

Since the carbon with the double bond does not have four different substituents, it is not a chiral center. Additionally, geometric isomerism (E/Z) does not contribute to chirality. Therefore, this compound **does not exhibit optical activity**.

---

### 2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
This compound contains a bicyclic structure with stereocenters at C3a and C7a, as indicated by the (R) and (S) configurations. The (E) designation refers to the geometry of a double bond, which does not affect chirality. Since the molecule has stereocenters and no symmetry to cancel chirality, it **exhibits optical activity**.

---

### 3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
The structure of this compound is **HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH**. The middle carbons (C2 and C3) are each attached to:
- A carboxylic acid group,
- A methyl group,
- Two identical CH3 groups.

Since neither C2 nor C3 has four different substituents, there are no chiral centers. Therefore, this compound **does not exhibit optical activity**.

---

### 4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
This compound has the same structure as the previous one, **HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH**. As explained above, neither C2 nor C3 has four different substituents, so there are no chiral centers. Therefore, this compound **does not exhibit optical activity**.

---

### 5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
The structure of this compound is a cyclohexene ring with an -OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The substituents on C1 are:
- An -OH group,
- Two CH2 groups (one adjacent to the double bond and one not),
- The rest of the ring.

The two CH2 groups are not identical due to the asymmetry caused by the double bond, making C1 a chiral center. Since the compound has chirality, it **exhibits optical activity**.

---

### 6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
This compound is a cyclohexane ring with -OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. Each of these carbons is attached to:
- An -OH group,
- Two identical CH2 groups,
- The rest of the ring.

Since none of the carbons with -OH groups have four different substituents, there are no chiral centers. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it **does not exhibit optical activity**.

---

### 7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
The structure of this compound is **O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl**. The carbon at C3 is attached to:
- A CH2 group (from C2),
- A CH2 group (from C4),
- A methyl group (CH3),
- A CH2-cyclopentyl group.

Since C3 has four different substituents, it is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound **exhibits optical activity**.

### Final Count of Optically Active Compounds
- Compound 2: Optically active
- Compound 5: Optically active
- Compound 7: Optically active

Thus, **3 compounds exhibit optical activity**.

**Answer: B**
