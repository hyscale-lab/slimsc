Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs. The spectrographs are ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I need to figure out which stars each can observe and then see which ones are common to both.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The key points are about the apparent V magnitudes that each spectrograph can detect. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, meaning apparent V <=17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V <=16. So, the star must have an apparent V magnitude that's less than or equal to 16, because that's the lower limit for both. Wait, waitâ€”no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, no, because the way it's worded is: ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So, that's apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star is 17 mag, it's on the edge for ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so apparent V <=16.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So, brightness is higher for lower magnitudes. So, if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than 17 (i.e., lower than 17), then it's observable. So, stars with V mag between, say, 0 to 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, meaning V mag <16, because 16 is the limit. So, for a star to be observable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16. Because HIRES only goes up to 16, but ESPRESSO can go a bit higher (up to 17). So, the star must be <=16 mag in apparent V for both.

So, the task is to compute the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which ones are <=16 mag, and which of those are also >= the lower limit given by their absolute magnitude and distance.

Wait, no, wait. Wait
