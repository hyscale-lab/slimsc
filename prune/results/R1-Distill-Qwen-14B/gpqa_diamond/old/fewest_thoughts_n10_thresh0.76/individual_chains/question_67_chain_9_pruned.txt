Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to parse it step by step. Alright, the question is about the angular momentum states of two electrons in p orbitals. 

Wait, two electrons in p orbitals... So each has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l, but for p orbitals, l is 1. Right, because s is 0, p is 1, d is 2, etc. So each electron has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1.

The problem says the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. Oh, wait, that's probably the notation for the total angular momentum state. So the first two numbers are l1 and l2, then l (total orbital angular momentum) and m (the z-component). Wait, but wait a second. When you couple two angular momenta, the maximum possible l is l1 + l2, which here is 2. So the total l can be 0,1, or 2. But the given state is l=2, m=-1. So the state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z, and finding the joint probability that both are -ħ. So each measurement is for individual electrons' Lz.

Wait, so for each electron, the possible eigenvalues of Lz are -lħ, ..., +lħ. Since each has l=1, so possible m values for each are -
