Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see what I can figure out.

First, the IR data. The peaks at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are probably from N-H stretches, maybe amide or amine groups. Those are usually strong or medium in intensity. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 likely corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, ester, or amide. Since the molecular formula has two oxygen atoms, maybe it's an ester or amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now. The peaks are at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H), which is typical for a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. So maybe an ethyl group attached somewhere. Then there's a peak at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, 2H, maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen. Could be an ethyl ester's oxygen-bearing CH2, but wait, ethyl esters usually have the CH2 at around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. Hmm, but this is at 4.0 and a broad singlet. Maybe it's something else, like an oxygenated CH2 near a carbonyl, like an ethoxy group.

Then, the 4.5 ppm peak (q, 2H) is a quartet, which suggests coupling with a neighboring CH2 group. Quartet often comes from two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. So that could be part of an ester group. For example, in ethyl esters, the CH2 next to the O is a quartet. Wait, but in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 group shows up as a quartet around 4.1, but here it's at 4.5. Hmm, maybe the substituent is different.

Looking further, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent, giving a doublet each, and the coupling gives that doublet pattern. So the substituent is in the para position on the benzene ring.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring has a substituent in the para position. The substituent could be something like an ester group, amide, or an amino group. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide would have a CONH2 group. But the substituent is at position 3, which isn't para. Plus, the ethoxy group would be in the meta position, which would make the aromatic protons a bit more complex. The NMR shows a para substitution, so maybe not.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. Wait, no, formamide is HCONR2. So the structure would be O=CN attached to a benzene ring which has an ethoxy group in the para position. Let me think about the IR. The NH in the formamide would give the 3420 and 3325 cm-1 as amide N-H stretching. The carbonyl at 1720â€”amide carbonyls are usually around 1650-1700. Hmm, but maybe it's a bit strong here. Also, the NMR: the ethoxy group would give a triplet at around 1.2, and the OCH2CH3 would be a quartet around 4.0 or so. But wait, in the NMR data, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet of
