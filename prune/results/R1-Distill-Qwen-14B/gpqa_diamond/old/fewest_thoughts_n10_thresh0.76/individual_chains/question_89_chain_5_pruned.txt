Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so it's a very rigid molecule. When it's treated with excess KOH at 240°C, it probably undergoes a dehydrohalogenation reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe it forms an alkene.

Wait, but more accurately, when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they usually eliminate to form alkenes. But in this case, the starting compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Wait, 1,3-dibromo? So the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. But in an adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 are opposite each other, right? So maybe elimination isn't possible because they're not adjacent. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's not elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, no, KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. But in an adamantane structure, the carbons are very highly substituted and perhaps not very reactive. Unless... maybe the reaction is an elimination to form a diradical or something else. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. So maybe the product is an epoxide? No, epoxides are ethers. Or maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, when you have a dihalide and use a strong base, another possibility is that it's a nucleophilic substitution. But if there are two leaving groups (bromides), perhaps it's a double substitution. Wait, but with KOH, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but in this case, since the bromines are not adjacent, elimination might not form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The product is a light yellow solid. IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the two bromines are replaced by hydroxyl groups, but that would give a diol. But if the product then loses water, maybe forming a ketone. Wait, but how?

Wait, another approach: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. Maybe it's a double E2 elimination. But for E2, the leaving groups need to be anti-periplanar. In adamantane, the structure is rigid. So perhaps the two Brs can eliminate HBr in such a way to form a double bond. Wait, but 1 and 3 positions are across from each other. Eliminating two HBr would form a double bond between two carbons that are two positions apart?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by another elimination. Let me think: when two vicinal dihalides eliminate, they form a double bond. But in this case, the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, which are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane ring? Wait, no. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so each carbon is connected to three others. Wait, maybe the structure is such that the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework. Because then elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons, releasing two HBr molecules. That would form an adamantyl diene or something similar. But wait, the product's IR shows a carbonyl, which is a different functional group.

Hmm, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Each Br is replaced by an -OH group, giving a diol. But then, heating the diol with a strong base like KOH might lead to some kind of elimination again, forming a carbonyl. Wait, but the initial
