Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the number of loops in a Feynman diagram based on the given expression. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the process. Each loop typically adds a factor that comes from integrating over the loop momentum. Also, each loop brings in factors like integrals involving 1/(4π)^something, which usually comes from the loop integrals in the perturbative expansion.

The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I'm trying to think about what each part signifies. 

Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is a dimensionless quantity. g is probably a coupling constant, maybe the gauge coupling like in Yang-Mills theory. The sqrt(2) and 8 are just numerical factors—probably from symmetry factors or combinatorial factors in the diagram. The (Q/M)^2 term suggests some ratio of energy scales, maybe a mass parameter over a momentum transfer. But the key part is the 1/(4π)^6.

Wait, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of 1/(16π²) in four-dimensional spacetime due to the integration over the loop momentum. Because 4π comes from the volume element in spherical coordinates (like integrating over angles), and the loop integral has a d^4k, which after a Wick rotation becomes d^4k_E, and the integral often gives terms with (1/(16π²)) per loop. So for each loop, you get a 1/(16π²) factor. 

But wait, in dimensional regularization, the loop integrals are a bit different, but I think in this context, the question is more about the superficial degree of divergence or the typical loop factors in terms of 4π. Alternatively, sometimes people write loop factors as (1/(4π)^L), where L is the number of loops. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact exponent here.

Let me think. For each loop, when you compute the integral, you often end up with a factor like ∫ d^4k/(k^2 - m^2 + iε), which after some manipulations, leads to a result proportional to
