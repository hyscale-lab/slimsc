Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, right? The question says that a Pi-plus is at rest and decays into a mu-plus and a neutrino. The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny masses, almost negligible compared to other particles. So maybe I can treat the neutrino as massless? I think that's a common approximation in these kinds of problems.

The rest mass of the Pi-plus is 139.6 MeV, and the mu-plus is 105.7 MeV. Oh, wait, the mu-plus has a rest mass, but the neutrino's mass is probably considered zero here. So the setup is that the pion is initially stationary, so its momentum is zero. After the decay, the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Since the pion was at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero.

So, conservation of energy and momentum. Let's think about energy first. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the mu-plus and the neutrino. The mu-plus has rest mass energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy plus its rest mass. But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is approximately its kinetic energy.

Wait, no. The neutrino
