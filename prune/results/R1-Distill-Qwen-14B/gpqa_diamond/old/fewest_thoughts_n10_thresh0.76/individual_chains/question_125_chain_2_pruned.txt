Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that this kind of potential is like a 3D harmonic oscillator, because it's similar to the harmonic oscillator potential in each direction.

The problem is asking about the energy of the third excited state and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions exist for that energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D, so I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I think about the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z. Since it's isotropic, the potential is symmetric in all directions, so the energy only depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, right, in 3D, the energy levels are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Or wait, maybe it's (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) times ħω. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them up gives the total energy.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each one-dimensional harmonic oscillator has energy E_i = (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is 0,1,2,... So for 3D, it's the sum. So E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

But sometimes, people use a different notation where they define the principal quantum number as N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then E = (N + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but sometimes the notation might be E = (N + 3/2) ħω, where N is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So the energy levels depend on N.

So the energy levels are quantized in terms of N. The ground state is when N=0: n_x = n_y = n_z =0. So E_0 = (0 +
