Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a certain potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Oh right, r is the radial distance and θ is the polar angle in two dimensions. So I need to find the energy levels for this system.

Wait, I remember that in two dimensions, the Hamiltonian for a particle usually separates into radial and angular parts, especially when the potential depends on r and θ. Since the potential here has both r² and cos²θ terms, I think I should try to separate the variables or see if this is a known potential.

Let me think about the potential. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, cos squared theta can be rewritten using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ is equal to (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)kr²*(1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me calculate that: (3/2)*(1/2) = 3/4. So the second term is (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Wait, so the entire potential V(r,θ) is (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Let me combine the terms without cosθ. (1/2 + 3/4) = 5/4. So V(r,θ) is (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Hmm, or maybe I made a mistake in expanding that. Let me recalculate: the initial V is (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So when I expand cos²θ, it's (3/2)kr²*(1/2)(1 + cos2θ). Oh wait, no, when I expand cos²θ, it's (3/2)kr² * [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ] = (3/4)kr² (1 + cos2θ). So
