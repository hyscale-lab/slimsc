Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let me think this through step by step.

First, the problem says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and typically 4 neutrons if it's Li-7. But here, it's Li with 3 neutrons, so that would be Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

So the nucleus is Li-6. I'll need the mass of this nucleus. But wait, do I need the exact mass number or can I approximate? Maybe I should remember that the mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, but perhaps for this problem, the exact rest mass isn't necessary because it might be provided or standard.

Wait, but I don't have the exact mass of Li-6 given here. Hmm, maybe I can calculate it. The atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6.012 amu. Oh wait, because I think the exact value is 6.0121216 amu. But for precise calculations, I should look up the exact value. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass as approximately 6.012 GeV/c² since 1 amu is about 0.9315 GeV/c².

Wait, no, that's the conversion factor. So 1 amu is about 931.5 MeV/c², which is 0.9315 GeV/c². So the rest mass energy of the nucleus is its mass in GeV/c² multiplied by c², giving energy in GeV.

But the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, so I need to find its relativistic energy. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m_0 c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So plugging in v = 0.96c:

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let's see, 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so yes. So gamma is approximately 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... 

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy (m0 c²) of the Li-6 nucleus is its mass in GeV/c² multiplied by c², which is GeV. So I need to find the mass of Li-6 in GeV/c².

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0121216 u (atomic mass units). Converting this to GeV/c² using 1 u = 0.931494 GeV/c².

So m0 = 6.0121216 * 0.931494 ≈ let's calculate that.

Multiplying 6.0121216 by 0.931494.

6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964.

0.0121216 * 0.931494 ≈ 0.01126 (since 0.01 * 0.931494 is about 0.009315, and 0.0021216 * 0.931494 ≈ ~0.001976, adding to about 0.011291). So total would be approximately 5.588964 + 0.011291 = 5.600255 GeV/c².

Wait, wait, let me do that more accurately.

6.0121216 * 0.931494:

Let me compute 6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964.

Then 0.0121216 * 0.931494:

0.01 * 0.931494 = 0.00931494.

0.0021216 * 0.931494 ≈ 0.0021216 * 0.931 ≈ 0.001975.

So 0.00931494 + 0.001975 = 0.01129.

Adding to 5.588964 gives approximately 5.600254 GeV/c².

So the rest mass energy E0 is m0 c² = 5.600254 GeV.

Then the total energy E is gamma * E0.

Gamma is approximately 3.5714286.

So E = 3.5714286 * 5.600254 GeV.

Let's compute that.

First, 3.5 *5.6 = 19.6. Then the remaining 0.0714286 *5.6 ≈ 0.400.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

3.5714286 * 5.600254.

Break it down: 3 *5.600254 =16.800762.

0.5714286 *5.600254.

Wait, 0.5 *5.600254 is 2.800127.

0.0714286 *5.600254 ≈ 0.0714286 *5.6 = approximately 0.400000.

So 3 * 5.600254 =16.800762; 0.5*5.600254=2.800127; 0.0714286 *5.600254=0.400.

Adding these together: 16.800762 +2.800127=19.600889 +0.400=20.000889 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me check 3.5714286 *5.600254.

Let me compute 3.5714286 *5.600254 more accurately.

3.5714286 *5 = 17.857143.

3.5714286 *0.600254 = ?

Let’s compute 3.5714286 *0.6 = 2.14285716.

Then 3.5714286 *0.000254 ≈ 0.000905 (since 3.5714286 *0.000254 = approx 0.000905).

So adding 17.857143 +2.14285716 =20.0, plus 0.000905 =20.000905 GeV.

Wait, but earlier I got around 20.0008 GeV. Hmm, but the options don't have 20.0008. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419

Wait, my calculation gives approximately 20 GeV, but option C is 20.132, which is close. But maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the mass of Li-6.

The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0121216 u. Let me calculate that multiplied by 0.931494 GeV/u more accurately.

So 6.0121216 * 0.931494.

Let me compute this as:

6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964.

0.0121216 * 0.931494 = ?

Let me compute 0.01 *0.931494 =0.00931494.

0.0021216 * 0.931494 = ?

0.002 *0.931494 =0.001862988.

0.0001216 *0.931494 = approximately 0.0001128.

So sum is 0.001862988 +0.0001128 =0.001975788.

So 0.00931494 +0.001975788 =0.011290728.

So total mass energy is 5.588964 +0.011290728 =5.600254728 GeV.

So E0=5.600254728 GeV.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 =3.57142857.

So E = gamma * E0 =3.57142857 *5.600254728.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.600254728.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.600254728 =16.80076418.

0.57142857 *5.600254728.

Wait, 0.5 *5.600254728 =2.800127364.

0.07142857 *5.600254728 ≈ let's compute 5.600254728 *0.07142857.

Well, 5.6 *0.07 =0.392.

But more accurately:

5.600254728 * 0.07142857 ≈ let's compute that.

5 *0.07142857 =0.35714285.

0.600254728 *0.07142857 ≈0.04285714.

So total is approx 0.35714285 +0.04285714 =0.4.

So 0.07142857 *5.600254728 ≈0.4.

So 0.57142857 *5.600254728 is 2.800127364 +0.4 =3.200127364.

So total E is 16.80076418 +3.200127364 =20.00089154 GeV.

So approximately 20.00089 GeV.

But the options don't have exactly 20. So looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a little higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the gamma calculation. Let me recalculate gamma.

v =0.96c.

v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculation of the rest mass. Let me compute 6.0121216 * 0.931494 exactly.

Let me do the exact multiplication:

6.0121216 * 0.931494.

Let me compute it step by step.

6.0121216 * 0.931494:

Multiply 6.0121216 by 0.931494.

I can write this as:

(6 + 0.0121216) * (0.931494) =6 *0.931494 + 0.0121216 * 0.931494.

6 *0.931494=5.588964.

0.0121216 *0.931494 = let me compute this.

0.01 *0.931494 =0.00931494.

0.002 *0.931494 =0.001862988.

0.0001216 *0.931494 ≈0.0001128.

Adding these together: 0.00931494 +0.001862988 =0.011177928 +0.0001128 =0.011290728.

So 5.588964 +0.011290728 =5.600254728 GeV.

So that's correct.

Hmm, then 3.57142857 *5.600254728 = ?

Let me compute that with more precision.

3.57142857 *5.600254728 = ?

Perhaps using a calculator approach.

3.57142857 is exactly 25/7 (since 25/7≈3.57142857).

So 25/7 *5.600254728.

5.600254728 ÷7 = let's compute that.

5.600254728 ÷7 = approx 0.80003639.

Wait, 7 *0.8=5.6. So 5.6 ÷7 =0.8. So 5.600254728 ÷7 is approximately 0.80003639.

Then 0.80003639 *25 =20.00090975 GeV.

So E ≈20.00091 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest one is C) 20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.13 higher. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the rest mass?

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is being considered differently. Let me check the exact value of Li-6's mass.

Upon checking, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0121216 u.

Wait, but when calculating the rest energy, I should use the exact value, so perhaps my earlier calculation is correct.

Wait, another thought: is the mass of the nucleus taken as the sum of the masses of its components minus the binding energy? Or am I supposed to use the atomic mass including electrons?

Wait, no, in particle physics, when dealing with nuclei, the rest mass is taken as the atomic mass without the electrons because the nucleus is the collection of protons and neutrons. Wait, no, actually, the atomic mass includes electrons as well. Wait, but when considering the nucleus itself, the electrons are separate. Hmm, but in this case, the nucleus is Li-6, so the atomic mass would include the electrons. Wait, no, the nucleus is Li-6, so the mass I should use is the mass of the nucleus, not the atom.

Ah, here's a mistake. The problem says "nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons." So I should consider the nucleus's mass, not the atomic mass.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So the atomic mass includes electrons, but the nucleus's mass is the mass of protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. So perhaps I need to calculate the mass of the nucleus as:

Number of protons: Li has 3 protons. Number of neutrons: 3. So total nucleons =6.

The mass of the nucleus is approximately (number of protons × mass of proton) + (number of neutrons × mass of neutron) minus binding energy.

But wait, the exact calculation would require using the mass of the nucleus as given by experiment. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons.

Wait, because the nucleus is considered as a whole, so we need its rest mass. So the atomic mass includes electrons, but the nucleus's mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Wait, but for a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons, it has 3 electrons.

So the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0121216 u, which includes 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and 3 electrons.

So the mass of the nucleus is 6.0121216 u minus the mass of 3 electrons.

The mass of one electron is about 0.00054858 u. So three electrons would be 3 × 0.00054858 =0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass =6.0121216 u -0.00164574 u =6.01047586 u.

Ah, that's a crucial correction I had missed earlier. So the nucleus's mass is about 6.01047586 u.

Now, converting that to GeV/c²: 6.01047586 u × 0.931494 GeV/u.

Calculating 6.01047586 ×0.931494.

6 ×0.931494 =5.588964.

0.01047586 ×0.931494 ≈ let's compute that.

0.01 ×0.931494=0.00931494.

0.00047586 ×0.931494 ≈ approximately 0.000444.

So sum is 0.00931494 +0.000444 =0.00975894.

Adding to 5.588964 gives 5.588964 +0.00975894 =5.6, approximately 5.6 GeV/c².

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

6.01047586 *0.931494:

= (6 +0.01047586) *0.931494

=6*0.931494 +0.01047586 *0.931494.

6*0.931494=5.588964.

0.01047586 *0.931494:

Let's compute 0.01 *0.931494=0.00931494.

0.00047586 *0.931494 ≈0.00047586 ×0.931494.

0.0004 ×0.931494=0.0003725976.

0.00007586 ×0.931494≈ approximately 0.0000708.

So total ≈0.0003725976 +0.0000708 =0.0004433976.

So 0.00931494 +0.0004433976 =0.0097583376.

So total is 5.588964 +0.0097583376 =5.6 (exactly 5.5987223376 GeV).

Wait, 5.588964 +0.0097583376 =5.5987223376 GeV.

So the rest mass energy of the nucleus is approximately 5.598722 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.57142857 *5.598722 GeV.

Calculating that:

3.57142857 ×5.598722.

Let me compute this as:

3 ×5.598722 =16.796166.

0.57142857 ×5.598722 ≈ let's compute that.

0.5 ×5.598722 =2.799361.

0.07142857 ×5.598722 ≈0.400 (since 0.07 ×5.598722 is about 0.39191, and 0.00142857 ×5.598722 ≈0.007999, totaling about 0.400).

So 0.5 *5.598722 is 2.799361.

0.07142857 *5.598722 ≈0.400.

So 2.799361 +0.400 =3.199361.

Adding to 16.796166 gives 16.796166 +3.199361 =20. (wait, 16.796166 +3.199361 =20. (approximately 20.0 exactly?) Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 3.57142857 ×5.598722.

Let me compute this as:

3.57142857 ×5.598722.

I can compute it as (3 + 0.57142857) ×5.598722.

=3×5.598722 +0.57142857 ×5.598722.

=16.796166 + (0.57142857 ×5.598722).

Now, 0.57142857 ×5.598722.

Let me compute:

0.5 ×5.598722 =2.799361.

0.07142857 ×5.598722 ≈0.400.

So 2.799361 +0.400 =3.199361.

So total is 16.796166 +3.199361 =20. (exactly 20.0? Let me compute more precisely.)

Wait, 0.57142857 ×5.598722.

Wait, 0.57142857 is 4/7.

So 4/7 ×5.598722 = (5.598722 *4)/7 =22.394888 /7 ≈3.1992697.

So 3.1992697.

So 3 ×5.598722 =16.796166.

16.796166 +3.1992697 =20. (exactly 20.0 exactly? 16.796166 +3.1992697 =20. (lets add: 16.796166 +3.1992697 =20.0 (16.796166 +3.1992697 = 20.0 (exactly? Let's compute:

16.796166
+3.1992697
= 20. (16+3=19, 0.796166 +0.1992697=0.9954357 → 19 + 0.9954357=19.9954357, which is approximately 20. So 20.0 is about 19.9954 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation is 3.57142857 ×5.598722.

3.57142857 is 25/7.

So 25/7 ×5.598722 = (5.598722 ×25)/7.

5.598722 ×25 =139.96805.

139.96805 /7 =19.9954357 GeV.

So approximately 19.9954 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have exactly 20. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the nucleus mass.

Wait, I think I better recalculate the nucleus mass.

So the nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0121216 u.

The mass of an electron is 0.00054858 u.

So, for a Li-6 atom, the number of electrons is 3 (since it's neutral).

So the mass of the nucleus is atomic mass minus 3×electron mass.

So 6.0121216 u - 3×0.00054858 u.

3 ×0.00054858 =0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass =6.0121216 -0.00164574 =6.01047586 u.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, 6.01047586 u × 0.931494 GeV/u.

So 6.01047586 ×0.931494 = let's compute more accurately.

= (6 +0.01047586) ×0.931494

=6×0.931494 +0.01047586×0.931494.

6×0.931494 =5.588964.

0.01047586 ×0.931494.

Let me compute this product.

First, 0.01 ×0.931494 =0.00931494.

Then 0.00047586 ×0.931494.

Compute 0.0004 ×0.931494 =0.0003725976.

0.00007586 ×0.931494 ≈0.000070825.

Adding these gives 0.0003725976 + 0.000070825 =0.0004434226.

So sum is 0.00931494 +0.0004434226 =0.0097583626.

So total is 5.588964 +0.0097583626 =5.5987223626 GeV.

So E0 is approximately 5.598722 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 ×5.5987223626.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5.5987223626.

As before, let's compute as 25/7 ×5.5987223626.

= (5.5987223626 ×25) /7.

25 ×5.5987223626 =139.968059065.

Divide by 7: 139.968059065 /7 ≈19.995437 GeV.

Hmm, this gives approximately 19.9954 GeV, which is about 20 GeV.

But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. So my calculation gives about 20 GeV, but the closest option is C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v=0.96c.

v²/c²=(0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Let me think again, perhaps I messed up the nucleus mass.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass of the nucleus is not the atomic mass minus electrons, but perhaps I should have used the mass of the nucleus as a neutron-rich or proton-rich object. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass as the sum of protons and neutrons without considering binding energy.

Wait, but for precise calculations, the binding energy does matter. Let me check the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Upon checking, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01047586 u, as I calculated earlier.

So the rest mass energy is about 5.598722 GeV.

So with gamma ≈3.57142857, the total energy is about 19.9954 GeV, which is approximately 20 GeV. But the options don't have exactly 20.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps in the initial problem, the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of 6.01047586 u. But another approach is to use the mass as (mass of Li-6 nucleus) in GeV/c².

Wait, so 6.01047586 u * 0.931494 GeV/u = ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

6.01047586 ×0.931494.

Let me compute:

6.01047586 ×0.931494 = ?

Let me expand this as 6 *0.931494 =5.588964, plus 0.01047586 ×0.931494.

0.01 ×0.931494 =0.00931494.

0.00047586 ×0.931494 = compute 0.0004 ×0.931494=0.0003725976.

0.00007586 ×0.931494 ≈0.000070825.

So sum is 0.00931494 +0.0003725976 +0.000070825 =0.0097583626.

So total is 5.588964 +0.0097583626 =5.5987223626 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is 5.598722 GeV.

Hmm, so again, the calculation of E =3.57142857 ×5.5987223626 = approx 19.9954 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C at 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.137 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recompute gamma.

Wait, v=0.96c.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the total energy per nucleon, but no, the question is about the nucleus's energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the kinetic energy and then add it to the rest mass energy. Wait, no, because the question asks for the total energy, not the kinetic.

Wait, the relativistic energy is total energy, including rest mass.

So, the calculation gives about 19.9954 GeV, which is approximately 20 GeV. But the options don't have 20, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I did a mistake in the calculation. Let me try using more precise numbers.

Computing 3.57142857 ×5.5987223626.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.5987223626.

Hmm, perhaps using a calculator.

3.57142857 ×5.5987223626.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.5987223626.

Breaking it down:

= (3 + 0.57142857) ×5.5987223626.

=3×5.5987223626 +0.57142857×5.5987223626.

3×5.5987223626 =16.796167.

0.57142857×5.5987223626.

Let me compute this multiplication.

0.57142857 ×5.5987223626.

I can compute it as (4/7) ×5.5987223626.

= (5.5987223626 ×4)/7 =22.3948894504 /7 =3.1992699215 GeV.

So total is 16.796167 +3.1992699215 =19.9954369215 GeV.

So approximately 19.9954 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is to choose the closest option, but the options don't include 20.0. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem didn't consider the electrons, so the nucleus's mass is taken as the atomic mass.

Wait, if I forget to subtract the electrons, then the nucleus's mass would be 6.0121216 u, leading to E0=6.0121216 ×0.931494=5.600254 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 ×5.600254=20.00089 GeV.

Which would round to approximately 20.0009 GeV, which is about 20.001 GeV. So the closest option is C)20.132 GeV? No, 20.001 is closer to 20.0, but the options don't have it. So perhaps I should review the problem again.

Wait, the initial problem states that the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li-6. The problem didn't mention electrons, so perhaps the nucleus's mass is taken as the atomic mass, including electrons. But that doesn't make sense because the nucleus doesn't include electrons. So I think the initial approach of subtracting the electrons was correct.

But given that, the calculation leads to approximately 20 GeV, but the options don't have 20. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass as 6.012 GeV/c², leading to E=3.57142857 ×6.012 ≈21.48 GeV, but that doesn't match any option either.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is using the relativistic kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. But no, the question is about the total energy.

Another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the gamma factor. Let me recompute the gamma exactly.

v=0.96c.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of 3.57142857 ×5.5987223626.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.5987223626.

Let me compute it as:

3.57142857 ×5.5987223626.

Breaking it into parts:

3 ×5.5987223626 =16.7961670878.

0.57142857 ×5.5987223626.

= (0.5 + 0.07142857) ×5.5987223626.

0.5 ×5.5987223626 =2.7993611813.

0.07142857 ×5.5987223626.

=0.07142857 ×5.5987223626.

Let me compute this accurately.

0.07142857 ×5.5987223626 = ?

Well, 0.07 ×5.5987223626 =0.391910565.

0.00142857 ×5.5987223626 = approximately 0.007998.

So total is 0.391910565 +0.007998 ≈0.400.

So 0.57142857 ×5.5987223626 ≈2.7993611813 +0.400 =3.1993611813.

So total E=16.7961670878 +3.1993611813 =19.9955282691 GeV.

Which is approximately 19.9955 GeV.

So about 20 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, which is unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the energy per nucleon, but no, the question says the nucleus's energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the energy using the momentum or relativistic equations differently.

Wait, another approach: the total energy E is gamma m c².

But perhaps the momentum can be used to find gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ).

But without knowing the momentum, I can't use that approach directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate gamma as (1 - beta^2)^(-1/2), which I did correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the product 3.57142857 ×5.5987223626 more accurately.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.5987223626.

I can compute this as:

3.57142857 ×5.5987223626.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.5987223626.

Wait, 0.5987223626 =0.5 +0.0987223626.

So, 3.57142857 ×0.5 =1.785714285.

3.57142857 ×0.0987223626.

Compute 0.0987223626 × 3.57142857.

= 0.0987223626 ×3 =0.2961670878.

0.0987223626 ×0.57142857.

Wait, 0.0987223626 ×0.5 =0.0493611813.

0.0987223626 ×0.07142857 ≈0.007059.

So 0.0493611813 +0.007059 =0.0564201813.

So sum is 0.2961670878 +0.0564201813 =0.3525872691.

So 0.5987223626 ×3.57142857=1.785714285 +0.3525872691 =2.138301554.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.138301554 =19.9954444 GeV.

Hmm, still about 19.9954 GeV.

So I'm confident that the correct energy is approximately 20 GeV, but the options don't have 20 as an option. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the nucleus's mass. Let me check the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Another approach: perhaps the problem expects me to use the atomic mass without subtracting electrons. So the nucleus's mass is 6.0121216 u.

Then E0=6.0121216 ×0.931494 =5.600254 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 ×5.600254 = ?

3.5 ×5.6=19.6.

0.07142857 ×5.6=0.400.

So total is 19.6 + 0.4=20.

But with more precise calculation:

3.57142857 ×5.600254 =3.57142857 ×5.600254.

= (3 +0.57142857) ×5.600254.

=3×5.600254 + 0.57142857 ×5.600254.

3×5.600254=16.800762.

0.57142857 ×5.600254.

=0.5 ×5.600254 =2.800127.

0.07142857 ×5.600254 ≈0.400.

So sum is 2.800127 +0.400=3.200127.

Total E=16.800762 +3.200127=20.000889 GeV.

So option C is 20.132 GeV. Wait, so that's not matching. So perhaps I should think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v=0.96c.

v²/c²= (0.96)^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

Gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. But the question asks for the energy of the RHIC, which would be the total energy.

Wait, perhaps the speed is given, and I'm supposed to calculate the kinetic energy and then sum it with the rest energy. But no, the question asks for the energy, which is the total energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the nucleus's mass. Let me double-check the exact mass of Li-6.

Upon checking, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01047586 u.

So that part was correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C:20.132 GeV, but I must have made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the atomic mass without subtracting the electrons, leading to E=20.00089 GeV, which would round to 20.001 GeV, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of gamma again.

Wait, another way to compute gamma: gamma= (1 - beta^2)^(-1/2).

Beta= v/c=0.96.

Beta^2=0.9216.

1-beta^2=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but no, the question is about the nucleus.

Wait, maybe I should consider that RHIC accelerates ions, and the energy per ion is given, so perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are approximate.

Wait, the problem statement says the precision is at 1e-4, so I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute E more accurately.

E= gamma × m0 c².

Gamma =3.5714285714.

m0 c²=5.5987223626 GeV.

So E=3.5714285714 ×5.5987223626.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.5714285714 ×5.5987223626.

Compute 3 ×5.5987223626 =16.7961670878.

0.5714285714 ×5.5987223626.

Compute 0.5 ×5.5987223626=2.7993611813.

0.0714285714 ×5.5987223626.

Compute 0.07 ×5.5987223626=0.3919105654.

0.0014285714 ×5.5987223626= approx 0.007998.

So total 0.3919105654 +0.007998=0.400.

So 0.0714285714 ×5.5987223626=0.400.

So 0.5714285714 ×5.5987223626=2.7993611813 +0.400=3.1993611813.

So E=16.7961670878 +3.1993611813=19.9955282691 GeV.

So about 19.9955 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the Li-6 nucleus's mass.

The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01047586 u.

So 6.01047586 ×0.931494 GeV/u =5.59872236 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 ×5.59872236 =19.995436 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to round to four decimal places, which would be 19.9954 GeV, but that's not an option.

Looking back at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, none are close to 20 GeV except option C which is 20.132. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the nucleus's mass. Let me recheck.

Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0121216 u.

The mass of one electron is 0.00054858 u.

So the nucleus's mass is 6.0121216 - 3×0.00054858 =6.0121216 -0.00164574=6.01047586 u.

Yes.

So I think the calculation is correct, and the correct energy is approximately 20 GeV, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, the kinetic energy K is E - E0 = (gamma -1) m0 c².

In that case, K = (3.57142857 -1) ×5.59872236 =2.57142857 ×5.59872236.

Which is approximately 14.4953 GeV.

But the question asks for the energy of the RHIC, which is the total energy, not the kinetic.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but the nucleus has 6 nucleons, so E would be 19.9954 GeV.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem used a different value for the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact binding energy for Li-6. But without specific data, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the Li-6 atom, including electrons, leading to E=20 GeV, which would suggest that option C is the intended answer, but my calculation with the nucleus mass gives around 20 GeV, but the option is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately the gamma and E.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28.

But 0.28 is approximate. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

0.28 ×0.28=0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Hmm, correct.

So perhaps the problem expects me to accept that the energy is 20 GeV, but the closest option is C:20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass of the nucleus is taken as 6.012 GeV/c², leading to E=3.57142857 ×6.012=21.48 GeV, which is option D:21.419 GeV. But that doesn't match.

Wait, wait, let me compute 3.57142857 ×6.012.

=3 ×6.012=18.036.

0.57142857 ×6.012.

0.5 ×6.012=3.006.

0.07142857 ×6.012=0.4304.

So sum is3.006 +0.4304=3.4364.

Total E=18.036 +3.4364=21.4724 GeV, which is about 21.47 GeV.

Which is close to option D:21.419 GeV.

But that would imply that the rest mass energy is 6.012 GeV, which would be if the nucleus's mass is taken as the atomic mass, including electrons. But that's incorrect because the nucleus doesn't include electrons.

Hmm, perhaps the problem intended for us to use the atomic mass, leading to option D.

But that would be incorrect because the nucleus's mass is less than the atomic mass.

But given the options, the only way to get to option C is to have a rest mass of approximately 5.66 GeV.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the nucleus as 6.012 GeV/c² (atomic mass), which is incorrect, but perhaps that's what the problem expects.

In that case, E=3.57142857 ×6.012=21.47 GeV, which is close to option D.

But option D is 21.419 GeV, which is a bit lower.

Hmm, perhaps this is the intended approach. Or perhaps I should choose option C:20.132 GeV, but I can't see how that arises.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E with more precise numbers.

E=3.57142857 ×5.59872236 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.5714285714 ×5.5987223626.

Using a calculator: 3.5714285714 ×5.5987223626 = ?

Well, 3.5714285714 ×5.5987223626 ≈19.9954 GeV.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, the closest is option C, but it's not close.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to use the atomic mass, leading to E=20 GeV, but the available options don't have it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the calculation using more precise steps.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass of the nucleus.

The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01047586 u, which converts to 5.598722 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 ×5.598722 = ?

Let me compute this using more precise multiplication.

5.598722 ×3.57142857.

Breaking it down:

3 ×5.598722 =16.796166.

0.57142857 ×5.598722.

Let me compute 0.5 ×5.598722 =2.799361.

0.07142857 ×5.598722.

Compute 0.07 ×5.598722 =0.39191054.

0.00142857 ×5.598722 ≈0.007998.

Total: 0.39191054 +0.007998=0.400.

So 0.57142857 ×5.598722=2.799361 +0.400=3.199361.

Total E=16.796166 +3.199361=19.995527 GeV.

So, approximately 19.9955 GeV.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV, but I can't see how that arises. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the question or options.

Given the options, I'm unsure, but perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV.

But my calculation says it's approximately 20 GeV. I think I must have made a mistake somewhere, but I can't find it. So perhaps the correct answer is C.


To calculate the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus X (Li-6) is moving at a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( m_0 c^2 \) is the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed \( v = 0.96c \), so:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of approximately \( 6.01047586 \, \text{u} \) (atomic mass units). Converting this to GeV using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 0.931494 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.01047586 \times 0.931494 \approx 5.5987 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma m_0 c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.5987 \approx 19.9955 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.0 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**. While the exact calculation gives \( 19.9955 \, \text{GeV} \), rounding or approximations in the problem setup may account for the slight discrepancy.

Answer: C
