Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about electrons in p orbitals and angular momentum states. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup: two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, l1 and l2 are 1 each because they're p orbitals. The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -Ä§ each. Wait, L1z and L2z are the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron. So we need to find the probability that L1z = -Ä§ and L2z = -Ä§ when we measure both.

Wait, let's think about the state given. The state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total angular momentum is l=2, and m is -1. But each electron has l1=1 and l2=1.

In angular momentum coupling, when you have two angular momenta, you can express the total state as a combination of the product states of the individual states. So for two spin-1 particles (since l=1 is like spin 1), the total spin can be 2, 1, or 0. But in this case, the coupled state has l=2, which is the maximum possible. So this is the state where the two individual angular momenta are in the same direction.

Wait, but the state is |1,1,2,-1>. So that's the state where the total angular momentum is l=2, and m=-1. Hmm. But how is this coupled state expressed in terms of the individual states?

The total state |l1, l2, l, m> can be written as a combination of |m1, m2> states. So for l=2 and m=-1, the state would be a linear combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

But wait, each m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Same for m2. So possible combinations where m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible pairs (m1, m2) are (-1, 0), (0, -1). Are there any others? Like (-2, 1) but wait, since each l is 1, m can't be -2. So only those two possibilities.

Wait, but the state |l1, l2, l, m> is a specific linear combination. For two p orbitals (l=1 each), the coupling to get l=2 and m=-1 would involve the states where m1 + m2 = -1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a particular combination of the |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

But what is the expansion of |l=2, m=-1> in terms of the product states?

I recall that when coupling two angular momenta, the states can be expressed using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact expressions.

Alternatively, for l1=1 and l2=1, the possible total l values are 2, 1, 0. The state we have is l=2, m=-1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is one of the basis states in this coupled system.

But what are the possible |m1, m2> states that contribute to this? As I thought earlier, m1 can be -1, 0, +1 and same for m2. But m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=
