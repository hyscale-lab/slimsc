Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can observe. The problem says that ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. HIRES at Keck can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, only stars that are brighter than 17 mag (since HIRES can go down to 16, but ESPRESSO needs brighter than 17) would be detectable by both. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star must be observable by both instruments. So the star's apparent V magnitude has to be less than (brighter than) 17, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17. But HIRES can go up to 16. So the star's apparent V must be brighter than 17? Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's written: with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Because higher magnitude numbers are dimmer. So a star with V=17 is dimmer than V=16. So if a star is brighter than 17, that means V <17? Like, magnitude 16 is brighter than 17. So for both, the star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO, and for HIRES, it's brighter than 16. So to be observed by both, the star must be brighter than 17 mag? Because HIRES's limit is brighter than 16, which is a stricter condition than ESPRESSO's. Wait, no. Wait, no, no, no. Wait, let me think again. The brighter a star, the lower its magnitude. So a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag can be observed. Wait, that can't be right because 16 is brighter than 17. So if a star is brighter than 16
