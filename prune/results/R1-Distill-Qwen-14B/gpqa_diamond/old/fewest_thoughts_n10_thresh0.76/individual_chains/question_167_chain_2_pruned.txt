Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that non-Gaussian states are quantum states that can't be described by Gaussian statistics. The Schrödinger cat state is a famous example of a non-Gaussian state, often used in quantum optics and quantum information theory. So, the question is asking about the non-Gaussianity, nG, which is calculated using the relative entropy measure.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh wait, N is the normalization constant, which is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). Right, because the state should be normalized, so the denominator N ensures that.

The relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I remember that for the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, the reference Gaussian state is usually the one closest to the non-Gaussian state in some sense, maybe the one with the same first and second moments. Because Gaussian states are determined by their first and second moments, right? So the reference Gaussian state tau would have the same mean (if any) and the same covariance matrix as rho.

But wait, our state here is a superposition of coherent states. Wait, coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are Gaussian states. So the state |psi> is a superposition, making it non-Gaussian. But for the relative entropy, we're comparing it to a Gaussian state that's optimally matched, perhaps the best Gaussian approximation.

But how do I proceed with the calculation for the given parameters: phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Normalize the state |psi> to find N.
2. Compute the density matrix rho for |psi>.
3. Determine the reference Gaussian state tau. Since the state is a superposition of coherent states, perhaps tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Alternatively, maybe it's the closest Gaussian state in terms of some distance measure.
4. Compute the von Neumann entropies for rho and tau.
5. Subtract the entropy of tau from the entropy of rho to get del_b, which is the non-Gaussianity measure.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the specific form of tau. Alternatively, I remember that sometimes the relative entropy is used where the reference state is the closest Gaussian state to rho. The non-Gaussianity is then the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian tau.

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is a cat state, the reference Gaussian state might be the squeezed vacuum or a coherent state. Wait, I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should think more about the structure.

Wait another approach: for
