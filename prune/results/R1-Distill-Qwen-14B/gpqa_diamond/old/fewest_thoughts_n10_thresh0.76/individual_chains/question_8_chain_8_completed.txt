Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about gene interactions in white lupine plants regarding their resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. Hmm, I remember that transcription factors are proteins that help regulate the expression of other genes. So the setup is that they've identified three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They knocked each one out, creating mutants g1, g2, g3, and also some double mutants like g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

The experiment's results show how each mutant's resistance compares to the wild-type. The wild-type is 100%, so all the mutants have lower resistance. Let me list the data first:

- g1: 75% → So less resistance than wild type but not super bad.
- g2: 0% → No resistance at all. That's pretty severe.
- g3: 50% → Half the resistance.
- g1g3: 10% → Very low.
- g2g3: 0% → None again.
- g1g2: 0% → Also none.

The question is about drawing conclusions about their interactions. The options suggest various relationships like transcription factors, pleiotropy, gene redundancy, and epistasis.

Okay, let's think. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So if Gene A is epistatic to Gene B, the presence of a certain allele in Gene A masks the effect of Gene B. Alternatively, it's about the order in the pathway. If G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream, then knocking it out might disable all downstream genes it activates. 

Looking at the data, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%. Also, the double mutants involving G2 are all 0%. So for g2, g1g2, g2g3, all are 0%. That suggests that G2's function is crucial because without it, resistance is completely lost. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes, like G1 or G3. 

Wait, but looking at the single mutants: g3 has 50% resistance, g1 has 75%, and g2 is 0. So if G2 is a TF, it might be activating G1 and G3. Because without G2, neither of them can function, leading to no resistance.

But wait, what about the single mutants. If the g1 mutant has 75% resistance, that's better than g3's 50%, but worse than wild type. So perhaps G1 contributes to resistance, but not as much as G2. 

Let me think about the double mutants. For example, g1g3 is 10% resistance. Both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but the resistance isn't zero. That suggests that maybe there's another pathway, or perhaps G1 and G3 are not entirely redundant. Hmm, but how does that tie in with G2?

Wait, the double mutants that include G2 are all 0% resistance. So in g1g2, both G1 and G2 are knocked out. If G2 is a TF upstream of G1, then without G2, G1 can't be expressed. So the g1g2 mutant would be as bad as the g2 mutant, which it is (0%). Same for g2g3, which is 0%. So that supports the idea that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

Now, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, they have some residual resistance. That suggests that maybe the function of G1 and G3 is not completely dependent on G2, or perhaps there's another pathway. Or maybe G1 and G3 are part of a separate pathway that doesn't require G2. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the main regulator, and G1 and G3 are partially functional when G2 is present but not completely dependent on it.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 and g3 have 75% and 50%. So G1 alone contributes more than G3. So when both are knocked out, it's more severe: 10% is less than either single mutant. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are additive in their contribution. But how does this fit with G2 being a TF upstream of them?

Another angle: Gene redundancy refers to when two genes can compensate for each other. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, knocking both out would have a worse phenotype than knocking either alone. But in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance is worse than either, but it's not additive to zero. So maybe they are redundant, but not perfect. Or perhaps other factors are at play.

Epistasis could come into play here. Let's think: If Gene A is epistatic to Gene B, the phenotype of the double mutant is the same as the single mutant of Gene A. For example, if a plant can't grow without Gene A, then whether Gene B is present or knocked out doesn't matter because Gene A's absence is lethal. So in the data, the double mutants involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3) all have 0% resistance. So that suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because even when G1 is present (in g2g3), the resistance is 0. So G2 is masking the effect of G1 and G3.

Wait, but in the case of g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either but not zero. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are both contributing, but without G2, they can't function. But that's not the case because in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is still present. Hmm. Wait, no, in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is still functional because the double mutant is only G1 and G3 knocked out. So why is the resistance 10%? Maybe because G2 is still active, but without G1 and G3, perhaps the other components are not enough. Or maybe another gene is involved.

Wait, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, which would explain why their single knockouts are worse than wild-type. But in the double mutant g1g3, even though G2 is present, since both G1 and G3 are knocked out, perhaps the plant can't produce enough other defense mechanisms. So the 10% might be another pathway.

Wait, but the problem says that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. So the data suggests that G2 is the transcription factor. Because when G2 is knocked out, all resistance is lost, same with the double mutants that include G2.

So, let's consider each option.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm, but I thought G2 is the TF. So this option would say G1 is TF, which doesn't fit the data.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (pleiotropic?), G3 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm, same promoter might not fit. Also, epistasis between G3 and G1? If G3 is epistatic, then the double mutant g1g3 would be same as g3. But g1g3 is 10% while g3 is 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Here, maybe G1 and G3 are involved in different pathways but are both regulated by G2. Then, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in the double mutant g1g3, if G1 is epistatic, the resistance would be same as g1. But g1g3 has 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't seem to fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Redundancy means the genes have similar functions and can compensate for each other. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, knocking both out would be worse than either alone. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, worse than either. So that fits. Also, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as g1. But in this case, it's 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm getting epistasis wrong. Let me think again. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of the double mutant would be the same as the G1 mutant. But the g1g3 mutant is 10%, which is worse than G1's 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. Then the double mutant would resemble G3's phenotype, which is 50%. But the g1g3 is 10% which is worse. So that doesn't fit either.

Hmm. Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Another approach: Let's look for which option fits the data. The key points are:

- G2's knockout is 0% → suggests it's a critical gene, maybe a TF.
- The double mutants with G2 are all 0% → G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the others don't matter.
- The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is additive but not as bad as when G2 is involved.

So, if G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then without G2, G1 and G3 can't function. So in the single mutants, their resistance is lower than wild type, but not zero, because maybe they have some other function or another pathway.

But when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (along with others), their combined effect is worse (10%). So perhaps G1 and G3 are part of a redundant system, but they each contribute a portion to the resistance.

Now, looking at the options again.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 are pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1. No, because our analysis says G2 is TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (pleiotropy?), G3 epistatic to G1. So if G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the g1g3 mutant, the phenotype would look like G3's single mutant (50%). But the data shows 10% which is worse than G3's 50%. So this can't be right.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3. So in the g1g3 mutant, the phenotype would be same as G1's (75%). But the data shows 10% which is worse, so this doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking both out would have a worse phenotype than either, which it does (10% vs 75% and 50%). But if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the double mutant would have the same as G1's phenotype (75%). But in reality, it's 10%. So this doesn't fit either.

Hmm, none of the options perfectly fit. Maybe I'm misunderstanding epistasis in this context. Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream, possibly in separate pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 regulates both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are not redundant but additive. So without G2, neither can function. But with both G1 and G3 knocked out, even with G2 present, the plant can't produce enough resistance, leading to 10% — perhaps due to another pathway that's not as efficient.

Wait, but the question is about which conclusion can be drawn from the experiment. So looking for which option aligns with the data.

Another thought: The fact that g2g3 and g1g2 are 0% suggests that G2 is epistatic to both. So G2 is epistatic to G3 and G1. So when G2 is absent, the resistance is zero, regardless of other genes. So G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, which ones include G2 as a TF and G2 being epistatic to others.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. Yes, so that's correct. But option A says G1 is the TF, which we think is incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G3 epistatic towards G1. Not sure how that applies.

Wait, in the data, when G2 is present but G1 is missing (g2g3 is 0%), that doesn't directly relate to G3 being epistatic towards G1. Or does it? Maybe not.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 epistatic towards G3. So in g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1, but data says 10%. So no.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3. But in g1g3, the resistance is worse than either, so maybe redundancy is not the case. Redundancy would mean that knocking both doesn't make it worse than the worst single mutant.

Wait, in g1g3, 10% is worse than either. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking both would have the same effect as the worse single mutant, which would be G1 (75%) or G3 (50%). But 10% is worse than both, so that's not redundancy. So option D's redundancy part might be incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are epistatic to each other in some way, but I'm not seeing the exact option.

Wait, perhaps the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is additive. So G1 contributes 75% of the resistance, G3 contributes 50% of control. Wait, but that's not exactly additive because 75 + 50 is 125, which is over 100.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 contribute 25% each, because their single mutants reduce the resistance by that amount. Wait, but wild-type is 100%, g1 is 75% (25% loss), g3 is 50% (50% loss). So in the double mutant, the loss would be 25 + 50 = 75% loss, which would give 25% resistance. But the data says 10%, which is worse than 25%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the genes are in a pathway where G1 is upstream of G3. So if G1 is knocked out, G3 can't function. But in the single mutants, g3 has 50% resistance, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that would suggest that G3 is downstream. Because without G1, perhaps the other genes can compensate, but without G3, it's worse. Hmm, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, both regulated by G2. Without G2, both are non-functional. But with G2, knocking out both G1 and G3 (g1g3) leads to a worse resistance than either single knockout. So maybe G1 and G3 have additive effects when both are present, but without G2, they can't do anything.

Wait, but the double mutant g1g3 is 10%. So maybe G2 is the TF activating both G1 and G3, which in turn activate other genes for resistance. So without G2, G1 and G3 can't function, but in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is present, so why is the resistance so low?

Wait no, in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is still functional. So if G2 is a TF, then G1 and G3 are expressed. But their combined function only gives 10% resistance. That can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is necessary for G1 and G3 to function, but they also have some independent functions. Or perhaps other factors are involved. Alternatively, maybe there's a secondary pathway that only contributes a small amount when G1 and G3 are both knocked out.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to look at each option again.

Looking back, option A says G1 is TF, which I think is incorrect because the data shows G2's knockout is worse. So option A is probably wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (pleiotropic). So they are co-regulated. G3 epistatic to G1. If G3 is epistatic, then in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as G3's single mutant (50%). But the data says 10%, which is worse, so this doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. So their promoters are the same, same TFs regulating them. G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in double mutant, you get G1's phenotype. But g1g3 is 10%, worse than G1's 75%. So this doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So redundancy would mean that knocking both out is same as the worse single. But 10% is worse than either. So it's not redundancy. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's not gene redundancy but additive effects. But the options don't have that.

Wait, another possibility: G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So when both are knocked out, their combined loss leads to more severe resistance issues. So without G2, all resistance is lost. But when G2 is present, knocking out both G1 and G3 leads to only partial resistance (10%).

Another thought: If G1 and G3 are both activated by G2, but also have their own functions that don't require G2. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway. For example, G1 activates G3. So without G1, G3 can't function either. But in that case, the double mutant g1g3 would be same as g1. But the data shows g1g3 is 10%, worse than g1's 75%. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps G2 is the TF upstream of both G1 and G3. When G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to 0% resistance. When G1 is knocked out, G2 is still active, so G3 can be expressed, but perhaps G3 contributes only 25% (since g1 has 75% resistance). Similarly, when G3 is knocked out, G1 is still expressed, contributing 50% (g3 has 50% resistance).

Wait, but that doesn't add up. If G2 is active, G1 and G3 are expressed. So when G1 is knocked out, G3 is expressed, but why is resistance 75%? That suggests that G3 contributes 25% because 100% - 25% =75%. Similarly, when G3 is knocked out, G1 contributes 50% (so 100% -50% =50% resistance). So in the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out, so resistance is 100% - (25% +50%) =25%? But the data says 10%. Doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the contributions are not additive. Maybe G1 contributes 50% and G3 contributes 25%. Then, in g1, you lose 50%, so resistance is 50% (but data says 75%). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is a transcription factor, and G3 is downstream. But that would make G1 a TF, which the data suggests isn't the case.

Wait, the question states that at least one is a TF upstream. The data suggests that G2 is that TF because when G2 is knocked out, resistance is zero.

So, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are active, so no resistance. When G1 is knocked out, G3 is active but contributes less resistance (75% is more than G3's 50%). Wait, no: G1's single knockout is 75%, which is better than G3's 50%.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways. G2 activates both. So when G2 is present, both are expressed. When G1 is knocked out, only G3 is active, which gives 50% resistance. But wait, no: in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than G3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is in a different pathway than G3, both activated by G2. So without G1, the other pathway (G3) contributes 50%, but the data says G1's single mutant is 75%. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates G1, and G1 activates G3. So without G2, no G1 or G3. Without G1, G3 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance, but data says g1 is 75%. So that can't be right.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach it from the options again.

Looking at option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic to G1. But if G2 is epistatic to G1, then the double mutant g1g2 would have the same phenotype as g2, which is 0%. And the data does say g1g2 is 0%, so that fits. But if G1 is the TF, then why is g1's resistance 75%? Because a TF's knockout should disable regulation, leading to lower resistance. But 75% is a significant loss but not complete. Maybe G1 is a TF for some other genes, but not all.

Wait, but the problem states that at least one is a TF upstream. So perhaps G2 is the TF, and G1 is another gene. So option A is likely incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (pleiotropy), G3 epistatic to G1.

If G3 is epistatic, then in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as G3's single mutant (50%). But the data shows 10%, which is worse. So this doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as G1 (75%). But data is 10%, so no.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So redundancy would imply that knocking both out is same as the worse single. But 10% is worse. So perhaps not redundancy.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are not redundant but in a synthetic interaction. Like their combined loss leads to worse than either. So perhaps they act in parallel pathways. Without either, both pathways are compromised, leading to worse resistance.

So, if G2 is the TF, and in the g1g3 double mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. Since G2 is present, it's activating any downstream genes. But perhaps the pathways are such that G1 and G3 are the main contributors, and without them, the resistance is low.

But how does that tie into the options?

Looking again, the only option where G2 is the TF is A, B, C, D.

In the options, D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So, if they are redundant, then knocking both out would be same as the worse single, but here the double mutant is worse. So that's not gene redundancy.

Hmm. Maybe the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, but when both are knocked out, another pathway kicks in, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Option A. Let me read option A again: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggests G2 is the TF, so option A would be incorrect. Unless I'm missing something.

Another angle: what's the definition of pleiotropy? It's when one gene affects multiple traits. But how does that apply here? Maybe G2 affects multiple aspects of resistance, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not seeing it. Maybe I should think about the double mutant g1g3 being 10%, which is worse than either single. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined loss is worse than either alone. So they are additive but not redundant.

But the question is about their interaction, and the options don't directly describe additive effects.

Given all that, perhaps the best fit is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, option D.

Wait, another approach: which options have G2 as the TF and G2 being epistatic to G1 and G3. Let's look.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. That would fit because in g1g2, the resistance is 0, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1. But option A says G1 is the TF, which I don't think is correct.

Option B: G2 is TF, G3 is epistatic to G1. So in g1g3, the resistance would be same as G3 (50%). Data says 10%, which doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 is epistatic to G3. So in g1g3, resistance would be same as G1 (75%). Data is 10%, doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 is epistatic to G3. So in g1g3, same as G1 (75%). Data says 10%, no.

Wait, none of the options perfectly fit, but perhaps the best fit is option A, where G2 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, but option A says G1 is TF. That doesn't fit with the data. Because G2's knockout is more severe. So perhaps the correct answer is option A is incorrect.

Hmm, maybe the answer is option B. Let me reevaluate.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (pleiotropy), G3 is epistatic towards G1.

If they have same promoter, they're regulated by same TF. So G2 is the TF, which activates both. So when G2 is knocked out, both are not expressed → resistance 0%.

In the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out, but G2 is present. So why is resistance 10%? Perhaps because G1 and G3 have other promoters as well, or some alternative pathway.

But I'm not sure if this fits.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as G3 (50%), but data is 10%.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that when G3 is present, it's epistatic over G1, but when both are knocked out, another factor is at play.

Wait, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1, meaning that G3's presence masks G1's effect. So when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either.

But I'm not making progress here. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the data.

The fact that all double mutants involving G2 are 0% suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is the TF and epistatic to both. So looking for an option where G2 is TF and epistatic to others.

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1. So that fits, but G1 is TF, which the data doesn't support.

So perhaps the only option that fits G2 being TF and epistatic is none, but looking again, the options don't directly state that.

Wait, option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So when G1 is knocked out, G3 can't function. But data says when G1 is knocked out, G3 is 50% (g3 has 50%), but when both are knocked out (g1g3) it's 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A is wrong, and the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, but this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not convinced.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, what is gene redundancy? It's when two genes have overlapping functions, so knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype than either single knockout. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, their double knockout would have worse phenotype than either single. Which is what the data shows (g1g3 is 10% < g1's 75% and g3's 50%).

So option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as G1's single mutant (75%), but data says 10%. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of G1 masks the effect of G3. So in the double mutant, the effect is same as G1's mutant. But the data is 10%, which is worse. So that contradicts.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for which option correctly identifies G2 as the TF, and the other aspects.

Option A: G1 is TF. No, as G2's knockout is more severe.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter. So G2 is the TF for both. So when G2 is absent, both are not expressed. So g1 and g3 would have lower resistance. But the data shows g1 at 75% and g3 at 50%. So maybe they have other promoters that are not dependent on G2, allowing some expression. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 have another TF besides G2. So when G2 is knocked out, they lose some expression but not all. So perhaps G1 is expressed via another TF, leading to 75% resistance (g1). Similarly, G3 is expressed via another TF, leading to 50% resistance (g3).

But this is getting too speculative. I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the data, G2 is the TF, and in the double mutants involving G2, the resistance is zero. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Looking at the options, option A is the only one where G2 is epistatic to G1. But option A says G1 is TF, which I think is incorrect.

Wait, looking at the options again. None of the options perfectly fit. But perhaps the correct answer is option A. But I think I'm getting stuck, so I'll have to make a choice.

Another thought: The resistance of g1 is 75%, which is better than the wild-type's 100%? No, wait, no. Wait, the question says the plants have higher sensitivity to the pathogen because they cannot produce certain gene products. So the resistance is lower than the wild-type. So 75% means lower than 100%.

So the higher the percentage, the more resistant the plant is. So, looking at the data:

g1 → 75% → less sensitive than wild-type.

g2 → 0% → all infected.

g3 →50% → half the resistance.

So, let me think about the hierarchy. G2 is the most critical because without it, everything fails. So G2 is a TF.

G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not as critical. So without G2, G1 and G3 can't function. But when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are active, contributing to resistance.

In the double mutant g1g3, with G2 present, they still have low resistance (10%). So perhaps G1 and G3 each contribute some resistance, but their combined loss leads to almost no resistance. But that's confusing because with G2 present, why isn't G1 and G3 doing their jobs?

Wait, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, which in turn are also TFs that activate other genes. So without G2, G1 and G3 are not expressed, so downstream genes aren't active. So in the single mutants, some downstream genes are active due to other TFs, leading to partial resistance.

But I'm not sure.

Given all that, I think the correct answer is option A is incorrect, option B is incorrect, option C is incorrect, and option D is the correct one. Because in option D, G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3. But the data doesn't fit redundancy. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Option A: G1 is TF. But the data suggests G2 is the TF. So no.

After all, I'm going to go with option A because it's the only one where G2 is epistatic to G1, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, but redundancy would require that knocking both out doesn't make it worse than the worst single mutant. But in this case, the double mutant is worse. So D's redundancy part is incorrect.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a decision. Based on the data, G2 is the TF, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Among the options, the one that correctly states G2 as the TF and G2 being epistatic is option A, but option A says G1 is the TF. So I'm stuck.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the answer is option A is incorrect, and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, but when both are knocked out, other factors take over, leading to only 10% resistance. But the options don't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, each contributing to resistance, and their combined loss leads to worse resistance. So, this would be an example of additive effects, but none of the options directly address that.

Given all this, I think the best possible answer is option A is incorrect, and the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are perfect, but the best fit is option D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1, but G1 is a TF. No, because G2's knockout is more severe.

Wait, I think I've gone in circles. Let me try to sum up.

The key points:

1. G2 knockout → 0% resistance. So G2 is important, likely a TF.

2. Double mutants involving G2 → 0%. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

3. Double mutant g1g3 → 10% resistance. So without G2, this can't happen. But with G2 present, knocking out both G1 and G3 leads to low resistance.

So, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream. Their combined loss leads to low resistance.

So, which option fits this?

Looking at the options, option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1. So G2 being upstream of G1. So when G2 is knocked out, G1 can't function. So in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is same as g2. Which is the case.

But option A says G1 is the TF, which isn't supported by the data.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no. Because if G1 is the TF, why is the resistance in g1 75%?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reasoning. Let me try to think of which option correctly identifies G2 as TF and G2 as epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

This would fit the scenario where G2 is epistatic to G1, but G1 is the TF, which doesn't fit the data.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (pleiotropic), G3 is epistatic towards G1.

So, G3 is epistatic to G1. So in the double mutant g1g3, resistance should be same as G3's, which is 50%, but data is 10%, so doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So in g1g3, resistance same as G1 (75%), but data is 10%, no.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

In this case, gene redundancy would mean that knocking both out is same as the worse single, but data is worse. So this doesn't fit.

So none of the options perfectly fit, but the closest is option A if G2 is epistatic, but that makes G1 the TF, which I think is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A is incorrect, and the correct one is option B.

Wait, option B says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is same as G3's (50%), but data says 10%. So this doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to go with option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because G2 is epistatic towards G1, but I'm not sure.

But I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about what the data says about the epistatic relationships.

Epistatic relationships: when one gene is epistatic to another, the double mutant has the same phenotype as the epistatic gene's single mutant.

Looking at the data:

- g1g2 → 0% (same as g2)
- g2g3 → 0% (same as g2)
- g1g3 → 10% (worse than either)

So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because the double mutants with G2 are 0%, same as G2's single mutant.

So, which option states that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3?

Looking back: option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1. So that's only for G1. But G2 is also epistatic towards G3, as g2g3 is 0%.

So the correct conclusion must include that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. None of the options explicitly state that, but option A states G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A is not correct, and the correct answer is option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so G2 is their TF), G3 is epistatic to G1.

But again, data doesn't fit.

I think I've reached the limit of my analysis. Based on the data, I'm going to conclude that the correct answer is option A is incorrect, and the correct conclusion is G2 is the TF and epistatic to G1 and G3, but none of the options perfectly fit. However, among the options, the best fit is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A is incorrect, and the correct answer is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, making option D correct.

But in the data, the double mutant is worse, so redundancy isn't fitting.

I'm so confused. I think I'll have to make a choice based on the initial reasoning that G2 is the TF and epistatic to both. Since none of the options perfectly fit, but option A has G2 epistatic to G1, which is part of the story.

But I'm not confident. So in conclusion, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.


The question involves analyzing the resistance of white lupine mutants to anthracnose, a fungal disease, to determine the interactions between three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. The experiment provides resistance data for single mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The goal is to draw conclusions about the roles of these genes, particularly regarding transcription factors (TFs), pleiotropy, redundancy, and epistasis.

### Key Observations:
1. **Resistance Data**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (worse than wild-type but not severe).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (complete loss of resistance).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (moderate loss of resistance).
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance.
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (severe loss of resistance).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance.

2. **Critical Insights**:
   - **G2's Role**: The knockout of G2 results in 0% resistance, and all double mutants involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3) also show 0% resistance. This indicates that G2 is critical for resistance and likely acts upstream of G1 and G3.
   - **G1 and G3's Roles**: The single mutants g1 and g3 show partial resistance (75% and 50%, respectively), suggesting that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not as critical as G2. The double mutant g1g3 shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, indicating that G1 and G3 are not fully redundant but may have additive effects.

3. **Epistasis**:
   - G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have the same resistance as g2 (0%). This suggests that G2's function is upstream and masks the effects of G1 and G3 when absent.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor (TF), G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1. This is inconsistent with the data because G2's knockout results in complete loss of resistance, indicating that G2, not G1, is the TF.
- **Option B**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 share the same promoter (pleiotropy), and G3 is epistatic to G1. This is partially consistent with G2 being the TF, but the double mutant g1g3 (10% resistance) contradicts the idea that G3 is epistatic to G1, as the resistance is worse than either single mutant.
- **Option C**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. This is inconsistent with the data because the double mutant g1g3 (10% resistance) is worse than G1's single mutant (75%), which contradicts the idea that G1 is epistatic to G3.
- **Option D**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. While G2 is correctly identified as the TF, the data does not support redundancy, as the double mutant g1g3 (10% resistance) is worse than either single mutant. Additionally, the idea that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports that G2 is the transcription factor and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. However, none of the options perfectly align with the observations. Among the given options, **Option A** is the closest fit, as it correctly identifies G2 as epistatic to G1, even though it incorrectly identifies G1 as the TF.
