Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me check: each compound is a benzene ring with substituents. Benzene is C6H6, so substituents add up to C4H8. Oh wait, wait, wait. Because each substituent is an alkyl group. Let me think: for example, a methyl group is C1H3. If it's a diethyl group, each ethyl is C2H5. So if a benzene has four methyl groups, that's four CH3, so 4*3=12 H? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for each compound is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So substituents would be C4H8. So for each substituent, how?

Wait, each substituent is an alkyl group. Let's say we have four methyl groups. Each methyl is C1H3, so four would be C4H12. Wait, but benzene is C6H6. So the total would be C10H18. Oh wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. So that would imply that substituents contribute C4H8. So maybe not four methyl groups, but perhaps two ethyl groups and two methyl groups? Because ethyl is C2H5. So two ethyls would be C4H10. Then two methyls would add C2H6. So total substituents would be C6H16. That doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are four methyl groups but with some de-shielding or something. Wait, but the formula isn't matching. Let me think again. Wait, each compound is C10H14. So the benzene ring has six carbons, so substituents must be four carbons in total. So each substituent is a methyl group. Because four methyl groups would be 4 carbons. So each substituent is a methyl. So each substituent contributes a -CH3 group. So each substituent is a methyl. So each substituent is a single carbon.

Wait, but four methyl groups on benzene ring—that would give C10H14. Because benzene is C6H6. Each methyl adds a CH3. So four methyls add 4*(CH3)=4C and 12 H. So total is C6+4=10 C, H: 6 (benzene) + 12 (methyls) + 4 (since benzene with substituents would have fewer H). Wait, wait, wait. Benzene is C6H6. When you add methyl groups, each replaces a H. So each methyl adds 2 H per group. Wait, no. Each methyl group takes the place of one H on benzene. So benzene has 6 H. Each substituent replaces one H. So four substituents would have 4 H replaced, so 6-4=2 H left on the ring. Each substituent has 3 H (methyl). So total H would be 2 (aromatic) + 4 *3 (methyl) = 2 +12=14. So yes, the formula would be C10H14. So each compound is a benzene ring with four methyl groups attached.

Wait, but some options include diethylbenzene. Let me check. 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups attached to benzene. Each ethyl is C2H5. So two ethyls would be C4H10. Benzene is C6H6, so total is C10H16. But the molecular formula is C10H14, so that's not matching. So diethylbenzene is C10H16, which is not the case here. So option C is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. But diethyl is C10H16, which isn't matching the formula given. So that option is invalid. So the correct compounds must be tetramethylbenzenes.

So the mixture contains two tetramethylbenzenes, each with four methyl groups on the ring.

Now, the NMR spectrum: two singlets around 6.7 ppm, in 1:1 ratio. The aromatic region. Each singlet corresponds to equivalent protons. So, for each compound, the aromatic protons are either all the same or in a pattern that leads to a singlet.

Wait, when would you get a singlet in the aromatic region? That would happen when all the aromatic protons are equivalent. That's only possible if the substituents are arranged symmetrically in such a way that all the remaining aromatic protons are equivalent.

Wait, for example, in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (p-xylene or 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene?), wait no, wait. Let me think about the structures.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene—positions 1,2,3,4 (ortho, meta, etc.) No, wait, positions 1,2,3,4 would be adjacent in a square arrangement around the ring. Wait, but benzene is a hexagon. Positions 1,2,3,4 are four consecutive positions. So the ring would have methyl groups on four adjacent carbons. The remaining two positions would have H. Are these H equivalent? If the substituents are in positions 1,2,3,4, then the H's would be on positions 5 and 6. Are these equivalent?

Wait, in that case, the structure would have H's on positions 5 and 6. Are those equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. If the four methyl groups are in 1,2,3,4 positions, then positions 5 and 6 are across from each other. Are they equivalent? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in that structure, the two H's are di-equivalent, leading to a singlet. Because in such a structure, the two H's would be in equivalent environments due to symmetry.

Wait, let me think about the symmetry. If the substituents are in 1,2,3,4 positions, the molecule would have a mirror plane? Or maybe a C2 axis. Hmm, perhaps the two H's are equivalent. So their NMR signal would be a singlet. So each of the compounds in the mixture would have all aromatic protons equivalent, giving a singlet.

Wait, but the problem states that the NMR shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes a singlet, and they are in equal amounts (1:1). So each compound has only one type of aromatic proton, which gives a singlet.

So each compound must have all aromatic protons equivalent. So what structures of tetramethylbenzene have all aromatic H's equivalent?

Let me think. Another possibility is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let me draw it mentally. Positions 1,2,4,5. So 1 has a methyl, 2 has a methyl, 4 has a methyl, 5 has a methyl. The remaining positions are 3 and 6. Are these H's equivalent? Hmm, perhaps in this structure, the H's are in positions 3 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let me think about the symmetry.

In 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the structure is symmetric across the plane that bisects between positions 1 and 4. So positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. So the two H's would be equivalent, giving a singlet.

Alternatively, what about 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene? Let me look at that. Positions 1,2,3,5 have methyl groups. The remaining positions are 4 and 6. Are these equivalent? Let's see, the structure would have substituents in 1,2,3,5. So position 4 is next to 3 and 5. Position 6 is next to 5 and 1. Hmm, perhaps in this case, the H's at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. So again, a singlet.

Wait, but wait, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) has three methyl groups in meta positions, leaving three H's in equivalent positions, giving a singlet. But in this case, it's four methyl groups. So perhaps some structures have all H's equivalent.

Wait, but another possible structure is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let me think: positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. So the H's are at 5 and 6. Are 5 and 6 equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. The positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to each other, but when the substituents are on 1,2,3,4, does that make 5 and 6 equivalent?

Alternatively, perhaps in this structure, the H's at 5 and 6 are equivalent because the molecule has a symmetry axis through positions 5 and 6. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe it's a mirror plane. Wait, let me think: if substituents are in 1,2,3,4, then the molecule would have a center of symmetry. So positions 5 and 6 would be equivalent under this symmetry. So their H's would be equivalent, leading to a singlet.

Wait, so for each compound, we have two aromatic H's that are equivalent, giving a singlet. So the NMR shows two singlets, each from a different compound.

But in the problem, the NMR shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes one singlet (the aromatic region), and the two are in 1:1 ratio because the mix is 1:1. So the areas are equal, hence 1:1.

Now, looking at the options, let's consider each pair.

Option A: 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5. Hmm, what would their NMR look like.

Wait, for 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the aromatic H's would be at positions 5 and 6. Are those H's equivalent? If the structure has a center of symmetry, then 5 and 6 would be equivalent, leading to a singlet. So the aromatic region would show a singlet.

For 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the aromatic H's would be at positions 4 and 6. Are 4 and 6 equivalent? Let's think about the structure. The substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So position 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5. Position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1. In this structure, would positions 4 and 6 be equivalent? Hmm, perhaps they are not. Wait, maybe they are related by a symmetry. Let me imagine the molecule. If the substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then position 4 is next to 3 and 5, while position 6 is next to 5 and 1. Are 4 and 6 in symmetric positions? Hmm, perhaps not. So the H's on positions 4 and 6 would not be equivalent, leading to a doublet or more complex splitting. Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are a singlet. So that would imply that there's only one type of aromatic H.

So perhaps for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, if the H's at 4 and 6 are equivalent, then it would give a singlet. But would they be equivalent?

Wait, maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has some symmetry. Let me think, if the substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then the molecule would have a certain symmetry. Wait, perhaps it's a mirror plane that goes through the benzene, maybe through the center between positions 1 and 4? Not sure. If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then position 4 and 6 are mirror images. So their H's would be equivalent. So each would give a singlet.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Another approach: look at the splitting in the aromatic region. Each compound must have all their aromatic protons equivalent, leading to a singlet. So for each compound, the substituents must be arranged symmetrically so that any remaining H's are equivalent.

So let's consider each compound:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents on 1,2,4,5. The remaining H's are on 3 and 6. Are 3 and 6 equivalent? Well, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry between 3 and 6. So yes, the two H's would be equivalent, leading to a singlet.

2. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents on 1,2,3,4. Remaining H's on 5 and 6. Are 5 and 6 equivalent? If the molecule has a center of symmetry, then yes. So their H's are equivalent, singlet.

3. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents on 1,2,3,5. Remaining H's on 4 and 6. Are 4 and 6 equivalent? Let me see. The molecule would have a mirror plane? Maybe through position 3 and 6? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees, positions 4 and 6 swap. So perhaps they are equivalent under a C2 axis. So their H's would be equivalent, giving a singlet.

Wait, so all these compounds would have a singlet in the aromatic region. But wait, in the problem, the spectrum shows two singlets, so each compound must have only one set of aromatic H's.

Wait, but the NMR shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. So each of the two compounds contributes one singlet, each with the same area (since the mixture is 1:1). So the two compounds must each have a singlet in the aromatic region.

So which pairs of the four options would result in two singlets?

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5.

Each has two H's, each pair equivalent, so each gives a singlet. So the NMR would show two singlets, each from each compound. And the ratio would be 1:1, as per the problem. So option A would fit.

Option B) 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

Each would have two H's, equivalent, so two singlets. So the NMR would have two singlets in 1:1 ratio. So option B is possible.

Option C) 1,2,3,5 and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

But diethylbenzene is C10H16, which doesn't match C10H14, so option C is invalid.

Option D) 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

Each has two equivalent H's, so two singlets. So D is possible.

So now I need to look at the other part of the NMR: the three signals at 2.2 ppm, in a 2:1:1 ratio, all singlets.

These are likely the methyl groups attached to the benzene ring. Each methyl group is a singlet because they're attached to a ring (so no neighboring H's to split them). But the multiplicity and integration would depend on the number and equivalence of the methyl groups.

Each compound will have multiple methyl groups, but their equivalence could vary. For example, in a symmetrical structure, some methyl groups are equivalent, leading to fewer signals.

Let me think about each pair.

Starting with option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents on positions 1,2,3,4. The methyl groups at 1,2,3,4. Are any of these equivalent?

In this structure, positions 1 and 4 are across from each other, perhaps? Let me think—positions 1,2,3,4 are consecutive, so 1 and 4 are actually adjacent in a way that's not across. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So positions 1,2,3,4 are four consecutive positions, so in order 1,2,3,4. So the substituents are in positions 1 (top), 2 (next), 3 (next), 4 (bottom left). So the methyls at 1 and 4 are adjacent. Wait, but in this structure, maybe some methyl groups are equivalent. Let me imagine: looking at the ring, positions 1 and 4 are adjacent. So the methyl groups at 1,2,3,4 are in a line. Are any of them equivalent? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, but looking at the molecule, does it have any symmetry?

The structure 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene—is that actually possible? Because four substituents in a row would make the molecule look like a straight line around the ring. Hmm, but benzene is a ring, so the substituents would be next to each other. Let me think about the symmetry.

Wait, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, positions 1 and 4 are symmetric around a certain axis. Hmm, perhaps. So in that case, the methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 would be equivalent. Similarly, the methyl groups at 2 and 3 would be equivalent. So each pair would give a singlet.

So for 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, we would have two sets of methyl groups: those at 1 and 4 (equivalent), and those at 2 and 3 (equivalent). So in the NMR, there would be two methyl singlets. Let's say the integration is 2:2.

Similarly, for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Are any of these methyl groups equivalent?

In this structure, positions 1,2,3,5 have methyl groups. So positions 1,2,3 are consecutive, and 5 is opposite to 2. Let me see: perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent due to symmetry. Because if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, maybe positions 1 and 5 swap? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, the molecule may have a mirror plane that makes the methyl groups at 1 and 5 equivalent.

Wait, let me consider the structure. Positions 1,2,3,5: 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. 2 is adjacent to 1,3. 3 is adjacent to 2,4. 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. So the substituents are at 1,2,3,5. Are any of these substituents in equivalent positions? For example, methyl at 1 and methyl at 5 might be symmetrically equivalent. Thus, their H's would be equivalent, giving a singlet. Similarly, the methyls at 2 and 3: are they equivalent? Let me see. If the molecule is rotated, would the positions swap? Hmm, perhaps not. So in this case, the methyl groups at 1 and 5 would be equivalent, and the methyls at 2 and 3 would be another set.

Wait, no. Wait, 1 and 5 might not be equivalent. Let me think, in the structure 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are at positions 1,2,3,5. So, the ring has substituents in a way that 1,2,3 are adjacent, and the fourth substituent is at 5. So, the arrangement is like 1,2,3, and 5 (opposite to 2, perhaps). Hmm, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry that makes substituents at 1 and 5 equivalent. So, their methyl groups would be equivalent, each giving a singlet. Then the substituents at 2 and 3 are adjacent, but perhaps they're not equivalent. Because substituent at 2 is next to 1 and 3, while substituent at 3 is next to 2 and 4. Wait, but 4 doesn't have a substituent in this structure. So maybe the substituents at 2 and 3 are not equivalent. Hence, each would give their own singlet.

Wait, but no, because if the molecule has a mirror plane, substituents at 2 and 3 could be equivalent. Let me think. If there's a plane that reflects 2 and 3, then their methyl groups would be equivalent. Otherwise, they'd be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents at 2 and 3 are each adjacent to two substituents, so their environments are equivalent. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is adjacent to substituents 1 and 3, whereas substituent 3 is adjacent to substituents 2 and 4 (no substituent at 4). So their environments aren't the same. Therefore, the methyl groups at 2 and 3 would be non-equivalent, giving separate signals.

So for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, we would have three types of methyl groups: 1 and 5 (equivalent), 2, and 3 (each non-equivalent). So the NMR would show three singlets for the methyl groups. Their integration would be 2:1:1. Because the 1 and 5 methyl groups contribute two H's each (but wait, each methyl group has three H's). Wait, wait, each methyl is -CH3, so each contributes 3 H. So if groups 1 and 5 are equivalent, their combined integration would be 6 H (two groups, each 3 H). The methyl at 2 is 3 H, and the methyl at 3 is 3 H. So the integration would be 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1. Yes! So that matches the NMR data.

Now, looking at the other compound in option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's analyze its methyl groups. We have four methyl groups. Are any of them equivalent?

In this structure, substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So the substituents are in four consecutive positions. So in the molecule, substituents at 1 and 4 are adjacent to each other (since 1 is next to 2 and 6; 4 is next to 3 and 5). Wait, but in a ring, 1 and 4 are opposite each other. Oh wait, no, because in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are across from each other. So substituents at 1 and 4 are para to each other. So the substituents at 1 and 4 would be equivalent due to the symmetry of the molecule. Similarly, substituents at 2 and 3 are adjacent, but are they equivalent? Let me think: substituent at 2 is between 1 and 3, substituent at 3 is between 2 and 4. So substituents at 2 and 3 are in similar environments because substituent 1 is next to 2 and substituent 4 is next to 3. Wait, but substituent 4 is a methyl, so substituent 3 is adjacent to substituent 4. Similarly, substituent 2 is adjacent to substituent 1. So substituent 2 and 3 are each adjacent to one methyl group (on either side). So perhaps substituent 2 and 3 are in equivalent environments, leading to equivalent methyl groups.

So in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So the NMR would show two singlets for the methyl groups: one for 1 and 4 (total 2 groups, 6 H), and another for 2 and 3 (2 groups, 6 H), but wait, that would be two signals, each integrating for 6 H. But the problem states three signals with 2:1:1 ratio. So in this case, the 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have two methyl signals, while the other compound would have three? Hmm, but then in the mixture, the total would be 2+3=5 signals, but the problem states only three signals in the methyl region, each a singlet. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says that the NMR has two signals in the aromatic region (each a singlet) and three signals in the methyl region (each a singlet), in a 2:1:1 ratio.

So the three methyl signals must come from both compounds. So perhaps each compound contributes some of the signals.

Wait, in option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have two methyl signals (each integrating for 6 H), and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would have three methyl signals (integrating for 6, 3, 3 H). So when mixed in 1:1 ratio, each compound contributes their own signals. So the NMR would show overlapping signals.

Wait, but let's say the first compound (1,2,3,4) has two methyl signals: one for the 1 and 4 substituents (each 3 H, so together 6 H), and another for 2 and 3 (each 3 H, together 6 H). So in the mixture, these would be present. The second compound (1,2,3,5) would have three methyl signals: 1 and 5 (each 3 H, total 6 H), 2 (3 H), and 3 (3 H). So in the NMR, we would have five methyl signals. But the problem states that there are three signals in the methyl region. So perhaps this option is not correct.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the number of signals.

Wait, maybe in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and substituents at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So two signals: one for 1/4 (6 H), one for 2/3 (6 H). The other compound, 1,2,3,5, has substituents at 1,2,3,5. As earlier, substituents 1 and 5 are equivalent (6 H), substituent 2 (3 H), substituent 3 (3 H). So when mixed, the NMR would have:

- From first compound: two methyl signals (6H and 6H)
- From second compound: three methyl signals (6H, 3H, 3H)
Total: 5 signals, but the problem says three. So option A can't be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Let's consider option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

First, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5. So remaining H's at 3 and 6, which are equivalent, as discussed earlier.

The methyl groups: substituents at 1,2,4,5. Are any of these equivalent?

Let me think. Positions 1 and 5 are across from each other. Positions 2 and 4 are also across. So substituents at 1 and 5 are equivalent (they're para), and substituents at 2 and 4 are equivalent (they're para). So the methyl groups at 1 and 5 would be equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 would be equivalent. So in the NMR, two methyl signals: one for 1 and 5 (each 3 H, so 6 H total), another for 2 and 4 (each 3 H, so 6 H). So two signals, integrating for 6 H each.

The other compound is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which, as before, has three methyl signals: 1 and 5 (6 H), 2 (3 H), 3 (3 H).

When these two compounds are mixed 1:1, the NMR would show:

Methyl signals from first compound (1,2,4,5): two signals, each 6 H.

Methyl signals from second compound (1,2,3,5): three signals (6, 3, 3 H).

But when the two are mixed, their signals would add. So the NMR would have:

- One signal at ~2.2 ppm for 1/5 from both compounds. Wait, but the first compound's 1 and 5 methyl groups (each 3H) would be at the same shift as the second compound's 1 and 5 methyl groups? Or would they be different?

Wait, if both compounds have methyl groups at 1 and 5, but in different structures, their chemical shifts might be similar or different. But in the problem, the methyl signals are three in total. So perhaps the 1/5 methyl groups from both compounds are equivalent, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the 1/5 methyl groups from each compound are not equivalent, leading to separate signals.

Alternatively, maybe all methyl groups across both compounds are at the same shift. But that's not possible because they're in different environments. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two methyl signals (each 6 H) and the 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has three methyl signals (6,3,3). When mixed, the NMR would show:

- Methyls from 1,2,4,5: two signals (each 6 H)
- Methyls from 1,2,3,5: three signals (6,3,3)

But the problem says three signals in the methyl region. So perhaps the two compounds have some shared methyl shifts that merge.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and the 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene have some methyl groups that are equivalent in the mixture. But I'm not seeing how.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of signals each compound contributes. Maybe in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and at 2 and 4 are equivalent. So two signals: one for 1/5 (6 H), another for 2/4 (6 H). So in the mixture, the NMR would have:

- 1/5 from first compound: 6 H
- 2/4 from first compound: 6 H
- 1/5 from second compound: 6 H
- 2 from second compound: 3 H
- 3 from second compound: 3 H

But that's five signals. But the problem states three.

Hmm, maybe another approach. Let's look at the integration ratio: 2:1:1. So the three signals must integrate to 2, 1, 1. So perhaps two of the signals are from one compound, and one from the other.

Wait, the 2:1:1 could be 6 H, 3 H, 3 H. So perhaps the 6 H comes from two methyl groups (each 3 H), and the others are single methyl groups.

Looking back, perhaps the correct pair is 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

Wait, let's think about 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. As discussed, it has two methyl signals: 6 H (1/5 and 2/4). When mixed with 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which has three methyl signals (6 H, 3 H, 3 H), the total would be 5 signals. But the problem says three. So perhaps the two compounds have overlapping methyl signals.

Wait, maybe methyl groups in the same positions across the two compounds have the same shift. For example, in both compounds, the methyl at position 1 and 5 are in similar environments. So their signals would be the same. Hmm, but each compound has different substituents elsewhere. So their shifts would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups at position 2 in both compounds are in similar environments, leading to the same shift. Let me think: in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl at position 2 is adjacent to substituents at 1 and 3, but wait, in that compound, position 3 doesn't have a substituent. Wait, no: 1,2,4,5 have substituents. So in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, position 2 is next to substituents at 1 and 3 (but 3 has no substituent). Hmm, maybe the environment is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups at position 1 and 5 in both compounds are equivalent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two methyl signals (each 6 H), and the other compound has three, but when mixed, some signals overlap, reducing the total number.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think about the other part of the NMR, the methyl signals.

The three signals in the methyl region are in 2:1:1. So perhaps one compound has two methyl groups (equivalent), contributing 2:1, and the other has one, contributing 1. But that's not matching.

Wait, no. The 2:1:1 ratio implies three signals, each integrating to 2, 1, 1. But each methyl group contributes 3 H. So 2 *3 =6, 1 *3=3, 1 *3=3. So the integrations would be in 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.

So perhaps, one of the compounds contributes a signal of 6 H (two methyl groups, each 3 H), and the other contributes two signals of 3 H each.

Looking at the options, which pair would do this.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two methyl signals, each 6 H.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: three methyl signals, 6,3,3 H.

When mixed, the NMR would show:

- From first compound: two signals (6H each)
- From second compound: three signals (6H,3H,3H)

But that's five signals. But the problem says three, so this can't be right.

Let's think of another angle. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

Each has two methyl signals.

So for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two signals (6H each).
For 1,2,3,4: two signals (6H each).

So when mixed, the NMR would show four methyl signals. But the problem states three. So this doesn't fit.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

1,2,4,5 has two methyl signals (6H each), 1,2,3,5 has three (6,3,3).

When mixed, total of five signals. Not matching.

Option A: 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5.

1,2,3,4: two methyl signals (6H each)
1,2,3,5: three methyl signals (6,3,3)

Again, five signals. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has more than two methyl signals.

Wait, let me reevaluate the structure of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So positions 5 and 6 are H's.

Now, in this structure, the methyl groups at 1,2,3,4. Are any of these methyl groups equivalent?

If the structure has a plane of symmetry between positions 1 and 4, making methyl groups at 1 and 4 equivalent, and methyl groups at 2 and 3 equivalent.

So two methyl signals: 1/4 (6H) and 2/3 (6H).

So in the mixture, when combined with another compound that has three methyl signals, the total would be five. But the problem only shows three.

Wait, perhaps the other compound only has one methyl signal. But that's not possible because it's a tetramethyl.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structures wrong. Let me think about 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Are any of the methyl groups equivalent?

In this structure, substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the methyl groups at 1 and 5: are they in symmetric positions?

If you imagine the benzene ring, substituent 1 is at the top, substituent 5 is at the bottom. So substituent 1 is at position 1 (top), substituent 5 is at position 5 (bottom left perhaps). Are these positions symmetric? Maybe there is a mirror plane that reflects substituent 1 and 5, making their methyl groups equivalent. So the methyl groups at 1 and 5 would be equivalent, contributing a 6H signal. The methyl groups at 2 and 3: substituent 2 is at position 2 (next to 1), substituent 3 is at position 3 (next to 2 and 4). Are substituents 2 and 3 in equivalent environments? Hmm, substituent 2 is next to substituent 1, which is a methyl, and substituent 3 is next to substituent 4, which is H. So their environments are different. Therefore, substituents 2 and 3 would have different shifts, leading to two separate signals. So for this compound, three methyl signals: 6H (1+5), 3H (2), 3H (3).

Thus, when mixed with a compound that has two methyl signals, the total becomes five, which doesn't fit the problem's three signals.

Wait, perhaps the correct pair is 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

Wait, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. Are any of these equivalent?

1 and 5 are para, so their methyl groups are equivalent. 2 and 4 are also para, so their methyl groups are equivalent. So this compound would have two methyl signals: 6H (1+5) and 6H (2+4).

The other compound is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,4. So methyl groups at 1,2,3,4. Are any of these equivalent? 1 and 4 are para, so equivalent. 2 and 3 are adjacent but perhaps not equivalent. Wait, substituent 2 is next to 1 and 3, substituent 3 is next to 2 and 4. So their environments are different. So the methyl groups at 2 and 3 are non-equivalent. Thus, this compound would have three methyl signals: 6H (1+4), 3H (2), 3H (3).

When mixed, the NMR would have:

- From first compound: 6H (1+5), 6H (2+4)
- From second compound: 6H (1+4), 3H (2), 3H (3)

But this gives five signals, which again doesn't match the problem's three.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think about the other part of the NMR—the aromatic protons. The problem states two singlets in the aromatic region.

So each compound must have only one type of aromatic proton. So each compound's aromatic protons must be equivalent.

Which of the options have each compound's aromatic protons equivalent?

Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

1,2,4,5: aromatic H's at 3 and 6. Are they equivalent? Yes, because the structure is symmetric. So a singlet.

1,2,3,5: aromatic H's at 4 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let me think. The substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So positions 4 and 6: are they equivalent? Hmm, substituent 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5, substituent 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1. Are these environments the same? Maybe not. So the H's at 4 and 6 would be different, leading to a doublet or more splitting. Thus, this compound wouldn't give a singlet. So option D is invalid.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

1,2,4,5: aromatic H's at 3 and 6; equivalent, singlet.

1,2,3,4: aromatic H's at 5 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let's see. In this structure, substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So positions 5 and 6 are across from each other. Are they equivalent? Yes, because the molecule has a center of symmetry, so 5 and 6 are equivalent. So their H's are equivalent, giving a singlet. So this pair would each give a singlet in the aromatic region, fitting the NMR.

Now, checking the methyl signals.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two methyl signals (6H each).

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: two methyl signals (6H each).

When mixed, each would contribute their signals. So the NMR would show four methyl signals. But the problem states three. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

Wait, let me think again about their aromatic protons.

1,2,4,5: equivalent H's at 3 and 6 → singlet.

1,2,3,5: H's at 4 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let me think. In this structure, H's at 4 and 6. The substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So position 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5, while position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1. Are these positions symmetric? Maybe yes. For example, if the molecule has a mirror plane that swaps positions 4 and 6, their H's would be equivalent. So the aromatic H's would be a singlet.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the H's at 4 and 6 are not equivalent. But let's proceed.

So in the NMR, both aromatic regions are singlets.

Now, the methyl groups.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two methyl signals (6H each).

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: three methyl signals (6,3,3).

When mixed, it's 1:1 ratio. So the NMR would show:

- 6H from 1,2,4,5 (1 and 5 methyl groups)
- 6H from 1,2,3,5 (1 and 5 methyl groups)
- 6H from 1,2,4,5 (2 and 4)
- 3H from 1,2,3,5 (2)
- 3H from 1,2,3,5 (3)

Wait, but perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 in both compounds are in the same environment, leading to the same chemical shift. So:

- Methyl groups 1 and 5 in both compounds: total 6H +6H=12H, but in the NMR, it would appear as a single peak with 12H. But the problem states that the methyl signals are in 2:1:1 ratio. So that would be three peaks. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 in both compounds are equivalent, leading to a single peak for all four methyl groups (but that's four groups, 12 H, which wouldn't fit the 2:1:1 ratio).

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups at 2 in both compounds are equivalent. For example, in 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5, the methyl at position 2 in each would be in similar environments, leading to the same shift. So their signals would merge.

Similarly, the methyl at position 4 in 1,2,4,5 would be in a different environment than any others.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about which two compounds would produce three methyl signals in a 2:1:1 ratio when mixed in a 1:1 ratio.

The 2:1:1 ratio suggests that one signal is twice as large as the other two, each being the same.

Each signal corresponds to a certain number of H's. For 2:1:1, the integrations are 6,3,3.

So perhaps one compound contributes a 6H signal (two methyl groups), and the other contributes a 6H, 3H, and 3H. But when mixed, the 6H from each would add, making 12H, which is not possible because the ratio is 2:1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H in the 2:1:1 comes from one compound, and the other two signals come from the other compound.

Wait, but the 2:1:1 is the ratio of the signals. So their areas are in that proportion.

Wait, perhaps each compound contributes a 6H and a 3H signal. When mixed, the 6H signals from each compound could merge into a single 12H signal, but that's not matching the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the 6H from one compound and 3H and 3H from another form the 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, perhaps the 6H comes from one compound's two methyl groups, and the 3H and 3H from another. Since each compound is present in a 1:1 ratio, the 6H would be present in each, but in the mixture, it would be 6+6=12 H, which is 2:1:1 ratio when considering the other 6 H (but that's not adding up correctly).

Alternatively, perhaps one compound contributes a 6H signal (from two methyl groups), and the other contributes a 3H and 3H. So in the mixture, the 6H (2 signals) would each appear as a single peak, but perhaps they're the same.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the options and the given NMR data.

Another approach: the aromatic protons in each compound must be equivalent, giving a singlet. So each compound must have a symmetric structure that makes the aromatic H's equivalent.

Looking at the options, which pairs have structures where each compound's aromatic H's are equivalent.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

1,2,4,5: H's at 3 and 6. Are they equivalent? Yes, due to symmetry.

1,2,3,5: H's at 4 and 6. Are they equivalent?

Wait, substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So H's at 4 and 6. If the molecule has a symmetry that swaps 4 and 6, then yes. Let me imagine the structure: substituents at 1,2,3,5. So position 4 is next to 3 and 5, position 6 is next to 5 and 1. Are 4 and 6 in symmetric positions? Maybe not. So perhaps the H's at 4 and 6 are not equivalent. So this compound's aromatic H's would not be a singlet, making option D invalid.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

1,2,4,5: H's at 3 and 6 → singlet.

1,2,3,4: H's at 5 and 6 → are they equivalent? Yes, because substituents are symmetric, so they give a singlet.

So option B has both compounds with equivalent aromatic H's, leading to two singlets in the NMR. Now, checking the methyl signals.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two methyl signals, 6H each.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: two methyl signals, 6H each.

So in the mixture, the NMR would have four methyl signals, which doesn't match the problem's three.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Let me think again about their methyl groups.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

1,2,4,5: methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. So 1 and 5 are equivalent (6H), 2 and 4 are equivalent (6H).

1,2,3,5: methyl groups at 1,2,3,5. So 1 and5 are equivalent (6H), 2 (3H), 3 (3H).

When mixed in 1:1 ratio, the 1/5 methyl groups from both compounds: each contributes 6H, so total 12H. The 2/4 from first compound: 6H, and 2/3 from second: 3H each.

Wait, but the NMR shows three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps the 1/5 methyl groups from both compounds are not equivalent, leading to separate signals. So that would be 12H in two separate signals (6H each), but that doesn't fit the 2:1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2 methyl groups from the first compound and the 3 methyl groups from the second have some overlapping shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups at 2 in both compounds are in the same environment, leading to a merged signal.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

The correct answer must be option D, because in the aromatic region, each compound would give a singlet, and the methyl groups add up to the required ratio.

Wait, perhaps the methyl groups from both compounds at position 2 are equivalent because they're in the same position relative to other substituents. So their signals would merge, leading to a single peak.

So, in option D:

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: methyl at 2 → 3H, and methyl at 4 →3H (but 4 is equivalent to 2 in this compound).

Wait, no, in 1,2,4,5, the methyl at 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3 (which has substituent in the other compound), but perhaps the environment is the same as the methyl at 2 in the other compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups at position 2 in both compounds are in similar environments, merging their signals.

So, in the NMR:

- Methyl groups at 1/5 (both compounds): each contributes 6H. So two separate signals? Or perhaps the same shift. If the same, it would be 12H, but the problem's maximum is 2:1:1.

Alternatively, the methyl groups at 2 from both compounds are the same, leading to a 6H signal (since each contributes 3H). The methyl groups at 3 and 4 would be 3H each. So the signals would be 6H (from 2's), 6H (from 1/5), 3H (from3), 3H (from4). But that's four signals, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the substitution patterns.

The correct compounds must have all aromatic H's equivalent, leading to two singlets. So the correct option is either A, B, or D, because option C includes diethylbenzene which doesn't fit the formula.

From earlier analysis, option B is possible because both compounds have equivalent aromatic H's.

Now, checking the methyl signals. For option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

Each has two methyl signals (6 H each).

But when mixed, it's four signals. The problem says three. So perhaps one of these signals overlaps.

Wait, perhaps in both compounds, the methyl groups at position 2 and 4 are in the same environment. For example, in 1,2,4,5, the methyl at 2 is adjacent to substituents at 1 and 3 (which has none in this compound). In 1,2,3,4, the methyl at 2 is adjacent to substituents at 1 and 3 (both methyl). So their environments are different. So their shifts would be different, leading to separate signals.

So option B's methyl signals would be four, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assessment. Perhaps the correct pair is option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

In this case, the aromatic H's would each be a singlet.

The methyl groups:

1,2,4,5: two methyl signals (6H and 6H).

1,2,3,5: three methyl signals (6H, 3H, 3H).

When mixed, perhaps the 6H signals from both compounds merge into a single 12H signal, but that's not fitting 2:1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H from each compound adds up to 12H, which is twice the 6H of the other signals. But the ratio would be 12:3:3, which is 4:1:1, not 2:1:1.

Hmm, another thought. The 2:1:1 ratio could come from the two compounds contributing 6H, 3H, 3H in total.

So perhaps one compound contributes a 6H and a 3H, and the other contributes a 3H.

But that would require each compound to have specific methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps one compound has a 6H and a 3H, and the other has a 3H and a 6H.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, and the three signals come from the two compounds' methyl groups overlapping in a way that forms three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, despite the four signals, but I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I've been overcomplicating and the correct answer is D.

Wait, I'm going to make a choice. Based on the aromatic H's, option D has both compounds giving a singlet each, which fits. For the methyls, perhaps the 1,2,4,5 contributes two signals (6H each), and the 1,2,3,5 contributes three (6,3,3), but when mixed, some signals overlap, leading to three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, perhaps the 6H from 1,2,4,5 and the 6H from 1,2,3,5 both contribute to the same peak, giving 12H, which is not fitting. Alternatively, perhaps one of the 6H signals is split into two, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should choose option D as the answer.


The problem involves identifying two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula **C₁₀H₁₄** that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produce the described NMR spectrum. The NMR data includes two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm, 1:1 ratio) and three singlets in the methyl region (~2.2 ppm, 2:1:1 ratio). The compounds must be tetramethylbenzenes, as diethylbenzene (C₁₀H₁₆) does not match the molecular formula.
