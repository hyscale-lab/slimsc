Okay, so I'm looking at this enamine reaction problem. Hmm, I remember that enamines are typically formed from secondary amines and carbonyl compounds. The process usually involves two steps: first, the formation of a Schiff base by condensing the amine with a carbonyl, and then dehydrating it to form the enamine. But wait, the question is about the reagents and the product, so I need to think through the steps carefully.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Let me try to visualize that structure. So, pentan-2-ylidene would be a double bond between C2 and C3 of a pentane chain. The ethanaminium part suggests that it's an ammonium ion with a methyl group attached, maybe from a previous alkylation or something.

The reaction is with reagent A, which is a sequence of steps. The options give different sequences, so I need to figure out what each reagent does. Let's look at the options.

Option A: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. The product B is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. Hmm, wait, LDA is a strong base, used for deprotonating things. DME is a solvent. Then CH3CH2I is ethyl iodide. Then H3O+ is acidic workup.

Wait, the
