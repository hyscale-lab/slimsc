Okay, so I've got this physics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is given as E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And the question defines E as (π²ħ²)/(2mL²), so E is basically the coefficient for n squared. So each particle's energy is E multiplied by n squared, where n is the quantum number.

Wait, but wait. The particles are spin-1/2, so they are fermions. That means they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, right? So each quantum state can hold only one particle. But wait, in a 1D well, the quantum state is determined just by the principal quantum number n, or is it more complicated? Oh right, in a 1D box, each energy level is non-degenerate. Because for a 1D infinite well, the energy depends only on n, and each n is unique. So each n can hold only one particle because of the Pauli exclusion, since they are fermions with half-integer spin.

Wait, no. Wait, in 3D, the quantum numbers are more, but in 1D, each energy level has a single state. So each n can only be occupied by one fermion because of their spin. Wait, spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states, right? So each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins. Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, spin-1/2 particles are fermions, so each unique quantum state can have at most one particle. But the quantum state is determined by all the quantum numbers. In 1D, the particles are described by a single quantum number n. But wait, for fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But for a 1D box, the spatial wavefunction is either even or odd. Hmm, perhaps I should think more carefully.

Wait, maybe for a 1D infinite potential well, each energy level is non-degenerate, meaning each n corresponds to a unique state. But for spin-1/2 particles, each n can hold two particles with opposite spins. Because the spin multiplicity allows two particles in the same spatial state but different spin states. So each n can have two particles. So the number of particles is limited by the number of available n's multiplied by 2.

But wait, the question is about four particles. So, let's think about how they fill the energy levels.

The ground state would have the lowest possible energies. So the first two n's (n=1 and n=2) can each hold two particles (since spin up and spin down), so that's 4 particles. So the ground state configuration would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. Wait wait, no, no, wait. Each n can have two particles. So n=1 holds two particles, n=2 holds two particles. That's four particles total. So the ground state is (n=1)^2 (n=2)^2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, spin-1/2 allows for two particles in each n. So n=1 can have two particles (each with opposite spins), n=2 can have two, etc. But wait, since four particles are being placed, n=1 and n=2 each can hold two particles. So the ground state would have each of the lowest two levels filled, each with two particles.

So the energy of the ground state would be the sum of the energies of each particle. Each particle in n=1 contributes E*(1)^2 = E. There are two particles there, so 2E. Similarly, n=2 contributes E*(2)^2 =4E, and two particles, so 8E. So total ground state energy is 2E +8E =10 E? Wait, but wait. Oh wait, no, no. Because each particle's energy is E multiplied by n squared. So for n=1: E*1²= E. Two particles in n=1: 2*E. n=2: 4E, two particles: 8E. So total is 2E+8E=10E.

But wait, that can't be right because the options don't have the ground state as 10E. Wait, the options have option C as 4E, 10E, 15E. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me think again. Each particle in a state contributes E times their n squared. So if you have four fermions in the well, each with spin-1/2, they can occupy the lowest energy states with the lowest possible n's, considering that each n can hold two particles (since spin up and spin down are allowed).

So the first two energy levels (n=1 and n=2) can hold two particles each. So in the ground state, all four particles are in n=1 and n=2, each with two particles.

So the total energy is for each particle in n=1: E*(1²) each, so two particles: 2E. For n=2: E*(2²) each, two particles: 4E *2 =8E. So total is 2E +8E =10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says ground state is 4E, but option C has ground state as 4E, first excited as 10E, etc. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake about how the particles are filled.

Wait, another approach: The ground state for four spin-1/2 particles would have the lowest possible energies. Each n can hold two particles, so n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. So the total energy is (n=1) 2*(1²)E + (n=2) 2*(2²)E = 2E + 8E = 10E. So ground state is 10E.

Wait, but in the options, option B's ground state is 4E. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the particles are bosons, but no, the question says spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions. So each n can have two particles. Oh wait, but no, wait. Wait, in 1D, perhaps each n can hold only one particle because the spatial wavefunction would have to be antisymmetric? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, in 1D, the spin is a separate degree of freedom. So each spatial state can have up to two particles with opposite spins. So n=1 can have two particles, n=2 can have two, and so on.

So for four particles, n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So total energy would be (2*(1)^2 + 2*(2)^2) E = (2 +8) E =10E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C's ground state is 4E. So perhaps I'm not interpreting the question correctly.

Wait, maybe the particles are in a one-dimensional box and each state is non-degenerate, and each can hold two particles. So the ground state would have the lowest energy when the particles are filled into the lowest possible states.

Wait, perhaps the way the question is worded, it's about the individual particles, but the problem asks for the energies of the system's ground state, first excited, and second excited states. So perhaps I should think about the possible configurations for four particles and their total energies.

Wait, but the system's energy would be the sum of the energies of all four particles.

So for the ground state, the configuration is n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So the energies are 1²E, 1²E, 2²E, 2²E. Sum is 2E +8E=10E.

But looking at the options, option B has ground state 4E. So that can't be right. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe each particle is in a unique state. Because for spin-1/2, each n can hold two particles. So four particles would fill up n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So for the ground state, the total energy is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) )= 2E +8E =10E.

If that's the case, then the ground state is 10E.

But looking at the options, option C's ground state is 4E, which is 4E. So that would be the case if the configuration was n=1 with four particles, but that's not possible because each n can hold only two. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the four particles are in the same state? No, because each n can only hold two due to spin. So four would require n=1 (2), n=2 (2). So that gives a ground state of 10E.

Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the ground state in any option except option B and C. Option B's ground state is 4E, which is lower than 10E. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the way the particles fill is different. Maybe in the ground state, only the lowest n is filled as much as possible. Wait, but n=1 can hold two, n=2 can hold two, so 4 particles would fill both n=1 and n=2.

I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Each spin-1/2 particle in a 1D box can have its spatial wavefunction ψ_n(x) and spin state. Since the spin can be up or down, each n can hold two particles with opposite spins. So for four particles:

- n=1: two particles (spin up and down)
- n=2: two particles (spin up and down)
So total energy is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E +8E =10E. So ground state is 10E. Then the first excited state would be when a particle is promoted to a higher energy level.

Wait, but what's the first excited state for four particles? The ground state is filled as n=1 and n=2 with two each.

The first excited state would be the state where one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to the next available level, which is n=3. So now, the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But wait, but since each n can hold two, perhaps I'm not considering the possible arrangements correctly.

Wait, maybe the first excited state would be when the highest filled state is n=3, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps it's when the particles are arranged in a way that the next highest possible state is filled beyond the ground state.

Wait, maybe the ground state is all four in the lowest possible states, which would be n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So the total energy is 10E as I thought.

The first excited state would be when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So now, the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But wait, each n can hold two, so perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, but we can't have a half-filled state unless we consider that for four particles, perhaps the next available state is n=3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible combinations.

Wait, the ground state is the lowest possible energy, which is 10E. The first excited state would be the next possible energy. How do the particles arrange for that?

Alternatively, maybe the system's ground state isn't filled as 2 and 2 in n=1 and n=2, but perhaps it's filled differently. Wait, but with spin-1/2, you can have two in each n, so filling the lowest two n's with two particles each makes sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the system's energy levels, treating them as distinguishable particles. But no, they are fermions, so antisymmetry applies.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of the possible energy levels for the system.

The ground state: four particles, each in the lowest possible states. So for spin-1/2, each n can hold two, so n=1 (2) and n=2 (2) → total energy 10E.

The first excited state would have the highest possible filled state increased. So perhaps one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So now, the energies would be: for n=1: 2E, n=2: 1×4E, and n=3:1×9E. So total energy = 2E +4E +9E =15 E.

Wait, but that's if only three particles are in the first three n's. Wait, no, four particles in total. So, if in the first excited state, the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the sum is 2×1² E +1×2² E + 1×3² E = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, so the configuration becomes n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the total energy is 2×1E +1×4E +1×9E= 2E +4E +9E =15E. So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E.

Then, the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted, perhaps from n=2 to n=3 (but that's already filled), or maybe from n=3 to n=4?

Wait, but let's think: the first excited state is 15E. The second excited state could be when another particle moves to a higher state.

Wait, perhaps the filling is as follows:

Ground state (lowest energy): n=1 (2), n=2 (2): 2E +8E=10E.

First excited state: one particle from n=2 moves to n=3, so n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Sum: 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, so now n=3 has two, n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). Sum: 2E +0 + 2*9E= 2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but wait, what about the next possible state? Or perhaps the first excited state is when the next higher state is filled.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, making total energy 15E. Then the second excited state would be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making n=3 filled with two, which is 2E (n=1) + 0E (n=2) + 18E (n=3) =20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle moves from n=3 to n=4. Let's compute that.

Wait, in the first excited state (15E), we have n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1.

For the second excited state, perhaps another particle moves to n=4.

So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:0, n=4:1.

Sum:2E +4E +0 +16E=22E.

But that may not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the highest occupied state is n=4.

Wait, but perhaps the way to approach this is to find all possible configurations and their energies.

Wait, but considering that four particles must be arranged in the lowest possible energy states, but when determining the excited states, the particles are excited to higher states.

Let me list all possible possible configurations and their energy sums.

Total particles:4.

Each n can hold max 2.

Possible configurations:

1. n=1 (2), n=2 (2): E = 2*1 E + 2*4 E= 2E+8E=10E → ground state.

2. n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1): E=2*1 +1*4 +1*9= 2 +4 +9=15E → first excited.

3. n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2): sum=2*1 +0 +2*9= 2 + 18=20E → second excited?

But wait, another possibility is:

n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (0): but that's the same as the first excited.

Wait, no, perhaps another configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (2), which sum to 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

Is this a higher energy than 15E? Yes, 20E>15E.

So the possible energies are 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 20E (second excited). But looking at the options, none of them have these numbers. Wait, let's check the options again.

Option A:30E, 39E,50E.

Option B:4E,10E,50E.

Option C:4E,10E,15E.

Option D:10E,15E,18E.

Wait, our calculations don't match any of these. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in how the particles fill the states. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: for four spin-1/2 particles, the possible ground state is filled with the lowest possible n's, each holding two particles.

n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. So total energy: 2*(1) +2*(4) = 2+8=10E → ground state.

The first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to n=3. So the configuration becomes:

n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1.

Sum: 2*1 +1*4 +1*9= 2+4+9=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle is promoted. So either:

- Promote the last particle in n=2 to n=3 → now n=3 has two, and n=2 is empty.

So sum: 2*1 +0 +2*9=2+0+18=20E.

Alternatively, the next state could be promoting a particle from n=3 to n=4.

So sum would be 2*1 +1*4 +0 +1*16=2+4+0+16=22E.

But looking at the options, the only one that includes 10E, 15E, and 20E, but none of the options have that.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the question is considering the particles in a way that each state is unique, but without considering spin. That would be incorrect, but perhaps the question treats each n as a separate state, regardless of spin, which would imply each n can only hold one particle. But for spin-1/2, each n can hold two, so that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering each particle as distinguishable, which would be incorrect for fermions, but perhaps the question is not considering the Pauli principle, which would be a problem. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that each n can hold as many particles as possible, which would only be the case for bosons.

Wait, but the question says spin-1/2, which are fermions. So each spatial state can have two particles (opposite spins). So the configuration must follow that.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the system's energy levels when the particles are indistinct fermions, but perhaps the way the energy levels are considered is different. Let me think about the possible energies for each configuration.

Let me list all possible configurations and their sum.

1. All four in n=1? No, because maximum two per n.

2. Two in n=1, two in n=2 → sum 2E +8E=10E.

3. Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 → sum 2E +4E +9E=15E.

4. Two in n=1, two in n=3 → sum 2E + 18E=20E.

5. Two in n=2, two in n=3 → sum 8E +18E=26E.

6. One in n=1, three in n=2 → sum 1E + 12E=13E. But wait, can n=2 hold three? No, because each n can hold two. So that's impossible.

So the possible energy levels are 10E (ground), 15E, 20E, 26E, etc. So the first excited state is 15E, second is 20E. But none of the options have this.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: 4E, 10E,15E.

Option B:4E,10E,50E.

Option D:10E,15E,18E.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the particles are placed. Let me try considering that each n can hold only one particle, which would be the case if spin is not considered. But the question says spin-1/2, so that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are distinguishable. If that's the case, the energy would be the sum of each particle's energy, with no Pauli restrictions. But for four distinguishable particles, each can occupy the same state. But that would allow four particles in n=1, sum being 4E. So ground state would be 4E, first excited 10E, etc. Let's see.

Wait, but if particles are distinguishable, which they aren't, but if that's the assumption, then:

Ground state: all four particles in n=1 → sum 4E.

First excited state: three in n=1, one in n=2 → sum 3E +4E=7E.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the particles as distinguishable, but I think that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says "Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E."

Wait, perhaps the system's energy is the sum of the energies of each particle, considering that each particle must be in a unique state (which would be the case for fermions without considering spin, but with spin, each state can hold two particles). Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible energy levels for each particle and then find the possible system energies.

Each particle can be in any n, but considering that each n can have two particles (spin up and down). So four particles will fill n=1 and n=2, each with two. So ground state is 10E.

After that, the first excited state would have one particle promoted to n=3, making the configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), sum 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making n=3 have two, so configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2), sum 2E +0 +18E=20E.

Looking at the options, none have 20E as the second excited state. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm considering only one particle moving at a time, but perhaps the system can have a lower energy configuration when particles are promoted in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), which is 15E. The second excited state could be when a particle is promoted to n=4, making sum 2E +4E +9E +16E= 31E, but that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3, giving sum 2E +4E + 18E=24E, but that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), which is 15E. Then the second excited state is when another particle is promoted to n=3, making it 20E as before, but none of the options have 20E.

Wait, let's look at the options again:

Option C: 4E,10E,15E.

Ah! So in option C, the ground state is 4E, which would be the case if all four particles are in n=1, but that's only possible if each n can hold four particles, which isn't the case for spin-1/2.

So perhaps the question is treating each particle as distinguishable, ignoring the Pauli exclusion. If that's the case, then:

Each particle's energy is E*n².

Ground state: all four in n=1 → sum 4E.

First excited state: three in n=1, one in n=2 → sum 3E +4E=7E.

Wait, but that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are bosons, and can all be in the same state. So ground state is 4E, first excited state would be when one moves to n=2 → sum 3E +4E=7E. Second excited state would be when another moves to n=2: 2E + 8E=10E. Then the energies would be 4E,7E,10E, which doesn't match any option.

Hmm. Let me think differently. The options suggest that the ground state is 4E, which would mean four particles in n=1. That can't be possible with spin-1/2 fermions unless each n can hold four, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the potential well is such that each energy level is (n^2) E, and for four particles, the ground state is when they are in the lowest energy levels.

If each n can hold two particles, then the ground state would be (n=1) two particles and (n=2) two particles → sum 2E +8E=10E.

But none of the options have 10E as the ground state except option B and D.

Option B:4E,10E,50E.

Option D:10E,15E,18E.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering each particle as having a unique state, ignoring spin. So each n can hold only one particle. So for four particles, the ground state would be four different n's filled, each with one particle.

So n=1,2,3,4. Sum: 1E +4E +9E +16E=30E. So ground state is 30E.

First excited state would be when the highest n increases. But wait, that doesn't make sense because in the ground state, they're all in the lowest possible n's. So the first excited state would be when the highest n increases, but that would require one particle to have a higher n.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when the four particles are in n=1,2,3,4, each with one particle. Sum 30E.

The first excited state would be swapping one particle from n=4 to n=5, so sum becomes 1+4+9+25=39E.

Second excited state: another swap to n=6, sum 1+4+9+36=50E. So the energies would be 30E,39E,50E. Which matches option A.

But wait, the question says the particles are spin-1/2, which are fermions. So without considering spin, each n can hold one particle. But if we do consider spin, each n can hold two. So the correct approach would be to consider that each n can hold two particles, which would make the ground state 10E.

But the options don't have 10E as part of a set except B and D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the particles are in a 1D box and that each energy level is non-degenerate and can hold two particles, but the particles are being treated as distinguishable. Which would be incorrect for fermions, but perhaps the question is ignoring that.

If that's the case, then the ground state would have all four in n=1 → 4E. Then the first excited state would have three in n=1 and one in n=2 → 3E +4E=7E. Second excited state would have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 → sum 2E +4E +9E=15E. But the options don't have 7E and 15E.

Wait, but option C has 4E,10E,15E. So perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2, and two in n=1, giving sum 2E + 8E=10E. But that would be the ground state, not the first excited.

I'm getting stuck. Let's recap.

The correct approach is to consider four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite well. Each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So the ground state configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (2), sum 2E +8E=10E.

The first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Sum 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state is when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. Now, n=3 has two, and n=2 has zero. Sum 2E +0 + 18E=20E.

But none of the options have 10E,15E,20E. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the individual energies of the particles, not the total. No, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system".

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question made a mistake, and the correct option is not present. But that's unlikely.

Wait, looking at option D:10E,15E,18E.

How would 18E be achieved? Let's see: 10E is ground state (2E +8E). First excited is 15E (2E +4E +9E). Second excited would be when another particle is promoted. Let's see:

If a particle from n=3 is promoted to n=4, sum becomes 2E +4E + 0 +16E=22E.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration for the second excited state is n=1:2, n=2:2, n=3:2, but that would require six particles. No, four particles.

Perhaps another configuration is n=1:2, n=3:2. Sum: 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E.

But option D's second excited state is 18E. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=4. Let's calculate:

n=1:2, n=2:1, n=4:1. Sum=2E +4E +16E=22E.

No, that's not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, but another is promoted to n=3 as well. So n=1:2, n=3:2. Sum=2E + 18E=20E.

But again, that doesn't match 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3 and n=2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible options.

Looking at option C:4E,10E,15E.

If the ground state is 4E, that would mean all four particles are in n=1, which is only possible if each n can hold four, which isn't the case for spin-1/2 particles. So perhaps the question is considering that each n can hold four, which would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering each n can hold two, but for some reason, the ground state is filled as n=1 (2), and n=2 (1), and n=3 (1). But that would be 2E +4E +9E=15E, which is higher than 10E.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the particles as indistinguishable, but each n can hold any number. That would be incorrect for fermions but perhaps the question is ignoring that.

In that case, the ground state would be all four in n=1, sum 4E. First excited: three in n=1, one in n=2 → sum 3E +4E=7E. Second excited: two in n=1, two in n=2 → sum 2E +8E=10E. That would make the energies 4E,7E,10E, but that's not any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are in n=1 (2), n=2 (2), which is the ground state. Then the first excited state would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), sum 15E. Second excited state is n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → 2E +18E=20E.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=3, and another is promoted to n=4. But with four particles, perhaps the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (0). Sum=2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted, perhaps to n=4. So now n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (0), n=4 (1). Sum=2E +4E +16E=22E.

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the question is considering that the ground state is the lowest possible sum, which would be when the particles are in the lowest n's. But perhaps the question is treating the particles as bosons, where each n can hold any number.

In that case, ground state would be all four in n=1 → 4E. First excited: three in n=1, one in n=2 → sum 3E +4E=7E. Second excited: two in n=1, two in n=2 → sum 2E +8E=10E.

But none of the options have 4,7,10.

Wait, looking back, option C has 4E,10E,15E. So perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=1 → sum 10E, which would be the ground state. That can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two are in n=2 and two in n=3 → sum 8E +18E=26E, but that's not in the options.

Hmm, this is taking too long. I think I need to make a decision based on the options.

The correct approach, considering spin-1/2 fermions, is that each n can hold two particles. So the ground state is 10E. The first excited is 15E. The second excited is 20E. But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering each particle as having a unique state, regardless of spin. So each n can hold one particle. So four particles in n=1,2,3,4 → sum=30E.

First excited: replace the highest n=4 with n=5 → sum=1+4+9+25=39E.

Second excited: replace n=5 with n=6 → sum=30E-25E+36E=41E? No, wait, no. The second excited would be when two particles are promoted, perhaps.

But this leads to option A:30E,39E,50E.

So that's option A.

But wait, according to this, the energies would be 30E (ground), 39E (first excited), 50E (second excited).

But why would the second excited state be 50E? Because 30E is filled as n=1,2,3,4. First excited:5 replaces 4 → 30E -16E +25E=39E. Second excited: replace 5 with 6 → sum=39E -25E +36E=50E.

So option A would be the correct choice.

But why would this be the case when the particles are spin-1/2 fermions? Because in reality, each n can hold two particles. So perhaps the question is considering that each n can hold only one, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, but among the options, option A seems to fit if each n can hold only one particle.

But I'm getting stuck. I think I need to proceed with the information I have.

If the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E. But since none of the options have that, perhaps the question is considering each n can hold only one particle, making option A correct.

Alternatively, the question might have a typo, but in the absence of more information, perhaps the intended answer is option C:4E,10E,15E. Because that would mean the ground state is filled as n=1 (4 particles), which is impossible for fermions, but perhaps the question is ignoring spin.

But that doesn't make sense. I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible sum of the four particles' energies.

The ground state would have the four lowest possible individual energies.

If each n can hold two, the four particles would be in n=1 (2) and n=2 (2): sum 2E +8E=10E.

The first excited state would have one in n=3, so sum 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would have another in n=3, sum 2E +0 +18E=20E.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 4E,10E,15E, assuming each n can hold four particles, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the system's energy levels without considering spin, leading to option A.

But I'm not sure. Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option C, considering that the ground state is 4E, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the spin doesn't affect the energy, and each particle's state is uniquely determined by n. So each n can hold only one particle. So four particles in n=1,2,3,4 → sum 30E. Then first excited is when the highest n is increased to 5: sum 39E. Second excited to 6:50E. So option A.

But the question states the particles are spin-1/2, so this approach is incorrect. But perhaps the question is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating the particles as distinguishable, allowing all four to be in n=1, sum 4E. Then first excited state would have one in n=2: sum 3E +4E=7E. Second excited state would have two in n=2: sum 2E +8E=10E. So option C:4E,10E,15E. Wait, no, because 7E isn't an option.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the initial correct approach (spin-1/2 fermions, each n holds two), the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E. But none of the options have that.

Looking at the options, the only one that includes 10E is option B and D.

Option D:10E,15E,18E.

How would 18E be achieved? Let's see. 10E (ground) → 15E (first excited) → 18E (second excited).

Perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=4, so sum would be 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) + 16E (n=4) =22E. No, that's not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3, but that would require two promotions, making sum 2E + 0 +18E=20E.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → 15E. The second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=4, making sum 2E +4E +0 +16E=22E.

But option D's second excited state is 18E. How?

Wait, 18E is 9×2. So perhaps two particles in n=3: sum 2E + 18E=20E. No.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4 and another to n=3, but that would require more particles than we have.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=1 to n=2, making the configuration n=1 (1), n=2 (3). But n=2 can only hold two, so that's impossible.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer, based on the spin-1/2 consideration, is option C:4E,10E,15E, but I'm not confident.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Points:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Well**:  
   The energy levels are quantized and given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]  
   Each energy level \( n \) can hold up to two particles due to the spin-1/2 nature of the particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).

2. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   In the ground state, the four particles fill the lowest available energy levels. Since each \( n \) can hold two particles, the configuration is:  
   \[
   n=1 \, (2 \text{ particles}), \, n=2 \, (2 \text{ particles}).
   \]  
   The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2 \cdot E_1 + 2 \cdot E_2 = 2 \cdot (1^2 E) + 2 \cdot (2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

3. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes:  
   \[
   n=1 \, (2 \text{ particles}), \, n=2 \, (1 \text{ particle}), \, n=3 \, (1 \text{ particle}).
   \]  
   The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2 \cdot E_1 + 1 \cdot E_2 + 1 \cdot E_3 = 2 \cdot (1^2 E) + 1 \cdot (2^2 E) + 1 \cdot (3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

4. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), leaving \( n=2 \) empty and \( n=3 \) fully occupied. The configuration becomes:  
   \[
   n=1 \, (2 \text{ particles}), \, n=3 \, (2 \text{ particles}).
   \]  
   The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2 \cdot E_1 + 2 \cdot E_3 = 2 \cdot (1^2 E) + 2 \cdot (3^2 E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E)**:  
  This assumes each \( n \) can hold only one particle, which is incorrect for spin-1/2 fermions. This option does not match the correct configuration.

- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E)**:  
  The ground state energy of \( 4E \) implies all four particles are in \( n=1 \), which is impossible for spin-1/2 fermions since each \( n \) can hold only two particles. This option is incorrect.

- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E)**:  
  The ground state energy of \( 4E \) is incorrect for the same reason as in Option B. This option does not match the correct configuration.

- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**:  
  The ground state energy of \( 10E \) matches the correct configuration. However, the second excited state energy of \( 18E \) does not align with the calculated value of \( 20E \). This option is also incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \( 10E \), \( 15E \), and \( 20E \), respectively. However, none of the provided options match this result. Among the given options, **Option D** is the closest, as it correctly identifies the ground state energy of \( 10E \) and the first excited state energy of \( 15E \), though it incorrectly lists the second excited state as \( 18E \) instead of \( 20E \).

Answer: D
