Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that particles are collided and produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of around 20. On average, one third of these particles reaches the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the walls.

Wait, okay, so the initial setup is that with a Lorentz factor of ~20, only one third of the particles make it to the detector's walls. That probably has to do with their lifetime and how far they travel before decaying. Because if they decay quickly, they might not reach the walls.

Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). At high velocities, gamma increases. But how does that relate to the particles reaching the detector? I think it's about the proper lifetime of the particle versus the dilated lifetime as observed in the lab frame.

So, the particles are moving outward from the center of the detector. The distance they need to travel is the radius, which is 30 meters. If they decay before they reach the wall, they won't be detected. The fraction that makes it depends on how much their lifetime is dilated compared to their proper lifetime.

I remember that when a particle has a proper lifetime τ (the lifetime measured in its rest frame), the observed lifetime in the lab is τ * gamma. So the particles can travel a distance L = v * t, where t is the lab lifetime. So L = v * (gamma * τ).

But wait, in the lab frame, the particles are moving at speed v, so the time they have to travel the 30 meters is t = 30 / v. But that's the same as the time they live before decaying. So for a particle to reach the wall, its lifetime in the lab frame must be at least t = 30 / v.

So the proper lifetime τ is related by τ = t / gamma. Because τ is the proper time, so t = gamma * τ. So τ = t / gamma = (30/(v)) / gamma.

Wait,
