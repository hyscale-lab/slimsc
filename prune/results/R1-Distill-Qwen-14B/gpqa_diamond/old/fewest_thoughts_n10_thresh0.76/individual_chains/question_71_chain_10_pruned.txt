Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the distance from their star and their orbital periods. The question says the planets are in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. And I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula, right? I think it's based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^0.5, where T_star is the star's temperature, R_star is its radius, a is the planet's orbital distance, and A is the albedo. But wait, since all planets have the same albedo, that cancels out. So the ratio of temperatures would depend on the square root of (1/(2a)).

But wait, actually, the formula I recall is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5. So if all have same albedo, the (1-A) term is same for all, so it cancels when taking the ratio. So the T_eq ratio will be sqrt( (R_star/(2a4)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a4 ). Wait, no, because when you take the ratio T4/T2, it's sqrt( (R/(2a4)) / (R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ). So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ). But since I'm looking for T4 over T2, that's the ratio.

Wait, but wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period? Or is it the semi-major axis? Because the period relates to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law, which for circular orbits is T^2 proportional to a^3. So if the periods are in a ratio, I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes.

So the planets' periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 to Planet_5. So Planet_1: P1. Planet_2: P2 = 2 * P1. Planet_4: P
