Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-diene... I think that's a norbornene structure. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound, right? So the structure has two rings: a bicyclo system, and the substituent is an oxygen with a tert-butyl group attached.

Next step: this compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. I remember that when you have a diene and something with bromine, especially with a dienophile, it's probably a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, here the dienophile has two dibromomethyl groups on adjacent carbons.

Wait, the starting material is a diene (norbornene is a diene), and the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that would be a dienophile. But wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is like 1,3-cyclohexadiene. The substituents are on carbons 5 and 6, each with a dibromomethyl group. So each of those substituents is -CH2Br, but wait, noâ€”each is a dibromomethyl. So each substituent is CH2Br2? No, wait, dibromomethyl is CH2Br2? Or is it BrCH2Br? Oh wait, dibromomethyl group would be when each of the two substituents on the methyl is Br. So, the structure is Br2CH-.

Wait, but 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have each of the 5 and 6 positions bearing a -CH2Br2 group? Wait, maybe not, because dibromomethyl would be Br2C-,
