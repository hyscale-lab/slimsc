Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees.

Wait, wait. I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The (hkl) notation refers to the Miller indices, which define the plane.

Rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or wait, no. Rhombohedral is part of the cubic system but with all edges equal and all angles equal but not 90 degrees. Oh right, so it's a special case of the cubic system where the angles are all the same and not right angles.

The formula for interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by the Bragg's law equation related to the crystal structure. The general formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ)) )

Wait, wait, no. I think I might be mixing up the formulas. Oh, right, for a cubic system, the formula is simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. But for cubic with angles not 90, like in rhombohedral, the formula is more complex.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos α) + 2(kl cos α) )

Wait, because in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees in this case.

Also, since the crystal is rhombohedral, the lattice parameter a is the same as the interatomic distance, right? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', the edge length. So here, a is 10 Angstroms.

So the (111) plane: h=1, k=1, l=
