Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my IR and NMR, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are reagents used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So, if Compound X has a ketone group, after the reaction, that ketone would become a methylene (-CH2-) group. Or wait, maybe it's a ketone that's in an aromatic ring substitution? Let me think.

Looking at the IR data first. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region—could that be an O-H stretch? Like from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, the other peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The 1720 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group. So maybe it's a ketone (around 1700 cm-1) or an ester or carboxylic acid. But the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound likely has an aromatic ring with substituents.

Now, the NMR. Let's go through it. The 1H NMR has peaks at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). A singlet around 10 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm and are usually sharp singlets. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton, which is broad around 10-12 ppm. But the IR didn't show a broad peak around 3000 for O-H; wait, the IR shows 3400-2500, which could be O-H, but also possibly an amine or an alcohol.

Wait, the IR has 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. But if the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, that's more like a car
