Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, but there are some statistical probabilities involved. Let me think step by step.

The question says that we have an atom which has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, 32% means that after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed. Wait, that sounds like the concept of half-life, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's using the decay constant.

Wait, another approach: the probability of decay is given for a certain time. So maybe the decay follows an exponential law. The standard formula for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant, t is time. The probability that the atom has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

But wait, the question says that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So, 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. So, e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides, -100λ = ln(0.68). Let me calculate ln(0.68). I remember ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. So, 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, so ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3857. Wait, let me get exact value. Oh wait, I can't compute exactly in my head, but let's say ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3857. So, -100λ = -0.3857 → λ = 0.003857 per minute.

So, the decay constant λ is 0.003857 per minute.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So, now, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, is it 150 minutes from the start, or 150 minutes from now? Oh, the question says, after 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed. Now, what
