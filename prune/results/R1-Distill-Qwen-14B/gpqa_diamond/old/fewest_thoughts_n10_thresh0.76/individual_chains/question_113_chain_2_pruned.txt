Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given for the chemical formula are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The possible answers are A, B, C, D.

Alright, let's break down the data provided.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a broad peak could also be from an -OH stretch. Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups. Like ketones, aldehydes, esters, carboxylic acids, etc. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl, or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation or something like that. Wait, another thought: maybe the 1650 is an amide or something else with a conjugated carbonyl. But in this case, the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not amides.

Wait, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Because aromatic rings (like in benzene) have absorption around 1600-1680 cm^-1. If that's the case, then the 1700 could be a carbonyl group. So putting that together, maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Next, the 1H NMR. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has an alkene group.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what could that be? Let me think. 45 is a common mass, like maybe (CH3)2O (which is 45, but that's for ether).
