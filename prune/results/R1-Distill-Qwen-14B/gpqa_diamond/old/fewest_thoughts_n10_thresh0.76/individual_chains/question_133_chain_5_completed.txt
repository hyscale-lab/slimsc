Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains two different phosphoric acid salts. Hmm, orthophosphate ions are PO4^3-, right? Wait, no, wait. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and when it dissociates, it forms H2PO4^- (that's the dihydrogen phosphate ion), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and finally PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution.

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I should convert to liters because molarity is per liter. So 200 cm³ is 0.2 liters. 

In the solution, there are two substances: 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find out how much each contributes to the phosphate ions. Wait, but since they're salts, they'll dissociate in solution.

KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

On the other hand, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So the two salts provide H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But wait, what about the phosphate ions (PO4^3-)? Hmm. I think the solution is a buffer solution because it's mixing a weak acid and its conjugate base. But wait, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it has multiple dissociation steps.

The problem gives the Ka values for H3PO4 as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. These are the dissociation constants:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. The idea is that in solution, these two will react to form PO4^3- through the third dissociation. But wait, the third dissociation is really weak because Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the concentration of PO4^3- might be really low.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is such that the PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2- in solution. Let me think. Since in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the H2PO4^- is a weak acid (since it can donate another proton), and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base (as it can accept a proton to become H2PO4^-). So the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about PO4^3-, which comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton. So in solution, HPO4^2- can dissociate into H+ and PO4^3-. But the Ka for that is Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low. But I'm not sure if considering other factors is necessary.

Let me outline the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate the molarity of each salt in the solution.
2. Determine if they form a buffer solution.
3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the solution, which can then be used to find the concentration of PO4^3-.
4. Alternatively, maybe there's another approach considering the dissolution of the salts and their dissociation.

Wait, perhaps the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because that's what the two salts provide. So the pH can be found using the pKa2, but does that help me find the PO4^3- concentration?

Wait, maybe I should write out the dissolution equations:

KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-
Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O (but the H2O is just solvent, so maybe the actual ions are Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, in the solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The buffer system would be H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base), with the relevant pKa being pKa2 because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, the question is about PO4^3- concentration. How does that tie in?

PO4^3- is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-. So, in solution, some of the HPO4^2- will dissociate into H+ and PO4^3-.

The concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the third dissociation step, which is governed by Ka3.

But first, I think I need to find the pH of the solution because the concentration of PO4^3- depends on the pH.

So first, let's find the moles of each salt.

Calculating moles:

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is given as 136.09 g/mol. So moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007346 mol.

Similarly, the molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.

So in the solution, [H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03673 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028065 M.

So, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) → pKa2 ≈ 7.209.

Wait, let me calculate that. 6.2e-8 is 6.2 × 10^-8. Taking log: log(6.2) is about 0.792, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.792 -8 = -7.208. So pKa2 is 7.208.

Wait, wait. No, wait. pKa is -log(Ka). So Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is about 7.207.

So pH = 7.207 + log(0.028065 / 0.03673).

Let me calculate the ratio: 0.028065 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) is approximately -0.116.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.116 ≈ 7.091.

So the pH is about 7.09.

Now, knowing the pH, can I find the concentration of PO4^3-?

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, the expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We know [H+] is 10^-pH ≈ 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.25e-8 M.

So, rearranging the equation:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Wait, no. Let me write it again.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M (from earlier)

[H+] is 8.25e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.25e-8

Let me compute the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 ≈ 5.0517e-14.

Then divide by 8.25e-8: 5.0517e-14 / 8.25e-8 ≈ approximately 6.128e-7 M.

So [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.13e-7 M.

Now looking back at the options:

Option A is 6.24e-7 M.

Option D is 3.97e-7 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make any miscalculations?

Let me double-check the calculations.

First, the moles:

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 is approximately 136.1. So 1 / 136.1 ≈ 0.007335 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Molarity in 0.2 L (200 mL):

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

Then, Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log ( [HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-] )

pKa2 is 7.207 (since Ka2 = 6.2e-8, pKa2 ≈ 7.207).

The ratio is 0.028065 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) is approximately -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092.

So [H+] = 10^-7.092 ≈ 8.2e-8 (since 10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-0.09 is about 0.82).

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.092) ≈ 8.2e-8. Yep, correct.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So,

(1.8e-12) * 0.028065 = 5.05e-14.

Divide by 8.2e-8:

5.05e-14 / 8.2e-8 = (5.05 /8.2) * 1e-6.

5.05 / 8.2 ≈ 0.616.

So 0.616e-6 = 6.16e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.16e-7 M. The option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but why is another option close? Did I make a miscalculation?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact calculation without approximations.

Let me recompute the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028065 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03673 M.

Ratio: 0.028065 / 0.03673 = let me compute that exactly.

0.028065 / 0.03673 = (28065 / 36730) ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) = let's compute it more accurately.

Log(0.765) = log(7.65e-1).

Log(7.65) is about 0.884, so log(7.65e-1) is 0.884 -1 = -0.116.

So pH = 7.207 -0.116 =7.091.

[H+] = 10^-7.091 ≈ 8.1e-8 (since 10^(-7.091) = 10^(-7 -0.091) = 1e-7 * 10^-0.091 ≈ 1e-7 * 0.825 = 8.25e-8.

So [H+] =8.25e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+].

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So,

(1.8e-12) * 0.028065 = ?

1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517.

So 0.050517e-12 = 5.0517e-14.

Divide by 8.25e-8:

5.0517e-14 /8.25e-8 = (5.0517 /8.25) * 1e-6.

5.0517 /8.25 ≈ 0.612.

So 0.612e-6 = 6.12e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.12e-7 M. The closest option is A: 6.24e-7 M. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should carry more decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in assuming that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M and [H2PO4^-] is 0.03673 M, but perhaps the dissociation of the salts is more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is more complex because the phosphate exists in solution in all forms (H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-), but in this case, the majority is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the pH is near 7. So perhaps the assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M is correct.

Wait, another thought: the salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. They completely dissociate, so the concentrations are as calculated. Then, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions are present, and they can interconvert via the second dissociation (H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-), which affects the pH. But the third dissociation (HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-) is what contributes to the PO4^3- concentration, and that's dependent on the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using the equilibrium expressions for all species, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by that buffer. Then, using that pH, find the concentration of PO4^3- via the third dissociation.

But that's exactly what I did earlier, and the result was approximately 6.12e-7 M. The options are A:6.24e-7, D: 3.97e-7. Hmm, 6.12 is closer to 6.24 than to 3.97.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ratio or the pH.

Let me recalculate the ratio more accurately.

[HPO4^2-] = 1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O / 177.99 g/mol = 1/177.99 ≈ 0.005613 mol. 

In 0.2 L, that's 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 1.00 g KH2PO4 / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007346 mol. In 0.2 L, 0.03673 M.

The ratio is 0.028065 / 0.03673 = approximately 0.765.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

0.028065 ÷ 0.03673 = ?

Let me compute it precisely:

0.028065 ÷ 0.03673 ≈ 0.765.

Wait, 0.028065 ÷0.03673 = (28065) / (36730) ≈ 0.765.

So pH = pKa2 + log(0.765) = 7.207 + log(0.765). 

Calculating log(0.765):

log(0.765) = ln(0.765)/ln(10) ≈ (-0.268)/(2.3026) ≈ -0.116.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.116 =7.091.

So [H+] = 10^-7.091 ≈ 8.19e-8 M.

Then, using [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 =1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-]=0.028065 M, [H+]=8.19e-8.

So,

(1.8e-12) * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Divide by 8.19e-8: 5.0517e-14 /8.19e-8 ≈ 6.17e-7 M.

Hmm, about 6.17e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7).

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Let me compute (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) first.

1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517.

Multiply by 1e-12: 5.0517e-14.

Now, divide by 8.19e-8:

5.0517e-14 / 8.19e-8 = 5.0517/(8.19) * 1e-6.

5.0517 /8.19 ≈ 0.617.

So 0.617e-6 = 6.17e-7 M.

So about 6.17e-7 M, which is closest to option A:6.24e-7. The slight difference could be due to more precise calculations or rounding during intermediate steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the solution must account for the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-.

Wait, another thought: the HPO4^2- can act as a base and accept a proton from water to form H2PO4^-.

But in the buffer solution, the pH is determined by the ratio of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, but wait, in this buffer, H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So the pH is controlled by the second dissociation, pKa2. Hence, the concentration of PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation, which is a small fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the third dissociation more carefully, taking into account that HPO4^2- can lose a proton to form PO4^3-.

In that case, the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

But [HPO4^2-] is the concentration minus any that dissociates to form PO4^3-, but since Ka3 is so small, the change would be negligible. So, we can approximate [HPO4^2-] as the initial concentration.

Thus, [PO4^3-] ≈ (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Which is what I did earlier.

So, I think the calculation is correct.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A, 6.24e-7 M.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately without approximations.

Let me compute [PO4^3-] more accurately.

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] =0.028065 M.

[H+] = 8.19e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.19e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517.

So 0.050517e-12 = 5.0517e-14.

Divide by 8.19e-8:

5.0517e-14 / 8.19e-8 = (5.0517 /8.19 ) * 1e-6.

5.0517 /8.19 = let me compute this exactly.

8.19 * 0.616 = 5.052 (because 8 *0.616=4.928, 0.19 *0.616=0.117, total 5.045, which is close to 5.0517).

So 5.0517 /8.19 ≈ 0.616.

So 0.616e-6 =6.16e-7 M.

So about 6.16e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. So I think option A is the correct answer.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use equilibrium expressions.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007346 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Molarity in 200 mL (\( 0.2 \, \text{L} \)):  
  \[ [\text{H₂PO₄}^-] = \frac{0.007346}{0.2} \approx 0.03673 \, \text{M} \]

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Molarity in 200 mL (\( 0.2 \, \text{L} \)):  
  \[ [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}] = \frac{0.005613}{0.2} \approx 0.028065 \, \text{M} \]

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the solution
The solution is a buffer between \( \text{H₂PO₄}^- \) (acid) and \( \text{HPO₄}^{2-} \) (base), with the relevant dissociation constant \( K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_{a2} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]} \right)
\]
- \( \text{p}K_{a2} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207 \)  
- Ratio:  
  \[
  \frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]} = \frac{0.028065}{0.03673} \approx 0.765
  \]
- \( \log(0.765) \approx -0.116 \)  
- \( \text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.116 \approx 7.091 \)

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻]
The concentration of \( \text{PO₄}^{3-} \) arises from the dissociation of \( \text{HPO₄}^{2-} \):  
\[
\text{HPO₄}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{PO₄}^{3-}
\]
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_{a3} = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). Using the expression:  
\[
K_{a3} = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄}^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}
\]
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO₄}^{3-}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{K_{a3} \cdot [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]
- \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.091} \approx 8.19 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \)  
- Substituting values:  
  \[
  [\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.028065)}{8.19 \times 10^{-8}} \approx \frac{5.0517 \times 10^{-14}}{8.19 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.17 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated concentration of \( \text{PO₄}^{3-} \) is approximately \( 6.17 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option **A** (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).

ANSWER: A
