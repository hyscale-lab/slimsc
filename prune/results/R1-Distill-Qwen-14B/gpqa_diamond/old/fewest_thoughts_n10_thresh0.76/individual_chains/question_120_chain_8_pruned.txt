Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they are spread out evenly in all directions without any particular pattern. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are all different power laws, like 1 over plx to some exponent.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d, which means as plx decreases, distance increases. So a star with a larger plx is closer, and a smaller plx is farther away.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So I think it's about how the density of stars changes with parallax. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, they should be equally likely in all directions, but as you go farther away, the volume of space increases, which could affect how many stars you see in a given range.

Wait, let me think about the volume. The number of stars in a spherical shell depends on the volume of the shell. The volume of a spherical shell between distance d and d + dd is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume, which is 4πd² dd. But since stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant. So number of stars in shell is (number per volume) * volume = 4πd² dd * n, where n is number density.

But the question is in terms of parallax. Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me express d in terms of plx. So d = 1 / plx, and dd would be -1/(plx^2) d plx, but wait, since plx is decreasing as d increases, maybe I should think in terms of plx.

So the volume element in terms of plx would be the volume between plx and plx + dplx. Since d = 1/plx, the volume between plx and plx + dplx is 4π (1/plx)^2 (d plx) )

Wait, no, I think I might have messed up the substitution. Let me think again. The volume element in terms of d is 4πd² dd. Since d =
