Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says, we have an atom that we're monitoring. From previous experiments, we know it has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, we're asked, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Hmm, wait. So, the setup is that we have a single atom, and we're observing its decay. Oh, right, radioactive decay is a random process, right? So each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and this is modeled by the decay law.

I remember that the decay probability is often modeled using the exponential decay formula. The probability that a nucleus hasn't decayed by time t is given by N(t)/N0 = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. Or wait, maybe it's P = 1 - e^(-λt) for the probability of decay by time t.

Wait, the problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, P(100) = 0.32. So using that, we can find λ.

So first, we can find the decay constant λ. Let me see. 

We have P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). So for t=100, P=0.32. 

So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). 

Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Take the natural logarithm of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). 

So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100.

Calculating that: ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but let me think, 0.68 is about e^-0.415, actually. Let me compute ln(0.68). 

Wait, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.4005. So λ ≈ 0.4005 / 100 ≈ 0.004005 per minute.

Wait, no, wait. Because ln(0.68) is negative, so -ln(0.68) would be positive. So yes, λ is positive. So λ ≈ 0.004005 per minute.

Okay, now the current situation is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So, what is the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, so from the start, 50 minutes have passed, so we're now at t=50. The next 150 minutes would take us to t=200. So the total time from the start would be 200 minutes.

But wait, no. The way the problem is phrased: "the next 1
