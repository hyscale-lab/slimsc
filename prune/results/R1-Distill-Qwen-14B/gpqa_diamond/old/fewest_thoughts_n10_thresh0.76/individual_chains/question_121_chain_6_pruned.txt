Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about reacting a cyclic epoxide with an organocuprate. Hmm, I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically attack epoxides in a specific way. Let me think through this step by step.

The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize the structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane... So that's like a norbornane structure, right? Norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, but this is [4.1.0], which I think is a different arrangement. So the numbering is 1,3,4-trimethyl, and there's an oxygen at position 7, which is the epoxide oxygen. So, the structure has an epoxide ring, meaning two adjacent carbons connected by an oxygen.

The reaction is with Me2CuLi, which is an organocuprate, a strong nucleophile. The question says that the alkyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Oh right, because the Cu reagent tends to attack the less substituted carbon in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Also, for disubstituted epoxides, the attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile adds.

Wait, let me clarify that. So in a disubstituted epoxide, when the nucleophile attacks, the configuration at that carbon flips. But what about the other carbon? I think the other carbon's configuration depends on whether the attack is from the same side or opposite side. Wait, maybe it's more about the mechanism. I remember that epoxide ring-opening with nucleophiles can proceed via a two-step mechanism where the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon, and then the ring opens. The stereochemistry can lead to either retention or inversion.

Wait, in the case of organocuprates, I think the attack is more like a conjugate addition. Oh no, wait, maybe it's a typical SN2 mechanism for the ring-opening. Organocuprates typically perform 1,2-addition to epoxides, right? So they open the epoxide by attacking the less hindered carbon in an SN2 fashion. So the nucleophile (the methyl group from Me2CuLi) adds to the less substituted carbon, and the leaving group (the oxide) departs from the more substituted carbon.

In the epoxide, the two carbons are each attached to two substituents. Since this is a disubstituted epoxide, each carbon has two other substituents besides the oxide. So the more substituted carbon is more hindered, and the nucleophile attacks the less hindered one.

So first, I need to determine which carbon is more substituted and which is less. Looking at the structure, the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has a bridge structure. Let me try to imagine or sketch it. So, the 1,3,4 positions are all methyl groups. Wait, the structure is 1,3,4-trimethyl. So the bicyclo system has
