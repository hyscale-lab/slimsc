Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. So, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue.

Alright, let me start by recalling what I know about uncertainty principles and operators. The uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the variance. Variance is ⟨ψ|A²|ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩², where A is the operator. So for ΔP_z, it's sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, but wait a second. If the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, then it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. Because P_x and P_z are different observables, they might not commute. So measuring P_z when the system is in a P_x eigenstate will give a probabilistic result. That's why the uncertainty comes into play.

So first, I need to find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for the given state.

The given state is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me note that down. And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, but the basis vectors are those of P_z. So the given state is written in the P_z basis. Oh wait, wait, the problem says: "The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z." So the state |ψ> is expressed in the P_z basis.

So, the state is in the P_z eigenbasis. So when you have |ψ> in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value of P_z is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, weighted by the probabilities of each state.

Wait, but in this case, the state is not an eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, no, wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x. Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. But the basis vectors are the eigenstates of P_z. So the state is written as a linear combination of different P_z eigenstates. So, to find the expectation value of P_z, I can calculate it as the inner product of the state with the P_z operator acting on the state, or perhaps using matrix multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation values directly using the given state vector and the matrix for P_z.

Let me think about the approach step by step.

First, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z. Since the state is represented as a column vector, I can compute this as the conjugate transpose of the state multiplied by the P_z matrix multiplied by the state.

But wait, the state is given as a real vector, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let me write that down.

The state vector ψ is:

|ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T

So, the conjugate transpose ⟨ψ| is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

The P_z matrix is given as:

[ [ ħ , 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, -ħ ] ]

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I do ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

Let me compute this.

First, compute P_z |ψ>:

P_z |ψ> = [ ħ*(-1/2), 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1/2), -ħ*(-1/2) ]^T ?

Wait no, wait, matrix multiplication.

Each component of the resulting vector is the sum of the corresponding row of P_z multiplied by the components of |ψ>.

So first component:

(ħ)*(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1/2) = (-ħ/2)

Second component:

0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1/2) = 0

Third component:

0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (-ħ)*(-1/2) = ħ/2

So P_z |ψ> = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ is the dot product of ⟨ψ| and P_z|ψ>.

So, that's (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2).

Calculating each term:

First term: ( (-1/2) * (-ħ/2) ) = ħ/4

Second term: 0

Third term: ( (-1/2) * (ħ/2) ) = -ħ/4

Adding them up: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero.

Next, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩, which is ⟨ψ| P_z^2 |ψ⟩.

But since P_z is diagonal, its square is just each diagonal element squared. So P_z² is:

[ [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ] ]

Which simplifies to:

[ [ ħ², 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, ħ² ] ]

So when I compute P_z^2 |ψ>, it's the same as multiplying each component by the corresponding diagonal element squared.

So, applying P_z^2 to |ψ>:

First component: ħ² * (-1/2) = -ħ²/2

Second component: 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0

Third component: ħ² * (-1/2) = -ħ²/2

So P_z^2 |ψ> = [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T.

Now, compute ⟨ψ| P_z^2 |ψ⟩ which is the dot product of ⟨ψ| and P_z^2 |ψ>.

So:

( -1/2 )*(-ħ²/2) + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2 )

Let me compute each term:

First term: ( -1/2 ) * (-ħ²/2 ) = (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ² /4

Second term: 0

Third term: (-1/2) * (-ħ²/2 ) = (1/2)(ħ²/2 ) = ħ²/4

Adding them together: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Now, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 = (ħ²/2) - 0 = ħ²/2.

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

But wait, wait. The options are given, let me check the options. Option B is ħ/√2. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Let me recheck the computation of ⟨P_z⟩. The state is [a, b, c] = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]

P_z is diagonal, so when you compute ⟨P_z⟩, it's a * (ħ a) + b * (0 b) + c * (-ħ c). Wait, wait, no.

Wait, no. Wait, another approach: since the basis is P_z's eigenbasis, so the components of |ψ> are the coefficients of each P_z eigenstate. So the expectation value of P_z is the sum of |c_i|^2 * λ_i, where λ_i are the eigenvalues.

So for each component i, |c_i|^2 is |ψ_i|^2, multiplied by the eigenvalue of that state.

Looking at the state, the components are:

c1 = -1/2, so |c1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The corresponding eigenvalue is ħ.

c2 = 1/sqrt(2), so |c2|^2 = 1/2. The eigenvalue for this state is 0.

c3 = -1/2, so |c3|^2 = 1/4. The eigenvalue is -ħ.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) * ħ = 0. So that's correct.

Similarly, ⟨P_z^2⟩ is the sum of |c_i|^2 * (λ_i)^2.

So, for each term:

(1/4) * (ħ)^2 + (1/2)*0^2 + (1/4)*(-ħ)^2.

Which is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So variance is ½ ħ². So sqrt(½ ħ²) is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Looks like I did everything correctly. So the answer is B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ can be computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the state components) and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. From the state:

- $|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $\lambda_1 = \hbar$,
- $|c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, $\lambda_2 = 0$,
- $|c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $\lambda_3 = -\hbar$.

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \lambda_i^2.
\]

From the state and eigenvalues:

- $|c_1|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $\lambda_1^2 = \hbar^2$,
- $|c_2|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, $\lambda_2^2 = 0$,
- $|c_3|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $\lambda_3^2 = \hbar^2$.

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\text{Variance} = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Answer: B
