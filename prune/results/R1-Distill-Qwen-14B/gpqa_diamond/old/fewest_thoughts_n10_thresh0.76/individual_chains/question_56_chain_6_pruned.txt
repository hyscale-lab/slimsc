Okay, let's try to tackle this H-atom transition problem. Hmm, so the question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in atomic physics, transitions between energy levels are governed by selection rules.

Wait, the selection rules for dipole transitions... I think for the hydrogen atom, the allowed transitions are when certain quantum numbers change by specific amounts. Oh right, the standard selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, the transition can only occur if the initial and final states have opposite parity, or something like that?

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. It needs to decay via two dipole transitions to |1,0,0⟩. So two steps. Let me think about possible intermediate states.

In each step, the angular momentum l can change by ±1. Starting from l=0 in the first state, so the first transition would have to go to l=1. Because from 0, you can only go to 1. So the first step would be |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1, m⟩ or something else?

Wait wait, because the principal quantum number n changes when an electron emits a photon, right? So each dipole transition (which is a photon emission or absorption) changes n by 1 (n decreases by 1 for emission, increases for absorption, but in decay, it's emission, so n goes down). So from n=3, the next possible n after a dipole transition would be n=2.

So the first transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to a state with n=2 and l=1 (since from l=0, it can only go to l=1). What about m? The m can change by 0, ±1. So m goes from 0 to 0, +1, or -1.

So possible intermediates are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩. Now, from that intermediate, we need to go to n=1, l=0, m=0.

So let's see each possibility:

1. If intermediate is |2,1,0⟩. Then, from l=1, can go to l=0 or l=2. But we need to reach l=0. So that's possible. Now, for the m change: from m=0 to m=0 again (could also go to 1 or -1, but the final state is m=0). So, for the second transition, m can change by 0, ±1.

So from |2,1,0⟩, the next transition can be to |1,0,0⟩, because l goes from 1 to 0 (Δl = -1; allowed), and m goes from 0 to 0 (Δm=0; allowed). So this is a possible path: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0.

But wait, what about the probabilities? The options give different fractions
