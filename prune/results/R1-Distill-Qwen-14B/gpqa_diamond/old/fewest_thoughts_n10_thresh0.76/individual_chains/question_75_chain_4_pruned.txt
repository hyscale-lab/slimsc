Okay, I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the Chinese hamster ovary cells. Let's start by looking at the provided DNA sequence and see what's going on.

The construct has the coding sequence for GADD45G, but they added a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. HA tags are usually short peptide sequences, often added to the beginning of a protein to help with purification using antibodies against HA.

Looking at the DNA sequence, I notice that it starts with 5' ATG... which is the start codon, methionine. So the HA tag should be right after that. The HA tag is typically something like YPYDVPDYA, but I don't see that in the DNA. Wait, perhaps the HA tag is just a short peptide, maybe just a few amino acids. Like, sometimes it's just a few residues.

Wait, maybe the issue is a stop codon in the sequence. Let me look for any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). Scanning through the sequence:

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA in triplets.

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCC CGG ACC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A... 

Wait, at the very beginning: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC ...

So the start codon is ATG (position 1-3). Next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), CCA (proline), GAT (aspartic acid), TAC (tyrosine), GCC (alanine), AAA (lysine), TGA (stop codon). Oh! So the first few codons after ATG are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA. 

Wait, that's a problem. Because the TGA is a stop codon. So the ribosome would read from ATG, then the next codons, and when it hits TGA, it would terminate translation.

So looking at the sequence, the HA tag wasn't properly added, but the problem is that the original construct has a stop codon right after the start. Let me think about this.

In the sequence, the coding strand starts with ATG, then TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAT, TAC, GCC, AAA, TGA. So the 12th codon is TGA (positions 28-30). So the protein would be terminated right there, meaning it's a very short peptide. So why? Because the HA tag wasn't added correctly, or perhaps the HA tag sequence introduced a stop codon.

Wait, the question says that they introduced the HA sequence at the N-terminus. So the construct was supposed to be HA followed by GADD45G. So perhaps the HA tag was not added correctly, but more likely, the DNA sequence as provided includes a stop codon after the HA tag.

Wait, but looking at the DNA, after the ATG (start), the next codon is TAC (tyr), then CCA (pro), TAC (tyr), GAT (asp), GTT (val), CCA (pro), GAT (asp), TAC (tyr), GCC (ala), AAA (lys), TGA (stop). So that's the first 12 codons, but the HA tag is supposed to be before or at the start. So if the HA tag is at the N-terminus, perhaps the correct sequence should start with the HA tag, then GADD45G.

If the HA tag is part of the construct, but the DNA has a stop codon after, then the protein would be truncated. So perhaps the HA tag was not correctly inserted, leading to the stop codon.

Wait, but in the provided sequence, let's look again. The sequence is the plus strand, which is the coding strand. So the ATG is correct, but the next codons are TAC, etc. So the first few amino acids would be Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Val, Pro, Asp, Tyr, Ala, Lys, then stop.

But wait, the HA tag is a short peptide. Let me recall the HA tag sequence. The HA tag is derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. The common HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which is 10 amino acids. So the DNA would encode that as the first 30 nucleotides after the start codon.

But in their sequence, the first codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), etc. So TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA. Let me translate that:

TAC → Y

CCA → P

TAC → Y

GAT → D

GTT → V

CCA → P

GAT → D

TAC → Y

GCC → A

AAA → K

TGA → stop.

So that's the HA tag? Wait, YPYDVPDYA is Y (TAC), P (CCA), Y (TAC), D (GAT), V (GTT), P (CCA), D (GAT), Y (TAC),
