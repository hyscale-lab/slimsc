Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read the question again carefully. So, the molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me break down the information given.

The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. So, these three groups are each separated by one carbon—meaning each is in the 1,3,5 positions relative to each other. Wait, no, meta means each is two positions apart. So if one is in position 1, the next would be 3, and so on. Hmm, but since all three are meta, maybe they form a sort of triangle around the ring.

Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So, the carboxylic acid is in a certain position, and the OH and NMe2 are attached to the adjacent positions. Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. So, if the carboxylic acid is in position 2, the methoxy would be in position 6, but wait, maybe I should think about the numbering.

Wait, perhaps I should start by drawing the benzene ring and placing the substituents accordingly. Let's imagine the benzene ring. Let's choose a starting point for numbering. The carboxylic acid is a functional group, so it will get the lowest possible number. Benzoic acid derivatives usually have the COOH group as position 1.

Wait, but wait. The IUPAC nomenclature for benzoic acid derivatives: the substituents are numbered starting from the COOH group as position 1, and then the rest are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. So, for example, the substituents are arranged such that their positions are as low as possible.

So, let's suppose the COOH is in position 1. Then, the other groups—cyano (CN), aldehyde (CHO), and others—will be placed around.

Wait, the question says the three groups (COOH, CHO, CN) are all meta to each other. So if COOH is at position 1, then the next meta position would be 3, and then 5. So
