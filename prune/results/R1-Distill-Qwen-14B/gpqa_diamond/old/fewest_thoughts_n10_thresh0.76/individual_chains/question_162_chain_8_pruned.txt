Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm. Let me think. I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime, and pseudosphere is a type of soliton solution in certain theories, like in string theory or maybe some higher-dimensional theories. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, the denominator looks like 4 - x² - y². So the term simplifies to 32/(4 - r²) where r² is x² + y². Because I can write r² = x² + y², so the denominator becomes 4 - r².

I'm trying to remember how to calculate the area of a surface in such a metric. Oh right, the area element in two dimensions is usually sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since this is a 2D metric (because the line element is in terms of dx and dy only), the area would be the integral of the square root of the determinant times dx dy.

Wait, but in this case, the metric is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². Since both are the same (because the metric is written as (dx² + dy²) multiplied by 32/(4 - r²)), the determinant g would be [32/(4 - r²)]².

Wait, no. Wait, because for a diagonal metric, the determinant is (g_xx)(g_yy). Here, g_xx = 32/(4 - r²), and same for g_yy. So the determinant g is [32/(4 - r²)]². But wait, when computing the area element, it's sqrt(g) dxdy. So sqrt of [32/(4 - r²)]² is 32/(4 - r²).

So the area element becomes (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

But wait, to find the total area, I should change to polar coordinates because the expression is symmetric in x and y. So in polar coordinates, r² = x² + y², dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So the area element becomes 32/(4 - r²) * r dr dθ.

So the area
