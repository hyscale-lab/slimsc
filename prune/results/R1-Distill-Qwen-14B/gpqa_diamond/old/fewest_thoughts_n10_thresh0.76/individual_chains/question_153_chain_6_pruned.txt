Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. It's about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember is a nucleophilic addition to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Hmm, right, the Michael donor is the nucleophile that attacks the β-carbon.

The question has three parts (A, B, C) and four options (A, B, C, D). Each part involves a Michael addition reaction, and I need to determine the products for each. Then, match them with the options provided.

Let me take each reaction one by one.

First Reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH → A

I think dimethyl malonate is the Michael donor here. Wait, no, wait. Dimethyl malonate is a diethyl ester of malonic acid. Its structure is CH2(COOEt)2. So, the enolate would form from it. Wait, but in the Michael reaction, the Michael donor is the enolate, right? Or is it the nucleophile attacking the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl?

Wait, the reaction is a Michael addition, which is the conjugate addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl is the Michael acceptor. So, in this case, the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be the acceptor. The donor would be the enolate of dimethyl malonate.

Wait, but how does the enolate form? Dimethyl malonate is a good donor because it's a good electron donor. So, in the presence of a base like NaOEt (sodium ethoxide), it would deprotonate to form an enolate.

So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the β position of the acrylate. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure: the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So, it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Or wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think: the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, the 3-position would have the p-tolyl group. So, it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but the substituent is at the third carbon. Wait, that doesn't make sense because acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. If substituents are on the third carbon, that would be the carbonyl position. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3 with the substituent at position 3? No, that can't be right. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Oh, wait, no, the carbonyl is at position 2. So, I think the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Because the substituent is on the double bond's β position. So, the α and β would be the two carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. So, in this case, the accept
