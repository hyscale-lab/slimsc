Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, paramagnetic coupling... I think that's related to the Zeeman effect or something like that. 

First, let me read the problem again. The magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. They're asking to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (H) due to this magnetic field with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are whether ⟨H⟩ is much greater than, much less than, equal to, or just greater than ΔE.

Wait, the wavelength given is 0.4861 μm. That sounds familiar. Oh right, that's the wavelength of the Balmer-alpha line, which corresponds to a transition in hydrogen from n=2 to n=1. So the energy ΔE would be the energy difference between those two levels. 

I remember that the energy levels of hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant R is about 13.6 eV, but wait, actually, the energy levels are E_n = -Ry / n², where Ry is approximately 13.6 eV. So for n=2, E is -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV, and for n=1, it's -13.6 eV. The transition energy ΔE is the difference between these, which is 10.2 eV. But wait, I should double-check the exact value. Oh, wait, the problem says the transition energy is ΔE, which is the energy between the states, so yeah, 10.2 eV is correct.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. That's the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. The paramagnetic term usually refers to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and the external field. The Hamiltonian H is given by H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. 

The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m, where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, wait, no. Oh right, the orbital magnetic moment is μ = (μ_B) * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. The Bohr magneton is approximately 9.274×10^-24 J/T. 

So the Hamiltonian H = -μ·B. Since the field is along Oz, the z-component is all that matters. So H = -μ_z * B. Which is H = -μ_B * m * B. 

Wait, but sometimes I've seen H written as μ·B, with a positive sign. Oh, right, the magnetic dipole energy is H = -μ·B, so the energy is negative when μ is aligned with B. But since we're looking for the magnitude of the term, the sign won't matter for the comparison
