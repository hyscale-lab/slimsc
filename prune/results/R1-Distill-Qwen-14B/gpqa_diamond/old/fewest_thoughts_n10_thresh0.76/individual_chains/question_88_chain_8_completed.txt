Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and the immune response, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see... The question involves tagging inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice. Then, they observe some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus. They isolated the fluorescent Peyer patches and looked at the variable heavy chain genes, which showed high variability. The question is asking which process is happening.

Hmm, first, I need to remember what each part does. Rotavirus is a virus that infects the gastrointestinal tract, right? The inner capsid proteins are probably part of the viral structure that the immune system would target. So when they tag these with GFP, they can track them in the body.

When they deliver them via oral gavage, that means the mice are ingesting it, so it's going into their digestive system. The stomach has acid, which can break down proteins. So some of the GFP-tagged proteins are destroyed there. But some make it through and get into the intestines. The intestinal mucus is a barrier, so some get stuck there before reaching secondary lymphoid organs.

Secondary lymphoid organs include places like the Peyer's patches, which are located in the small intestine. These patches are sites where immune cells, like B cells, can encounter antigens. So when they isolate the Peyer patches and look at the proliferating cells, these are probably B cells that have been activated by the rotavirus antigen.

Now, when they sequence the variable heavy chain genes of these cells and find high variability, that rings a bell about immune processes. I remember that B cells undergo a process where their antibody diversity is increased. The variable regions of the heavy chains are crucial for this diversity.

So, the possible processes are listed in the options. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Somatic hypermutation. I think this happens in B cells after they've been activated. It's a process where mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the B cell receptor (BCR) genes, increasing the diversity of the antibodies produced. This happens during the maturation of B cells in germinal centers.

Option B: Complement activation. The complement system is a part of the immune response that helps clear pathogens. It's more about marking pathogens for destruction by opsonization or causing lysis but doesn't directly relate to the variability of the variable regions.

Option C: Class switching recombination. This is when the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) changes. It involves recombination at the heavy chain locus but doesn't increase the variability of the variable regions themselves.

Option D: VDJ recombination. This is the process during B cell development in the bone marrow where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are combined to form the variable region of the heavy chain. This happens during the early stages and leads to initial diversity among B cells.

Wait, but in this scenario, the variable heavy chains show high variability after immunization. So if the B cells have already been activated and are proliferating, this suggests that they're undergoing some form of diversification after antigen recognition.

VDJ recombination happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow, which is early on. If the mice were just given the antigen, the B cells would have already undergone this process and perhaps are now being activated.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs after the B cells have been activated and are present in the germinal centers. This process introduces point mutations into the variable regions, leading to more diverse antibodies. So, the high variability observed in the variable heavy chains would be due to this process.

So the answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The question involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins reach the Peyer patches, where proliferating cells are isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability. The key is to identify the immune process responsible for this variability.

1. **Understanding the Setup**: Rotavirus capsid proteins are tagged with GFP and introduced into mice. Some proteins are destroyed by stomach acid, while others reach the Peyer patches, where B cells encounter antigens and proliferate. High variability in the variable heavy chain genes of these cells is observed.

2. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers, introducing mutations into the variable regions of the BCR genes to increase antibody diversity. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chains.
   - **B) Complement activation**: This involves marking pathogens for destruction but does not directly affect the variability of the variable regions.
   - **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variability of the variable regions.
   - **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, combining V, D, and J gene segments to form the variable region. However, this process occurs before antigen exposure and does not explain the observed variability after immunization.

3. **Conclusion**: The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs after antigen recognition in activated B cells, leading to increased diversity in the immune response.
