Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out. 

The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, I think the mass might not be directly relevant here because the question is about elemental abundances, which are determined by other factors like nucleosynthesis and mixing. So maybe the mass is just extra info.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Then there are [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh right, the [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. 

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So, let's parse that. 

For the Sun: 

nFe/nH = 10^( (7.5 -12) ) = 10^(-4.5). Wait, wait, let me think. The formula is 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals some number. So, for Fe, it's 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg: log10(nMg/nH) =7 -12= -5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5).

Now, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So we need [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2] or maybe [Si]_1/[Si]_2. Wait, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms, which is n_Si1 / n_Si2.

But wait, the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Wait, no, the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2? Or Star_2 to Star_1? The wording is a bit ambiguous. The question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that would be (n_Si1 / n_Si2). Or perhaps, wait, maybe the ratio is (n_Si in Star_1) / (n_Si in Star_2)
