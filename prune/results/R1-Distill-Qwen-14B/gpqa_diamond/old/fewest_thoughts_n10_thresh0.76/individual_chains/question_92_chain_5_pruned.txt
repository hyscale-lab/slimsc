Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. I remember that the formula involves the bond energies of the reactants and products. Oh wait, yes, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies of the bonds broken and formed.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a bit complex. I should probably count the number of each type of bond in this molecule. Let me visualize the structure. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds, maybe? Let me see. 

Wait, the formula seems to have multiple CH2 groups and branches. Let me try to count all the bonds. But maybe an easier approach is to figure out the number of each type of bond in the molecule and then calculate the total bond energy.

The elements involved are carbon and hydrogen. So, all the bonds are either C-C, C=C, C-H, or H-H. Wait, but H-H bonds are probably only in the reactant side if hydrogen is being added, but in the molecule itself, I don't think any H-H bonds are present because all the hydrogens are attached to carbon. So maybe only C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds are relevant.

Wait, the problem provides the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, the ent
