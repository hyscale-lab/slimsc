Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, so the setup is an atomic nucleus at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, which means the total momentum after fission should still be zero because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. That makes sense.

Let me get the masses sorted out first. Let's say the less massive fragment has a rest mass m, so the more massive one has 2m. The sum is 3m, and that's 99% of the initial mass. The initial mass is M, so 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99/3) M, and 2m = 0.66 M. Wait, but the initial mass is 300 GeV in terms of rest mass energy. Oh wait, the rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV, so M is the rest mass, and M c² is 300 GeV. Hmm, but in units where c=1, maybe? So perhaps M is 300 GeV/c².

Wait, but when you split into two fragments, the sum of their rest masses is 0.99M. So the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. The fragments' rest mass energies will sum to 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So maybe the rest mass energies are 297 GeV in total.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. So initial M is 300 GeV/c²? Because rest mass energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV/(c²). Then the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M. So 0.99 * 300 GeV/c² = 297 GeV/c². So the two fragments sum to 297 GeV/c², and M is 300 GeV/c². So the mass lost is 3 GeV/c², which would go into the kinetic energy or other forms like binding energy or something else. But since the problem says "nothing else," I think the rest goes into kinetic energy.

So, the two fragments: one has a rest mass of 2m, the other m. Sum is 3m = 0.99 M. So m = 0.99 M / 3 = 0.33 M. Which makes the more massive fragment 2m = 0.66 M, and the lighter one 0.33 M.

Wait, but M is 300 GeV/c². So the more massive fragment is 2m = 0.66 * 300 GeV/c² = 198 GeV/c². The lighter one is 99 GeV/c². So together, 297 GeV/c², which is correct.

Now, since the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after fission is zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's denote their velocities as v1 and v2. But since momentum is mass times velocity (in the non-relativistic case), but relativistically, it's gamma m v
