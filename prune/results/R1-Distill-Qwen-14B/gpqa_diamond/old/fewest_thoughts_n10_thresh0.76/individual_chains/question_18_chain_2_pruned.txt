Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I don't think the mass matters here because the question is about elemental abundances. Oh wait, maybe it's just extra info.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh, and the Sun's photosphere has [Fe/H] at 7.5 and [Mg/H] at 7 when using 12 + log(nX/H) for each element X.

Wait, what do these brackets mean again? Oh right, [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_Sun. Alternatively, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY / (nX_sun /nY_sun)) ) = log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ). Or another way, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun).

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means (nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun = 10^0.3. So (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun * 10^0 = same as the Sun's. So Star_1 has the same iron abundance as the Sun relative to hydrogen.

Now, the Sun's [Fe/H
