Alright, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Hmm, okay, let's see. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons, so I think that makes it Li-6? Because Li typically has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would give it an atomic mass number of 6, right?

So I need to calculate the energy of this nucleus. I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by its rest mass energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, I should make sure about the units and what's given.

First, let me figure out the mass of the nucleus. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 GeV/c², and a neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². So the total mass of Li-6 would be (3 * 1.007276) + (3 * 1.008665) GeV/c².

Let me calculate that. 3 * 1.007276 is about 3.021828, and 3 * 1.008665 is approximately 3.025995. Adding them together gives 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 GeV/c². So m0 is about 6.0478 GeV/c².

Next, I need to find gamma. The speed v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96c)². The gamma formula is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let's compute the denominator first.

v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Then sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right. But wait, 0.28 * 0.28 is indeed 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, yes. So gamma is 1/0.28, which equals approximately 3.5714.

So now, the energy E is gamma times m0c². But wait, m0 is already in GeV/c², so when multiplied by c², the c² would cancel out the denominator. So E = gamma * m0.

So plugging in the numbers: E = 3.57142857 * 6.0478 GeV. Let me compute that.

3.57142857 * 6 = 21.4285714 GeV. But wait, I should be more precise. Let's calculate 3.57142857 *6.0478.

Breaking it down:

6.0478 *3.57142857:

Let me approximate this. 

6 *3.57142857 =21.4285714
0.0478 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.1708.

So adding them together: 21.4285714 + 0.1708 ≈21.59937.

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute that more accurately. Maybe I should use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *6.0478.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *6.0478:

First, 3 *6.0478 =18.1434.

0.57142857 is about 4/7, so 6.0478 * 4/7 ≈ (6.0478 *4)=24.1912; divided by 7 is approximately 3.4559.

So 18.1434 +3.4559 ≈21.5993.

Hmm, so around 21.6 GeV.

Wait, but let's think again. The options given are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419

So my calculation got around 21.6, which is higher than option D (21.419). Did I make a mistake in the gamma calculation?

Wait, let me recheck gamma. v =0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2=0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 =0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the mass calculation. Let me check the mass of Li-6 again.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So 3*(mass of proton) + 3*(mass of neutron).

Mass of proton is about 1.007276 GeV/c².

Mass of neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c².

So 3 *1.007276=3.021828 GeV/c².

3 *1.008665=3.025995 GeV/c².

Summing them: 3.021828 + 3.025995 =6.047823 GeV/c².

That seems correct.

Wait, but maybe I should account for binding energy. Oh wait, no, because in particle
