Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not too sure about that; maybe it's just a detail that's not important for solving the problem.

The given information includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. That means Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's. Then, between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So Planet2 is 2.3 times Planet3's temperature?

Wait, wait. No, because the way ratios are presented can be tricky. Let me think. If the ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, that means T1/T2 = 1.4. Then, T2/T3 = 2.3. So, T1 is 1.4 times T2, and T2 is 2.3 times T3. So T1 is 1.4 * 2.3 * T3, which is 3.22 times T3. So the temperatures go: Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, which is hotter than Planet3.

Next, the mass ratios. Planet1 and Planet2 have a mass ratio of about 1.15. So M1/M2 = 1.15. Between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 1.35. So M2/M3 = 1.35. So M1 is 1.15 times M2, and M2 is 1.35 times M3. So M1 is 1.15 * 1.35 * M3. Let me calculate that: 1.15 * 1.35 is approximately 1.5525. So M1 is about 1.55 times M3. So the masses go: Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, which is more than Planet3.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So, we're to find the factor by which Planet3's period is larger than Planet1's.

All right, so I'm supposed to find P3 / P1. And the albedo is the same for all three, 0.3, like Earth. So albedo doesn't come into play here, which is good.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and its orbital period doesn't directly influence the temperature, but the orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's laws.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = [(L*(1 - a))/(16 * π * σ * D^2)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star. But since all three planets are orbiting the same star, L and a are the same for all. So T is proportional to
