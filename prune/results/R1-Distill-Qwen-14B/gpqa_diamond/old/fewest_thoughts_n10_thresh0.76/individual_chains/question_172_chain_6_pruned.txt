Okay, so I've got this physics problem about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's see. The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation here probably refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one.

I remember that in thermal equilibrium, which I think is what Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) implies, the distribution of particles in different energy states is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the formula is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels is proportional to an exponential term involving the energy difference and temperature.

The Boltzmann equation, if I recall, is n2/n1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ). Since E2 > E1, this ratio will be less than one. But in the problem, n2 for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, let me clarify. The problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited"—so n2 for star_1 is twice as much as n2 for star_2. Or is it that the excitation relative to the ground state is different between the stars?

Alternatively, perhaps it's that the ratio of excited to unexcited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So maybe for star_1, n2/n1 = 2*(n2’/n1’), where
