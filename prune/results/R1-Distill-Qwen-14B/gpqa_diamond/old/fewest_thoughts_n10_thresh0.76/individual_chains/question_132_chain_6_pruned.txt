Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The aromatic region shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, wait, I think it's two signals, each a singlet, and each integrating for a certain number of protons, but the ratio is 1:1. Hmm, or maybe the ratio is about their intensity. Or perhaps the two signals each have a 1:1 area, but I'm not sure.

Then there are three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So three different groups here, maybe methyl groups, since 2.2 is typical for CH3 attached to something de-shielded, like in isopropyl or perhaps attached to an aromatic ring.

The possible compounds are all tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let me think about each compound's structure and their NMR.

The molecular formula is C10H14. Let's check each option:

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: that would be four methyl groups on the benzene, making the formula C10H14. Same with the others except 1,4-diethylbenzene, which has two ethyl groups. Wait, 1,4-diethyl would be C8H10, but the total is C10H14. Oh wait, each ethyl is C2H5. So two ethyl groups would add 4 carbons, and the benzene is 6, so 6+4=10 carbons. So C10H14: benzene (6 carbons, 6 H's), two ethyl groups (each C2H5 has 5 H's, so two would be 10 H's). Wait, but benzene has 6 H's in diethylbenzene? No, wait, when you have substituents on benzene, the H's on the ring are replaced. Let me think: for diethylbenzene, each ethyl is attached in positions 1 and 4, which are para to each other.

So structure-wise:

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: a benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1,2,4,5. That would be two adjacent (1,2) and another adjacent pair (4,5), so perhaps a 1,2 and 4,5 substitution. Wait, wait, but wait, in benzene, 1,2,4,5 positions would be two para substituents? Let me draw it.

Wait, benzene is a ring with positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. If you have substituents at 1,2,4,5, then 1 and 2 are adjacent,
