Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that the operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Oh wait, right, in quantum mechanics, operators often correspond to observables, and their eigenvalues represent possible measurement outcomes. So P here is probably the momentum operator or something similar, but I'm not sure. But okay, I'll focus on the matrices given.

The problem provides the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P. Each component is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So, let's write them down:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. That looks familiar—like the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, right? Wait, no, the Pauli Y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so that's exactly P_y. And P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix scaled by ħ/2.

So the total operator P is along the direction n, which
