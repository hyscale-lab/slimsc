Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that flux in the optical or near-infrared dropping at shorter wavelengths could relate to something called the Lyman-alpha forest or maybe something to do with the quasar's emission lines being redshifted.

Wait, Lyman-alpha is a hydrogen emission line at about 121 nm. If a quasar's emission is redshifted, the observed wavelength would be longer. So if the peak is at 790 nm, that's way longer than 121 nm. Let me calculate the redshift. The formula is observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z). So λ_emit for Lyman-alpha is 121 nm, so 790 = 121*(1+z). So 1+z = 790/121 ≈6.5289. So z ≈5.5289. That's a high redshift object.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance is a way to express the distance to an object in a flat universe, considering the expansion. The formula for comoving distance depends on the redshift and the cosmological parameters: Hubble constant H0, matter density Ω_m, dark energy Ω_Λ, etc.

The parameters given are H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, and it's flat (so Ω_k=0). So we need to compute the comoving distance at z≈5.5289.

But wait, calculating the comoving distance for high redshifts isn't straightforward. It involves integrating the inverse of the Hubble parameter over redshift. The comoving distance D_C is given by (c/H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_r(1+z)^4 + Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ). Oh wait, but for z much greater than 1, radiation density is negligible, so Ω_r is zero. So E(z) = sqrt( (
