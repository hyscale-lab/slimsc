Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene, and I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the options given.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me draw that structure mentally. It's a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group, position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group. Wait, no, waitâ€”I think I got that wrong. Wait, the numbering might be different. Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent to each other in a row. So, the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions.

So, the substituents are in the meta and para positions relative to each other? Wait, no, position 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho), position 2 and 3 are also adjacent (ortho), and position 1 and 3 are meta relative to each other.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Positions 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent in a way that each is next to the other. So, if I imagine the benzene ring, substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions. So, the substituents are all adjacent, in a sort of meta arrangement for two substituents, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to think about the order of substitution.

I need to figure out the order in which the substituents are added to benzene to get them in those specific positions. I remember that when you perform electrophilic substitution reactions on benzene, the incoming groups enter in a certain regiochemistry based on directing groups
