Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined, and their energy levels are quantized.

The problem is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so I need to calculate each of these and match them.

First, I should recall the energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite well. The energy formula is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the quantum number. But here, E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²), so E = E_1. So each state's energy will be a multiple of E.

For a single particle, the energy levels are E_1, 2²E_1=4E, 3²E_1=9E, 4²E_1=16E, etc. But wait, wait, no. Wait, E itself is E_1. So E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, and so on.

But now, we have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n. But wait, no—actually, in one dimension, each particle's state is determined by its quantum number n and its spin. Since spin is 1/2, each particle has two possible spin states: up and down.

So for each energy level n, you can have two particles with different spins. So each n can hold two particles. So let me think about how the four particles would fill the energy levels.

The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration. Since each n can take two particles, the first two particles go into n=1 (with opposite spins), the next two go into n=2. Wait, no. Wait, no, because n=1 can hold two particles, but if there are four particles, we can have n=1 holding two, n=2 holding two. Because each n
