Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Wait, I remember that for angular momentum operators, especially spin, the eigenstates can be found using the operator components along a particular direction. Oh right, the operator P here is probably the spin operator because the components are given in terms of ħ/2 matrices.

So the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. That direction can be represented using spherical coordinates, where the angle θ is from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle. Since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, right? Because the x-z plane means the projection on the y-axis is zero. So φ is either 0 or π, but maybe it doesn't matter for the eigenvector since it's arbitrary.

The eigenvector we're looking for is for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Spin-up state, I think. So the spin state along direction n should have eigenvalue +ħ/2.

In quantum mechanics, the spin operator along a direction n is given by the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y must be zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, let's write that down. The operator P is a vector operator whose components are given. Each component is (ħ/2) times a Pauli matrix. So P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, P_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, P_z is (ħ/2) σ_z. So the operator along n is P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, since n is a direction, it's a unit vector. So n_x and n_z are the components of the unit vector in the x and z directions, respectively. So n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, since in the x-z plane, φ=0. Because any direction in the x-z plane can be described by an angle θ from the z-axis, and φ=0.
