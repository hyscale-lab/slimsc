Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis pathways. But let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which reaction sequence leads to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions.

First, I need to visualize the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, it's a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). The substituents on the benzene ring are a bromine at the 3 position and a nitro group at the 5 position. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me sketch it mentally. The phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon (C=O), making the structure Ph-C(O)-CH3? Wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO? No, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(O)-. So the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH3? Hmm, wait no. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, which is (propan-2-one), but wait, no. No, ethan-1-one would be CH2C(O)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the IUPAC nomenclature for ketones is based on the longest chain that includes the carbonyl group. So, ethan-1-one would have the carbonyl at position 1. So that would be R-CO-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Actually, I think I'm mixing up the nomenclature. Let me think again. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone (acetone) part is connected to the benzene ring at the 1-position of the ketone. So, the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and a ketone group (C=O) attached at the 1-position of the benzene. Wait, no. Wait, wait. No, the ketone is part of the ethanone, not directly attached to the benzene. Wait, no, the phenyl group is attached to the ketone.

Wait, acetophenone is a benzene ring attached to a ketone (phenylacetone). So, it's benzene with a carbonyl group attached, making it C6H5-C(O)-CH3. But in this case, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the structure would be:

The ketone is ethan-1-one, which is (CH3)2CO, but if it's 1-phenyl, then the phenyl is attached to the carb
