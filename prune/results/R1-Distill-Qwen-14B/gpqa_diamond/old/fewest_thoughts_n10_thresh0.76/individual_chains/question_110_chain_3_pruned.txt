Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are observable by both instruments based on the given data.

I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES have different magnitude limits. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, so it can handle stars up to 17 mag. HIRES can go down to 16 mag. So, the stars must have an apparent V magnitude that's brighter than or equal to 16 (since HIRES can't go beyond 16, and ESPRESSO can go a bit lower, but the higher one is the limiting factor here). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So, that means it can observe any star with V less than or equal to 17? Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's a higher magnitude number but lower brightness. Wait no, wait, no. Let me think: magnitudes are such that lower numbers are brighter. So a star with V magnitude 16 is brighter than one with 17. So the HIRES can observe stars up to 16 mag (since it's brighter than 16). So a star with apparent V mag of 16 can be observed by HIRES, but ESPRESSO can go to 17, so a star at 17 can't be observed by HIRES but can by ESPRESSO. So, for a star to be observed by both, its apparent V mag must be ≤16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16. Because if a star is 17 mag, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't. So the star must have V mag ≤16 to be detectable by both.

Wait, wait, am I getting this right? Let me clarify. The question says: With ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that would be V mag less than 17, right? Because a star with V mag of 1
