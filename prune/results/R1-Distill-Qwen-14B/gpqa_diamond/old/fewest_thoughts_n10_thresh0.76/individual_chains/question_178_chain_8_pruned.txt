Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in quantum field theory, the renormalizability depends on the dimensions of the interaction terms. 

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, what's σ_{μν} again? Oh right, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think, so it's like ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ.

So, to find the mass dimension of κ, I need to figure out the dimensions of each part of the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because in four spacetime dimensions, the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ℏ=c=1), so each term in the Lagrangian density must have dimension [Mass]^4.

Let me break down L_int. The term is κ multiplied by \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ multiplied by F^{μν}. So, each component's mass dimension needs to be considered.

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. I remember that in four dimensions, the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (∫ / p - m) ψ =0, where m has dimension 1, so ψ must have dimension 3/2 to balance the equation.

Then, σ_{μν} is a product of two γ matrices. Each γ matrix is dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, so σ_{μν} also has dimension 0.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each A is a vector potential, which in four dimensions has mass dimension 1. Because the covariant derivative is ∂ + i e A, and ∂ has dimension 1, so A must have dimension 1 to balance. Therefore, each derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, and F^{μν} is a derivative acting on A, so F has dimension 2. Because F is ∂A, which is (dim 1) acting on (dim 1), so ∂A would have dimension 2? Wait, no—actually, F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. Each term is ∂ (dim 1) times A (dim 1), so F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together, the term in the Lagrangian is κ * [ψ]^2 * [F]. Because ψ is dimension 3/2, so two ψs (from \bar{ψ} and ψ) give (3/2)*2 =3. F is dimension 2, so the whole term is κ * (3) * (2) = κ *6. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so:

κ * 6 =4 → [κ]=4/6 = 2/3? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing up how the dimensions multiply.

Wait, no. Each component's dimension multiplies. The whole term is κ multiplied by \bar{ψ}σ_{μν}ψ multiplied by F^{μν}. So [κ] is the dimension we need to find, and the other parts:

Each ψ is 3/2. So \bar{ψ}ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2) )=3.

Then F^{μν} is dimension 2. So the product ψ^2 *
