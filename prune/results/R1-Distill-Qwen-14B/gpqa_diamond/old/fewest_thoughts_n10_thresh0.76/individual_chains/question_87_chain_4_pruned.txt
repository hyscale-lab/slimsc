Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents, right? And the total carbon atoms are 8. Hmm, so the main ring is a benzene ring, which has 6 carbons. So the substituents must add 2 more carbons because 6 + 2 = 8. Oh wait, but wait, substituents can sometimes be more complicated. Let me think again. The compound is di-substituted, so there are two groups attached to the benzene ring.

The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents on the benzene ring must include a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or something like that) and a halogen, like Cl or Br. But wait, the compound is di-substituted, so the two substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but waitâ€”could the substituents be more complicated, like maybe one substituent has both a carbonyl and a halogen? Like a halogenated carbonyl group? Hmm, but that's probably more than what's needed here. Let me think again. The substituents are two separate groups: one is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen.

So, benzene with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group, like a ketone (C=O), and the other is a halogen (like Cl). Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group and the other is a halogen, but maybe they are part of a larger substituent.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the compound has 8 carbons in total. The benzene has 6 carbons. So the substituents must add 2 carbons. So each substituent could be a single carbon, but that might not make sense for a carbonyl group. Let me think of the possibilities.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents could be a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which is a single substituent with a carbonyl) and another substituent that has a halogen. Alternatively
