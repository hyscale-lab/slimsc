Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the main focus is on tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that tautomerism has something to do with the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift in double bonds, like in keto-enol tautomerism. And optical isomerism is about molecules being non-superimposable mirror images, which usually involves chiral centers.

The question has two parts, A and B. 

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism. 

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

So I need to figure out each part separately.

Starting with Part A. Let's think about tautomerism. Tautomerism occurs when a molecule can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, causing a change in structure, like between a keto and enol form. For that, the molecule must have a hydrogen attached to a carbon that's next to a carbonyl group, right? So, if the compound has adjacent carbonyl groups, like conjugated carbonyls, maybe tautomerism isn't possible because there's no hydrogen available to shift.

Benzoquinone: Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone can be 1,2-diketone (ortho) or 1,4-diketone (para). Either way, the structure has two carbonyl groups. So, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is adjacent to a benzene ring but are they adjacent to each other? No, because the quinone structure is two carbonyls across from each other.

Wait, for tautomerism to happen, you need a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl. Benzoquinone, like para-benzoquinone, has two carbonyl groups opposite each other. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the benzene ring. Wait
