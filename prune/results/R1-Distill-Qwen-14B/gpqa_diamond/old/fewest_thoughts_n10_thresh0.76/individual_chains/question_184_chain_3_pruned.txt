Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reactions. Hmm, I remember that when you're dealing with multiple substituents on benzene rings, the order of reactions matters a lot because each substituent directs the next incoming group.

Let me think about the structure we're trying to make. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, numbering the benzene ring, position 1 has the ethoxy group, position 2 has the tert-butyl group, and position 3 has the nitro group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. The IUPAC numbering probably places substituents in the lowest possible order. Let me visualize it.

Wait, benzene is symmetric, so the numbering can vary. Let me think again: the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. But I need to make sure about the order of reactions.

So, the synthesis starts with benzene. Each substitution step depends on the directing groups of the substituents already present.

First, I think about the substitution reactions. Nitration is a meta-directing reaction when the substituent is a nitro group. Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an O-alkyl group) and it's ortho/para-directing. The tert-butyl group is a strong activating, para-directing group because it's an alkyl chain. Wait, no, actually, tert-butyl is a bulky group, but it's a strong activating group because it's an alkyl. So, substituents on benzene can be activating or deactivating, and that affects where the next substituent goes.

Wait, let's list out the substituents and their directing effects:

- tert-butyl (alkyl): activating, ortho/para-directing.
- ethoxy (OCH2CH3):
