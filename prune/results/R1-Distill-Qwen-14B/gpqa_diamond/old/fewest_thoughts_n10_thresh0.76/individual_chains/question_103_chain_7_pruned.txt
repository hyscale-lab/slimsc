Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. The task is to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking it down, the phenyl group is attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one), and on the benzene ring, there are two substituents: a bromine at the 3-position and a nitro group at the 5-position. Wait, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me visualize that. So if the ketone is at position 1, then the substituents would be at positions 3 and 5 relative to that.

Wait, actually, in benzene, substituents are numbered to give the lowest possible numbers. So the ketone group is directly attached to the benzene (since it's 1-phenyl). So the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone (like acetophenone), and on the ring, there's a bromine and a nitro group in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So the substituents are meta to each other relative to the ketone.

Now, I need to figure out how to introduce these groups in the correct positions. Let's think about the directing effects of each substituent.

Benzene is the starting material. Let's consider the first substitution. Common reactions are nitration, bromination, acetylation, etc.

The target molecule has a nitro group and a bromine in the meta positions relative to the ketone. Also, the ketone is an acetyl group attached to the benzene ring.

But wait, the ketone (acetyl) is an activating group, right? No, wait. Acetophenone is a ketone attached to benzene. The ketone is a meta director because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So when a substituent is introduced after the ketone is already attached, it will go into the
