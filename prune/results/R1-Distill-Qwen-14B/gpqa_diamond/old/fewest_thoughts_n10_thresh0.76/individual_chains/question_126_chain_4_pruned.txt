Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions and chromatography concepts. But let's take it step by step.

The question involves two reactions, both of which use some kind of borohydride reduction. Then, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. The main goal is to figure out how many peaks appear in each type of chromatogram. 

First, let me parse each reaction carefully.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. In ketones, LAH would typically reduce the ketone group into a secondary alcohol. So, the starting material is a ketone, so after reduction, it becomes a secondary alcohol. Since the starting material is (S) configuration, the product's configuration might depend on the reaction conditions. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to inversion of configuration if it's an SN2 mechanism, but ketone reductions are usually via a tetrahedral intermediate, which might proceed with retention or maybe no particular configuration unless the starting material is chiral. Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the carbonyl is at position 3. Let me draw the structure to visualize.

The structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(O)-(CH2)3CH3? Wait, no. Let me think: hexan-3-one is (CH2CH2)C(O)CH2CH2CH3. So, the carbonyl is at position 3. So the starting molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which I think is (R) or (S) configuration at the 5th carbon, which has a methoxy group. 

Wait, the structure might be CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3. Hmm, no, wait: 5-methoxyhexan-3-one would have the structure: CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH
