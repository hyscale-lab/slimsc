Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The system consists of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Right, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Wait, no, actually, each state's contribution is exp(-β E), so I have to calculate that for each possible state and sum them all.

First, let me think about the possible states. Each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I'll need to list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate the energy for each, then compute exp(-βE) for each and sum them up.

Wait, but that's a lot of work. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps I can find how many states have a particular value of the energy, then compute the partition function more efficiently.

Wait, the energy E is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me note that each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1, because each S_i is ±1. So S_i S_j = 1 if Si and Sj are the same, and -1 if they're different.

So the sum inside the brackets is the sum of three terms, each ±1. Let me denote the sum as S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J S.

So each state will have an energy proportional to S. So I need to find the number of states where S has a particular value, say s, and then compute the contributions.

So S can range from what? Each term is ±1, so the sum can be:

Maximum when all three terms are 1: S=3.

Minimum when all three terms are -1: S=-3.

But wait, is that possible? Let me think. For example, can all three S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 be 1 at the same time
