Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l=1. The coupled state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So, l1 and l2 are both 1. The total angular momentum l is 2, and m is -1.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. So, each of their individual z-components is -ħ. But wait, I remember that for angular momentum, the eigenvalues are mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So, for each electron, L_z would be m_i * ħ. So, if m_i is -1, then L1z would be -ħ and same for L2z.

But wait, the state given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, the total m is -1. Let me think. The total m is m1 + m2. Because when you couple angular momenta, the total m is the sum of the individual m's. So, m_total = m1 + m2.

In this state, m is -1. So, m1 + m2 = -1. Now, the question is asking for the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1. That would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. So, adding those gives m_total = -2. But wait, the given state has m_total = -1. That doesn't add up. So, that can't happen.

Wait, wait, hold on. Because if both m1 and m2 are -1, then their sum is -2, which doesn't match the m of -1 for the state. So, that means the state |1,1,2,-1> does not include any component where both m1 and m2 are -1. Because in that case, the total would be -2, which isn't the case here.

But wait, maybe the state is not normalized, but in any case, the state given has m = -1. So, any component where m1 + m2 = -1. So, possible (m1, m2) pairs are (0,-1), (1,-2), (-1,0), (-2,1), etc. But wait, the individual m's can't be less than -l or more than +l. Since l=1, each m can be -1, 0, +1.

So, possible pairs adding up to -1 are:

m1=0, m2=-1

m1=1, m2=-2 → but m2 can't be -2, since l=1, so m2 can only be -1,0,1. So that's invalid.

Similarly, m1=-1, m2=0.

So the possible (m1, m2) for the state with m_total = -1 are (0,-1) and (-1, 0). So, no component where both are -1. Because that would require
