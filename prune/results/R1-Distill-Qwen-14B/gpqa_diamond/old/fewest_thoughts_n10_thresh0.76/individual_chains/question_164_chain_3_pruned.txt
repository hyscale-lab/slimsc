Okay, I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's see what the question is about. So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses, so that's the orbital period of the binary system.

Then, there are spectroscopic observations about the radial velocities (RV) of the stars. In system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. I need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, considering the mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm, I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity curves are related to the masses of the stars. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity amplitude because the center of mass is closer to it. So, the mass ratio is inversely proportional to the velocity ratio.

Wait, the formula I think I should use is the mass ratio (q) equals the mass of the secondary divided by the mass of the primary. And the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So, q = (v1) / (v2), where v1 is the primary's velocity and v2 is the secondary's. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think. The less massive star moves more. So, if star A has mass M, star B has mass m. Then, M_A * a_A = M_B * a_B, where a is the semi-major axis. Since the velocity is v = 2πa/P, the velocity is proportional to a. So, M_A/M_B = v_B/v_A. So, the mass ratio q = M_B/M_A = v_A / v_B.

Wait, maybe I should write the Keplerian equations. The mass function comes into play here, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Alternatively, for each system, the total mass can be calculated from the radial velocity semi-amplitudes and the period.

Wait, the formula for the mass function is f(M) = (v^3 P) / (2π G), but that's for a single-lined spectroscopic binary. But in this case, the problem gives both stars' RV amplitudes, so maybe it's a double-lined system. So, perhaps I can find the masses of each star.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't give me actual masses but the radial velocity amplitudes. So, I need to relate the RVs to the masses.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit, so a smaller velocity amplitude. The velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to their masses.

So, for system 1, star A has velocity amplitude K1 = 10 km/s, and star B has K2 =5 km/s. So the mass ratio q = M_B / M_A = K1 / K2. Because mass is inversely proportional to velocity.

So, q = 10 /5 = 2. So, M_B is twice M_A in system 1. So,
