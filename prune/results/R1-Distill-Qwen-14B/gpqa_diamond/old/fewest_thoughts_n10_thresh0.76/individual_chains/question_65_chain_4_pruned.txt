Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to select the correct major products based on the given options. Let me break it down.

First, Reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and H+. I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. When a strong base is used, especially in such conditions, it's often about elimination reactions or deprotonation. But wait, the starting material has a spiro structure, which is where two rings are joined at a single atom. The molecule is 1-vinyl, so there's a double bond attached to the spiro center. The formula is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So structure-wise, I imagine the spiro atom is connected to a vinyl group (CH2CH2 double bond?), maybe.

When you have a spiro compound and you deprotonate it, especially with a strong base like KH, you're likely looking at an elimination reaction. But wait, the reaction also involves H+ at the end. Or maybe the H+ is a workup step. Let me think. So, the alcohol is -OH. If we deprotonate the alcohol, we get an alkoxide. Then, perhaps an elimination occurs, maybe forming a carbonyl group? Wait, or maybe a ring-closing or some kind of cyclization.

Wait, another thought: The spiro compound has two rings. The 3.5 part probably means one ring is 4-membered (since 3+1) and the other is 6-membered (5+1). So, when treated with a strong base like KH, the -OH is deprotonated to O-, which is a good leaving group if possible. But wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the hydroxyl group, leading to an elimination. Or, considering the structure, perhaps an E2 elimination occurs, forming a double bond.

Wait, but the starting material already has a double bond. So maybe the base induces some kind of ring formation. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement? Pinacol rearrangement involves 1,2-diols under acid conditions, but here we have a strong base.

Alternatively, maybe the base induces a conjugate addition or elimination. Let me think about the structure. The spiro compound has a five-membered and a seven-membered ring? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, spiro[3.5]non... So the main chain is non, meaning nine carbons. So the spiro is at position 1, with a vinyl group attached there. The structure would be a bridge between two rings: one is a 3-membered ring (if 3.5 is the bridge?), wait no, spiro rings are connected at a single atom, so each ring is attached to that central atom. So, for spiro[3.5], each ring would have 3 and 5 carbons respectively. So the smaller ring would be a 3-membered ring (like cyclopropane) and the larger a 5 or 6-membered. Wait, spiro[m.n] means m+1 and n+1 carbons in each ring. So spiro[3.5] would be 4 and 6 membered rings. So two rings: four-membered and six-membered.

So, the molecule is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the spiro is at C1, which has the vinyl group (CH2-CH2 with a double bond), and the hydroxyl group on the same carbon. The double bond is at position 5. Hmm.

When treated with a strong base, perhaps it's an E2 elimination. The base abstracts a proton beta to the hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of a double bond or an expansion of the
