Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and some dark spots on it. The scenario is that these spots can mimic the effect of an exoplanet when observed through photometric time-series data. The task is to find out what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be relative to the star's radius to produce the same brightness variation.

So, first, let's list out the given information.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So Rstar = R_sun. Let me recall the Sun's radius is about 7e5 km, but maybe I won't need the exact value since we're dealing with ratios.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. Dark spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. So 20% means 0.2 of the star's surface is covered by spots.

The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. But wait, the star's Teff is 6000 K. So the spots are either 5000 K or 7000 K? The problem says a temperature difference of 1000 K. Oh, but wait, spots are cooler regions, so I think the spots are 5000 K. Because in reality, sunspots are darker and cooler than the surrounding photosphere.

So the star is losing brightness due to these spots when they are on the hemisphere facing us. But the question says that when the star isn't covered by spots, what would be the exoplanet's radius. So the scenario is comparing two cases: one where the brightness variation comes from spots, and another where it's an exoplanet transiting in front.

Wait, no. The question says that because of the spots, the brightness variation is similar to an exoplanet. So in reality, the spots are causing the photometric variations, but if instead, it was an exoplanet, what would the planet's radius be to cause the same brightness dip.

So, the problem is to find R_pl / R_star such that the dip in brightness (the amplitude) when the planet transits is the same as the dip
