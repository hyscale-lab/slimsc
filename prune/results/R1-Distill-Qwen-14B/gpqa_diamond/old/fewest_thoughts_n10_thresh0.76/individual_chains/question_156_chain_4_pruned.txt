Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both achiral and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

First, I remember that mCPBA (meta-chloroperbenzoic acid) is a peracid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. So when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. The reaction is stereospecific, right? So the stereochemistry of the starting alkene will influence the epoxide's structure.

Wait, but wait. The reaction conditions after mCPBA are aqueous acid. Oh, right! Epoxides under acidic conditions typically undergo ring-opening reactions. The acid would protonate the epoxide, making it more electrophilic. Then, the ring opens via a carbocation intermediate. For symmetric epoxides, maybe the ring-opening is more straightforward, but for asymmetric ones, the product might be a mixture.

But wait, the starting alkenes here are (E) and (Z) isomers. So each will form different epoxides upon reaction with mCPBA. Let me think about each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA. The (E) configuration means the higher priority groups on each carbon are opposite each other. The epoxidation would form an epoxide where the oxygen is across the double bond. So the (E) alkene would form a trans-diepoxide? Or wait, mCPBA forms an epoxide by adding an oxygen across the double bond. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the alkene's geometry. So for an (E) alkene, the resulting epoxide would have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides, making it a trans-epoxide.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene. The (Z) configuration has the higher priority groups on the same side. So the epoxide formed would have the oxygen atoms on the same side, making it a cis-epoxide.

Wait, so Reaction 1 gives a trans-epoxide, and Reaction 2 gives a cis-epoxide
