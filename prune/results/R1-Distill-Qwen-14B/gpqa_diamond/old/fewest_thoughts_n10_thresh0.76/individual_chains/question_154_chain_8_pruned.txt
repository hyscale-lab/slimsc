Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem is about identifying an unknown white solid based on its spectral data. The chemist has some mass spec, IR, and 1H NMR data. There are four options provided, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let's start by looking at each piece of data and see what information it gives.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% abundance. There's also a peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, I remember that molecular ion peaks can indicate the molecular weight. So, the molecular weight is likely 156. But wait, there's a peak at 158. I think that might be due to a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has two common isotopes: about 75% 35Cl (mass ~35) and 25% 37Cl (~37). So, the molecular ion (M) would be at 35Cl, but sometimes the M+2 peak appears at 37Cl. So, the molecular weight is 156, but the presence of an M+2 peak could suggest a chlorine atom in the molecule. Let me calculate: if the molecular formula has one Cl, which is m/z 35, but the M would be, say, 156. So, the M+2 would be 158, which is 32% of the intensity. 32% is roughly 37Cl's abundance (37 is about 25% of Cl's natural abundance, wait no, wait: wait, 35Cl is about 75% and 37Cl is about 25%. So, if the molecular ion is 156 (M), which includes one Cl (35), then the M+2 would be 158 (35 +2 =37), so the abundance would be 25% of the M peak. But the M peak is at 156 (100%), and the M+2 is 32% of that. Hmm, 32% is a bit higher than 25%. Maybe there are two Cl atoms? Because if there are two Cls, then the M would be 156 (35*2=70?), and the M+2 would be 158 (37*2=74?), but wait, that would require each Cl contributes. Wait, maybe the molecular formula includes one Cl. So, if M is 156 (Cl at 35), then M+Cl37 would be 158. The expected intensity ratio would be about 25% because each Cl contributes. But the M+2 here is 32% of M. Hmm. Maybe it's not just Cl. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is at 156, but the M+2 is 158 with 32% intensity. I'm a bit confused here, but perhaps the presence of Cl is indicated.

Next, the IR data. Broad peak from 3500 to 2700 cm^-1. That's a broad peak, which usually suggests O-H or N-H stretching. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. 1720 is in the range for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters, etc. But the broad peak might suggest that the O-H is present, like in a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak, but the carbonyl would be around 1700-1725 cm^-1. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the stretching is higher, like around 2800 and 2720 for the aldehyde C-H stretch. But the IR here shows a broad peak which might not be from aldehyde but from something else. Let's think: a strong, sharp peak at 1720 could be an ester or perhaps a ketone, but if there's a broad O-H peak, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have both O-H (broad) and a strong carbonyl (around 1700). So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR now. The 1H NMR shows three signals. The first is at 11.0 ppm, a singlet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton (but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm) or a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, wait. Wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad singlets around 10-12 ppm. So 11.0 ppm as a singlet could be a carboxylic acid -OH. But wait, in DMSO, the OH of a carboxylic acid can be downfield. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, so 11 is a bit high for that. Hmm. Another possibility is an aromatic -OH, but those are usually around 5-8 ppm, so that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the NH in a primary amine, but that's less likely here.

Then, the next signals in the NMR are at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). These are in the aromatic region. The doublets suggest coupling between two protons each. So perhaps the structure has two sets of protons that are each adjacent to each other in a para-substituted benzene, for example. Let me think: if it's a para-substituted benzene, you might have two doublets. For instance, in para-substituted aromatic compounds, the protons are often split into two doublets, each integrating for two protons. Like in para-substituted benzaldehyde, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Or maybe in a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions, like chlorobenzoic acid.

Wait, let me think about the options provided.

Options:
A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid
C) Phenyl chloroformate
D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid

Looking at each option:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2. The substituents are in the o and m positions. But then, the aromatic protons would be in positions 4 and 6, perhaps, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact splitting. Also, the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, maybe 9.5-10.5. The NMR here shows
