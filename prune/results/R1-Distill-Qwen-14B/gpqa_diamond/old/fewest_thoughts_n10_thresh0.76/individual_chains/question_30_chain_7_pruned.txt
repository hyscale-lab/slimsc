Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry and light emission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see. The question is about a textile dye that emits light with a certain energy, right? And I need to figure out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember from my notes that when a compound absorbs light, it emits or reflects the complementary color. Oh right, the color wheel! So if something emits green, it must absorb magenta or something. But wait, the question says it emits light at 2.3393 eV. I think I need to find out what color that corresponds to.

Wait, energy levels and colors. I remember that energy and wavelength are inversely related via the equation E = hc/λ. So higher energy means shorter wavelength. The visible spectrum ranges from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Each color has a specific energy.

So let's calculate the wavelength. E is given in eV. E = 2.3393 eV. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3.0e8 m/s. Oh wait, but since E is in eV, I should convert it to Joules first.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J. Let me compute that. 2 * 1.602 is 3.204, 0.3393 *1.602 is about 0.543. So total E is roughly 3.204 + 0.543 = 3.747e-19 J.

Now, E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E. Plugging in the numbers: (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (3.747e-19 J). Let's compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 3.747e-19 is (1.9878e-25)/(3.747e-19) = approx 5.3e-7 meters. Because 1e-9 meters is a nanometer,
