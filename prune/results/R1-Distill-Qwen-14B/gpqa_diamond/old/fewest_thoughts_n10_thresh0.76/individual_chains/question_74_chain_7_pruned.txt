Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed without decay. Now, we're asked what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are A) 44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law. The probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed; it's memoryless. So even if 50 minutes have gone by and the atom hasn't decayed, the probability for the next time period should be calculated based on the remaining time.

Wait, but wait. The initial probability given is 32% over 100 minutes. So first, maybe I should find the decay constant or the half-life from this information. Because the decay probability is given for 100 minutes, I can relate that to the decay constant.

The decay probability formula is P = 1 - e^(-λt), where P is the probability, λ is the decay constant, and t is the time. Oh wait, right, because each atom has a certain probability of decaying per unit time, and the survival probability is e^(-λt), so the decayed probability is 1 minus that.

So initially, P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let's solve for λ.

So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ)
=> e^(-100λ) = 0.68
Take natural log on both sides:
-100λ = ln(0.68)
λ = -ln(0.68) / 100

Let me compute ln(0.68). Remembering that ln(1) is 0, and ln(0.5) is about -0.693. 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, so ln(0.68) is around -0.4005. Let me check: using calculator in my mind, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.4005.

So λ ≈ (0.4005)/100 = 0.004005 per minute.

Now, the problem says 50 minutes have passed without decay. So the remaining time we're considering is 150 minutes. Wait, no—wait, the question is about the next 150 minutes. But wait, wait a second. The question is a bit ambiguous. Are the next 150 minutes in addition to the 50 that have already passed, making the total 200 minutes, or is it the next 150 minutes from the current time?

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "the next 150 minutes" — so I think that's the time starting from now, so 150 minutes from now. That is, the time elapsed is
