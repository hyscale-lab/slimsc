Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's try to think this through.

Alright, the question has three parts: A, B, and C. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different products. Let's take them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves enolates attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

Dimethyl malonate is a good enolate precursor because it's a diester. So in the presence of a base like NaOEt, the malonate would form an enolate. The methyl acrylate would then be the Michael acceptor since it's an alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylateâ€”so the acrylate part is CH2=CHCOOCH3 with the substituent at the 3 position being a p-tolyl group. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C3. So the structure would be CH2=C(C6H4-4-Me)-COOCH3.

When the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks, the enolate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. The attack would happen at the less substituted end because of regiochemistry, but wait, the acrylate has the substituent on the same side as the carbonyl, so in (E) configuration, the p-tolyl and the ester group are on opposite sides.

Wait, no: for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituents on either end of the double bond are the p-tolyl and the ester. So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 of the acrylate: CH2-CH-p-tolyl-... wait, maybe I should draw it.

The structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the CH2? Or wait, wait. The acrylate is 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(C6H4-4-Me)OCH3? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the CH2 group? No, wait, 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon? Wait, no, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So the carbons are 1 (CH2), 2 (CH), 3 (COOR). So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the CH2.
