Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually correspond to O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait—the problem says it's an unknown compound. So if the peak is very broad, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because the O-H in carboxylic acids is usually broader than that of alcohols. Also, another strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a strong absorption, probably a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have that around 1700, but ketones and esters also do. However, the broad peak at 3000 suggests it's a carboxylic acid, because their O-H is more acidic and the broadening is more pronounced.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. None of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So that rules out any double bonds or aromatic protons. So the compound doesn't have any vinyl groups. That makes sense because all the options provided are structures with branching and a carboxylic acid group but no double bonds.

In the NMR, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, complex splitting patterns. Let me think about what that means. Each splitting indicates coupling with neighboring protons. A doublet of triplets suggests two sets of neighboring protons. Wait, perhaps each proton is split by two different sets of adjacent protons.

Wait, the splitting patterns can tell us about the structure. Let's think about each option and their structures.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure would have a central carbon (maybe the carbonyl is on the end?) Wait, no. Let me parse the formula. It's CH3 connected to a C(H)(C2H5), which is another CH connected to C2H5. Then another CH connected to C2H5, and then CH2COOH. So, perhaps this is a di-substituted something. Wait, maybe it's a geminal di-substituted group?

No, wait, probably it's a structure where there are two CH groups each attached to ethyl groups. So like (CH2CH2CH3) attached to a CH which is attached to another CH which is attached to another ethyl group and a CH2COOH group. Hmm, maybe a branching point. Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure like (CH2CH2CH3)C(H)(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the central part is two CH groups, each connected to an ethyl group. So each CH is attached to an ethyl and two other carbons.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH3 connected to a C(H)(C2H5), which is connected to another C(H)(C2H5), and then a COOH. So that would mean the middle carbons are each CH groups attached to ethyl groups, and the whole thing is connected to a COOH group. Wait, but the COOH is at the end. So the structure is CH2CH2-C-(...)-C-...-COOH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So the CH3 is attached to
