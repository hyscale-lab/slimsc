Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a point charge q moving with a trajectory s(t). We're supposed to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a point r at time t, where t > tr. Tr is the time when the field was generated. The vector d is from the field generation point to the observation point r.

Alright, I remember that potentials in electromagnetism are related to the charge and current distributions. The scalar potential V is usually due to the charge, and the vector potential A is due to the current or motion of the charge.

Wait, the problem gives me four options, A to D. Each option gives expressions for V and A. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let's recall the formulas for the potentials. For a charge moving with velocity v at time tr, the potentials at time t (t > tr) would involve considering the retarded time. The retarded time is when the effects from the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time reach the observer at time t.

So, the scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by 1 over the distance, but with the retarded time. Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times something, maybe involving the same distance but adjusted for the motion.

Wait, more precisely, the scalar potential for a moving charge is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r)], but I think when the charge is moving, the expression might involve the term (d · v), where d is the displacement vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point r. So, the denominator is something like (d c - d · v), because of the way the retarded time works.

Wait, let me think about the exact expressions. The scalar potential V is generally given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r')] where r' is the distance in the rest frame of the charge, but considering the motion. Or is it (d c - (d · v)) in the denominator?

Wait, I think the denominator for the potentials is (|d| c - d · v). Let me think
