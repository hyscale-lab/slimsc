Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, which isn't present here. So, (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2. Wait, because N is treated as +1. So 18-9+1=10. 10/2=5 degrees. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from rings, double bonds, triple bonds, etc. Maybe a benzene ring (which is three degrees), a double bond (one), and maybe another ring or a ketone or something else.

The NMR data is given. Let me look at that. The peaks are:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) - That's a triplet. High ppm, maybe an aldehyde proton? Or maybe an acidic proton like -OH, but that's usually broader. Aldehyde protons are around 9-10, so maybe that's an aldehyde.

6.98 (d, 2H) - Two protons as a doublet. Maybe aromatic protons next to substituents.

6.51 (d, 2H) - Another doublet. Maybe another set of aromatic protons. So maybe two doublets each with two H, that suggests a para-substituted benzene. Like in para-substituted benzene, you have two protons in the ortho positions as doublets.

6.27 (bs, 2H) - Broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH group or maybe an enol. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated diene or something else.

3.66 (d, 2H) - A doublet, 2H. Maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom. Like OCH2, perhaps. Or maybe a CH2 next to an oxygen.

Wait, putting this together. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet, which is a bit unusual for an aldehyde. Typically, aldehyde protons are around 9-10 and as a singlet, unless coupled with something. Maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group? Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system.

Wait, another possibility is that the triplet is from an aldehyde next to a CH2 group. So if we have something like R-CHO, and the R is CH2-CH2 or something, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the NMR again: the 9.72 ppm is a triplet, integrating 1H. So maybe it's an aldehyde proton that's next to a CH2 group. So the structure could have an aldehyde attached to a CH2 group, which is perhaps part of a larger substituent.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet for 2H. So maybe a CH2 next to an oxygen. Like OCH2. So if we have an OCH2 group, perhaps in a benzene ring substitution.

Wait, but also considering the 6.98 and 6.51 peaks, maybe there's a para-substituted benzene ring. So two doublets each with 2H. So for example, the benzene is para-substituted with something.

Putting this together, maybe the compound is a diaryl ketone or something similar, but let's think about the reaction steps.

The reagents used are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: This is typically a nitrous acid condition, used for diazotization. This usually happens with aromatic amines, like aniline, under cold conditions (like 0-5Â°C). So maybe the starting compound has an aromatic amine group.

2. H2O: After diazotization, if you have H2O, it could be a hydrolysis step. Diazonium salts in water can undergo hydrolysis, especially under acidic or basic conditions. For example, if the diazonium salt is treated with water, it might form a phenol.

3. Aqueous KOH and heat: That sounds like a typical condition for elimination reactions or perhaps a substitution. Alternatively, it might be a hydrolysis of an imine or something else.

So, considering these steps: the starting material probably has an aromatic amine group. Let's think about the initial structure.

The NMR has a triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H), which might be an aldehyde proton adjacent to a CH2 group. Then, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H, which could be OCH2. So perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with an -OCH2CHO group attached? Or maybe something else.

Wait another thought: the starting material is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen.

If the N is in an amine group, like aniline, but after diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes a phenol.

So the initial structure might have a benzene ring with a substituent that includes an amine group and another group that could form an aldehyde after some reaction.

Wait, the NMR has an aldehyde proton, so maybe the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative with an amine group. Or perhaps the aldehyde comes from the reaction.

Wait, but the reaction steps: after diazotization and hydrolysis, perhaps the am
