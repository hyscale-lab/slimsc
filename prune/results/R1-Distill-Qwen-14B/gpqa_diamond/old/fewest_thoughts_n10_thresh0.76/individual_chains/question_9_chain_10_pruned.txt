Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is about their point groups. The question gives four options, and I need to determine which one fits the C3h symmetry.

Wait, what's C3h symmetry again? I think C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. C3h point group means the molecule has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane (Ïƒ) that includes the axis. Alternatively, maybe it's a combination of rotation and reflection. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, but I know that C3h symmetry implies a certain level of symmetry in the molecule.

Let me list the options again:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

So I need to analyze each structure's symmetry.

Starting with option C: triisopropyl borate. I think that's (i-Pr)3BO. The structure is a boron atom with three isopropyl groups attached. Isopropyl groups are like CH(CH3)2. So the molecule should have a trigonal planar geometry around boron? Wait, but since the substituents are all the same (three isopropyl), the molecule should have a high degree of symmetry.

Wait, but is it trigonal planar? Or maybe tetrahedral? No, wait, boron usually has three bonds. Triisopropyl borate would have a trigonal planar structure because it's like BX3, right? So trigonal planar would have D3h symmetry, perhaps? Or maybe C3v. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, trigonal planar structures belong to the D3h point group. Because they have a C3 axis, three mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. So D3h has higher symmetry than C3h. So if the molecule has D3h symmetry, then it wouldn't fit C
