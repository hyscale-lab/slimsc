Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

The question is about a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that these are point groups, which describe the symmetry of molecules. 

Let me list out what I know from the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C also reacts with water to reform A and two acids, F (strong) and G (weak).
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I need to figure out what E is, then determine its molecular symmetry.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. So, if A is a solid and B is a gas, maybe B is something that can react in a high stoichiometric ratio. For example, maybe B is a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2. Since the product C is bright red, that makes me think of something like sulfur trioxide (but that's more of a liquid) or maybe a compound with a lot of red color. Alternatively, perhaps C is a transition metal compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, bright red... maybe it's a product involving manganese or vanadium? Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, if B is Cl2, perhaps C is something like CCl4, but that's colorless. Hmm, I'm not sure yet.

Looking at reaction 2: C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. So, maybe E is something like phosgene (which is highly toxic), or another toxic gas. Phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, but I'm not certain.

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C reacts with water, it produces two different acids. Strong acid plus weak acid. For example, maybe C is a sulfite or something else. Wait, if C is something like SO3 (which is solid, I think?), reacting with water would give H2SO4 (strong acid) and maybe another acid? Or maybe C is a nitrate? Not sure.

Wait, let's think about D and B reacting to form H, a solvent. D and B in a 1:1 ratio. If B is O2, maybe D is something else. Or if B is Cl2, then maybe D is something that reacts 1:1 with Cl2 to form a solvent. For example, H2O reacts with Cl2 in certain conditions to form HClO, HCl, etc., but that's a bit more complex. Alternatively, D could be a diatomic gas like F2, but that's probably not a solvent.

Wait, another thought: D reacts with B to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents are like ethanol, water, acetone, etc. But since B is a
