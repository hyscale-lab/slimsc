Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are four different esters: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. Hmm, I remember that the structure of these compounds involves an ester group and a propenyl or butenyl group. The substituents on the double bond (cis or trans) will affect the NMR spectrum, so that should be key here.

The NMR data provided is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

I think breaking down each peak will help. Let's start by recalling the typical NMR signals for such esters.

First, the 2.1 ppm singlet (3H, s) is likely from an acetyl group (OAc) because the acetate's methyl group usually appears around 2.1 ppm as a singlet. So that makes sense.

Next, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is probably a methyl group attached to a double bond. Wait, in propenyl or butenyl esters, the structure is like CH2=CH- or CH2-CH2-CH2-, but wait, no, wait. Let me think. For a propenyl group, it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Or wait, no: propenyl esters could be CH2=CH-OAc, but no, wait, wait.

Wait, the propenyl group would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or maybe the structure is something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an allyl group. Hmm. Maybe I need to imagine the structure.

Wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl esters. So, propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2-OAc? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=
