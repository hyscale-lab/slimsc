Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, decay probability... Oh right, in radioactive decay, each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. I remember that this follows an exponential decay model. So the key here is the decay constant and figuring out the remaining probability.

Wait, so the initial statement says that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. So that means the decay constant lambda is such that the probability P(t) is 32% at t=100 minutes. The formula for the probability of decay by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). Oh wait, no, wait. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as the fraction remaining, which is e^(-λt). But here, the probability that the atom has decayed by time t is 32%, so that must be 1 - e^(-λt). Let me write that down.

So, according to that, 32% is 0.32. So,

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

Which means,

e^(-λ *100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

Take the natural log of both sides:

-λ *100 = ln(0.68)

So,

λ = - ln(0.6
