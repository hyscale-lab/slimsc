Okay, so I'm going to try to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, so I'll break it down into parts.

So, the problem talks about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

I think I'll start by identifying the possible substances involved here.

First, the gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, if the molecule is, say, H2O, the number of neutrons and protons would be different. Wait, but for each molecule, the total protons and neutrons are the same. Let me think: maybe the molecule is something like CO2? No, CO2 has 22 protons and 26 neutrons (assuming the carbon is 12, oxygen 16). Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule where each atom contributes equally so that the total is the same for protons and neutrons.

Wait, maybe the gas is CO2? Let me calculate. Carbon-12 has 6 protons, 6 neutrons. Oxygen-16 has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So CO2 would have 6+8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons would be 6 + 8*2 = 22. Oh wait, that's 22 each. So the molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that fits the condition. So gas W could be CO2.

Wait, another possibility is H2O. Let's see: H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (assuming H-1). O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So H2O has 2(1) + 8 = 10 protons, 2(0) + 8 =8 neutrons. Not the same. So that doesn't work. So CO2 is a possibility.

So if W is CO2, then what about the reaction? X reacts with Y to produce CO2, a precipitate, and possibly other products. Maybe Y is a carbonate, and X is an acid. Wait, but Y is a liquid. Common liquid acids include H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), HCl (but that's a liquid at higher concentrations), maybe H3PO4, etc.

Wait, but the precipitate G forms. So perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is an acid. When an acid reacts with a carbonate, it produces CO2 gas, water, and a precipitate if the carbonate is insoluble. Wait, but carbonate reacting with acid generally gives CO2, water, and the corresponding salt. If the salt is insoluble, it precipitates. So perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is an acid.

Wait, but the reaction is X reacts violently with liquid Y. So maybe X is a strong acid, and Y is a carbonate. The reaction would produce CO2, H2O, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it precipitates as G. Then, when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Let's see, 277 K is about 4°C. Which substances have a melting point around there? For example, water freezes at 273 K, which is 0°C. So 277 K is just a bit above, maybe something like ice melting, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid with a melting point just a bit above 0°C. Hmm, perhaps B is something like NaCl? No, NaCl melts at 801°C. Wait, that's way higher. Maybe something else.

Alternatively, if G is a carbonate salt, heating it might decompose it. Let's think: When carbonate is heated, it can decompose into CO2 and the metal oxide. For example, CaCO3 → CaO + CO2 upon heating. So if G is CaCO3, heating would produce CaO (which has a melting point around 2600°C, which is way higher than 277 K). That doesn't fit. So maybe the precipitate G is something else.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate is a sulfide? No, maybe not. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, maybe gas W is not CO2. Let me think of another possibility. Another possible molecule where the total number of protons equals the total neutrons. Let's see, what about CH4? Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's 12C), hydrogen has 1 each. So CH4 would have 6 + 4(1) = 10 protons and 6 +4(0) =6 neutrons. Not equal. So no.

What about C2H6? Protons: 2*6 +6=18. Neutrons: 2*(6) + 6*(0)=12. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: maybe the molecule is something like NH3. Let's see: N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (14N), H has 1 each. So NH3 would have 7 +3 =10 protons, and 7 +3*0=7. Not equal. No.

Wait, maybe the molecule is H2O. Wait, earlier thought was no, but let me recalculate. H has 1 proton each, O has 8. So H2O has 2+8=10 protons. Neutrons: O has 8, H has 0 (assuming H-1). So total neutrons 8. 10 vs 8, not equal. So no.

Wait, what about O2? O2 has two O atoms, each 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons 16, neutrons 16. So that would fit. So W could be O2 gas. But O2 is diatomic, so in the gas form, that makes sense. But does the reaction produce O2?

Hmm, but earlier I thought W is CO2, but perhaps O2 is a possibility. Let's think about where O2 might come from. Maybe the reaction is a decomposition.

Wait, the reaction is X reacting with Y. If Y is H2O, and X is something that reacts violently with H2O, like a metal. Wait, but if X is a metal, and Y is H2O, maybe the reaction produces H2 gas. But H2's molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, so protons 2, neutrons 0. Not equal, so that doesn't fit. So maybe not H2.

Alternatively, if the reaction produces O2, perhaps the reactants are something like H2O2, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe I should think of the precipitate. If the precipitate is a metal hydroxide, and upon heating, it decomposes. Let's say the precipitate is something like Mg(OH)2. When heated, it might decompose into MgO and water. But the melting point of MgO is very high, around 2800°C, which is way higher than 277 K (which is about 4°C). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is something else. Wait, perhaps the precipitate is a carbonate, but when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. But then B would be the metal oxide, which usually has a high melting point. So that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the gas. Maybe I should approach it from another angle, like the product of a keto acid with X containing two oxygen atoms.

Wait, the product of a certain keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. So the product is likely a salt, perhaps, where the acid donates a proton to X. So if the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), and X is a base. But wait, the reaction between an acid and a base usually gives a salt and water. So X might be a base.

Wait, but X is known to incorporate a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X has an isotope with a higher atomic mass. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's a close analog of another reagent. So maybe X is something like NaOH or KOH, which are strong bases and used as reagents.

Wait, but what if X is NaOH? Then, when it reacts with Y, which could be a carbonate, like Na2CO3, but Y is a liquid. Wait, Na2CO3 is a solid at room temp. Hmm.

Alternatively, Y could be a liquid carbonate, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe Y is a sulfuric acid solution. Wait, but if X is NaOH, then reacting with H2SO4 would produce Na2SO4, water, and perhaps a precipitate? Not sure.

Wait, but perhaps Y is a carbonate solution, but that's liquid only if it's in solution. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different substance. Maybe Y is a solution of a carbonate, but I'm not certain.

Wait, going back to the product after X reacts with a keto acid. The product has two oxygen atoms. So if X is a base, like NaOH, and the keto acid is, say, acetic acid, then the product would be sodium acetate, which has the formula CH3COONa. Each sodium acetate molecule has two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. So that fits.

So in this case, X is NaOH. So what's the reaction when NaOH reacts with a liquid Y?

Wait, but earlier in the problem, X reacts with Y to produce gas W. If Y is a carbonate, like K2CO3, but Y would have to be liquid. Alternatively, maybe Y is CO2? No, CO2 is a gas, not a liquid. Wait, but under certain conditions, CO2 can be a liquid, like dry ice is solid, but maybe if it's under pressure, it's a liquid. Hmm, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a sulfate, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the first reaction again. X reacts with Y, a liquid, to produce gas W (with equal protons and neutrons), precipitate G, and possibly other products.

If X is NaOH, then reacting with a carbonate solution would produce CO2 gas. So W would be CO2, which fits our earlier analysis where CO2 has equal protons and neutrons.

So the reaction would be:

2 NaOH + Na2CO3 → 2 Na2CO3? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, NaOH + Na2CO3 would produce NaCO3 (sodium carbonate) and water? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps Y is a metal carbonate, and X is a strong base. Hmm, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider the possible elements in X.

Wait, the problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X has two different isotopes of one element. For example, in NaOH, Na has isotopes like 23Na and 25Na. So 25Na is heavier. So if X is NaOH, it could have more of the heavier isotope.

Wait, but NaOH is a compound with Na, O, and H. The heavier isotopes would be in the Na or O. So the heavier isotope could be in the Na (like 25Na) or the O (like 18O).

But the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Wait, the elements present in X would be Na, O, H. So the lightest is H, atomic mass ~1. The heaviest is O or Na. Wait, Na is about 23, O is 16. So the heaviest element in X is Na. So cumulative atomic masses would be 1 (H) + 23 (Na) = 24.

Wait, but in the options, 25 is an option (option B) and 29 (option D). Hmm. Or perhaps I'm not calculating correctly.

Wait, the question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X".

Wait, the lightest element in X is H (atomic mass 1), the heaviest is Na (23). So 1 +23 =24. Hmm, but 24 isn't an option here. The options are 35,25,31,29. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps X is KOH instead of NaOH. Let's see. K has an atomic mass around 39. Then, the lightest is H (1), heaviest K (39). Sum is 40, but that's not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps X is something else. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 4°C. So what substance has a melting point around there? Perhaps B is water. But that doesn't make sense because water is a liquid at 277 K.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe B is a different compound. Wait, another possibility: perhaps B is solid CO2, but that's dry ice. But dry ice sublimates at -78°C, not 4°C.

Wait, maybe B is a metal oxide. For instance, if the precipitate G is a carbonate, and heating it produces CO2 and metal oxide. Wait, but earlier I thought metal oxides have high melting points.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think, maybe B is some kind of salt. Wait, another idea: maybe B is NaHCO3, but I'm not sure about its melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound.

Alternatively, maybe the precipitate G is something like magnesium hydroxide, which upon heating might lose water and form something else, but I don't think so. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the product of a keto acid with X having two oxygen atoms. So keto acid is something like acetic acid, which has the formula CH3COOH. When it reacts with a base like X (NaOH), the product is sodium acetate, which has two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion.

So X is a base, probably NaOH or KOH. Let's assume X is NaOH for now.

So X is NaOH, which includes Na, O, and H. Now, what about the reaction with Y?

If Y is a carbonate, like K2CO3, but that's a solid. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the reaction between NaOH and Y produces CO2. So Y could be a carbonate, but in a liquid form. Alternatively, Y could be CO2 itself, but that's a gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a bicarbonate, like KHCO3, but that's also a solid. Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a metal carbonate that's a liquid. Not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the possible substances X. The question says that X and its analogs are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So X could be something like sodium methoxide, or another strong base used in organic reactions.

Wait, another possibility: X is a hydroxylamine? Or perhaps it's something else. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal borohydride, but that seems a stretch.

Wait, let me think of the reaction again. X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W (with same protons and neutrons), precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B with melting point ~277 K.

If G is a carbonate salt, and upon heating, it releases CO2 and the metal oxide. But then B would be the metal oxide, which usually has a high melting point, which doesn't fit 277 K.

Wait, another thought: maybe G is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). When heated, it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But the melting point of Na2CO3 is around 842°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: what if the precipitate G is a hydroxide? Like Mg(OH)2. When heated, it might decompose into MgO and H2O, but again, MgO has a high melting point. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible elements in X.

The problem mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So perhaps X is a compound where one of the elements has a higher isotope. For example, maybe X is H2O, where one of the H atoms is deuterium (heavier isotope). But that's not a reagent in organic chemistry, perhaps.

Wait, but if X is H2O with a heavier isotope, like D2O (deuterium oxide), that's heavy water. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, but then the reaction of heavy water with a keto acid would produce something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a borohydride, like NaBH4, which is used in organic chemistry as a reducing agent. So NaBH4 has Na, B, H. The heavier isotope might be in H (deuterium), or B.

But the product of a keto acid (like a ketone) with NaBH4 would be the secondary alcohol. So the product would have more oxygen atoms, but the question says the product has two oxygen atoms. Wait, the product would be the alcohol, which has hydroxyl group, but I'm not sure about the oxygens.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another angle. Let's think about the cumulative atomic masses.

The problem says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. For example, if X has elements A, B, C, with A being the lightest and C the heaviest, then sum A's atomic mass and C's.

So, for X, let's say the elements are Na, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 1+23=24. But 24 isn't an option.

Wait, but the options are 35,25,31,29. So perhaps my assumption about X is wrong.

Wait, maybe X is KOH. K is about 39, O 16, H 1. So sum is 1+39=40, which is not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X has different elements. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or something else. But O2 doesn't fit with the other parts of the problem.

Wait, perhaps X is NH3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a halogen, like Cl2, but that doesn't fit the reagent part.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal hydride, like LiAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent in organic chemistry. So LiAlH4 consists of Li, Al, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (27). 1+27=28. Oh wait, 28 is not one of the options either.

Wait, but one of the options is 29 (option D). Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a nitride, like Mg3N2. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements like C, H, O. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is an amine. Let's say it's NH3. But when NH3 reacts with a liquid, what would happen? Maybe with water, but that's not a violent reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an alkali metal, like Na or K, which reacts violently with water. So if Y is water, X is Na metal. Let's think:

Na reacts with water (Y) to produce NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. But H2 is the gas. But earlier, the gas W has equal protons and neutrons. H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, which doesn't fit. So that's not possible.

Wait, but what if the gas W is O2. How would that happen? Maybe the reaction is a decomposition of some oxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a carbonate and a strong acid, producing CO2. But then X would be the acid, which is reacting with Y as carbonate.

Wait, perhaps X is sulfuric acid, which is a liquid. So if Y is a carbonate, like CaCO3, then X (H2SO4) would react with Y to produce CO2, CaSO4, and water. The precipitate G would be CaSO4 if it's insoluble, but I think CaSO4 is sparingly soluble. So maybe a precipitate forms.

Wait, but when CaSO4 is heated, it doesn't decompose at normal temperatures. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate G is something else. Maybe the reaction produces a metal hydroxide when X (acid) reacts with a carbonate. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction between X and Y is a neutralization reaction, producing a salt and water. So if X is a base and Y is an acid, their reaction produces a salt and water. But in that case, the gas W could be something else, like SO2 or CO2, depending on the acid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to make a table of possibilities for W.

Earlier, I thought W could be CO2 (protons 22, neutrons 22) or O2 (protons 16, neutrons 16). Another option is CH4? Wait, no, because earlier calculation showed it doesn't fit. Wait, what about N2? N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (14N), so N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that fits. So gas W could be N2.

How would that happen? Maybe the reaction is between a nitride and water, producing NH3 and N2 gas, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a nitric acid and a carbonate, producing CO2 and NO or N2. But that's more complicated.

Hmm. Another idea: if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, like H2SO4, then the reaction would produce CO2 gas. But then X would be the carbonate, which is a solid, not a liquid. So Y is liquid.

Wait, perhaps Y is a liquid acid, like H2SO4, and X is a carbonate, but then X would be solid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a liquid like ether, but I don't see how that would produce CO2.

Wait, another thought: what if the gas W is O2, and the reaction is a decomposition of H2O2 into H2O and O2 gas. So if Y is H2O2 (liquid), and X is a catalyst, perhaps like MnO2. But then X would be the catalyst, but I'm not sure if that fits the rest of the scenario.

Alternatively, if X is something else, like a metal, and Y is an acid, but I'm not making progress.

Perhaps I should look at the options again. The options are 35,25,31,29. These numbers are sums of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Let me think of possible combinations:

If the lightest element is H (1) and the heaviest is Cl (35.5), the sum is 36.5 → 36 (close to 35, option A).

If the heaviest is S (32), lightest H, sum is 33. Not an option.

If the heaviest is O (16), and the lightest H, sum is 17. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: maybe X is a compound containing O and F. For example, O has 16, F has 19. So sum is 1+19=20, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains K (39) and H (1), sum 40. Not an option.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the lightest and heaviest elements in X are O (16) and Na (23), sum 39. Not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, if X contains C (12) and O (16), sum 28 (no option). Or C and Cl: 12 +35=47 (no option).

Wait, perhaps the heaviest element is S (32), and the lightest is H (1), sum 33 (no option).

Wait, another thought: what if X is a compound with elements like C and O, but that's unlikely given the reagent context.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule, but I don't see how that would fit.

Wait, another angle: the product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So if the product is a salt like sodium acetate (CH3COONa), which has two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. Then X is NaOH, which has Na, O, H.

So elements in X are Na, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Not an option. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe another isotopic consideration. Maybe in X, one of the atoms is a heavier isotope. For example, in NaOH, Na could have a heavier isotope, like 25Na. But the atomic mass is based on the isotope's mass, so 25Na is 25. So the elements present are Na (25), O (16), H (1). So the lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (25). Sum 26. Not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the elements are O and F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe X is something like NH4Cl. Then elements are N, H, Cl. Lightest H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 36.5 → 36 (close to option A:35). But NH4Cl is a salt, not sure if it's used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Plus, how would it react with Y to produce gas W?

Alternatively, perhaps X is NH3. Elements N and H. Lightest H (1), heaviest N (14). Sum 15. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is something with elements like Cl and H, like HCl. Lightest H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 36.5→36. Close to option A:35. But HCl is a gas, not a reagent in this context perhaps.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the options again.

Options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Looking at the possible sums:

- If the heaviest is Cl (35.5) and the lightest H (1), sum is ~36.5 → 36. Close to option A (35).
- If the heaviest is Al (27) and lightest H (1), sum 28, not an option.
- If the heaviest is S (32) and lightest H (1), sum 33, not an option.
- If heaviest is Na (23) and lightest H (1), sum 24, no option.
- If heaviest is K (39) and lightest H (1), sum 40, no option.
- If heaviest is O (16) and lightest H (1), sum 17, no option.
- If heaviest is F (19) and lightest H (1), sum 20, no option.
- If heaviest is C (12) and lightest H (1), sum 13, no option.

Hmm, none of these sums match the options except option A (35), which is close to 36.5 (Cl and H). So perhaps the elements are Cl and H.

So X would have H and Cl as its elements. For example, HCl is a gas, but X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Alternatively, maybe X is CH3Cl (chloromethane), but that's a solvent, not a reagent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is NaCl. But NaCl is a salt. Wait, but if X is NaCl, then the elements are Na (23) and Cl (35.5). Sum 23+35.5=58.5. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with H, Cl, and another element. Maybe HOCl (hypochlorous acid), but I'm not sure about its reactivity.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Cl2, but that's a diatomic gas, not a reagent in this context.

Wait, another thought: what if the elements in X are O and Cl. So O (16) and Cl (35.5). Sum 51.5. Not an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So the product could be something like CH3COOH + X → CH3COO-R, where R is from X. So if X is NaOH, the product is sodium acetate, which has two oxygen atoms per molecule.

Wait, but earlier analysis of X being NaOH gives a sum of 24, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm wrong about X.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal borohydride, like LiAlH4. It's used as a strong reducing agent in organic chemistry. So elements are Li, Al, H.

Li has atomic mass ~7, Al ~27, H ~1. So the lightest is H (1), heaviest Al (27). Sum 28. Not an option.

Alternatively, maybe X is another borohydride, like NaBH4. Elements Na (23), B (11), H (1). Lightest H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Not an option.

Hmm. Another angle: perhaps the precipitate G is copper hydroxide, which when heated decomposes into copper oxide and water. Copper oxide has a melting point around 2000°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps B is something like ammonium chloride, which has a melting point of about 334 K. Wait, that's higher than 277 K. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is something like ice. No, ice's melting point is 273 K, which is very close to 277 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C, so ice would melt at 0°C, but maybe it's another compound close to that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is solid CO2, but it sublimes at -78°C.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate G is sodium carbonate decahydrate, which upon heating loses water and becomes anhydrous sodium carbonate. But the melting point of sodium carbonate is high.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The only option that seems to fit a possible sum is option A (35), which would be H (1) and Cl (35.5), giving a sum of about 36.5, which rounds to 35 (option A). Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 35, which could be from another combination.

Wait, another possibility: if X contains C and O. For example, CO (carbon monoxide). Then, the lightest element is C (12), but wait, O is 16. No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe X is a compound with C and O, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3OH (methanol), which is a reagent. Elements are C (12), H (1), O (16). Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So the product could be something like RCOOR', where R and R' are from X and the acid. So if the acid is acetic acid (CH3COOH), and X is something like ethanol, then the product would be ester with two oxygen atoms. But ethanol isn't known for incorporating a heavier isotope as part of its structure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base like NaOH, and the product is sodium acetate, which has two oxygen atoms. So back to X being NaOH.

So elements in X: Na (23), O (16), H (1). Sum lightest (H) + heaviest (Na) = 24. Not an option.

Wait, but perhaps X has other elements. Maybe X is a compound with C, H, O, and another element. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier, and the correct answer is option C)31.

Wait, 31 could be from O (16) and N (15), but that's not possible as O is 16.

Wait, another possibility: if X contains F (19) and H (1), sum is 20. Not an option.

Wait, maybe the heaviest is S (32) and lightest is H (1), sum 33 (not an option). Or Cl (35) and H (1), sum 36 (close to option A:35).

Perhaps the correct answer is A)35. So I'll go with that.


The problem involves identifying a substance X that reacts with a liquid Y to produce a gas W, a precipitate G, and a compound B. The gas W has a molecule where the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K (~4°C). Additionally, the product of X with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include CO₂ (22 protons, 22 neutrons) or O₂ (16 protons, 16 neutrons). CO₂ is more likely due to its relevance in reactions involving acids and carbonates.

2. **Reaction Between X and Y**: If X is a base (e.g., NaOH or KOH) and Y is a carbonate, the reaction would produce CO₂ gas, water, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it forms the precipitate G. Upon heating, G could decompose into a metal oxide and CO₂.

3. **Melting Point of B**: The melting point of B (~277 K) suggests it is a compound with a low melting point. However, typical metal oxides (e.g., Na₂CO₃, K₂CO₃) have much higher melting points, raising questions about the identity of B.

4. **Product with a Keto Acid**: The product of X with a keto acid (e.g., acetic acid) contains two oxygen atoms. For example, if X is NaOH, the product could be sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which fits this description.

5. **Elements in X**: X is likely a compound such as NaOH or KOH, which contains Na, O, and H. The lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1), and the heaviest is Na (atomic mass ~23) or K (atomic mass ~39). The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements must be calculated.

6. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**:
   - If X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23), O (16), and H (1). The lightest element is H (1), and the heaviest is Na (23). Their cumulative atomic mass is \(1 + 23 = 24\), which is not an option.
   - If X is KOH, the elements are K (39), O (16), and H (1). The lightest element is H (1), and the heaviest is K (39). Their cumulative atomic mass is \(1 + 39 = 40\), which is also not an option.

7. **Revisiting the Options**: The only option that aligns with the problem is **A) 35**, which could correspond to a compound containing H (1) and Cl (35.5). This suggests X might involve chlorine, though the exact identity of X remains unclear.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is **A) 35**, corresponding to the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (H) and heaviest (Cl) elements in X.
