Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is a bicyclic structure with two double bonds, right? The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. I remember that tert-butoxy is a bulky group, which might influence the reaction somehow.

Next, this compound is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, but wait, in the presence of a dihalide, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Oh, wait, dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups. So perhaps this is a 1,4-addition or some kind of cycloaddition? Or maybe a ring-opening or ring-forming reaction.

Wait, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. So each of those substituents is -CH2Br. But since it's two equivalents, maybe each equivalent contributes two groups? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the norbornene is undergoing an addition reaction.

Wait, another thought: when norbornene derivatives react with dienes, especially under certain conditions, they can undergo Diels-Alder reactions. But the diene here is cyclohexa-1,3-diene, which is a conjugated diene. But wait, the starting material has two double bonds itselfâ€”so maybe that's part of the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. The other molecule has two dienophile sites (since each dibromomethyl is a potential dienophile, but I'm not sure). Wait, but Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene and a dienophile. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the norbornene and the other diene.

Wait, but the other compound is 5,6-bis
