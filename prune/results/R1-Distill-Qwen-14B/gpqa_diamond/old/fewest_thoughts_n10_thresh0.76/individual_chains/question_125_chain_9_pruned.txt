Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². I remember that the harmonic oscillator is a standard problem in quantum mechanics, so I should probably recall what I know about its energy levels and eigenfunctions.

Wait, the question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degenerate states) for that energy. Right, the energy levels in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized, and each level depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

In a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each of the three dimensions. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think. The energy levels are actually E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), right? Or another way, since it's isotropic, it's E = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So n is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...), and each n corresponds to a different energy level.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me get that straight. For a 3D isotropic oscillator, the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers in each direction. So each of the n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers, and n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy depends on n, which is the total number of quanta in all three directions.

So the ground state corresponds to n=0 (all n_x, n_y, n_z = 0), first excited state is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3, right? Because the ground state is the lowest, and each excited state increases n by one.

Wait, the question says "third excited state." So ground is 0, first is 1, second is 2, third is 3. So for n=3, the energy is
