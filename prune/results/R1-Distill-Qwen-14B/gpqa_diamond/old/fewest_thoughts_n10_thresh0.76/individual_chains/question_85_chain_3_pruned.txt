Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I'm supposed to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have different masses and radii. Oh wait, and they're both in circular orbits. 

The question mentions the transit and radial velocity methods. I remember that transit method measures the dip in brightness as a planet passes in front of the star, which gives us the planet's size. Radial velocity detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull, giving mass info.

But the question is about equilibrium temperatures. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

Wait, but both planets have the same albedo, so that (1 - albedo) term will cancel out when taking the ratio. So I don't have to worry about that part.

The key variables here are the distance from the star (a), which is determined by the RV data. Because the RV method gives the mass and the orbital period, and from that, using Kepler's laws, we can find the semi-major axis (a).

Wait, but in the problem, they give shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 63
