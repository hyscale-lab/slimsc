Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question says we're mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, wait, neutralization usually involves an acid and a base reacting to form water and a salt. But here, there are two acids and one base. That's a bit tricky. Maybe I should figure out the overall reaction first.

Let me write down what each solution is:

- HCl is a strong acid. So when it dissociates, it gives H+ and Cl- ions.
- H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. Since it's a strong acid, it dissociates completely in the first ionization to H+ and HSO4^-. But wait, does it go further? Well, the second ionization of HSO4^- isn't as complete, but for concentrations in solution, maybe I should consider both H+ ions from H2SO4. But wait, in this case, how much H+ do we get? Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions because H2SO4 â†’ 2H+ + SO4^2- (I think that's true when it's a strong acid, but perhaps in reality, the second H+ doesn't fully dissociate. Oh, wait, but in this problem, I think it's okay to consider both H+ from H2SO4 since it's a strong acid, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll have to be careful with that.)

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. The formula for barium hydroxide is Ba(OH)2. When it dissociates, each unit gives Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So one mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH^- ions.

So the acids are HCl and H2SO4. The base is Ba(OH)2. When they mix, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH^- ions from the base.

Wait, but how much total H+ and OH- are there in each solution?

Let me calculate the moles of each acid and base.

First, HCl.

Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V =
