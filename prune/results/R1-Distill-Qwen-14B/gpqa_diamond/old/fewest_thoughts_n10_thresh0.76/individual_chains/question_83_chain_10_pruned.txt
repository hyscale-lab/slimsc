Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The question is about finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out the initial setup. The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Oh wait, yeah, because 20 + 20 is 40. So the concentration after dilution would be half, right? Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when the amount of solute is constant. So initial concentration is 0.05 M, volume doubles, so new concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, let me calculate that. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the volume is 0.04 L. So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point happens when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react completely. The moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001, so volume is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume. So that's 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Let me see what's happening at this point.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. So the moles of NaOH added would be 0.001 * 0.25 = 0.00025 moles. So moles of acetic acid remaining are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075, and moles of acetate formed are 0.00025.

But wait, when we mix 20 cm³ acetic acid with 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 4
