Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see what information I can extract.

So the problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually involves reactions like addition or maybe some kind of reduction. For example, alkenes can decolorize bromine water because of the addition reaction. So maybe mixture X has alkenes or something similar.

When mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which consists of two other liquids. Importantly, mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. So whatever Y is, it doesn't have the functional groups that react with bromine water. Maybe Y doesn't have double bonds anymore because if X had alkenes, hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bonds.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z is part of Y and is used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So Z must be something that's already saturated—like maybe an alkane, which can't be hydrogenated further because it's already fully saturated.

The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let me calculate what that corresponds to. The mass fraction is (mass of H)/(mass of Z) = 14.28%. Let's see, converting that percentage into a decimal, it's 0.1428.

Hydrogen's atomic weight is about 1.008 g/mol, and carbon is about 12.01 g/mol. Let's say Z has a formula of CnH2m. But since Z is a product of hydrogenation, maybe it's an alkane, which would have the formula CnH2n+2. Because alkanes can't be hydrogenated further.

So, if Z is CnH2n+2, the molar mass is (12n + 2n + 2) = 14n + 2 g/mol. The mass of H is (2n+2)*1.008.

Given that (mass H)/(mass Z) = 0.1428.

So:

[(2n + 2)*1.008] / (14n + 2) = 0.1428

Let me solve for n. Let's approximate 1.008 as 1.01 for simplicity.

(2n+2)*1.01 = 0.1428*(14n + 2)

Multiply both sides:

(2n+2)*1.01 = 2.00 (14n +2) * 0.1428

Wait, no. Let me compute the right side: 0.1428*(14n +2) = (14n *0.1428) + (2 *0.1428) = approx 2n + 0.2856.

So left side: 1.01*(2n +2) = 2.02n + 2.02.

Setting equation:

2.02n + 2.02 = 2n + 0.2856.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait no, wait, let me correct that.

Wait, 0.1428 is approximately 1/7, because 1/7 is roughly 0.142857... So maybe the fraction is exact as 1/7.

Let me rewrite the equation using 1/7.

So,

(2n + 2)*1.008 / (14n + 2) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by (14n + 2):

(2n +2)*1.008 = (14n + 2)/7.

Simplify the right side: (14n +2)/7 = 2n + (2/7).

So,

(2n +2)*1.008 = 2n + 2/7.

Let me compute left side:

1.008*(2n + 2) = 2.016n + 2.016.

So,

2.016n + 2.016 = 2n + 0.2857 (since 2/7≈0.2857).

Subtract 2n from both sides:

0.016n + 2.016 = 0.2857.

Subtract 2.016 from both sides:

0.016n = 0.2857 - 2.016 = -1.7303.

Wait, that's negative. Hmm, that can't be right. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps Z is not an alkane. Maybe it's a different structure. But wait, Z doesn't react with hydrogen further, which suggests it's fully saturated. So perhaps it's cyclopropane or something else, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me re-express this.

The mass fraction is (mass of H)/(mass of Z) = 14.28%.

So,

H mass = (number of H atoms) × 1.008.

Total mass of Z is (n×12.01) + (H ×1.008).

Let me write the equation as:

(H ×1.008) / (12.01n + H ×1.008) = 0.1428.

Let me denote the number of H atoms as h.

So,

( h * 1.008 ) / (12.01n + h *1.008 ) = 0.1428.

Let me rearrange:

h *1.008 = 0.1428*(12.01n + h *1.008 )

Expanding the right side:

h *1.008 = 0.1428 *12.01n + 0.1428 * h *1.008.

Let me subtract 0.1428 * h *1.008 from both sides:

h *1.008 - 0.1428 h *1.008 = 0.1428 *12.01n.

Factor out h *1.008:

h *1.008 (1 - 0.1428) = 0.1428 *12.01 n.

Compute 1 - 0.1428: that's 0.8572.

So,

h *1.008 * 0.8572 = 0.1428 *12.01 n.

Let me compute the left and right sides.

Compute 1.008 *0.8572 ≈ 1.008 *0.8572 ≈ 0.863.

Right side: 0.1428 *12.01 ≈ 1.716.

So,

h *0.863 = 1.716 n.

Divide both sides by 0.863:

h = (1.716 / 0.863) * n ≈ (1.987) n.

So,

h ≈ 2n.

Hmm, so h is approximately twice n, which makes sense. So, perhaps Z has a formula like CnH2n, but that would be an alkene. However, earlier thought was that Z is an alkane, which has 2n+2 H. Wait, this is conflicting.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about specific hydrocarbons. If Z is an alkane, like propane (C3H8), what's the mass fraction of H?

Mass of H: 8*1.008=8.064 g.

Mass of C3H8: (3×12.01) +8.064 =36.03 + 8.064=44.094 g.

So H fraction is 8.064 /44.094 ≈ 0.1827, which is about 18.27%, higher than 14.28%.

Another example: butane (C4H10). H mass=10 ×1.008=10.08.

Mass of C4H10: 4×12.01 +10.08=48.04 +10.08=58.12.

H fraction:10.08/58.12≈0.1734 (17.34%). Still higher than 14.28%.

Next, pentane (C5H12): H mass=12×1.008=12.096.

Mass of C5H12:5×12.01 +12.096=60.05 +12.096=72.146.

H fraction:12.096/72.146≈0.1675 (16.75%). Still higher.

Hexane (C6H14): H mass=14 ×1.008=14.112.

Mass of hexane:6×12.01 +14.112=72.06 +14.112=86.172.

H fraction:14.112 /86.172 ≈0.1637 (16.37%). Closer, but still higher.

Wait, maybe if I go higher. Heptane (C7H16): H mass=16 ×1.008=16.128.

Mass of heptane:7×12.01 +16.128=84.07 +16.128=100.2 g.

H fraction:16.128/100.2≈0.1609 (16.09%). Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. What if Z is not an alkane but something else, but wait, Z is a hydrocarbon. Since it doesn't react further with hydrogen, it must be fully saturated, so only single bonds. So an alkane.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial equation. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is CnH2n, but that would be an alkene, which would react with hydrogen, but the problem says Z doesn't react further. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the mass fraction is 14.28%, which is exactly 1/7. So 14.28% is 1/7. So perhaps Z has a formula where H is 1/7 of the total mass. Let me think of such hydrocarbons.

Let me denote the formula of Z as CnHm. Then,

(m × 1.008) / (12n + m ×1.008) = 1/7.

Cross-multiplying:

7m ×1.008 = (12n + m ×1.008).

7m *1.008 =12n + m *1.008.

Subtract m*1.008 from both sides:

6m *1.008 =12n.

Divide both sides by 6*1.008:

m = (12n) / (6 *1.008) )= (2n) / 1.008 ≈ (2n)/1.008 = approx 1.984 n.

So, m is approximately 2n. So the formula is CnH2n. But wait, that's an alkene, which would react with hydrogen. But Z doesn't react further, which suggests it's an alkane. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the approach. Let's think about possible hydrocarbons where the H mass is exactly 1/7 of total mass.

Suppose the formula is CnH2n. Then, let's compute the H fraction.

H mass = 2n *1.008 = 2.016n.

C mass =12n.

Total mass=12n +2.016n=14.016n.

H fraction=2.016n /14.016n =2.016/14.016≈0.1435, which is about 14.35%, close to 14.28%. So very close.

So, Z is CnH2n, which is an alkene. But wait, earlier thought said it's an alkane because it doesn't react further. But if Z is an alkene, then why doesn't it react further? Because maybe it's already hydrogenated as much as possible. Wait, but if you hydrogenate something with double bonds, you get an alkane. So if Z is an alkene, that would mean that when you hydrogenate mixture Y, you get Z, which is an alkene. But that can't happen because hydrogenation adds H2 across double bonds, turning them into single bonds. So perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, let me retrace the problem
