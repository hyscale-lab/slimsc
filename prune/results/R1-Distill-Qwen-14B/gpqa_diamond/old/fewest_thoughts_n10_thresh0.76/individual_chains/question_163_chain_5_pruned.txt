Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. They want to know the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to prepare this solution and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Right, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and a strong acid will react with it. So the reaction should be between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid. Since the acid is monobasic, like HCl or HNO3, which donate one H+ ion each.

First, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Let's calculate that. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So for Fe(OH)3, it's 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams is how many moles? Moles = mass / molar mass. So 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles, which is 9.36e-4 moles.

Fe(OH)3 reacts with a strong acid in a neutralization reaction. The reaction equation is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

Wait, but wait, since it's a monobasic acid, each molecule provides one H+. So for each Fe(OH)3, you need three H+ ions. So the stoichiometry is 1:3.

So moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 9.36e-4 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is moles / concentration. 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is close. But wait, is there any other consideration?

Wait, but Fe(OH)3 is a solid, and when you add the acid, it dissolves. So the volume of the acid is the minimum needed to react completely with Fe(OH)3.

Wait, but the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³. So does the acid volume contribute to the total? Or is the 100 cm³ the final solution?

Wait, the question says: "dissolve [...] in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution after dissolving will be 100 cm³. So the acid is added to the solution, but the total solution volume is 100 cm³.

Wait, no. Let me read again: "We would like to dissolve [...] in 100 cm3 total volume." So the total volume is 100 cm³, so the solution after dissolving is 100 cm³. So the acid is added, but the volume after mixing is 100 cm³. So the acid added (V) plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution (probably 100 cm³ minus V, but maybe it's negligible?), but maybe the initial volume is 100 cm³. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the solution is made by adding the acid to the Fe
