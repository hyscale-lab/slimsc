Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read through it again and think about what's going on.

The question is about a small peptidic compound synthesized chemically. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly right except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. The shifts are similar, integrals add up to 1H. They ruled out spin-spin coupling as the cause because the coupling pattern doesn't fit. So, what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Hmm, in NMR, each proton should be a single peak unless there's some sort of splitting. But they've ruled out coupling, so maybe it's not about neighboring protons. Another possibility is that the proton is in different environments. Wait, could it be due to some kind of isomerism?

Then there's the LC-MS part. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So same mass but different something? But same mass would mean same molecular weight. The same mass in MS suggests same molecular formula, which would be same molecule, right? Or maybe not. Wait, maybe it's a diastereomer or enantiomer. Because diastereomers have different physical properties, maybe they would separate on the LC. Enantiomers would have same physical properties except in chiral columns or something. But the question says the peaks are clearly defined and of equal intensity. Oh, but wait, if it's a racemic mixture, the two enantiomers might elute similarly because the column isn't chiral. Or maybe the LC is a normal column and can't separate them. Alternatively, if it's diastereomers, the column could separate them into two peaks.

Wait, but the NMR is showing two peaks for the same proton. So possible that it's diastereomers or enantiomers. Let's think about what each option says.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. That would mean another compound, but the NMR peaks would be different. The question says the NMR is consistent except for these two peaks. Plus, the MS would have different masses. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. In that case, in a regular column, the enantiomers would look like one peak because the column doesn't differentiate. Unless it's a chiral column. But the question says LC-MS shows two peaks. So if the LC is a chiral column, they would separate into two peaks. But if the NMR has two peaks for the same proton, that doesn't fit. Enantiomers have identical NMR properties because they're mirror images, so the NMR would show same peaks. But here, same alpha-proton is split into two. So maybe B isn't the case.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. I'm not sure about this. I think double coupling refers to when a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, but that would split each into multiple peaks, not two. Or maybe it's a problem during synthesis, like some sort of side reaction. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin, so maybe it's not about that
