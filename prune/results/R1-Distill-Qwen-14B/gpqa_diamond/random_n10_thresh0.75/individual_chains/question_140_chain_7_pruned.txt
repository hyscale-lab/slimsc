Okay, I'm going to try to work through this chemistry problem. It's a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Additionally, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

The goal is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A) 35, B) 25, C) 31, D) 29.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, let's think about substance X. It reacts violently with liquid Y. Common reactions like this could be metals reacting with acids. For example, sodium or potassium reacting with water. But wait, Y is a liquid, so maybe it's not water but another liquid. Alternatively, maybe Y is something like a strong acid, like sulfuric acid. But I'm not sure yet.

The gas W released has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Let's think about possible gases. If a molecule has equal protons and neutrons, maybe it's something simple. Wait, protons and neutrons are in the nucleus, so each atom contributes. But wait, the molecule as a whole has the same number of neutrons and protons. That is, the sum of all protons in the molecule equals the sum of all neutrons.

Wait, no. The question says the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So, each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons? Or the same number of each in the molecule? Wait, the wording is: "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So, for each molecule, the total number of neutrons equals the total number of protons.

So, for example, a molecule with 2 protons and 2 neutrons would satisfy this. Let's think: H2O has 2*(1 proton + 1 neutron) per H, and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's the common
