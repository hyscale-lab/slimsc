Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem has two reactions. The first one is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that NaCN is often used in nucleophilic substitution reactions. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. Oh wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it's usually an example of a nucleophilic addition. So, ketones can undergo addition reactions with nucleophiles like CN-.

Wait, but I think the addition of CN- to a ketone would form a cyanohydrin. Right, the cyanohydrin formation. The general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin. The mechanism involves the attack of the cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon, followed by protonation.

But in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which matches the product. So that makes sense.

Now, what conditions are needed for this reaction? I remember that the cyanide ion is a good nucleophile, but the reaction might need some acid catalysis. Because, the addition of CN- is usually done under acidic conditions. Or wait, maybe the reaction is done in a basic solution? Because in some cases, like the hydrolysis of nitriles, you use acid or base. Wait, no, for cyanohydrin formation, I think it's typically done under acid conditions.

Wait, but butanone is a ketone. The reaction of ketones with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions, usually requires a proton source. So perhaps the reaction is acid-catalyzed. So,
