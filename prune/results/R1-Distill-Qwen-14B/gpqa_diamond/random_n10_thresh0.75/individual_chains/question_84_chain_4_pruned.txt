Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, using matrix exponential functions approximated by fractional approximations.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. I remember that when solving PDEs like the heat equation, especially in higher dimensions, finite difference methods are often used. These methods convert the PDE into a system of equations, which is usually represented by a matrix. The solution then involves computing the matrix exponential, which can be tough for large matrices.

Wait, the question mentions converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. Parallel splitting methods... Oh right, I think this relates to techniques like the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method or others. These methods decompose the problem into smaller parts that can be solved independently, allowing for parallel computation.

Matrix exponential functions are used to solve systems of linear ODEs, which is what you get after discretizing the PDE. But calculating a matrix exponential directly can be computationally intensive, especially for large systems. So, approximating the matrix exponential is a way to make it more manageable.

Fractional approximation methods... I'm trying to recall. Fractional approximation is a way to approximate the exponential function using a rational function. Like, instead of e^A, you approximate it with a ratio of two polynomials, P(A)/Q(A), which is easier to compute, especially in parallel.

So the key factor is what allows this parallel processing. The options are A through D. Let me go through them.

Option A: Stability analysis. Stability is important in numerical methods to ensure that the errors don't grow uncontrollably. But I'm not sure how that directly relates to making the algorithm parallel. Maybe it's a red herring.

Option B: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal conditions might complicate the problem, but I don't see the direct link to parallelism here. Perhaps in some methods, but I'm not certain.

Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation. Hmm, the roots of the polynomial in the approximation. If the approximation uses a rational function, the roots might influence the stability or convergence. But how does that tie into parallel processing? Maybe not directly.

Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Oh wait, partial fraction decomposition is a way to break down a rational function into simpler fractions. If the approximation can be decomposed into partial fractions, each part could be computed in parallel. So for example, if you have e^{At} approximated by a sum of terms like (A + a_i)^{-1}, each (A + a_i)^{-1} can be computed independently, which fits into a parallel algorithm.

Wait, so if the fractional approximation allows the matrix exponential to be expressed as a sum of terms that can be computed separately, then each term can be handled in parallel. That makes sense. So the key is the linear partial fraction decomposition, which allows the algorithm to split into parallel steps.

Alternatively, in something like the ADI method, the time discretization is split into different directions, allowing each step to be computed in parallel. But here the question is about the matrix exponential approximation.

So the fact that the fractional approximation can be decomposed
