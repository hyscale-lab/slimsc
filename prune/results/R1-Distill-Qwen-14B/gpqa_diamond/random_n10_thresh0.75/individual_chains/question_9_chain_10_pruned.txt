Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let's break it down.

First, what does C3h symmetry mean? I remember that symmetry elements in molecules include things like axes, planes, etc. C3h sounds familiar. Oh right, it's the cyclic group with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule must have a three-fold rotational symmetry and also a mirror plane that's horizontal. 

Wait, wait. C3h is a point group. So the molecule's symmetry should belong to the C3h group. Let me recall what types of molecules have this symmetry. C3h is a lower symmetry than something like D3h, right? Because D has a higher symmetry with more elements.

Looking at the options, the molecules are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I need to figure out each molecule's structure and their symmetry.

Starting with option C: triisopropyl borate. I think that's (i-Pr)3BO, right? So it's a trigonal bipyramidal structure maybe? Wait, no, each isopropyl group is a substituent on a central boron atom. Wait, borate structure tends to be trigonal planar maybe. Hmm, but if it's triisopropyl, each substituent is an isopropyl group. So the boron is at the center with three identical groups. That would give it a trigonal planar geometry. So symmetry-wise, it would have a C3 axis because all three substituents are the same. But does it have a mirror plane?

If the molecule is symmetric across a plane, then it would have a mirror plane. For triisopropyl borate, each isopropyl is identical. So the structure should have a plane of symmetry. So the point group would be
