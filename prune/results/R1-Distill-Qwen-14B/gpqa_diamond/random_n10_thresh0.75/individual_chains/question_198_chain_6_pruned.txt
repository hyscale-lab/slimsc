Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt complexes among all the cobalt species.

Hmm, right, stability constants are involved here. I remember that the stability constant, β, measures how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more likely to form.

So, the Co(II) can form complexes with SCN- in different stoichiometries. The complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^?, wait, no, wait, wait. Let me think about the charge. Co(II) has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So for each complex, the formula would be [Co(SCN)_n]^{2 - n}.

Wait, the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^(2-n). So, for n=1: [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1), because 2 -1 =1. For n=2: [Co(SCN)₂]^0, because 2-2=0. For n=3: [Co(SCN)3]^–, and for n=4: [Co(SCN)4]^2–.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the charges. Let me make sure. The complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} would have Co^(2+) and each SCN is -1. So the charge is 2+ - n*(1-) ) = 2 - n. Right, so for n=1, it's [CoSCN]^+, n=2 is neutral, n=3 is -, n=4 is 2-.

But wait, all the thiocyanate is in solution, but in the problem, the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So the solution is SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, and the Co is 1e-2 M.

Wait, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So that includes all the species: free Co²+ plus all the complexes. So, the sum of all the [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) plus [Co²+] equals 1e-2 M.

But wait, the stability constants are given for each complex. Let me think about the complexes in terms of their formation.

The first complex is [CoSCN]^+, which has a stability constant β1 =9. Then β2=40 for the next, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^0. Then β3=63 for [Co(SCN)3]^–, and β4=16 for [Co(SCN)4]^2–.

Wait, but wait a second. Stability constants are typically written for each successive addition of a lig
