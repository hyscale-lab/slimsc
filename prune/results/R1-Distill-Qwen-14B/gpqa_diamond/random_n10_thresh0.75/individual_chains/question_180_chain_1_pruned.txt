Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm.

So the setup is: there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, right?

Wait, wait. Electric potential energy... I remember that when you have multiple charges, the potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble them. Since the system is isolated, the potential energy is calculated by considering each pair of charges and the work needed to bring them to their positions.

Each charge is 2e. So each charge has a magnitude of 2 times the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge q = 2e = 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, the system has 13 charges. But one is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. Let me think: the charge at P is fixed, so when we bring the other charges into place, we have to consider their interactions with the fixed charge and with each other.

But wait, in calculating the potential energy of the system, we consider each pair once. So for the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 charges, there's an interaction. And then, between
