Okay, so I've got this physics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinities that pop up in calculations. So the idea is that these theories often have these infinities, and regularization is a way to handle them, maybe by introducing some cutoff or other methods. But some theories might not need this because they are either free from such divergences or have a different structure.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything. It deals with high energies because it incorporates gravity and is supposed to work at all scales. But wait, string theories usually require a lot of mathematical machinery, like supersymmetry, and they might still have their own kinds of divergences. Or maybe because they're based on strings instead of point particles, the divergences are softer or absent. Wait, I'm not so sure. Alternatively, string theories might require different kinds of 'regularization' through things like the introduction of a string length scale, but I'm not certain if they never need it. I'll have to keep this in mind.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory with gluons and quarks. I know that QCD calculations often involve issues like Landau poles, which are problems where the coupling becomes infinite at some high energy scale. To handle these, people use techniques like dimensional regularization or other methods. So QCD does require regularization. So B is not the answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. I remember that QED does have divergences, especially in loop calculations. For example, the calculation of electron mass and charge leads to infinities. But QED is renormalizable, which means that despite the divergences, the theory can be made finite by absorbing the infinities into physical parameters like mass and charge. However, regularization is a step in the renormalization process. So QED does require regularization. So option C is not the correct answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't involve the same kind of infinities that quantum theories do. In classical E&M, like Maxwell's equations, do you have any issues with divergences? Well, in classical theory, the fields can become singular at point charges, but those are more about the mathematical representation rather than physical divergences in calculations. Also, in the context of regularization, which is a quantum field theory concept, classical theories don't really require it because they don't have the same divergent integrals. So if the question is about which theory doesn't need regularization, maybe D is the right choice.

Wait, but wait. The question is about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So let me think about each theory's behavior at high energies.

In QED, when
