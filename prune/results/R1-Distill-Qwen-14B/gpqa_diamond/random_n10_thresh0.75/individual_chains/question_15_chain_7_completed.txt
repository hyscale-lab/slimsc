Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh wait, right, the probability formula has something to do with the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. The formula for orbital period is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the mass of the planet is much smaller than the star, we can approximate M as the star's mass. So, P is proportional to a^(3/2) divided by sqrt(M). 

Wait, in this case, Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. So even though Planet_1's period is three times shorter, let's think about the actual orbital radius. Kepler's third law says P² ∝ a³/(M). Let me write it down.

For Planet_1: P1 = 3 * P2. Wait no, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter, so P1 = P2 /3. Because if Planet_2 has a longer period, it's farther out.

So for the orbital radius: using P² = (4π²/G M) a³. Let's ignore constants and just write P² proportional to a³/(M). So for each planet:

P1² = (a1³) / (M1) 

P2² = (a2³) / (M2) 

M1 is twice M2, so M1 = 2 M2.

And P1 = P2 /3.

So, substituting:

(P2/3)^2 = (a1³) / (2 M2) 

And P2^2 = (a2³) / M2.

Divide the first equation by the second to eliminate M2 and P2:

[(P2²/9) / (a1³/(2 M2))] / [P2²/(a2³ / M2)] ] = (a2³/(9 * 2 M2)) * (M2/(a1³)) ) * (something cancels?)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to take the ratio of a1 to a2.

From the first equation: P1² * M1 = a1³ / k (where k is a constant). Similarly, P2² * M2 = a2³ / k.

Divide the two:

(P1² * M1) / (P2² * M2) ) = (a1³ / a2³)

Substitute P1 = P2 /3, M1 = 2 M2:

( (P2²/9) * 2 M2 ) / ( P2² * M2 ) ) = (a1³ / a2³ )

Simplify numerator: (P2² * 2 M2) /9 
Denominator: P2² M2 

So the ratio is (2 /9) /1 = (2/9) = (a1^3)/(a2^3)

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) 

Let me calculate 2/9 is about 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6. Let me check, 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter period.

Now, the probability of a transit depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star's size. The formula I remember is that the probability P is roughly (R_*) / (a), where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis. But wait, actually, the exact formula is something like (R_*)/(a) * (something else?), but I think for a circular orbit and edge-on alignment, the transit probability is proportional to (R_*)/(a * AU) ?

Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a), because the area the planet can block is a chord of the star's disk. The probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the square of the orbital distance (but I'm getting a bit fuzzy here).

Wait, I think the probability is approximately (R_*) / (a), but it's actually a function of the impact parameter. The transit probability is given by (R_* / a) multiplied by something else, but I might be mixing it up.

Another approach: The transit probability is given by the formula P ≈ (R_*/a) / (1 + (R_*/a)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another source says the geometric probability is (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_*/a))^-1, but I might need to think differently.

Wait, maybe I should remember the formula correctly. The geometric probability of a transit is (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_*/a))^-1. But when R_* is much smaller than a, this approximates to (R_*/a). So in this question, since the stars have the same radius, R1 = R2, perhaps?

Wait, the problem states that both host stars have the same radii. Oh yes, that's given. Both stars have the same radius, R. So R1 = R2 = R.

So the transit probability for each planet would be proportional to (R/a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

So we can compare the probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2 by the ratio (R/a1) divided by (R/a2) ) → (a2)/(a1).

Because P1 ∝ R/a1, P2 ∝ R/a2. So the ratio P1/P2 = (R/a1)/(R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

From earlier, a1 ≈0.6 a2 → a2/a1 ≈ 1.6667. So P1 is about 1.6667 times P2.

Wait, that can't be right because if a1 is smaller than a2, R/a1 is larger than R/a2, so Planet_1 would have a higher probability.

Wait, let me see again. a1 is 0.6 a2. So a2 is (5/3) a1. Because 0.6 is 3/5, so a1 = (3/5) a2 → a2 = (5/3) a1.

So (R/a1) = (R) / a1 = R/(0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) (R/a2) ≈ 1.6667 (R/a2).

So the probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.6667 times higher than that for Planet_2.

Wait, no. Because the transit probability is (R/a). So P1 = R/(a1), P2 = R/(a2). So the ratio P1/P2 = a2/a1.

We have a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.6 a2. So a2/a1 ≈1.6667. So P1 is 1.6667 times P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher than that for Planet_2. Therefore, they would prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher chance of transiting.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times. Wait, 1.6667 is about 1.67, which would be close to 1.65 as in option C. So the correct option would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the earlier steps. Because if a1 is 0.6 a2, then a2 is larger than a1. So R/a is larger for a1, so R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So P1 = R/a1, P2 = R/a2 → P1 > P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so they should choose Planet_1.

So looking at the options, which one says Planet_1 is preferred with a factor close to 1.67?

Option C says 1.65 times higher. That's very close.

So the answer should be option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the orbital distance \( a \).

### Step 1: Orbital Distance Ratio
Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M \) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1, \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (since its period is three times shorter), and \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as that of Planet_2). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_1}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3}{M_1} \cdot \frac{M_2}{a_2^3}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2M_2} \cdot \frac{M_2}{a_2^3}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}
\]

\[
a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9}a_2^3
\]

\[
a_1 = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}a_2 \approx 0.6a_2
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \) is approximately 0.6 times \( a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since \( R_* \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of the probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

From \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \), we find:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.6a_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.67 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The probability ratio is not 1.5 times but closer to 1.67.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability is approximately 1.65 times higher, which is consistent with the calculated value.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The probability ratio is not 2.7 times but closer to 1.67.

### Final Answer
Planet_1 is preferred due to its approximately 1.65 times higher probability of transiting.
