Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics; you have to consider special relativity. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, the relative speed part. Oh right, when you're calculating the speed of one object relative to another in relativity, you can't just subtract the velocities like in classical mechanics. You have to use the velocity addition formula. Right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but I need to make sure I get the signs right. 

Wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed would be the difference in their velocities divided by (1 minus the product of their speeds divided by c squared). Let me write that down.

So astronaut A's speed is u = 0.6c, and astronaut B's speed is v = 0.5c. I think the relative speed of A from B's frame would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Plugging in the numbers: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me calculate the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So relative speed is (0.1c)/(0.7) = (1/7)c, approximately 0.1428c. Wait, but wait, is that the correct formula? Because sometimes when you're moving relative to each other, you have to think about which frame you're in. Oh, right, because astronaut A is moving faster than astronaut B, so from B's perspective, A is approaching at a certain speed.

Alternatively, another way to think: if you're in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference, but adjusted by the Lorentz factor. So using
