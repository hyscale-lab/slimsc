Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem here. It's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let's see, the question says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its concentration changes, which affects the pH. Then during titration, the pH changes based on where you are in the titration curve.

First, let me think about the initial solution after dilution. The original acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. When I add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration would be half because the volume doubles. So 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. The moles of acetic acid are Molarity x Volume in liters. Oh wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. When I add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Right, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when you titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O. 

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the initial moles of acetic acid: 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. So NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question isn't about equivalence directly yet. It's about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume is 10 cm³ * 0.25 = 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, wait. No, I think at 25% of the equivalence point, you're 25% of the way to the equivalence. So the volume added is 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. So yes, 2.5 cm³.

But wait, let me double-check. The equivalence is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So 25% titration means 25% of that volume is added. So yes, 2.5 cm³.

Hmm, so for the 25% point, I need to calculate the pH at that point. Let's think about the situation. At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The solution will contain both acetic acid and its conjugate base, so it's a buffer solution. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

First, find pKa. Given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → log(1) is 0, so log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → about 0.267 + (-5) → -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73.

Now, for the 25% titration: how much of each species do we have?

Let me think about the moles. Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 moles. At 25% titration, NaOH added is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles. So it reacts with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid
