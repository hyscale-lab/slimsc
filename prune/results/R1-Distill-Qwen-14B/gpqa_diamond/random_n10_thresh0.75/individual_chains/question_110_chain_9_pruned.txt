Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and the spectrographs that can detect them. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question asks which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I remember from the question that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can see brighter than 16 mag. So, the star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh, wait, no, wait. Wait, when you say "brighter than 17 mag", that's actually dimmer because lower magnitudes are brighter. Hmm, wait noâ€”apparent magnitude works such that lower numbers mean brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because, like, the scale is weird. For example, the Sun is about -26.74, so brighter. So, if something is brighter than 17, its apparent magnitude is less than 17.

Wait, the question says: for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, their apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 17. Because they can observe stars brighter than (i.e., with lower apparent mag) 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than (apparent V mag) 16. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent magnitude must be less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than 16 (for HIRES). Wait, no. Wait, wait, wait. Because for both, they can observe stars brighter than those magnitude thresholds. So, for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent magnitude must be less than both 17 and 16. So, less than 16. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's automatically brighter than 17. So, only stars with apparent V mag less than 16 can be observed by both.

Wait, but wait, because the question says "brighter than
