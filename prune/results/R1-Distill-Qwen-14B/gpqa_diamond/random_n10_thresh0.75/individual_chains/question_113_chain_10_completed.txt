Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbon atoms but varying in hydrogen and oxygen counts. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of data provided.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So maybe the compound has an alcohol group (-OH) or perhaps a carboxylic acid. But wait, the question mentions two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are important. 

The 1700 region in IR is typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like conjugated double bonds). Wait, but 1650 is a bit lower than a typical aldehyde or ketone. Maybe it's an ester or maybe an amide? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugated substituents.

Then, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond, perhaps in an alkene group or maybe part of a ring system.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: 45 could be from a methyl group attached to something, but more likely, it's a fragment that includes a functional group. Maybe a (CH3)2CO group (like acetone) would lose some parts to form a fragment. Alternatively, 45 could correspond to a CH3CO+ ion, which would be a fragment from an ester or ketone.

Now, let's consider the possible structures based on the options. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation for each formula to see what functional groups we might expect.

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since none of the formulas have X or N, it's (2C + 2 - H)/2.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6. H=12. So DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, if O is present, maybe that's a carbonyl.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=(14-10)/2=2. Again, two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=(14-12)/2=1. One degree.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So the compound must have at least one double bond, which would account for at least one DoU.

Now, let's think about the IR data again. The broad peak at 3000 is likely an O-H group. The 1700 and 1650 could be two carbonyl groups. Wait, but that's a bit unusual because two carbonyl groups would require the molecule to have two C=O bonds. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring with conjugation.

But another thought: 1700 is a strong carbonyl, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring, like in a conjugated system, such as in an aromatic ester or something. Or maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl system. That would explain the IR at 1650, which is lower than a regular carbonyl because of conjugation.

Wait, if the 1700 is a carbonyl and the 1650 is an aromatic ring, that would fit a structure like an aromatic ester (maybe a phenyl group attached to an ester). Alternatively, it could be a ketone with an adjacent double bond, like a ketone and an alkene.

The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests an alkene group, so maybe the molecule has both a carbonyl and an alkene.

Also, considering the O-H stretch in IR, which could be from an alcohol or perhaps a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H peak, maybe even stronger. But the question says a very broad absorption, which can fit either. However, another thing to consider is that if the O-H is an alcohol, it would be less acidic and the peak might be broader but not as strong as a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or another group, but O-H in an ester isn't likely. Wait, esters don't have O-H groups. So maybe the O-H is from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait. The IR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Let me think about which functional groups these could be. 1700 is a carbonyl. 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching) or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl group, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Or maybe it's a carbonyl with conjugation to another group.

So, for example, if the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond, then the IR would have a strong peak for the ester carbonyl at 1700, and the 1650 could be the conjugated C=C (as in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester). Alternatively, the 1650 could be a carbonyl from a ketone adjacent to a double bond. Hmm.

But looking at the NMR, vinyl hydrogens suggest a double bond. So let's think: the structure could be something like an ester with a conjugated double bond, or perhaps a ketone with an adjacent double bond.

Wait, but the options have varying O counts. Let's consider the possible functional groups.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation 1. So one ring or a double bond. If O2, maybe an ester (which has two oxygen atoms) and a ring? Or an ester and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU 2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. Since the NMR has vinyl H, that suggests a double bond.

Let me think about possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: could be an ester with a ring (like a cyclic ester, which is a lactone), but that would have a ring and an ester. Or maybe a benzene ring with a substituent, but wait, with six carbons, benzene would account for six, so the substituent would be a single group, perhaps an ester. Alternatively, a di-ester. But C6H12O2: molecular formula would fit something like methyl cyclohexanoate or similar.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation 2. So could be two rings, which is unlikely, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But with O2, maybe a diester (but that would require more oxygen?), or perhaps an ester and an alkene. Or perhaps a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1700, which is a strong carbonyl, so probably an ester. If it's an ester, then O2 makes sense (since esters are R-O-CO-O-R). Wait, no, esters have two oxygen atoms in the functional group. So a simple ester would contribute two O atoms. So if the formula has O2, that could fit.

But let's go back to the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z 45. What fragments correspond to 45? Let's think about possible ions.

45 could be CH3CO+ (acetone ion, m/z 45), or maybe (CH3)2CO+ (but that's 58?), no. Wait, 45 can also be from a methyl group attached to something else. Or maybe a cleavage in an ester group.

Wait, let me think. The molecular ion could break into different fragments. For example, if the molecule is an ester, it could lose the ester group as a fragment. Alternatively, in an ester, the cleavage could occur between the carbonyl and the oxygen, leading to a fragment that is the RCOO- part. But I'm not exactly sure.

Another approach: think about the molecular formula and possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structure: methyl cyclohexanoate. For example, cyclohexanoic acid methyl ester. The structure would be OMe attached to a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl. That would have a ring (so a double bond equivalent), the ester carbonyl. But DoU would be 1 (the ring), but the ester carbonyl is another DoU. Wait, no. Wait, DoU is calculated based on the formula, not the structure. So for C6H12O2, DoU is 1. So that suggests one ring or one double bond or a combination adding up to one. Wait, but an ester has a carbonyl, which is a double bond. So if the compound has an ester and a ring, that would account for two DoU. But the formula's DoU is 1. So that suggests that the structure would have either a ring or a double bond but not both. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, which is a lactone. A six-membered ring lactone (like gamma-caprolactone) would have a ring (so one DoU) and a carbonyl (another DoU), but the formula would have a higher DoU. Wait, but the formula for gamma-caprolactone is C5H8O2, which is DoU (2*5 +2 -8)/2= (12-8)/2=2. So that would have two DoU. So if the formula is C6H12O2, which has DoU 1, that suggests only one double bond or ring.

Hmm, maybe it's a substituted ester without a ring. Wait, but then the DoU would be 1, which is the carbonyl. So perhaps the structure is an ester with a single double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Let's see: for example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. The formula for that would be C4H6O2. But our options are C6H10O2, etc. So maybe a similar structure but longer. Let's think: if the ester is a substituted acrylate, like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is something with three carbons, maybe.

Alternatively, could it be a benzene ring with an ester substituent? But benzene has three DoU (a ring with three double bonds). So if the formula is C6H10O2, that would have DoU (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. Benzene is three DoU, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps it's not a benzene ring but something else.

Wait, let's look at the NMR. Vinyl hydrogens are present, so an alkene is definitely there. So the structure must have a double bond.

So for the IR data: O-H (broad), carbonyl (1700), and another peak (1650) which could be the C=C in the alkene.

Wait, but in conjugated systems, the C=C stretching can be lower than 1680 or so. So if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the C=C would be around 1650, and the carbonyl would be around 1700. That makes sense.

So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is another group. Let's see what the molecular formula would be.

Let's take for example, the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's too long. Let me compute:

CH2=CHCOO- would be C3H4O2. Then, adding R as CH2CH2CH3 would make it C6H10O2. Wait, let me check: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 is C6H10O2. So the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C). That fits.

But wait, let's check the IR and the other data.

In this structure, the ester would have a carbonyl at ~1700 cm⁻¹. The C=C from the double bond would be at ~1650. The O-H would be from where? Wait, wait a minute. In this structure, there's no O-H group. Oh, wait, that's a problem. Because the IR shows a broad peak around 3000, which suggests an O-H group.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake here. The structure I was thinking of (ester with a double bond) doesn't have an O-H group, but the IR indicates an O-H.

So perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid ester with an alcohol group? No, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the compound has both an ester group and an alcohol group. For example, a glycol ester, but that would require more oxygen atoms. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol with an ester group? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the O-H could be from a hydroxyl group attached to the molecule, such as in a phenol. But phenol's O-H is a broad peak, around 3300-3000 cm⁻¹. Wait, but the IR here is 3000, which is a very broad peak. Phenols have broad O-H peaks. So perhaps the structure includes a phenolic -OH group.

But wait, if the formula is C6H10O2, and the structure is a phenol ester, that might make sense. For example, phenyl propionate. Let's see: phenyl group (C6H5) attached to an ester group. But wait, the formula for phenyl propionate would be C6H5COOCH2CH2CH3. That would be C9H10O2. Which is more than the options given. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with an alcohol group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is part of a hemiacetal or acetal structure, but I'm not sure how that would fit with the other data.

Alternatively, could the O-H be part of a ketone? No, that doesn't make sense. O-H is more likely from an alcohol, phenol, or carboxylic acid.

Wait, if the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, that would explain the broad peak. But then, the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak would be the carboxylic acid's carbonyl. But carboxylic acids have broad O-H peaks, which fit the description.

But wait, the IR also has a peak at 1650. If it's a carboxylic acid, perhaps the molecule has a conjugated double bond. For example, a substituted acrylic acid.

So, the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOH. But that would be C3H4O2. Our options are C6H10O2, which is a bigger molecule. So perhaps it's a longer chain with a double bond and a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. But then, the formula would have O2. Let's see: for hex-4-enoic acid, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCOOH. But the formula would be C6H10O2. Yes, that fits option C.

Wait, hex-4-enoic acid would be CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCOOH, which is C6H10O2. The IR would show a broad O-H (carboxylic acid) at ~3000 cm⁻¹, a strong carbonyl around 1700 (carboxylic acid), and the C=C double bond at around 1650 (as it's conjugated with the carbonyl). That fits the IR data.

But wait, the NMR would have peaks for vinyl hydrogens. In this structure, the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5 (if counting from the COOH group). So the vinyl hydrogens would be the CH2 groups attached to the double bond. But in hex-4-enoic acid, the double bond is between C4 and C5, so the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-COOH? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me structure it correctly.

Wait, hex-4-enoic acid would be CH2CH2CH2CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that's not right. Let me structure it correctly. Wait, the correct structure would be CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait, the correct structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂COOH. No, let me correct that. For hex-4-enoic acid: the chain is six carbons, with the double bond starting at C4. So the structure is: CH₂CH₂CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with the double bond between C4 and C5. Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure would be CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-COOH? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂COOH. That would be 4-pentenoic acid, not hex. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. For example, a substituted acrylic acid ester with an alcohol substituent.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are usually split into certain patterns. For a double bond in an ester like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the vinyl protons would be deshielded and show up around 5-6 ppm, maybe as a doublet or triplet depending on substitution.

But let's get back to the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z 45. If the molecular ion breaks off a fragment of 45, what would that correspond to? For example, if the molecule is CH₂=CHCOO-R, then when the ester group breaks off, perhaps the R group could be something that upon cleavage would form a 45 m/z fragment.

Wait, another thought: the 45 m/z could be from the loss of a (CH3)2CO group, which is acetone (45). So if the molecule loses a methyl group with a carbonyl, that would leave a fragment at 45. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion breaks into something like CH3CO+ (which is 45).

So, for example, if the molecule is an ester like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, then upon fragmentation, it might lose the ester oxygen and form a CH2=CHCOO+ and a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, but the mass of CH2=CHCOO is 73 (C3H4O2: 3*12 +4*1 +16*2=36+4+32=72). Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, molecular weight of CH2=CHCOO- is (3 carbons: 3*12=36) + (4 H:4) + (2 O:32) = 36+4+32=72. So that's 72. But the fragment is 45. Alternatively, if the molecule is a di-substituted ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Let's think of gamma-butyrolactone, which is a cyclic ester with four carbons. But our compound has six carbons. So maybe a six-membered lactone. The structure would be a six-membered ring with an ester linkage, so O in the ring. If the lactone has a double bond, that could account for the vinyl hydrogens. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options.

Option C is C6H10O2.

The molecular weight would be 6*12 +10*1 +2*16=72+10+32=114 g/mol.

If the molecular ion breaks into a fragment of 45, perhaps the rest is 114-45=69. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a part of the molecule. For example, the (CH3)2CO group (acetone) has a molecular weight of 58 (but wait, (CH3)2CO is (3*12) + (6*1) + (16) = 36 +6 +16=58). Hmm, but the fragment is 45. That doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the molecule has a methyl group attached to something. For example, if the molecule breaks off a CH3 group, the remaining would be 114-15=99. Not sure.

Another thought: the mass spectrum peak at 45 could be the molecular ion of a smaller fragment, perhaps from a substituted acetic acid. For example, if the molecule is CH2=CHCOOH, the molecular ion would be 99 (C3H4O2: 3*12+4+32=36+4+32=72). Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, 3 carbons: 3*12=36, 4 H:4, 2 O:32. Total 72. So a fragment of m/z=72 would be the molecular ion of that. But the question has a fragment at 45, so maybe it's from a different part.

Wait, maybe the molecule is an ester where the R group is CH2CH2CH3, and the other part is CH2=CHCOO-. So the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. The molecular weight is (3 carbons from ester) + (3 from R) = 6 C, 10 H, 2 O. So molecular formula C6H10O2, which is option C.

Now, when this ester breaks, perhaps it loses the R group (CH2CH2CH3) as a fragment. The R group would have a molecular weight of 72 (C3H7O: no, wait, R is CH2CH2CH3, which is C3H7. Wait, but in the ester, it's O-CO-O-R. So the R is CH2CH2CH3. So the molecular weight of the ester is (3 from COO) + (3 from R) = 6 C. Let's calculate the molecular weight of CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3:

CH2=CHCOO: that's C3H4O2 (3*12=36, 4 H=4, 2O=32 → 72)
OCH2CH2CH3: that's C3H7O (3*12=36, 7 H=7, 16 → 6*12=72? Wait, wait, the entire ester is C6H10O2.

So the molecular weight is 114. If the fragment is at 45, maybe the molecule breaks at the ester oxygen, releasing the R-O- group as a fragment. So the R is CH2CH2CH3. Its molecular weight is 3 carbons (36) +7 H (7) + oxygen (16) → 36+7+16=59. But the fragment is 45, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks off the ester group as a fragment of 72 (CH2=CHCOO- would be 72) and the R group as 42 (since 72 +42=114). Wait, 42 is the molecular weight of the R-O group, which is CH2CH2CH3O. Wait, CH2CH2CH3O would be C3H7O: 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16 → 36+7+16=59. Not 42.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about another approach. Let's think about the molecular formula and possible structures again.

Option C is C6H10O2. Possible structures: an ester with a double bond (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester) and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure might be a carboxylic acid, but that didn't fit with the ester O.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a di-substituted ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the O-H in the IR could be from an alcohol group, not a carboxylic acid. So, for example, the structure could be an ester with an alcohol group. But that would require more oxygen, perhaps O3. But our options don't have O3. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a hemiacetal or acetal, but that's more complex.

Wait, let's think about the NMR data. Vinyl hydrogens are present, which suggests a trans or cis double bond. Also, the presence of such hydrogens could be in a conjugated system, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

So, putting it all together, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an alcohol group. But how?

Wait, perhaps the structure has both an ester group and a hydroxyl group on the same chain. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. But that would have formula C6H10O3, which isn't an option here.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options again.

Option C: C6H10O2.

The DoU is 2. So, two rings, one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

Considering the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are from a double bond, and the IR has a carbonyl and another peak, perhaps the structure has a ring plus a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a ring. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows a peak at 1650 cm⁻¹. That could be a conjugated carbonyl, such as in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The 1700 is the ester carbonyl, and 1650 is the conjugated C=C.

So, structure: an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would have the formula CnH2n-2O2. Let's compute for n=6: C6H10O2. Yes, that fits option C.

So, the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is CH2CH2CH2 (so that the total is C6). So R would be CH2CH2CH3. So the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

But wait, that's C6H10O2. Let me check the formula:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 → 3 carbons (CH2=CHCOO) + 3 (CH2CH2CH3) = 6 C.

Hydrogen: CH2=CHCOO has 4 H (CH2 has 2, CH has 2, O has none). CH2CH2CH3 has 7 H. Wait, CH2=CHCOO is CH2=CH-CO-O- which is CH2=CHCOO- → that's 3 carbons, and O. So, the ester would be:

CH2=CHCOO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So R' is CH2CH2CH3, and R is CH2CH2CH2- with a double bond? No, wait, perhaps R is CH2=CHCOO- and the other R' is CH2CH2CH3. So the ester is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

So the formula is C6H10O2, which is option C. Let's verify the hydrogen count:

For CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

Breaking it down:

CH2=CH- (2 H on CH2, 2 H on CH, but wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

Each CH2=CH group has 2 H on each CH2 and 1 H on CH (but wait, CH2=CH is CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, wait, CH2=CH has CH2 connected to CH with double bond. So each group has 2 H on CH2 and 1 H on CH. So, for CH2=CHCOO: the CH2=CH has 3 H (CH2 has 2, CH has 1) but then the COO has no H. Wait, perhaps I need to recount.

Structure: CH2=CH-COO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

The CH2=CH group is (CH2) (CH) with a double bond. The CH2 has 2 H, the CH has 1 H (since it's attached to the carbonyl). COO has no H. The ester O is connected to CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H.

So total H:

CH2=CH → 2 +1 =3 H.

COO has no H.

CH2CH2CH3 → 2 (from first CH2) + 2 (from second CH2) +3 (from CH3) →7 H.

Wait, no: CH2CH2CH3 is CH2-CH2-CH3. So each CH2 has 2 H. The first CH2 has 2 H, the middle CH2 has 2 H, and the CH3 has 3 H. So 2 +2 +3=7 H.

Plus the 3 H from the CH2=CH group. So total H is 3 +7=10. That's correct because the formula is C6H10O2.

Now, the IR:

- Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹: where is the O-H? Wait, in this structure, there's no O-H group. Oh no! That's a problem. Because the IR shows a broad peak around 3000, which suggests an O-H group. But in the structure I've been considering (an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester), there's no O-H. So that's a contradiction.

Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in assuming the structure. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: the O-H is from a phenol group. So the structure could be a phenol with an ester group. For example, a substituted phenyl ester. But that would require the molecular formula to have more carbon atoms than the options provided, perhaps. Wait, phenol is C6H5OH. If I have a phenol ester, like phenyl propionate, that would be C6H5OOCR, which would have more carbons than our options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a vinyl alcohol ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the O-H isn't from the ester but from another group. Let me think: perhaps the compound has both an ester and an alcohol group. For example, a molecule with both an ester and an -OH.

But the formula is C6H10O2. So for that, the structure could be something like HOCH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that would have O3. Because each ester has two O, but the alcohol adds another O. So that's O3, which isn't an option. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the O-H is from a hemiacetal. But that seems more complex.

Wait, another idea: maybe the compound is a cyclic ester with an alcohol group, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from an acidic hydrogen, like a alpha proton to a carbonyl. For example, in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the alpha protons are acidic. But those protons are not O-H, so the IR wouldn't show a broad peak around 3000, because they're not O-H.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let's think about the other options.

Option B is C6H10O. DoU is 2. So two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond.

IR has a broad peak at 3000, which could be an O-H (like an alcohol) or perhaps a C-H stretch (like in sp² C-H, which is around 3100-3000 cm⁻¹). Wait, but that's a different region. So a broad peak at 3000 is more likely O-H.

So if the compound is an alcohol with a double bond and maybe another ring.

But the DoU is 2. So for option B, C6H10O, DoU is 2. So two rings or a ring and a double bond or two double bonds.

If it's a diene (two double bonds), then the IR would show possibly two C=C peaks. But the IR only shows one peak at 1650, which might be a C=C.

But the option B has O=1. So if it's an alcohol, the O-H would be present. Let's think of a structure like cyclohexene with a hydroxyl group. For example, cyclohexene-ol.

But then the formula would be C6H10O, which is option B. Let's check:

Cyclohexene has a ring (one DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), total DoU 2, which fits option B's formula.

So the structure would be cyclohexenol. The IR would show a broad O-H peak at 3000, a C=C peak around 1650, and possibly another peak from the ring (like C-O stretching, but not sure). The NMR would have vinyl hydrogens from the double bond.

The mass spectrum fragment at 45 could be from a part of the molecule, perhaps a CH2CH2OH group losing something. But I'm not sure.

But wait, the FTIR has a peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. So if the structure is cyclohexenol, where's the carbonyl? It doesn't have one.

Ah, that's a problem. So the compound must have a carbonyl group. So option B, which has O=1, can't have a carbonyl group because that would require O=2 (as a carbonyl is C=O). So option B is out because the IR shows a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl.

So option B is eliminated.

Now, looking at the remaining options: A, C, D.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU is (2*6+2-12)/2=(14-12)/2=1. So one ring or one double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So the structure must have a double bond, which accounts for the DoU.

The IR has O-H and carbonyl. But option D has O=1. So if there's a carbonyl group, which requires O=1, that's possible. Let's see.

So structure could be a ketone with an alcohol group. For example, cyclohexanol with a ketone. But DoU would be 1 (from the ring or double bond). Wait, but a ketone is a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so DoU would be 1. So for example, a cyclohexenone with an alcohol substituent. But then the formula would have O=2 (one from the ketone, one from the alcohol). So that's O=2, which isn't the case for option D, which has O=1.

Hmm, so that's a problem. So option D can't have a carbonyl and an O-H group because that would require O=2, but option D has O=1.

So option D is out.

That leaves options A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU is 1.

So one ring or one double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present, which accounts for the DoU.

So the structure must have a double bond. The IR has a carbonyl (1700) and O-H (3000) and another peak at 1650. If the structure is an ester with a double bond and an O-H group, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, option A has O=2. So perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, let's think: structure could be an ester with a vinyl group. For example, methyl vinyl benzoate, but that might not fit the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a double bond in the R group.

Let me think of a structure: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's C6H10O2, which is option C.

Wait, but option A is C6H12O2, which has two more hydrogens. So perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. Like a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that would require more O.

Wait, another approach: the mass spectrum fragment at 45. If the molecule is C6H12O2, and the fragment is 45, perhaps the molecule is something like a diethyl malonate, which is CH2(COOEt)2. Let's see: molecular formula would be C6H10O4 (since each ester group is O2 and C2). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a substituent. Let me think: a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula for option A: C6H12O2.

Possible structures: maybe a substituted cyclopentane with an ester group.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me recap.

The IR shows O-H (broad), carbonyl (1700), and another peak (1650). The NMR has vinyl H. The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

Option C: C6H10O2. Structure could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which fits the IR and NMR data, but where is the O-H?

Ah, perhaps the O-H is not in the main chain but as a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a phenyl ester with a vinyl group. But phenyl groups would add more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a hydroxyl group attached to the ester. For example, the ester would be part of a larger structure with an OH group. But that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a geminal diol, but that doesn't make much sense.

Hmm, perhaps I should think that the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, and the 1700 is the carboxylic acid's carbonyl, and the 1650 is the C=C in the double bond.

So the structure would be a substituted acrylic acid. For example, hex-4-enoic acid: CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCOOH.

The formula for that would be C6H10O2. So that fits option C.

So the IR would show:

- Broad O-H from the carboxylic acid (3000 cm⁻¹).
- Strong carbonyl at ~1700 cm⁻¹.
- The C=C at ~1650 cm⁻¹ (conjugated with the carbonyl).

The NMR would have peaks for vinyl hydrogens (the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond).

The mass spectrum's fragment at 45 could come from the loss of a CH3 group or part of the molecule. But I'm not entirely sure.

But wait, hex-4-enoic acid has a double bond between C4 and C5. So the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH₂-CH₂-COOH. No, wait, that doesn't include a double bond. Let me structure it correctly. Hex-4-enoic acid is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, that would be 4-hexenoic acid.

Wait, no. Let me correct that: the correct structure for hex-4-enoic acid is CH₂CH₂CH₂CH=CH-COOH. So the double bond is between C4 and C5, and the COOH is on C6.

So the formula would be C6H10O2, which matches option C.

The IR data fits: broad O-H, strong carbonyl, and conjugated C=C.

The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens on the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond.

The mass spectrum fragment at 45 could be from the cleavage of the COOH group, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, considering the molecular formula of hex-4-enoic acid as C6H10O2, and the fact that the IR and NMR data fit, it seems that option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the structure I was considering (an ester with a double bond) didn't have an O-H group, which contradicts the IR data. So the correct structure must have both an O-H and a carbonyl group.

In the case of hex-4-enoic acid, the O-H is from the carboxylic acid, and the carbonyl is from the acid. The IR would fit, and the NMR would show the vinyl hydrogens.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer must be option C: C6H10O2.


The unknown compound is characterized using FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The spectroscopic data provides critical clues about the molecular structure:

1. **FTIR Analysis**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm$^-$ suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.  
   - A strong absorption at 1700 cm$^-$ indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.  
   - A peak at 1650 cm$^-$ suggests a conjugated C=C bond, likely part of an alpha, beta-unsaturated system.

2. **$^1$H NMR**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirm the presence of a double bond in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a fragment corresponding to a CH$_3$CO group (acetone ion).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$)**:  
  Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. This formula could correspond to a structure with one ring or one double bond. However, the IR data indicates the presence of both a carbonyl group (C=O) and a conjugated C=C bond, which requires at least two degrees of unsaturation. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the data.

- **Option B (C$_6$H$_{10}$O)**:  
  Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = 2. This formula could correspond to a structure with two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. However, the IR data shows a strong carbonyl peak at 1700 cm$^-$, which requires an oxygen atom to form the C=O bond. Since this option only has one oxygen atom, it cannot account for the carbonyl group. Thus, this option is eliminated.

- **Option C (C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$)**:  
  Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = 2. This formula could correspond to a structure with a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. The IR data (broad O-H, carbonyl at 1700 cm$^-$, and conjugated C=C at 1650 cm$^-$) and the $^1$H NMR data (vinyl hydrogens) are consistent with an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. A plausible structure is hex-4-enoic acid (CH$_2$=CHCH$_2$CH$_2$COOH), which has the correct molecular formula (C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$) and matches all the spectroscopic data.

- **Option D (C$_6$H$_{12}$O)**:  
  Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. This formula could correspond to a structure with one ring or one double bond. However, the IR data indicates the presence of both a carbonyl group (C=O) and a conjugated C=C bond, which requires at least two degrees of unsaturation. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data (FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and mass spectrometry) are most consistent with the molecular formula **C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**, corresponding to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid like hex-4-enoic acid.
