Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, so the operator P is probably the spin operator, right? Because in quantum mechanics, spin components are often represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given.

Let me look at the given matrices. P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. That looks familiar—it's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Similarly, P_y has elements with i and -i, which matches the Pauli Y matrix. P_z is diagonal with 1 and -1, scaled by ħ/2.

So the operator for spin in direction n (which is in the x-z plane) would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But wait, since n lies in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P becomes n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Let me write that out:

P = n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which simplifies to:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because when you add the matrices, the top-left element is n_z*(ħ/2), top-right is n_x*(ħ/2), and so on.

We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's denote the eigenvector as a column vector [a; b]. So, the eigenvalue equation is:

P * [a; b] = (+ħ/2) [a; b]

Let me plug in the matrix P into this equation. So:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Since ħ/2 is a common factor, I can divide both sides by (ħ/2), leading to:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

n_z * a + n_x * b = a  
n_x * a - n_z * b = b

Wait, wait. Let me write each component:

1. Top equation: n_z a + n_x b = a  
2. Bottom equation: n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me rearrange each equation.

From equation 1: (n_z a) + (n_x b) = a  
=> n_z a + n_x b - a = 0  
=> a (n_z - 1) + n_x b = 0  
Similarly, equation 2: n_x a - n_z b = b  
=> n_x a - n_z b - b =0  
=> n_x a - b (n_z +1) =0

So now I have two equations:

a (n_z -1) + n_x b =0  
n_x a - b (n_z +1) =0

Hmm, I need to find a and b in terms of n_x and n_z. Let me try solving these equations.

Let me treat one of the variables as a parameter. Let's say I solve for a in terms of b from equation 1, and plug into equation 2.

From equation 1: a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z -1 )

Wait, but denominator is n_z -1. If n_z is 1, that's a problem, but since n is a unit vector, n_z can't be more than 1. So maybe that's a special case, but let's proceed.

Substituting a into equation 2:

n_x [ (-n_x b)/(n_z -1) ) ] - b (n_z +1) =0

Let me compute each term.

n_x * (-n_x b) / (n_z -1) ) = -n_x² b/(n_z-1)

So the equation becomes:

[ -n_x² b/(n_z -1) ) ] - b(n_z +1) = 0

Factor out b:

b [ -n_x²/(n_z -1) - (n_z +1) ] =0

Assuming b is not zero (since both a and b can't be zero for a non-trivial solution), the term in the brackets must be zero.

So:

-n_x²/(n_z -1) - (n_z +1) =0

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

-n_x² - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) =0

Wait, expanding the second term:

(n_z +1)(n_z -1) = n_z² -1

So:

-n_x² - (n_z² -1) =0  
=> -n_x² - n_z² +1 =0  
=> -(n_x^2 + n_z^2) +1 =0  
But n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So:

-(1) +1=0 → 0=0

Which is always true. That means that the equations are dependent, and the solution is not unique. So I can choose a parameter to express the eigenvector.

Let me pick b as a parameter. Let me let b=1, then find a.

From equation 1: a = [ -n_x * b ] / (n_z -1 )

Wait, but if n_z =1, this would be a problem. Let me think. If n_z=1, that would mean the direction is along +z. Then what happens?

If n_z=1, then n_x must be 0 (since n_x² +n_z²=1). Then the operator P becomes (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the standard P_z.

The eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. The eigenvector for +ħ/2 would be [1;0], since P_z |+z> =
