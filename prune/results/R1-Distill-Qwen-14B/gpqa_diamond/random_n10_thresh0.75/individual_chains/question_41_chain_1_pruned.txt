Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects the way light propagates, but I'm not exactly sure how. Let me recall some concepts.

I know that the index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (c) to the speed of light in the medium (v_medium). So normally, v_medium = c/n. But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. What happens when the medium is moving?

Oh right, this probably involves the addition of velocities, like in special relativity. Because when the medium moves, the light's speed relative to the lab frame would be affected by the medium's velocity. But wait, isn't the speed of light supposed to be constant in all inertial frames? Oh, but wait, that's only in a vacuum. I'm not sure about in a medium.

Wait, no, the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. But in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So I need to find the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab frame.

Let me think about how velocities add. Normally, without considering relativity, if a medium is moving at velocity v
