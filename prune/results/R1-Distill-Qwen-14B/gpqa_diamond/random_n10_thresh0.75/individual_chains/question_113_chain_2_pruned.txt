Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let me think about each piece of information given and how to interpret it.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol, not a carboxylic acid because those can sometimes be even broader. But sometimes alcohols can have broad peaks too, though maybe not as broad as carboxylic acids. Also, the user said it's very broad, which makes me think maybe it's an -OH group. 

Then there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an ester or maybe another group like an amide, but since we don't have any info about N, probably not amide. Wait, another possibility: maybe conjugated carbonyl groups. Like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl? Because conjugation can lower the wavenumber a bit. So if the compound has two carbonyl groups, like maybe an ester and a ketone, or perhaps an ester and an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone? Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with carbonyl groups attached.

Moving to the 1H NMR: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule must have a double bond. Also, the NMR has several peaks, which suggests a molecule with multiple types of protons, perhaps in different environments.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Let me think about what fragments give m/z 45. I remember that (CH3)2O is 45 (since 12*2 +1*6 +16= 45). So maybe a methoxy group? Or perhaps an acetal fragment? Alternatively, another possibility is that 45 could come from a ketene ion, but I'm not as sure about that.

Now, looking
