Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a certain nucleus to reach 0.96c speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and typically 4 neutrons, making it Li-7. But here, X is Li with 3 neutrons, so that would be Li-6, right? Because 3 protons and 3 neutrons sum to 6, so it's a lithium-6 nucleus. So X is Li-6.

The question is about finding the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So we need to calculate the relativistic energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96 times the speed of light.

I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So E = gamma * m*c².

But wait, since we're dealing with heavy ions, the rest mass is significant. So I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus first.

The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus (which is 6 u, where u is the atomic mass unit). I recall that the atomic mass unit is approximately 1.660539 × 10^-27 kg. So, m = 6 * 1.660539e-27 kg. Let me calculate that: 6 * 1.660539e-27 is about 9.963234e-27 kg.

Now, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s. So m*c² would be the rest energy. But wait, since we're dealing with GeV, maybe it's better to compute everything in appropriate units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the rest mass of Li-6 in atomic mass units and then convert that to energy in GeV. Let me think: 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So, 1 u equals 931.5 MeV. Therefore, 6 u is
