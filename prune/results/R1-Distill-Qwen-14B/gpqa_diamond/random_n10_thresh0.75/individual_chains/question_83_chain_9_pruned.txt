Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralizing a solution with a base. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. So first, I should probably figure out the concentration after dilution.

Wait, dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³ because we add another 20. So M2 is (0.05 *20) /40 = 0.025 M. Right, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point. Let's tackle each part.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially.

Wait, wait. Let's compute the moles of acetic acid first. Volume is 40 cm³ (since diluted to 40) and concentration 0.025 M. So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because 40 cm³ is 0.04 liters.

So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but the question is about the pH at equivalence. At equivalence, the solution is a sodium acetate solution because the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base. So the solution will be basic because acetate is a weak base.

So I'll need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions. The total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ (original solution) +10 cm³ (NaOH) =50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. The moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (A-) will hydrolyze in water: A- + H2O ↔ HA + OH-. The Kb for this is Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, that's a very small Kb, so the solution should be slightly basic, but not too much. To find pH, I can use the approximation for weak bases, but maybe it's better to set up an equation.

The concentration
