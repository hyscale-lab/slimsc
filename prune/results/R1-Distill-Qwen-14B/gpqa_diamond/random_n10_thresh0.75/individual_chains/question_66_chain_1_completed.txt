Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, so what do I remember about these symmetries? I think Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in all reference frames moving at constant velocity relative to each other. So the symmetry group includes rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is bigger, right? It includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. So Poincare implies Lorentz, I guess.

In SMEFT, the theory is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are supposed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. So I think the SM has Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT must too. So operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz invariant. So option 1 is definitely in.

What about Poincare symmetry? Well, Poincare includes both Lorentz and translational symmetries. The SMEFT is a field theory, so it should respect all the symmetries of the SM, which includes Poincare. So do all SMEFT operators have to obey Poincare symmetry? Because without that, the theory wouldn't make sense in terms of local symmetries. So I think 2 (Poincare) is also required. So that makes options that include both 1 and 2 as correct.

CP symmetry is another matter. CP is Charge conjugation combined with Parity. But the SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry. For example, in the Standard Model, processes like the CKM mechanism allow for CP violation. So SMEFT operators can have CP violation. Therefore, operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So options that include 3 (CP) might not be correct. So options B and D include 3, maybe they are not the right answers.

CPT symmetry is a big one. CPT combines Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories that are Lorentz invariant must also be CPT symmetric. Because it comes from the properties of the S-matrix and the way fields transform under the Lorentz group. So SMEFT, being a Lorentz invariant theory, must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 must be correct.

So putting it together, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, wait, but wait. Poincare is more than Lorentz. So if the operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So the question is about which symmetries must all operators respect. So the required are Poincare and CPT?

Wait, no, wait. The options are which of the four listed symmetries must be respected. So looking at the options:

Question says which must be respected by all operators. So operators in SMEFT must be invariant under these symmetries.

Option 1: Lorentz symmetry. Yes, because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory.

Option 2: Poincare symmetry. Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But do the operators need to be invariant under translations? Well, in a field theory, the fields themselves transform under translations, but the operators would be built from the fields. Wait, but in effective field theories, operators are local, so they should respect all the symmetries of the underlying theory.

Wait, but SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Poincare includes translations, but I think that Poincare symmetry is already implied because the theory is a Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant field theory. So operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars and can be local. But the question is whether each operator individually must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. A Poincare symmetry implies that the theory is invariant under Lorentz transformations and translations. So if an operator is a scalar (thus invariant under Lorentz), and you act with a translation on it, the operator itself isn't transformed into another operator, because translation would shift the fields but the operator is a product of fields at the same point. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way to think.

Alternatively, the theory as a whole must have Poincare symmetry, but individual operators don't have to transform in a particular way beyond being Lorentz invariant. So maybe the SMEFT operators don't have to explicitly respect Poincare symmetry beyond being Lorentz scalars. Or perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must be invariant under these symmetries.

If that's the case, then for Lorentz symmetry, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. For Poincare, each operator must be invariant under translations as well. But in reality, an operator like O(x) would translate as O(x + a), but the individual operator O(x) isn't invariant under translations. Unless it's a singlet, which it already is because it's a scalar. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that all operators must be Lorentz scalars (so Lorentz symmetry is required) and each operator must also transform in a particular way under CPT. But what about Poincare? Since Poincare includes translations, but operators are local, perhaps the operators don't need to be invariant under translations because translation invariance is a global symmetry. Wait, no, in a translation, the operator itself would shift, but the theory remains translation invariant because the action would have an integral over all space of the Lagrangian, which includes the operator terms.

Wait, perhaps the better way is to think about the symmetries that SMEFT must have. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, and it must also respect CPT because of its Lorentz invariance. But Poincare is more than Lorentz; it includes translations. So, if the theory is Poincare invariant, then yes, operators must respect that. But is Poincare symmetry necessary for SMEFT?

Wait, the Standard Model is a Poincare-invariant theory. So the SMEFT, which is an effective theory based on the SM, should also respect Poincare symmetry. Hence, all operators in SMEFT must be Poincare invariant, meaning that they must be both Lorentz scalars and translation invariant in their structure. But wait, the operators are local, so how do they transform under translations? Maybe the individual operator terms don't transform in a way that affects their structure beyond being scalars.

Alternatively, perhaps the key point is that all operators must be Lorentz scalars and must transform correctly under CPT. So the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz and CPT.

Wait, but the question includes Poincare as option 2. So let's reevaluate.

Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if an operator is a scalar (so invariant under Lorentz), and the theory is translation invariant, perhaps the operator doesn't need to be invariant under translations because translation symmetry applies to the entire theory, not individual operators. For example, the QED Lagrangian is translation invariant because the electric and magnetic fields are connected via Maxwell's equations, and the matter fields transform under the gauge symmetry. But individual terms in the Lagrangian, like the kinetic term for the electron, are not invariant under translations; rather, the entire Lagrangian density is.

So perhaps the operators in the SMEFT don't need to be invariant under translations, but the theory as a whole is. So the individual operators may not need to respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the operator isn't required to transform in any specific way under translation beyond the overall theory, then maybe the operators don't need to obey Poincare, only Lorentz and CPT.

Hmm, but then the Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translation. So if the operator respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poincare? No, because translation is a separate symmetry. So, if the operator is a scalar, it's Lorentz invariant, but not necessarily translation invariant. So perhaps the operators must respect Lorentz, and the overall theory must respect Poincare, but individual operators don't need to.

Wait, but the SMEFT is a field theory, so it must respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincare. So each operator must be a scalar (Lorentz), but also must be a scalar under translation? But how? The operator is a local operator, so perhaps not. Because translation would shift the position of the fields, but the operator itself is a product of fields at a single point. So perhaps the operator doesn't need to be translation invariant, but the sum of all operators in the Lagrangian must make the entire theory translation invariant.

So perhaps the individual operators don't have to respect Poincare symmetry, only Lorentz and CPT. So the correct options would be 1, 4.

Wait, looking back at the options: option C is 1,2,4. So that's Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Option A is 1 and 2. But if the operators don't need to respect Poincare, then maybe only 1 and 4 are required, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look for another approach. Maybe the problem is more straightforward.

The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Also, any Lorentz-invariant theory must be CPT-invariant, so operators must respect CPT symmetry. So that's points 1 and 4. What about Poincare? Since Poincare includes translations, but operators are local, perhaps the operators don't have to respect translation symmetry as individual entities. So option 2 (Poincare) isn't required for each operator. So the required symmetries are 1 and 4.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that includes only 1 and 4. Let me see the options again.

Options are:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

Hmm. So none of the options have just 1 and 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that Poincare isn't required. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetry. Because SMEFT is a Poincare-invariant theory. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So that would include Lorentz and translation. So the correct options would be 1,2,4, which is option C.

Wait, but why would that be the case? Because operators in the Lagrangian must be scalars under all the symmetries of the theory.

Alternatively, perhaps the operators must individually be Poincare scalars, meaning they're invariant under Lorentz and translations. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the SMEFT operators must be invariant under all the symmetries of the theory, which includes Poincare. So each operator must respect Poincare, Lorentz, and CPT.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators." So if Poincare is a symmetry, then operators should respect it. But if operators are Poincare scalars, then they must be both Lorentz scalars and translation scalars. But translation symmetry is a bit tricky because operators are local—meaning they're defined at a point. So perhaps translation symmetry isn't a condition that operators must satisfy individually. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the point is that Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz, so if an operator respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. So if the correct required symmetries are Lorentz and CPT, and Poincare is broader, but if the operators must respect Poincare, then option C (1,2,4) would include that.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of a different angle. The question is about which symmetries must all operators respect. So if an operator is a scalar under Poincare, it's automatically a scalar under Lorentz. So if the theory has Poincare symmetry, the operators must be Poincare scalars. Hence, they must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So would the correct answer include Poincare (option 2) and CPT (option 4) along with Lorentz?

Wait, but the question lists Lorentz as option 1 and Poincare as option 2. So if all operators must respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So the correct answer would include 2 and 4. But the options don't have an option with 2 and 4. The options are A:1,2; B:3,4; C:1,2,4; D:1,3,4.

Alternatively, maybe only Lorentz and CPT are required, but Poincare isn't. So the correct answer would be 1 and 4, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Poincare symmetry is automatically respected if the theory is Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant. But the operators are local, so perhaps translation invariance isn't an issue. So maybe the operators don't need to respect Poincare, only Lorentz and CPT.

But then the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C (1,2,4). Because SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, hence all operators must be Poincare scalars, which implies they're Lorentz scalars and their structure is compatible with translations. But I'm not entirely convinced about the translation part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So option C) 1,2,4.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think about what the SMEFT is.

SMEFT is an effective theory constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. These operators are built from the SM fields and must be Lorentz scalars because the SM is Lorentz-invariant. Additionally, since the SM is CPT-invariant, SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. Now, what about Poincare symmetry?

Well, the SM is a Poincare-invariant theory. So all operators in SMEFT must also be Poincare scalars, meaning they're invariant under Lorentz and translation. But wait, the translation invariance is a global symmetry, so perhaps the operators don't have to be invariant under translations because translation symmetry is about the entire Lagrangian, not individual terms.

Hmm. Maybe the confusion arises from whether the operators are required to individually respect Poincare symmetry or if the theory as a whole does.

Wait, the question says that all operators must respect the symmetry. So if the operator is not invariant under Poincare, then the theory wouldn't be Poincare-invariant. But wait, operators are part of the Lagrangian, so their sum must be invariant under the symmetry. So each operator doesn't have to be invariant, but the whole Lagrangian must be.

Ah, perhaps that's the key. The operators don't have to be Poincare scalars; the entire Lagrangian must be. So in that case, individual operators can have terms that are not Poincare scalars, but when summed, they form a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, but they don't have to be invariant under translations because the entire Lagrangian is.

So, in that case, the operators don't need to respect Poincare symmetry, only Lorentz and CPT. But since the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators, and Poincare is a larger symmetry, perhaps the answer doesn't include Poincare.

But wait, the SMEFT must be a Poincare-invariant theory, so each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, but not necessarily a Poincare scalar.

Wait, I'm getting myself into circles. Let me try to find another approach. Maybe the correct answer is option C (1,2,4), because Poincare is a symmetry of the theory, so all operators must be Poincare scalars, hence they must respect Lorentz (since Poincare includes it), and CPT, which is a separate symmetry.

But another approach: the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So for all operators, which symmetries must they individually be invariant under.

1. Lorentz symmetry: yes, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar.

2. Poincare symmetry: perhaps no, because Poincare includes translations and operators are local, so translation invariance isn't a condition on individual operators but on the entire theory.

3. CP symmetry: no, because the SM allows for CP violation, so SMEFT can include operators that violate CP.

4. CPT symmetry: yes, because any Lorentz-invariant theory must be CPT-invariant. So all operators must respect CPT.

So the correct symmetries are 1 and 4. But looking at the options, there's no option with just 1 and 4.

Wait, wait. Are all operators automatically CPT-invariant because the theory is Lorentz-invariant? Because in a Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry is enforced at the level of the S-matrix, but individual operators might not be CPT-symmetric. Or perhaps the operators must themselves be CPT scalars.

Hmm. Wait, but CPT symmetry is about the combination of C, P, and T. In a Lorentz-invariant theory, each operator must transform in a way that is compatible with CPT. So perhaps each operator must be a CPT scalar, meaning that when you apply CPT, the operator remains the same. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I think in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the operator must be a scalar under CPT. Because the operator is a scalar under Lorentz, and under CPT, which is a symmetry, the operator is invariant. So SMEFT operators must be CPT scalars.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about the structure of the SMEFT operators. They're constructed as Lorentz scalars, and for each operator dimension, they're built from the SM fields in a way that respects all SM symmetries except for higher-dimension corrections. Since the SM is CPT-invariant, the SMEFT must also be CPT-invariant. So the operators must be CPT scalars.

So, putting it all together, the operators must respect Lorentz (1), and CPT (4). But what about Poincare (2)? Since the theory as a whole respects Poincare, but the individual operators don't have to. So the correct answer would be 1 and 4.

But looking back, the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

From my earlier analysis, the correct symmetries are 1 (Lorentz) and 4 (CPT). But option C includes 2, which is Poincare. So perhaps Poincare is not a required symmetry for the operators, but the theory must have it. So the operators don't need to respect Poincare, but the overall theory does. So the operators must respect Lorentz and CPT, making the answer include 1 and 4, but no such option exists.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Poincare is automatically respected because the operators are Lorentz scalars. Wait, no, Poincare is more than Lorentz. So perhaps the correct answer is option C (1,2,4), but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think: the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. The Standard Model is also CPT-invariant, so SMEFT must be as well, so operators must be CPT scalars. Poincare includes Lorentz and translation, but the operators are local, so only Lorentz is a condition on the operators. Thus, 1 (Lorentz) and 4 (CPT) are required. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the operators must also respect Poincare symmetry. Because Poincare is a symmetry of the theory, so the operators must be Poincare scalars. So each operator must be invariant under Poincare, which includes Lorentz and translation. Thus, all operators must be Poincare scalars, which implies Lorentz and translation invariance. But wait, translation invariance for an operator isn't something that can be achieved by a local operator because translation would shift the position. So perhaps the operator doesn't need to be translation invariant, but the theory as a whole must be. So the operator must be Lorentz and CPT invariant, but not necessarily Poincare.

So perhaps the correct answer is that the operators must respect Lorentz and CPT, but not Poincare. But since Poincare is a combination, the correct answer would include Lorentz (1), but not Poincare (2). So the correct answer would be 1 and 4. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should recall that in SMEFT, the operators are required to be Lorentz scalars and CPT scalars. So they must respect Lorentz and CPT. So the answer includes 1 and 4, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm wrong about the CPT part.

Wait, another approach. In the Standard Model, the CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry. So any effective theory beyond the SM that is based on the SM must also respect CPT symmetry. So all SMEFT operators must be CPT scalars. Therefore, all operators must respect CPT. So 4 is included.

But again, the options don't have 1 and 4. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, which includes 1, 2, 4.

Alternatively, I'm overcomplicating it and the correct answer is option C) 1,2,4.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck because the question is tricky. Let me try to find another angle. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

In SMEFT, the operators are higher-dimensional terms that must be consistent with the SM's symmetries. The SM respects Lorentz, CPT, but not necessarily CP or Poincare (since Poincare includes translations and the SM is translation-invariant, but operators don't have to be).

Wait, but SMEFT is an effective theory of the SM, so it must respect all the symmetries of the SM, including Lorentz and CPT. The SM is a Poincare-invariant theory, so SMEFT must also be Poincare-invariant, meaning that each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So each operator must respect Lorentz and translation. But how does that work for local operators? Because translation would take x to x + a, but the operator is at a point. So perhaps the operator doesn't have to be translation invariant itself, but the sum of all operators in the Lagrangian must be translation-invariant.

Wait, but the question is about what each operator must respect, not the entire theory. So perhaps the operators don't have to individually respect translation invariance, but the theory must as a whole.

So in that case, the operators must respect Lorentz (1) and CPT (4). But the options don't have that combination. So perhaps the correct answer is option C) 1,2,4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) because Poincare is a required symmetry of the theory, so all operators must be Poincare scalars, which means they are Lorentz scalars and their terms are arranged in a way that respects translation invariance when combined in the Lagrangian.

But I'm not entirely confident. Given the options, the most plausible answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So option C (1,2,4) is correct.


The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). To determine the correct answer, we analyze the symmetries listed in the options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must be Lorentz scalars. This symmetry is fundamental and must be respected by all operators.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. While the SMEFT is a Poincaré-invariant theory, the question focuses on whether individual operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. Operators are local and do not need to be translation-invariant individually, as translation invariance is ensured by the entire Lagrangian. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is not a strict requirement for individual operators, but the theory as a whole respects it.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model (SM) allows for CP violation, and SMEFT inherits this feature. Therefore, operators in SMEFT do not need to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: Any Lorentz-invariant theory, including the SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry. This symmetry is required for all operators in SMEFT.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)** and **CPT symmetry (4)**. Poincaré symmetry (2) is not strictly required for individual operators, as translation invariance is ensured by the Lagrangian as a whole. CP symmetry (3) is not required due to the presence of CP-violating phenomena in the SM.

Given the options, the correct answer is **C) 1,2,4**, as it includes Lorentz, Poincaré, and CPT symmetries. While Poincaré symmetry is not strictly required for individual operators, it is included in the answer to reflect the broader symmetry structure of the theory.

Answer: C
