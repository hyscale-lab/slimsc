Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, so I need to look at that to determine which fermions X can decay into.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into fermions, the energy (or mass) of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Because when a particle decays, it has to have enough energy to produce the rest mass of the decay products. So, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so any fermion pair it can decay into must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Looking at the Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. So the interaction term is something like λ times the field f times the fermion fields ψ_f and their adjoint. So the term involves X(y) multiplied by the fermion fields. That suggests that X couples to the fermions f.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Okay, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The exact form of the coupling isn't as important as knowing which fermions X can interact with. Because the problem gives the interaction, X must be coupling to certain fermions f.

So the fermions that X can decay into are the ones it couples to. So the Lagrangian here has X interacting with fermions f. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion is f.

Wait, but in the given Lagrangian, the coupling is to ψ_f (y), which is a fermion field. So which fermions are these? The options include particles like b quarks, c quarks, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, etc. So the possible decay products depend on which fermions X couples to.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify the type of fermion f. So perhaps the interaction is with all possible fermions, but that's probably not the case. Wait, the interaction term is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So perhaps f is a scalar here, so maybe the fermions are say, leptons or quarks. Or maybe f is a generic fermion field. Hmm, perhaps the actual fermion species isn't specified, but from the options, I can see that the possible decay products are pairs of fermions.

Wait, but the boson X is a scalar (since it's in the Lagrangian as a field without derivatives, perhaps). So, in terms of decay, X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So the possible decay products are all possible pairs of fermions whose mass is less than or equal to half of 6 GeV, which is 3 GeV each. So each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Wait, no, because the combined mass of the pair must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Oh wait, the rest mass of X is 6 GeV. When it decays, the total energy of the decay products must not exceed the rest mass of X. So for a fermion-antifermion pair, each has mass m, so combined mass is 2m. So 2m ≤ 6 GeV, so m ≤ 3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass ≤3 GeV can be a decay product. Now, let's list the known fermion masses:

- electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- muon (mu): ~0.105 GeV
- tau (tau):
