Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the question is about two stars, star_1 and star_2. The main point is that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, and the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The question is asking which equation correctly relates the effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Alright, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution relates the populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this case, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. I think that means the population of a higher energy level (n2) compared to a lower one (n1) is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So, for each star, the ratio of populations depends on their respective temperatures.

Let's denote the excitation level for star_1 as a ratio. Let me call the ratio for star_1 as R1 and for star_2 as R2. According to the problem, R1 = 2 * R2.

What's the expression for R in terms of temperature? Oh right, R = n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels. So for each star, R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, but wait a second. Since the energy difference is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J, which is actually equal to k, since k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, that's an important point. Because ΔE = k*T? Or wait, no, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is the same as k, because k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait, no, k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T? No, wait ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is the same as k. So, ΔE = k, because 1.38e-23 J is k, so k = 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, but when you multiply k by a temperature in Kelvin, you get J. So the energy difference here is k times some temperature. Wait, but the problem states that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So that's exactly k. Because k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so if ΔE = k*T, then for ΔE to be k, T would be 1 K. But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

So, the ratio R1/R2 = (n2/n1
