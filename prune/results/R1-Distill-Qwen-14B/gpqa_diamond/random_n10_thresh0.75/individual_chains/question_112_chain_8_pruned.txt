Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates of an operator and then finding the average value of that operator. 

Let me start by reading the problem again carefully.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, the first thing I remember is that when a state is given as a linear combination of eigenstates of an operator, the coefficients' squared magnitudes give the probabilities of measuring the corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional, not exactly equal. So I think I need to normalize the state first. Because the sum of the probabilities should be 1.

The operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm. So the matrix is a 2x2 because the state is a combination of |up> and |down>, which are spin eigenstates, so spin-½ system.

So for a 2x2 matrix, the operator A would have zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. That is:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, because if i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So the diagonal (i=j) elements are zero.

Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right! That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli matrices have 1s off the diagonal and 0s on. So, the operator A must be (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

So, A = (hbar/2) σ_x.

Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the operator A. Wait, but wait. Since A is proportional to σ_x, the eigenstates would be the same as those of σ_x, because multiplying by a scalar doesn't change the eigenstates, just the eigenvalues.

So, the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. I think the eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the
