Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might take some wrong turns, but I'll try to figure it out.

The question says that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO is reacted with a set of reagents, and we need to identify the final product from the options given. The NMR data is provided, which should help in determining the structure of the starting compound.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down, for each degree of unsaturation, it's a ring or a double bond. The calculation is done by the formula: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, but in this case, X (halogens) is zero. So plugging in the numbers: (2*8 + 2 - 9 - 0 +1)/2. Let me compute that: (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from rings and double bonds. Hmm, 5 DoU: maybe a benzene ring (which has 3 DoU, since it's three double bonds), plus a double bond elsewhere, and maybe a ring again or more. Alternatively, one ring, a double bond, and some other rings.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

Let me try to interpret the NMR. The first peak is a triplet at 9.72 ppm. That high up is probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe it's a terminal aldehyde group, which would be a triplet if it's coupled with another proton. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets or maybe triplets if coupled with something nearby. Hmm, but in some cases, like in enals
