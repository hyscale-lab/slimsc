Alright, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, okay. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance is approximately 1 divided by parallax, so r ≈ 1 / plx. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

Wait, but the question says the number of stars varies with 1/plx^5. So, if I have N ∝ 1/plx^5, and I know that plx is proportional to 1/r (since plx = 1/r), then substituting that in, I can write N in terms of r.

Let me write this out step by step. Let's denote the parallax as p. So p is inversely proportional to r: p ∝ 1/r. 

The number of stars, N, varies as 1/p^5. So substituting p in terms of r, N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Simplifying that, 1/(1/r^5) is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. I think that refers to the differential, like the change in N with respect to r. So maybe I need to consider how N depends on r.

Wait, no, the question says "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)" — I think that's just asking for the dependence, not the derivative. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number increases as r^5. So for each unit increase in r, the number of stars increases by r^5. But wait, that doesn't make sense because r is in parsecs or something, and as r increases, the number of stars shouldn't just keep increasing without bound. Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, another approach. The number density of stars might be what they're talking about. The number of stars per unit volume or something like that. Oh, because if stars are spread out, the number you see in a region depends on the volume, which depends on distance.

Wait, but the initial statement says the number of stars varies as 1/p^5. So when p is small (which means large distance), 1/p^5 becomes large, so N is larger. That makes sense because at larger distances, the volume (and possibly the number of stars) would increase, but I thought the number of stars per unit volume might decrease, but maybe not.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between flux and number counts. Oh, right, in astronomy, number counts of sources (like stars) as a function of distance usually follow certain relations. The number of stars within a certain distance is related to the volume. Volume goes as r^3, so if the density of stars is uniform, the number would go as r^3. But here, the relation is N ∝ 1/p^5 = (r)^5 because p=1/r.

So if N ∝ r^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But does that make sense? Because as you go further, the volume increases as r^3, so if the number is r^5, that's faster than the volume. That would imply the density is increasing as r^2 (since density is number/volume: N/V = (r^5)/(r^3) )= r^2. So density goes up with r squared. That seems odd because you’d expect density to decrease with distance for a uniform distribution. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question isn't about the total number of stars in a volume, but the number per unit area (like in a specific region of the sky, which would be a volume slice). So for a given area, the number of stars at a distance r would depend on the depth (distance). So if you have a region of the sky, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr would be N = k * (number per unit volume) * 4π r² dr.

Oh, wait, that makes sense. Because the number of stars in a spherical shell at radius r is the surface area of the sphere (4πr²) multiplied by the thickness dr, and the number density (stars per unit volume) at that distance.

So let's say the number density (stars per unit volume) is n(r). Then the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr is dN = n(r) * 4π r² dr.

If the number density n(r) is constant, then dN = 4π n r² dr, so the number per unit distance (dN/dr) is 4π n r². So it goes as r squared. But in our case, the number of stars N varies as 1/p^5 = r^5. So substituting, N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's the number of stars that varies as 1/p^5, which is r^5. So if N = k r^5, then how does the number change with distance?

Wait, perhaps I should think about how N relates to r. If N is proportional to r^5, then for each unit increase in r, N increases by r^5. But that seems like a very rapid increase. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the differential, the change in N per unit change in r. Then N ∝ r^5 would imply dN/dr ∝ 5 r^4, which would be option C if that's the case.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". I'm not entirely sure about the wording. "Per unit range of distance" might mean the change in number per unit distance. So if N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr = 5 k r^4, which would mean the change is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases by r^4 per unit r.

Looking at the options, option C is ~r^4. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but another way to think about it: maybe the number of stars in the region is given as N ∝ 1/p^5. Since p = 1/r, substituting, N ∝ r^5. So N increases as r^5. That would mean that the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But in reality, as you go further, the number of stars you can observe in a given volume (like a sphere) should increase as r^3 if the density is uniform. So this suggests the density isn't uniform here; it's increasing with r^2, which is an unusual scenario. But perhaps the question is just about the relation, not the physical reasoning.

So the problem states that N varies as 1/p^5. So N ∝ r^5. So when r increases by a small amount dr, the change in N would be dN = 5 k r^4 dr, so dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4.

Looking back at the options, option C is ~r^4. So the correct answer would be C.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} \propto \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the given relation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." This likely refers to the differential change in \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is represented by \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Differentiating \( N \propto r^5 \) gives \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Among the options provided:
- **A) \( \sim r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^5 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \):** Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars, not the change per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \):** Correct, as \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \).
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is not \( r^2 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
