Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first part of the reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in the presence of water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I need to figure out what reagents A and B are from the given options. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing possible pairs for A and B.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN and some reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, what's that product? Let me think about the structure. The product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. So that's a ketone reacting with a cyanide. Hmm.

I recall that the addition of a nitrile group to a ketone usually involves some kind of addition reaction. But wait, ketones typically undergo nucleophilic addition. So maybe the cyanide is acting as a nucleophile here. Oh, but butan-2-one has a ketone group, and NaCN is providing the cyanide ion as a nucleophile.

Ah, wait. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the ketone (butan-2-one) becomes a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached. Wait, no. Let me write out the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions. The mechanism would be nucleophilic addition. The CN- adds to the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. Oh wait, a cyanohydrin is when a nitrile and an alcohol group are added to a carbonyl, right? So that would form a secondary alcohol adjacent to a nitrile.

So the product is a cyanohydrin. So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohy
