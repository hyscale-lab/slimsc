Okay, so I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that for crystals, interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, so that's a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system, but with all edges equal and angles not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think. No, wait—rhombohedral is a hexagonal subclass or part of the cubic system? I think it's a type of cubic crystal system where all edges are the same length, but the angles between them are not 90 degrees. So, in a rhombohedral lattice, a = b = c, but α = β = γ, which can be different from 90 degrees. Oh, right, in this problem, the angles are all 30 degrees.

So the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, which I think is the lattice parameter a, since in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the vertices of the unit cell. So a = 10 angstroms.

The problem is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by 1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - something with the angles. Wait, the exact formula. I think for a general crystal system, the formula
