Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each involves a Michael addition, and we need to find the major products from each. Let me tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH. So, NaOEt is a strong base, usually used to deprotonate something to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor.

Wait, in the Michael reaction, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta position of the acceptor. So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Let me visualize the structures.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3)2C(CO2Me)2. Its enolate would have the negative charge on the central carbon. When that attacks the acrylate, which is something like CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me, the attack would happen on the carbon next to the carbonyl.

So, the enolate adds to the beta carbon. The addition would form a new bond between the alpha carbon of the enolate (which is the central carbon in malonate) and the beta carbon of the acrylate. Then, resonance would form a new carbonyl group.

After the attack, we would get a new carbon-carbon bond. The product would have a four-carbon chain, I think. Let me draw it mentally. The malonate part brings two methyl groups and two ester groups. So the product would be a tricarboxylate with substituents.

Wait, the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl) connected to a CO2Me. When the enolate attacks, it will add to the CH2 part. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-p-tolyl, but the carbonyl is on the other end. So the acrylate is (E)-configuration, meaning the p-tolyl group and the CO2Me are on opposite sides.

When the enolate (from malonate) attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part), the product would have the structure where the malonate's alpha carbon is attached to the CH of the acrylate. So, maybe the product becomes a longer chain with ester groups.

The product A is likely a tricarboxylate. Let me look at the options. Option A for part A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Hmm, that's a structure
