Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, when I'm thinking about luminosity, I don't think mass directly affects it, unless I'm missing something. Oh right, because luminosity mainly depends on radius and temperature. So maybe the mass is a red herring here?

The problem also mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K) and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the astronomers calculated the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So I need to find L1 / L2.

The formula for luminosity of a star (as a black body) is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the luminosity depends on the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

Since T1 = T2, because λ_max is the same for both, then L is proportional to R². So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)². Wait, since R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So the factor should be 2.25. Looking at the options, option A is 2.25. So why is that the case?

Wait, but wait! The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect the calculations? Hmm. Oh, because when a star is moving towards or away from us, it causes a Doppler shift in the wavelength of the emitted light. So, the observed wavelength might not be the same as the emitted one.

Wait, earlier I thought that the peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, but that's the observed wavelength. So, if the star is moving, the emitted peak wavelength would be different, but due to Doppler shift, the observed would be shifted.

So I need to correct the temperatures based on the Doppler effect. Because the observed λ_max is the same, but the actual emitted λ_emitted would be different if the star is moving.

Wait, so let me think. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. So for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, it's moving away (since the velocity is positive, but I'm not sure about the sign convention here. Wait, radial velocity is 700 km/s for Star_2. But wait, Star_1 has radial velocity 0. So Star_2 is moving away from us at 700 km/s, so the light is redshifted. So the observed λ is longer than the emitted.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both. So for Star_1, which is at rest (radial velocity 0), its observed λ is the same as its emitted λ. For Star_2, which is moving away, its observed λ is longer than its emitted λ.

Wait, but for both stars, the observed λ_max is the same. So for Star_2, the emitted λ_emitted would be shorter than the observed λ, because it's moving away, causing a redshift. So λ_emitted = λ_observed * sqrt( (c - v)/(c + v) )? Or is it the inverse? Wait, I think the Doppler shift formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but wait, no, that's for relativistic speeds, but 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light (c is ~3e5 km/s). So v is much smaller than c, so we can use the approximation.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c). Because when a source moves away, the wavelength stretches. So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c), since v is positive when moving away.

So for Star_2, which is moving away at 700 km/s, its observed λ_max is λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c), where v2 is 700 km/s.

Star_1's observed λ_max is the same as Star_2's, so λ_emit1 = λ_obs (since v1 is 0). So I need to relate their emitted wavelengths.

Given that λ_obs = λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c). So λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 + v2/c).

But wait, from the earlier part, since both stars' observed λ's are the same (λ_obs), and that's the same as Star_1's emitted λ. So then, for Star_2, the emitted wavelength is λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c).

But wait, the problem says the stars radiate as black bodies. So the peak wavelength they emit is determined by their temperature. So the actual emitted λ's depend on their temperature via Wien's law.

Wait, let me write the equations.

For Star_1:
λ_emit1 = b / T1.

For Star_2:
λ_emit2 = b / T2.

But we know that the observed λ_obs for Star_2 is λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ_obs.

And for Star_1, λ_obs = λ_emit1.

So set λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

Substituting:

b/T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Rearranged:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) / 1

Wait, no. Let me see:

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the substitution.

Wait, λ_emit1 = λ_obs. Because Star_1 is not moving, so observed λ is same as emitted. So λ_emit1 = λ_obs.

Star_2's observed λ is λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ_obs.

So, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c) = λ_emit1 / (1 + v2/c).

So from Wien's law,

λ_emit1 = b/T1,

λ_emit2 = b/T2.

So,

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

So, T2 is larger than T1? Because (1 + v/c) is greater than 1. But that would mean Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. But Star_2 is moving away, so its emitted wavelength is shifted to longer λ. So if T2 is higher, then from Wien's law, λ_emit2 is shorter. So observed λ_obs for Star_2 is longer than λ_emit2, but for Star_1, λ_obs is λ_emit1.

But according to the earlier equation, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). Wait, that would make T2 higher than T1. So let me plug the numbers.

v2 = 700 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s, so v2/c is 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333.

So (1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.02333.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.02333. So T2 is about 2.33% higher than T1.

Wait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. If Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer. So for the same observed λ, the emitted λ of Star_2 must be shorter than that of Star_1. Because if a star's emitted light is at a shorter wavelength (higher T), but due to moving away, the observed wavelength is stretched to match Star_1's emitted λ.

So that makes sense. So T2 is higher than T1.

So now, the luminosity of each star is L = 4πR²σT⁴.

So L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T2^4.

So the ratio L1/L2 is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We know that R1 = 1.5 R2.

And T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * 1.02333.

So T1/T2 = 1 / 1.02333 ≈ 0.977.

So let's compute each part.

(R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4.

Let me compute 0.977^4.

First, 0.977^2: 0.977 * 0.977 ≈ 0.954529.

Then squared again: 0.954529^2 ≈ 0.911.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute 0.977^1 = 0.977.

0.977^2 = (0.977)*(0.977) = approx:

0.977 * 0.977:

Let me compute 977 * 977:

Well, 977² = (1000 - 23)^2 = 1000² - 2*1000*23 + 23² = 1e6 - 46,000 + 529 = 954,529.

So 0.977^2 = 0.954529.

Now, 0.954529^2:

Compute 0.954529 * 0.954529.

I can approximate this as (0.95 + 0.004529)^2.

But maybe a better approach is to compute 0.954529 * 0.954529.

Let me compute 954529 * 954529, but that's too tedious. Alternatively, I can use the fact that (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b² where a=0.95 and b=0.004529.

Wait, wait, a more accurate way is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Let me compute 0.954529 × 0.954529.

We can compute:

0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

But wait, 0.954529 is 0.95 + 0.004529.

So (0.95 + 0.004529)^2 = 0.95² + 2*(0.95)*(0.004529) + (0.004529)^2.

Compute each term:

0.95² = 0.9025.

2*(0.95)*(0.004529) = 2 * 0.95 * 0.004529 ≈ 2 * 0.00429755 = 0.0085951.

(0.004529)^2 ≈ 0.0000205.

Summing up:

0.9025 + 0.0085951 = 0.9110951.

Plus 0.0000205 is about 0.9111156.

So approximately 0.9111.

So (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.9111.

So now, the ratio L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.9111) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9111.

Compute 2 * 0.9111 = 1.8222.

0.25 * 0.9111 = approx 0.227775.

Add them together: ~1.8222 + 0.227775 = 2.05.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 2.25 multiplied by 0.9111 is (2.25)*(0.9111) = 2.05?

Wait, 2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025. 2.25 * 0.0111 is about 0.025. So total is about 2.05.

Wait, but that would make L1/L2 ≈ 2.05, but the options are all around 2.23 to 2.35. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps my approximation for (0.977)^4 is too rough. Let me compute it more accurately.

Another approach: Let me compute (1 + v2/c) = 1 + 700/(3e5) = 1 + 0.002333... ≈ 1.002333.

No, wait, 700/3e5 is 700/300000 = 0.002333... So (1 + v2/c) = 1.002333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So T1/T2 = 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.99768.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute (0.99768)^2 first.

0.99768 * 0.99768:

Approximating: (1 - 0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00232) + (0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00464 + 0.00000538 ≈ 0.99536538.

So approximately 0.995365.

Now, square that again to get to the fourth power.

(0.995365)^2.

Again, let's compute it as (1 - 0.004635)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.004635) + (0.004635)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00927 + 0.0000215 ≈ 0.9907515.

So approximately 0.99075.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99075.

So now, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.99075) = 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.2282.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking back at the options, option D is ~2.23. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but let me double-check the math to be sure.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation of v/c. Because 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, and c is 3e8 m/s. So 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.002333... So yes, (1 + v/c) is 1.002333, and T2 is T1 * 1.002333.

So T1/T2 is approximately 0.99767.

So (0.99767)^4.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute (0.99767)^2:

0.99767 * 0.99767.

= (1 - 0.00233)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.9953454.

Then, (0.9953454)^2.

Again, (1 - 0.0046546)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0046546 + (0.0046546)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0093092 + 0.0000216 ≈ 0.9907124.

So (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.990712.

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * 0.990712 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990712.

Compute that: 2.25 * 0.990712.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.000712 = 0.001599.

Add them: 2.2275 + 0.001599 ≈ 2.2291.

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23. So the factor is ~2.23.

So the correct option is D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Relating the temperatures
The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) of both stars are the same. Using Wien's law (\(\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}\)), the emitted wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{emit}}\)) of the stars are related to their temperatures. For Star_2, the observed wavelength is redshifted due to its radial velocity (\(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

For Star_1, since it has no radial velocity (\(v_1 = 0\)), \(\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}}\). Equating the observed wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Substituting Wien's law (\(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T}\)):

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Canceling \(b\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Rearranging:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}
\]

### Step 2: Substituting values
The speed of light \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), so:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \approx 1.002333
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the luminosity ratio
The radius of Star_1 is \(R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2\), so:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99767)^4
\]

First, calculate \((0.99767)^2\):

\[
(0.99767)^2 \approx 0.995345
\]

Then, square the result:

\[
(0.995345)^2 \approx 0.990712
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx 0.990712
\]

Now, calculate the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot 0.990712 \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
