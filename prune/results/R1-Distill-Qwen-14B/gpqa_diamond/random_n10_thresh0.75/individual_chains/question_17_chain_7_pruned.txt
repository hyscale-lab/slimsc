Okay, so I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, let's think about this. The problem gives me that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about protonation or anything like that. 

Wait, what's the formation constant again? I remember that the formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−, right? So Kf = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But wait, in this case, the solution has the Ca-EDTA complex already. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. That would mean that the initial concentrations before dissociation are [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] are both zero, but that can't be right. Wait no, actually, the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, no. Wait, the solution is a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the complex is already formed. So at equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02 M. Or is it? Wait, no. Because the complex can dissociate, but given that Kf is a large number (5e10), the complex is very stable. So the dissociation would be minimal.

Wait, but the problem is asking for [Ca²+], the concentration of free calcium ions. So if the complex dissociates a little, we can model it.

So let me denote:
Let the concentration of the complex be 0.02 M. So initially, [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] would be zero. But when some of the complex dissociates, let x be the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− that comes off. So:

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small because Kf is large)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

Then, the formation constant Kf = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So solving for x: x² = 0.02/(5e10) → x² = 2e-12 / 5? Wait, wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12, since 1e-2 /1e10 is 1e-
