Alright, so I've got this problem here about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, okay, I remember that rhombohedral structures have all their lattice parameters equal but with angles that aren't 90 degrees. Oh right, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Interesting.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance involves the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices. Wait, yeah, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + kl + lh) * cos(theta) ) or something like that? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else. Oh, right! For a rhombohedral system, the formula for interplanar distance is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk - hl - kl ) * cos(theta/2) )? Or wait, maybe it's a bit different because of the angles.

Wait, another approach: The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by d = (a²)/(h² + k² + l² - hk cos γ - kl cos β - lh cos α) )^(1/2). Wait, but in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is such that a = b = c, and angles alpha = beta = gamma = theta. So maybe the formula simplifies.

So, for a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c, and all angles are equal (
