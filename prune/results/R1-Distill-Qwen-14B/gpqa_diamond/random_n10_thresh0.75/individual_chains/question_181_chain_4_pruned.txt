Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio question. Hmm, let me think. So the question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops. I remember that the pp chain is one of the main ways the Sun produces energy, especially in the core. The pp chain has different branches, like I, II, and III, right?

Wait, the pp-III branch is the one that produces helium-4, I think. Oh, right! The pp-I branch produces deuterium, and then the pp-II and pp-III build on that. The pp-III branch is crucial because it's the dominant process in the Sun's core for proton-proton fusion, leading to helium production.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino production? Neutrinos are produced in the Sun through various processes. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. Oh wait, but also, the pp chain itself produces neutrinos, specifically electron neutrinos (νe) via the beta plus decay steps.

But wait, the pp-III branch is a part of the pp chain. If the pp-III branch stops, then the entire pp chain would be affected because that's a main pathway for the fusion. So, if pp-III stops, the pp chain's contribution to the Sun's energy production would decrease. But the CNO cycle might still continue, right? Because CNO is another fusion pathway, though it's more dominant in hotter stars.

Wait, but does the CNO cycle produce neutrinos as well? I think the CNO cycle primarily produces carbon-12, but in the later stages, it fuses into helium-4. The neutrinos come from the beta decays in the pp chain. Oh, right, the CNO cycle doesn't produce as many neutrinos because the beta decays are part of the CNO process, but perhaps I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, maybe the CNO cycle doesn't produce neutrinos as significantly as the pp chain does. Wait, no—actually, I think the CNO cycle does produce some neutrinos, but the primary source is the pp chain's beta decays.

Wait, the pp chain is the main source of solar neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos from the pp chain would stop. But wait, the question says that
