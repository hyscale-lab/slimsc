Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m moving in the positive x-direction at 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

I remember that when dealing with velocities in special relativity, you can't just subtract them normally because of the velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is something like (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, the formula might be different depending on the frame. So, since both are moving in the same direction, I need to find the relative velocity of one with respect to the other.

Let me think: Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. To find the relative speed of B from A's frame, I should use the velocity addition formula. So, v_rel = (v_B - v_A) / (1 - (v_B v_A)/(c²)). Wait, wait, no, actually, if A is moving at v_A, and B is moving at v_B relative to the same frame, then from A's perspective, B's speed is v_B minus v_A, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, no, the formula is v_rel = (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_B v_A)/(c²)). Let me plug in the numbers. So v_A is 0.6c, v_B is 0.5c. So the numerator is 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. But since we're talking about the magnitude, it's 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. So
