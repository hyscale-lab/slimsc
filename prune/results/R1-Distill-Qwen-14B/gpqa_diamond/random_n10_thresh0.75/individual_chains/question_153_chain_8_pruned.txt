Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition. Hmm, I need to figure out the products for each of the reactions given. Let's take it step by step.

First, I'll read the question again. So, the question is about three different Michael addition reactions, and I need to determine the major products for each. The options are A, B, and C, with each option providing possible products for A, B, and C.

The reactions are:

1. dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH → A
2. 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + MeOH, H3O+ → B
3. C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the product here is given, and I need to find what C is.

Wait, but looking at the options, each option lists what A, B, and C are. So, perhaps the third reaction is part of the options, and I need to figure out C based on the reaction given. Let me make sure I understand each reaction.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. I think NaOEt is a base, and in the presence of a carbonyl, it would deprotonate something to form an enolate.

Wait, but in a Michael addition, the enolate acts as the nucleophile. So, thinking about the Michael reaction, the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound is the electrophile, and the enolate is the nucleophile.

So, the dimethyl malonate is the nucleophile here. Because dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor. It's a diester, so when treated with a base like NaOEt, it will form an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that structure. The acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. But wait, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the substituents would be on the acrylate.

Wait, wait, maybe I should think about the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The acrylate part is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Wait, no. Let's number the carbons. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the carbonyl is at position 1, the double bond between 1 and 2. So, the third position would
