Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll walk through my thoughts step by step. 

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how it compares to an exoplanet's signal in a light curve. Let me read the problem again.

So, we have a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. When this star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing brightness variations. The question is, if instead, what's causing the brightness variation is an exoplanet, what would the planet's radius need to be relative to the star's radius to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

I remember that the light curve's amplitude depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, as when the planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light. The formula for the change in brightness (delta F) is given by the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. So delta F = (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Wait, but in this case, the star's spots are causing the brightness variation, not the planet. So I need to compare the two scenarios.

The star's one hemisphere (so half of its surface) is covered with spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered with spots. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4πR²) )? Or maybe just 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere?

Wait, the star's surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². The filling factor is 20%, so the area covered is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

The spots are cooler: Teff of 6000K, and spots are 5000K. So when the spots are facing us, they contribute less light than the rest of the star.

The brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view. When the star is such that the spot area is on the side facing us, the total brightness is lower than when the spots are on the far side.

So, the change in brightness (delta F) would be the difference between the star's normal brightness and when the spots are visible. 

Let me think about the flux from the star. The star emits a certain amount of flux. When part of its surface is cooler, the total flux is less. The change in flux when the spots are facing us is the difference between the normal flux and the flux when spots are visible.

The star's total flux without spots is F_total = sigma * Teff^4 * (4π R^2) / (4π D^2) ), but when considering the change, maybe I can normalize things.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the change in brightness relative to the star's total brightness. Let's break it down.

The total flux of the star when no spots are visible is F0 =
