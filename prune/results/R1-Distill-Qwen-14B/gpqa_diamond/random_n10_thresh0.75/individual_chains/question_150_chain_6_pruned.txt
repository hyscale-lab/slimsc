Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. The NMR data is given, so I should probably start by analyzing that to figure out the structure.

Looking at the NMR spectrum:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet. High upfield, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or something. But wait, this is a triplet, so maybe it's coupling with two equivalent protons. Like if the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group?

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, probably aromatic protons. Maybe in a para-substituted benzene ring? So each of these would be two protons, perhaps as the ortho and para positions?

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet. If the first set is for one substituent on benzene, maybe this is another substituent. Wait, but the molecular formula has two benzene rings? Because I see two sets of aromatic protons. So maybe two phenyl groups attached.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Maybe some vinyl protons, like adjacent to an electronegative group or something. Or maybe it's an aromatic proton with some exchange, but more likely vinyl.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, integrating to 2H. So two protons, maybe a CH2 group next to something else. Like OCH2, maybe. Or adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Putting this together: The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2= (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. Which could be two rings (each a benzene is three, but wait, no, wait. Wait, C8H9NO: wait, maybe it's one benzene ring and another ring or double bonds.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. The NMR suggests a possible structure with two benzene rings. Because the aromatic protons are in two different environments. So each benzene ring has substituents. 

Looking at the aromatic protons: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). If each is a pair of protons, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene. So maybe each benzene has a substituent, and each substituent is in the para position. So maybe two para-substituted benzene rings attached to something else.

The 6.27 (bs, 2H) might be a vinyl group, like in a conjugated aldehyde. Like something like CH2=CHO-... or maybe it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

The 3.66 (d, 2H): Could this be an OCH2 group? Because OCH2 would have protons that are split by adjacent groups. For example, if it's part of an ether or an ester. But given the reagents, maybe it's something else.

Wait, the reagents are: first NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aqueous KOH and heat. Hmm. Let me think about that. Sodium nitrite and HCl is typically used for diazotization, which is usually done with aromatic amines. So the compound probably has an aromatic amine group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So N in
