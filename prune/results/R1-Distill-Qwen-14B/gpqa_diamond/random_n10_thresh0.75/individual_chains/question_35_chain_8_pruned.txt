Okay, so I have this problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, angular momentum... Oh right, I remember that spin-½ particles like muons have spin operators that are represented by 2x2 matrices. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operator Ay.

The matrix operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. Wait, I think S is the Pauli Y matrix. Because Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, right? So S here is σy.

So, the matrix Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. Let me write that out. σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So multiplying by c, Ay becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Which is [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalues of a matrix are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix Ay - a I would be [[ -a, -(i h)/(4π) ), [ (i h)/(4π), -a ]].

Wait, no. Let me think again. The matrix Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], where c is h/(4π). So when subtracting a I, the diagonal becomes (0 - a) and (0 -a), so the matrix is [[-a, -i c], [i c, -a]].

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i c)(i c) ) = a² - ( (-i)(i) c² )

Wait, (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c². Let's calculate that. (-i)(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So (-i c)(i c) = (i^2)*(-1) c² → Wait, no, (-i)*(i) = -i² = -(-1)=1. So the term is c² * 1. So determinant is a² - (c² * 1) = a² - c².

Setting determinant to zero: a² - c² =0 → a²= c² → a= ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a= c and a= -c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

Wait, but wait. Wait, because S has eigenvalues ±1, since it's a Pauli matrix. So multiplying by c gives eigenvalues ±c.

So, the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π). So the eigenvalues' real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), and they are real numbers. So the eigenvalues are real.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, and the real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option A is talking about both real and imaginary parts, which doesn't make sense here.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. But our eigenvalues are real, so B is incorrect because eigenvalues are real, no imaginary parts.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A squared, but not of Az. Wait, A is the operator, so A squared would be (c S)^2. S is σy, which squares to identity matrix, because σy² = I. So (c σy)^2 = c² I. So any eigenstate of σy is also an eigenstate of (c σy)^2 because the square is a multiple of identity. So the eigenvectors of Ay are also eigenvectors of A². So the first part of option C is correct. What about the second part, can they be eigenfunctions of Az? Az is the z-component of angular momentum, which is (something like) c * σz. σy and σz don't commute, so their eigenvectors are different. So eigenvectors of Ay cannot be eigenvectors of Az. So option C is correct in saying that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. So C sounds correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the matrix operator's basis functions are probably the basis vectors, but the eigenfunctions are specific vectors that satisfy Ay φ = a φ. So being the basis functions may or may not be the case. For example, in the Pauli matrices, the eigenvectors are specific vectors, not necessarily the basis functions. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. The standard basis is e1=(1,0), e2=(0,1). But for σy, the eigenvectors are (1, i) and (1, -i), right? So they are not the standard basis vectors, which are the basis functions. So the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of Ay. So D is incorrect.

So looking back at the options, the correct statement is option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i\frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i\frac{h}{4\pi} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues \( a \) of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = 0.
\]

Substituting \( A_y - aI \), we get:

\[
\det \begin{bmatrix} -a & -i\frac{h}{4
