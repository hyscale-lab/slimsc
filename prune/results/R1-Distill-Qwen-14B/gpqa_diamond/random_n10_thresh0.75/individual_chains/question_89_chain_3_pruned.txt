Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons or something? Wait, no, 1 and 3 positions. Oh well, moving on.

The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are treated with a base, it's usually an elimination reaction. So, dehydrohalogenation, right? That would form an alkene. But since there are two bromines, maybe it forms a diene? Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... elimination would probably lead to a conjugated diene because the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in a way that when they eliminate, the double bonds form between the respective positions.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the 1 and 3 positions would be on adjacent carbons in the structure. So when KOH is added, the two Br groups would leave, each taking a proton from adjacent carbons, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since both Brs are on adjacent carbons, eliminating both would lead to a conjugated diene. So the product should be 1,3-adamantadiene or something
