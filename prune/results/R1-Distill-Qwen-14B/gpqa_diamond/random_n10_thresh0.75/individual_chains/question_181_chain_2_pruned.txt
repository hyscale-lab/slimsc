Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes based on a hypothetical scenario. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to piece this together.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops about 8.5 minutes ago, and all other reactions continue. I need to find the ratio of the flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux(band1)/flux(band2) is what we're looking for.

First, I remember that the pp chain is responsible for a lot of the Sun's energy production, especially in regions where the temperature is high enough. The pp-III branch is a part of this chain. Oh wait, the pp chain produces protons and eventually leads to helium via the triple-alpha process, right? But wait, I think the main proton-proton chain (pp I) produces a lot of neutrinos, especially electron neutrinos. And the pp-III branch is a specific part of that process. So if it stops, what does that mean for neutrino production?

I think the pp-III branch is involved in higher energy neutrino production. Oh wait, pp-III is where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus to form helium-4. But since the Sun is mostly in the pp-I and pp-II processes, maybe the pp-III isn't as dominant. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The main proton-proton chain steps are:

1. Two protons (p) collide to form a deuteron (D), emitting a positron and a neutrino. This is the pp-I branch.
2. The deuteron captures another proton to form helium-3 (He-3), which is the pp-II branch.
3. He-3 can then either combine with another He-3 to form He-4 (triple-alpha is a different process, but wait, noâ€”pp-III is when He-3 captures a proton to become He-4, but wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, the triple-alpha is at much higher temperatures. So the pp chain occurs in hotter regions. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the details.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch refers to the process where He-3 captures a
