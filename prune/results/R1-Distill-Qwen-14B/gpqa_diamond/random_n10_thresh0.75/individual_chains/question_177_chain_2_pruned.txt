Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, wait, the wavelength of maximum brightness is determined by something called Wien's Law, right? Oh right, Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature, so λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Oh, wait, that's an important point. So T1 = T2.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity refers to the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But I'm not sure how that affects luminosity in this case. Maybe that's a red herring because the problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies, so their intrinsic properties (like temperature, radius) determine luminosity. So maybe radial velocity doesn't factor into the luminosity calculation here, since that's about how fast they're moving, not their physical properties. Or wait, no, because when they move, it affects things like Doppler shift, but since the problem is about computing the luminosity, which is intrinsic, perhaps radial velocity isn't needed. Maybe the velocities are just extra info, or perhaps they relate to something else. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about computing the luminosity factor between the two stars. So the formula for luminosity of a star as a black body is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both are black bodies, this should apply.

So let's write down what we know. 

Star_1: Radius R1 = 1.5 R2. Mass is 1.5 M2. But mass doesn't directly affect luminosity here unless it's related to temperature? Wait, wait, but in the problem, the temperature is already given to be the same because their λ_max is the same. So the masses being different might be a distractor. Because if the stars are main-sequence stars, then mass might relate to luminosity, but the problem gives us specific data about R and T, so probably I should go with that.

So, R1 = 1.5 R2. T1 = T2, since λ_max same.

So L1 / L2 = (4π R1² σ T1^4) / (4π R2² σ T2^4) )

Simplify: 4π, σ, and T^4 (since T1=T2) will cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) = (1.5 R2 / R2 )² = (1.5)^2 = 2.
