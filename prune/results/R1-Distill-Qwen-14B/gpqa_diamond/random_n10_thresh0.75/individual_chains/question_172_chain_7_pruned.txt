Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when atoms are in different energy levels, their excitation depends on temperature. Oh right, this must relate to the Boltzmann distribution.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the ratio of the populations of those energy levels is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2.

I think the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The formula is something like n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(k*T)). Since the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, I can denote that as ΔE = E_i - E_j.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention the statistical weights (g_i and g_j), so I guess they are the same for both stars, or maybe the ratio cancels out. So the ratio of populations would be n1/n2 = 2 = exp(ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait no, wait. Let's think again. For star_1, the number of excited atoms is higher. So n1 > n2. But the energy levels are the same for both stars, right? Because the iron atoms in each star's photosphere are the same element. So ΔE is the same for both stars.

So the ratio n1/n2 = 2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))]

Wait, because if E_i is the higher energy level, then the lower level is E_j. But when you're in a higher energy level, the exponent would be negative, so the population is lower. Wait, but in this case, n1 is the population in a specific energy level for star_1. Wait, perhaps I should clarify.

Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So let's say that the energy level is E. Then, the population of E in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1(E) = 2 n2(E).

Using the Boltzmann factor, n(E) = (g(E)/g) * exp(-E/(kT
