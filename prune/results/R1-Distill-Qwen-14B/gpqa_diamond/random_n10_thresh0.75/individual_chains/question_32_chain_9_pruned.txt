Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy increases significantly due to relativistic effects. The question states that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c, so we're definitely in the realm of special relativity here.

The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the atomic number for lithium is 3, meaning it has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is 3 + 3 = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which is actually a rare isotope, but that's probably not too important for this calculation.

So the nucleus is a heavy ion with charge +3e, but for the purpose of calculating energy, I think the charge might not matter here. What matters is the rest mass energy. Oh right, because in particle physics, when calculating the energy of a moving particle, we use the rest mass energy and multiply by gamma, the Lorentz factor.

The energy in question is the total energy of the nucleus, which is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in particle colliders, the kinetic energy is often what's provided, but sometimes people refer to the total energy. I need to be careful here. The question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think it's asking for the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

So the formula I need is E = gamma * m0c².

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me compute that.

Calculating gamma: v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, but let me compute that accurately. Let me do it step by step. 0.96 squared is indeed 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784: Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yeah, gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is needed. The nucleus is Li-6, so its mass is the mass of 6 nucleons
