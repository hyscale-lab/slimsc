Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are several steps, and some hints provided. Let's break it down.

First, the reaction scheme:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclic ketones. Let's think about each reaction step and see what each tells us about the structure.

Starting with the first step: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So if A has a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde, HCN would add to it. That would form a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an ester, HCN might add differently, but more likely, it's a carbonyl. The product B would have an -OH and a -CN group adjacent perhaps.

Wait, but HCN adds to ketones to form a cyanohydrin. So A is a ketone, and B is the cyanohydrin. So that makes sense.

Next step: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. So if B is a cyanohydrin, which has two hydroxyl groups attached to adjacent carbons (if it's a cyclopentanone, for example, adding HCN would lead to a cyanohydrin with two adjacent OH groups), then the reduction with H2 and Pd would reduce the nitrile group (-CN) to an amine (-CH2NH2?), but wait, no. Wait, in the presence of H2 and a catalyst like Pd, a nitrile would typically be reduced to an amine (-CH2NH2
