Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about which planet is more likely to transit. Let's see what the question says. 

So, there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, which means their minimum masses and orbital periods are known. But the key thing is that the researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. 

Alright, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. The formula I recall is P = R_p / a, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. But wait, actually, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think. The transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But for a given star and planet, the probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Wait, no, maybe it's more about the orbital distance compared to the star's size, but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, I think the transit probability (p) is given by the formula p = (R_s + R_p) / a, but actually, I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the larger the star (R_star), and the smaller the a (closer the planet), the higher the probability. Hmm, let me think again.

Wait, the probability that a planet transits is about how likely its orbital plane is aligned in our line of sight. The formula I think is p = (R_s / a), where R_s is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, I'm not certain. Another source I remember says p = (R* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R*, it's approximately R* / a. 

Wait, no. Wait, I think the transit probability is actually given by the formula p = (R* / a) multiplied by (something else?), or maybe another factor. Let me think. Oh, I think the probability is p = (R* / a) * (something to do with
