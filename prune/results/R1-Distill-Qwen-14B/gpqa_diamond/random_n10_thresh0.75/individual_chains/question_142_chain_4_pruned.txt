Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used in quantum mechanics to describe the state of a system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. The question gives me a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>. Because each term is a projector (like |0><0| and |1><1|) and they're added together and scaled by 1/2, it means the state is equally likely to be in |0> or |1>. So this is a completely mixed state for a single qubit, right?

Now, the question is about where this density matrix sits in the qubit space. I remember that the space of density matrices for a single qubit can be represented as a 3-dimensional space, corresponding to the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), and any single-qubit state can be represented as a point on or inside this sphere.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (x, y, z) such that |r| ≤ 1. So if I can rewrite the given ρ in this form, I can find the vector r.

Let me write out the given ρ:

ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|).

Wait, |0><0| is the same as the projector for the state |0>. Similarly for |1>. But |0> is (1, 0) in computational basis, and |1> is (0, 1). So |0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in (2,2) position. Adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with entries 1 and 1. So when multiplied by 1/2, the diagonal becomes 1/2 and 1/2.

So ρ is:
[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Wait, but I also remember that
