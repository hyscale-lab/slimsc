Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They're using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, wait. The fundamental stateâ€”I think that refers to the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in its ground state. The photon is absorbed, which means energy is added, so the molecule moves to a higher energy state.

But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy states are quantized both for rotation and vibration. So the molecule's energy depends on both rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the question says it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor model accounts for bond vibrations, unlike the rigid rotor which assumes the bond length is fixed. So in the non-rigid case, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions.

But how do the energy levels work here? Let me recall. For a diatomic molecule, the total energy is the sum of rotational energy, vibrational energy, and maybe electronic energy, but I think this question is focusing on rotation and vibration.

Wait, the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that implies the molecule is making a transition from a
