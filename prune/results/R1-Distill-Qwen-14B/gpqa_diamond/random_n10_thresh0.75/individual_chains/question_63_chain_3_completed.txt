Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, I need to find the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to transition to the next lowest energy state. Let me think.

The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, wait. I remember that the rigid rotor model doesn't account for bond vibrations, but the non-rigid (or vibration) model does. So the molecule's energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state usually refers to the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, the molecule is in its ground state, probably the v=0 vibration level and the lowest rotational state, which I think is J=0 for rotation.

But wait, when it absorbs a photon, it can transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what's the next state? The lowest energy transition would be either a vibrational or rotational change. Oh, right, the vibrational energy levels have higher spacing than rotational, so if the photon energy is enough, it'll cause a vibrational transition. Otherwise, it might cause a rotational change.

Wait, but the problem is about the lowest possible energy state. So I think the next state would be the first excited state, which could be either a change in vibrational or rotational state. But since the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy," I think that refers to the next energy level, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. So the minimal energy photon would cause a transition to the next higher state, which could be either the first vibrational excited state (v=1) or the first rotational state (J=1).

Wait, but the energy levels are such that the vibrational energy transitions require higher energy than rotational ones. Because the rotational energy spacing is smaller. So the fundamental vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1) would require a higher energy photon than a rotational transition (like J=0 to J=1).

But since the question is about the next state, regardless of its type, the photon should provide the energy difference between the ground state and the next energy level. But wait, the ground state is the lowest energy state, so the next state is the first excited state, which is the state with the next higher energy. So what is the energy order between the first rotational state and the first vibrational state?

In the quantum harmonic oscillator model, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) hν. The rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The rotational constant depends on the moment of inertia, which is μ R². So for a diatomic, μ is the reduced mass.

So, the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vib = h ν. The rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is ΔE_rot = B [1(1+1) - 0] = 2B.

Which of these is smaller? Let's calculate both.

First, let's compute the vibrational energy difference. The angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. The energy hν is h times ω, since ν = ω/(2π). Wait, actually, ν is frequency, so ω = 2π ν. So E_vib = h ν = (h ω) / (2π).

Wait, no. The angular frequency is ω, so the frequency ν is ω/(2π). So E_vib per quantum is (1/2) h ω for the ground state, but the transition from v=0 to v=1 would be h ω.

Wait, no, actually, the energy levels are E_v = (v + 1/2) h ω. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is E_1 - E_0 = h ω (since 1 + 1/2 - (0 + 1/2) ) = h ω.

So ΔE_vib = h ω.

Then, the rotational energy difference is ΔE_rot = 2B.

So which one is smaller? Let's compute both.

First, compute B. B is the rotational constant, which is (h²)/(8 π² μ R²), where μ is the reduced mass.

Wait, no. The rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), and B = (h²)/(8 π² I), where I is the moment of inertia.

I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms.

So, let's compute μ. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg.

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) amu = 40 /22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 20 and 2 sum to 22, so 20/(20+2) = 20/22 = 10/11 ≈ 0.909 amu.

Wait no, wait: the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). So Mx is 20, My is 2.

μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait no, 20 amu and 2 amu. Wait 20+2=22. So 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 20 * 2 is 40, so 40/(20+2) is 40/22, which is 20/11 ≈1.818 amu. Okay.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu ≈ let me compute that.

1.818 * 1.66e-27 = Let's see, approx: 1.8 *1.66 is about 2.988. So about 2.988e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1.818 * 1.66 = ?

1 *1.66=1.66
0.8 *1.66=1.328
0.018 *1.66≈0.02988
So total: 1.66 +1.328 = 2.988 +0.02988 ≈3.01788. So approx 3.01788e-27 kg.

So I = μ R².

R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So R=2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = (3.01788e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = (3.01788e-27) * (4e-20) = 1.20715e-46 kg m².

Then B = h²/(8 π² I). h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

So compute h²: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Then 8 π² is about 8*(9.8696)≈78.9568.

So denominator is 78.9568 * I = 78.9568 * 1.20715e-46 ≈ let's compute this.

78.9568 *1.20715e-46 ≈ 78.9568 *1.20715 is about 95.2, so 95.2e-46 = 9.52e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.52e-45 ≈ (4.39 /9.52) * 1e-22.

4.39 /9.52 ≈0.461, so B≈0.461e-22 =4.61e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot =2B = 2 *4.61e-23 J =9.22e-23 J.

Wait, and the vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vib = h ω.

h is 6.626e-34 J s, ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Wait a second, that's way bigger than ΔE_rot. So the vibrational transition requires more energy than a rotational one.

So, the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the rotational state, since it requires less energy. So the photon must provide the energy difference for the rotational transition.

But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, what momentum should the photon have in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm. So the next state after the ground state (the lowest energy) is the first excited state, which can be either J=1 (rotational) or v=1 (vibrational), whichever requires less energy.

Since the rotational transition requires less energy (ΔE_rot=9.22e-23 J) versus vibrational (ΔE_vib=2.65e-19 J), the photon must have the energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

Wait, but the question may be considering the molecule in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy where both v=0 and J=0. So the next state is the first excited state, which would be the rotational state since it's lower energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule in a state where it can transition either way, but the photon's energy should match the difference between these two.

Wait, but the problem says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the lowest possible energy is the next higher energy state, which is the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy must match the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but the question is about the photon's momentum. So I need to find the momentum p of the photon such that its energy equals the required ΔE.

Photon energy E = h f, and since f = c / λ, but for momentum p, E = p c. Because the momentum of a photon is p = h f / c = h / (λ c) ? Wait, let me recall the formula. The momentum p of a photon is E / c, because E = pc (since for photons, mass is zero, so E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2 → E=pc).

So p = E / c.

So for the rotational transition, E_rot = 9.22e-23 J.

p_rot = E_rot / c.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p_rot = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the calculations because the options are around 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns.

Wait a second, 1 Ns is 1 kg·m/s. So 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than any of the options. The options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Hmm, that's way off. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused the energy levels. Because I thought the molecule was in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would be either v=1 or J=1. But perhaps the question is considering transitions in both degrees of freedom, but the next state is the next possible state, which could be either. But I have to find the photon that causes the transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the one with the smallest energy difference—so the rotational.

But my calculation gave a momentum that's way lower than any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in computing B.

Let me redo the calculation of B.

B = h²/(8 π² I)

I is μ R².

μ is (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu =40 /22 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27.

Let me compute 1.818 *1.66.

1.818 *1.66:

= (1 + 0.8 + 0.018) *1.66

= 1*1.66 + 0.8*1.66 + 0.018*1.66

=1.66 + 1.328 + 0.02988 ≈3.01788.

So μ ≈3.01788e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, so R =2e-10 m.

I = μ R² =3.01788e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I =3.01788e-27 *4e-20 =12.0715e-47 kg m² =1.20715e-46 kg m².

Now, compute B.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67 J² s².

8 π² ≈78.9568.

So denominator is 8 π² I =78.9568 * 1.20715e-46 = ?

78.9568 *1.20715 = approx 78.9568 *1.2 =94.748, but more accurately:

1.20715 *78.9568.

Let me compute 78.9568 * 1.20715.

78.9568 *1 =78.9568

78.9568 *0.2=15.79136

78.9568 *0.00715≈0.5643.

Adding together: 78.9568 +15.79136=94.74816 +0.5643≈95.3125.

So 95.3125e-46 =9.53125e-45 kg m².

So B =4.39e-67 /9.53125e-45 = approx (4.39 /9.53125) * 1e-22.

4.39 / 9.53125 ≈0.4605.

So B ≈0.4605e-22 J.

Then, the energy difference for rotation from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = B*(2) =0.921e-22 J =9.21e-23 J.

So photon energy E must be 9.21e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p is E/c =9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) =3.07e-31 kg m/s =3.07e-31 Ns.

But looking at the options, the smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is way larger than 3e-31 Ns. So that can't be right. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the photon causing a transition to the next vibrational state. But earlier, the energy difference was about 2.65e-19 J, which would give a momentum of 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns. That's option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28, so not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I need to reevaluate my approach.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (v=0) but the rotational state isn't zero. Wait, the question says it's in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, so J=0 and v=0.

So the next state would be either J=1 or v=1. The problem is asking for the photon that would cause the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the one that requires the least energy, which is the rotational transition.

But my calculation gives a momentum of 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia.

Wait, let me double-check the moment of inertia I.

I = μ R².

μ is (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

But wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass formula. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). So Mx=20, My=2.

Wait, 20*2=40, 20+2=22; so μ=40/22 amu =20/11 ≈1.818 amu. Correct.

Ah, but wait, R is given as 2 angstroms, but perhaps I should use bond length in meters correctly. 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. So R^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I=μ *R² = (3.01788e-27 kg) * (4e-20 m²) =1.20715e-46 kg m². Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing B. Let me compute B again.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 (correct).

8 pi^2 is 8*(9.8696)= 78.957. Correct.

I is 1.20715e-46 kg m². Correct.

So denominator is 78.957 *1.20715e-46 = same as 78.957 *1.20715e-46.

Wait, wait, 78.957 multiplied by 1.20715e-46.

Wait, 78.957 *1.20715e-46 = (78.957 *1.20715) * 1e-46.

78.957 *1.20715 = 78.957 *1.2 =94.7484, and 78.957 *0.00715≈0.564. So total ≈95.3124.

So 95.3124e-46 =9.53124e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.53124e-45 = approx 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, wait, no: 4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 = (4.39 /9.53) * 1e-67 +45 =0.46e-22.

Ah, that's 4.6e-23 J. So 2B is 9.2e-23 J. Correct.

So E_rot =9.2e-23 J.

p = E_rot / c =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns. But this is way smaller than any option.

Hmm, the options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

These are all around 1e-27 to 1e-28, so 3e-31 is way smaller.

Wait, did I get the units wrong for the energy? Because 9.2e-23 J is the energy, but what if the formula for p is not E/c?

Wait, p = E/c is correct for a photon. Because E = pc.

But perhaps I should have considered the energy as the rotational energy, but maybe I should have used the vibrational energy instead. Let's see.

If I use the vibrational energy, E_vib = h ω =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E_vib /c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is close but not exact.

But why would I choose the vibrational transition over rotational? Because the rotational requires less energy but gives a lower momentum. But the question is about the next possible state, which could be either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the first state with higher energy, regardless of the type, but the photon must have enough energy to cause the transition. But that would require the photon to have at least the energy of the rotational transition, but if it's higher, maybe it can cause a vibrational transition.

Wait, but the question states the photon causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state is the one with the minimal possible energy above the ground state, which is the rotational state.

So why am I getting a momentum way below the given options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the reduced mass. Let me check the reduced mass again.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2 ) =40 /22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu. Correct.

Wait, 20 amu is 20 *1.66e-27 kg =3.32e-26 kg.

My=2 amu = 3.32e-27 kg.

Wait, no, wait. Mx =20 amu =20 *1.66e-27 kg =3.32e-26 kg.

My=2 amu =3.32e-27 kg.

So the reduced mass μ is (3.32e-26 *3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27).

Wait, let me compute that.

Numerator: (3.32e-26) * (3.32e-27) = (3.32)^2 *1e-53 ≈11.0224e-53 =1.10224e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 =3.32e-26 +0.332e-26 =3.652e-26 kg.

So μ =1.10224e-52 /3.652e-26 = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

Which matches earlier calculation. So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps I confused the vibrational and rotational energy levels. Let me think about the energy levels again.

In the quantum harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E_v = (v + 1/2) h ω.

So the transition from v=0 to v=1 requires ΔE_vib = h ω.

In the rigid rotor model, E_J = B J (J+1), so the transition from J=0 to J=1 requires ΔE_rot =2B.

So the question is, which transition requires less energy.

But earlier, ΔE_rot is 9.2e-23 J, and ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J, so the rotational transition is much smaller.

So the photon should have the energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

But why is the calculated p so much smaller than the options? Maybe I made a mistake in the computation of B.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, but I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor model. So perhaps this model includes both rotational and vibrational contributions, and the energy levels are a combination of both.

In that case, the energy levels are more complex, but the transition would involve a change in both rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, but the question is about the transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So if the current state is the ground state (v=0, J=0), the next state is the one with the least energy increase, which would be the first excited state, which could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=1), etc.

But among these, which has the least energy?

We know that the rotational energy for J=1 is higher than vibrational energy for v=0 to v=1? Let me compute the energies.

E_vib for v=1 is (1 + 1/2) h ω - (0 + 1/2) h ω = h ω.

E_rot for J=1 is B *1*(1+1) = 2B.

So which is smaller, h ω or 2B?

h ω =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

2B is 9.2e-23 J.

So 2B is smaller. So the next state is J=1, with E=2B.

So the photon needs to have energy 2B.

So then, p = E/c = 9.2e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the fundamental vibrational state (v=0) but the rotational state could be higher.

Wait, no, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest possible energy, so both v=0 and J=0.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model used is the rigid rotor, not the non-rigid. But the question says the non-rigid (rotation-vibration) model. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the energy difference of the states but about the photon's momentum causing the transition. But I'm confident in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error in computing B.

Wait, B = h²/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2/(8 π² *1.207e-46).

Let me compute the numerator: 6.626e-34 squared.

6.626e-34 *6.626e-34 = approx (6.626)^2 =43.9, so 43.9e-68 =4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 pi^2 *1.207e-46.

8 * pi^2 = approx 78.957.

78.957 *1.207e-46 = approx 78.957 *1.207 = 95.3e-46 =9.53e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 = (4.39 /9.53) *1e-22.

4.39 /9.53 ≈0.46, so B≈0.46e-22 J.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which is a larger energy jump, but that would give a larger p, matching the options.

But why would the question say "next state with the lowest possible energy"? That would imply the smallest possible energy increase. So that should be the rotational transition.

But perhaps the options have a mistake, or I'm missing some factor.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of the rotational and vibrational transitions. Or perhaps it's considering the transition to a state with both J and v changing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, not the rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in the combination of both, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me recheck the units.

Wait, h is 6.626e-34 J s. Correct.

R is 2 angstroms =2e-10 m. Correct.

Masses in kg: 20 amu =20 *1.66e-27 kg =3.32e-26 kg.

2 amu =3.32e-27 kg.

So μ is (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27)/(3.32e-26 +3.32e-27) = (1.102e-52)/(3.652e-26) ) =3.017e-27 kg. Correct.

I = μ R² =3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.017e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg m². Correct.

B = h²/(8 pi² I) = (6.626e-34)^2/(8 pi² *1.207e-46) = 4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 =4.6e-23 J. Correct.

So the only thing left is that perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum that corresponds to the vibrational transition.

Because if I compute p for the vibrational transition:

E_vib = h ω =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, option A is 1.9e-28, option C is 1.1e-27. So 8.83e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28), but it's not exactly matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_vib. Let me recompute.

E_vib = h ω.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

ω=4e14 rad/s.

So E_vib=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p = E_vib /c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 Ns.

Hmm. So none of the options exactly match this. But option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of this.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the energy difference for the rotational transition.

Earlier, the rotational transition's p was 3.07e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than the options. So that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would have a ΔE_rot = B*(2*3) – B*(0*1) =6B.

Wait, but that would require more energy than J=0 to J=1, so it's higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the transition to a state with both J and v changed, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotation but only the vibration, but the question says it's using the non-rigid rotor model, so both are considered.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the energy levels as a combination of rotation and vibration, but the minimal energy transition is the vibrational one because it's allowed. Wait, but the allowed transitions for a photon are usually in vibrational or rotational, depending on the selection rules.

In the rigid rotor, dipole transitions require delta J = ±1, but in vibration, delta v= ±1. But for a diatomic, the dipole moment changes during vibration, so vibrational transitions are allowed, but rotational transitions are also allowed if there's a change in dipole moment during rotation. So perhaps the transition could involve both. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energy levels as a sum of rotational and vibrational contributions, and the next state is the first one where either changes. But since the question is about the next state, which is the minimal energy, the rotational is lower.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the rotational energy.

Wait, B is the rotational constant in Joules, so for J=0 to J=1, delta E is 2B.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the moment of inertia differently. Wait, perhaps the bond length R is given, but is it the equilibrium bond length, and does it change during vibration? Well, in the non-rigid rotor, R is allowed to vary, so perhaps the moment of inertia is a function of v, but for the ground state, perhaps R is at its equilibrium value.

Wait, but in the ground state, v=0, so R is at equilibrium. So the calculation of B is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is looking for the photon that causes a transition to the first excited vibrational state, regardless of energy. But that would be a much higher energy and momentum, matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next vibrational state and the photon's energy is the vibrational quantum. So p would be 8.83e-28 Ns, but that's not in the options.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for B. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for B is B = h²/(8 pi^2 I). Yes.

But perhaps the rotational energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) ) * B.

So for J=0 to J=1, delta E is 2B.

So everything correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state where both J and v change. But that complicates the energy calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy for the first allowed transition in the non-rigid rotor model, which could be a combination of both.

But without knowing the exact model, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's energy being the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, the energy difference for the fundamental vibration is h ω.

The energy difference for rotation is 2B.

So the minimal energy change is 2B.

So the photon must have energy E = 2B.

So p = E/c = 2B/c.

Compute 2B:

2 *4.6e-23 J =9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns.

But again, the options don't include this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model, which would ignore the bond length change due to vibration. But the problem says non-rigid, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in the rotational level, but also considering the vibrational energy. So the next state is J=1, v=0.

So E_rot =2B.

p =2B /c = (9.2e-23 J) /3e8 m/s =3.07e-31 Ns.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let me recompute B using exact numbers.

Compute B:

h =6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value).

h² = (6.62607015e-34)^2 =43.897e-68 J² s².

8 pi² = 8 * (pi)^2 ≈8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

I =3.01788e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.01788e-27 *4e-20 =1.20715e-46 kg m².

Denominator:8 pi² * I =78.9568 *1.20715e-46 =95.29e-46 ≈9.529e-45 kg m².

So B =43.897e-68 /9.529e-45 ≈4.605e-23 J.

So 2B=9.21e-23 J. Correct.

p =9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns.

Hmm. I'm stuck. None of the options seem to match. Perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum for a transition to the first vibrational state, which would be E=2.65e-19 J, p=8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 is closest to option C (1.1e-27), but not quite. Wait, option C is 1.1e-27, which is an order of magnitude higher than my computed 8.8e-28.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ.

Wait, μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) * amu.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ= (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

So converting to kg: 1.818 *1.66e-27 kg → 3.017e-27 kg. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length R is 2 angstroms but in the model, the bond length is used in a different way. For example, maybe R is in a different unit or calculation.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's energy to cause a transition to the next vibrational state, which would be option A's p=1.9e-28 Ns.

But why would the energy be 1.9e-28 * 3e8 =5.7e-20 J. But h ω is 2.65e-19 J. So that's a third.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the energy levels.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy is B J (J+1), but perhaps I should use J=0 to J=2, but that would require 6B, which is higher than the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a different energy calculation, like the centrifugal distortion, but that's more advanced.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon to cause a transition to the next state, which is vibrationally higher, but not just the next in energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the first excited state, which could be either J=1 or v=1, but the photon's energy must match the vibrational transition, because even though it's higher energy, it's the next state in terms of vibrational excitation.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the photon's momentum in terms of energy.

The photon's energy E is the energy difference between the initial and final states. The initial state is v=0, J=0.

The final state could be either:

a) v=1, J=0 → E =h ω.

b) v=0, J=1 → E=2B.

c) v=1, J=1 → E =h ω + 2B.

The question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, which is the one with the least E. So a) and b) are the first options.

Between a) and b), since 2B < h ω, the photon should have E=2B.

But again, that gives p=3.07e-31, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state where both J and v change, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of the vibrational and rotational transitions, but that would be higher than either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, and the answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns.

But with p=8.8e-28, which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly. So perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the vibrational energy.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_vib = h * w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p =E_vib /c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

The options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

So 8.8e-28 is not among the options. The closest is option D (1.4e-28) and option A (1.9e-28). But 8.8e-28 is about 5 times option A and 6 times option D.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of h or w.

Wait, h is exactly 6.62607015e-34 J s.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

E =6.62607015e-34 *4e14 =2.65042806e-19 J.

p =2.65042806e-19 /3e8 =8.8347602e-28 Ns.

Still the same result.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value for the speed of light, like 3e8 m/s, which I used. Or maybe 2.998e8, but that wouldn't change it much.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy in terms of the quantum number change. For a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are quantized, and the photon must have energy equal to the difference between two adjacent levels. So the minimal energy photon would cause a transition from v=0 to v=1.

So the photon's momentum is 8.83e-28 Ns, but again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would be 6B. Let's compute that.

6B=6 *4.6e-23=2.76e-22 J.

p=2.76e-22 /3e8=9.2e-31 Ns.

Still way too small.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The options suggest that the correct answer is around 1e-27 to 1e-28.

Looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps the formula for B is different. B is sometimes given by B = (h²)/(8 π² I), which I used. But sometimes, it's written as B = (h²)/(4 π² I) * (1/(2I)).

Wait, no, the standard formula is B = (h²)/(8 pi² I).

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is given by E_J = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1. But no, the units here are in Joules.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of wavenumbers and then convert, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy to be the rotational energy difference, and the momentum is 3.07e-31 Ns, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is about the transition from the ground vibrational state to the first excited vibrational state, which would be a much higher energy, hence the momentum would be about 8.8e-28, which is close to option A (1.9e-28), but not exactly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the reduced mass in a different way. Let me recompute μ.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2) / (20+2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu =1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ =1.818 *1.66053906660e-27 ≈3.017e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the possible answers.

The options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

The computed p for the vibrational transition is 8.8e-28. None of the options match exactly, but perhaps the question is expecting the rotational transition's p of 3.07e-31, which is way too small.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's energy causing a transition to the next vibrational state, and the options are approximations. But 8.8e-28 is not close to any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me recheck.

E_vib = h * ω =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Yes.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition's frequency as 4e14 Hz, not rad/s.

Wait, ω is given as 4e14 rad/s, which is 8e13 Hz, since ω=2 pi ν.

So ν = ω/(2 pi) =4e14 /6.283 ≈6.366e13 Hz.

So E_vib = h ν =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈4.22e-20 J.

p =4.22e-20 /3e8 =1.407e-28 Ns.

Ah! That's option D) 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, that makes sense.

So perhaps I made a mistake in using ω as the frequency, when actually I should have used ν=ω/(2 pi).

Because in the question, w is given as angular frequency (ω=4e14 rad/s). So the frequency ν is ω/(2 pi) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So E_vib = h ν =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈4.22e-20 J.

p =4.22e-20 /3e8 =1.407e-28 Ns.

Which matches option D) 1.4e-28 Ns.

Ah, that must be the mistake. I used ω directly, but the correct frequency is ν=ω/(2 pi).

So the correct answer would be D) 1.4e-28 Ns.


To determine the momentum of the photon that causes the molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between the rotational and vibrational states of the diatomic molecule.

### Key Information:
- **Molecule**: Diatomic with atoms X and Y.
- **Masses**:  
  - \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \), \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \).  
  - Reduced mass:  
  \[
  \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
  \]
  Converting to kg:  
  \[
  \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
  \]
- **Bond length**: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).  
- **Angular frequency**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).  
- **Moment of inertia**:  
  \[
  I = \mu R^2 = (3.017 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
  \]
- **Rotational constant**:  
  \[
  B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}, \quad \text{where } h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s}.
  \]
  Substituting values:  
  \[
  B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
  \]
- **Energy difference for rotational transition**:  
  \[
  \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
  \]
- **Energy difference for vibrational transition**:  
  The vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_v = (v + \frac{1}{2}) h \omega \). For \( v = 0 \to v = 1 \):  
  \[
  \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
  \]

### Analysis:
The molecule is initially in the fundamental state (\( v = 0, J = 0 \)). The next state with the lowest possible energy corresponds to the smallest energy difference. Comparing the rotational and vibrational energy differences:
- \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)  
- \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)

Since \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} < \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \), the photon must provide the energy difference for the rotational transition.

### Photon Momentum:
The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For the rotational transition:
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
\]
This value is far smaller than any of the given options, suggesting the problem instead considers the vibrational transition.

### Vibrational Transition Momentum:
For the vibrational transition, the energy difference is \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). The corresponding momentum is:
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
\]
This value is also not an exact match to the options, but the closest match is **Option D** (\( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)).

### Final Answer:
The problem likely assumes the vibrational transition, with the angular frequency \( \omega \) converted to frequency \( \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \). Recomputing with \( \nu \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz} \):
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.366 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
\]
The momentum becomes:
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.407 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
\]
This matches **Option D** (\( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)).

ANSWER: D
