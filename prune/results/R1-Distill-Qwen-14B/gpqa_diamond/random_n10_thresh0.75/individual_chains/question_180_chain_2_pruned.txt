Okay, let's see. I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, so the question is about finding the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Let me read it again.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Right, e is the elementary charge, so each has twice that. The mass is negligible, so maybe we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or something else related to motion—it's all about potential energy, I think.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the setup is like this: one charge is at point P, and the other twelve are all located on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. I guess they're placed symmetrically or something since they're constrained at that distance.

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. Oh, right, in electrostatics, the potential energy of a configuration of charges is the work done to bring them together from infinity. But wait, since all the charges are fixed except one, I need to think about how the potential energy is calculated here.

Wait, but in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the other twelve are arranged around it. So, each of the twelve is at 2 meters from P. But I'm trying to find the minimum potential energy of the system. Hmm, but wait, how does that work? Because when you bring charges together, you have to do work against their mutual repulsion.

Wait, but in this case, all the twelve charges are at the same distance from P. So, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of the potentials created by each of the twelve charges at the position of the 13th, plus the potential between each of the twelve charges themselves.

Wait, no. The potential energy of a system of multiple charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So, you have to consider each pair and calculate their contribution. But since all the twelve are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P, how do the distances work?

Let me think. The 13th charge (at P) is 2 meters away from each of the twelve. So, the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the twelve is (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2m). But wait, the potential energy for each
