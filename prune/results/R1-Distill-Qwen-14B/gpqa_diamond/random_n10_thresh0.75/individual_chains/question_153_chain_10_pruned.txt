Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The key here is that the nucleophile, usually an enolate, attacks the beta position, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

Looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate is one of the reactants. Dimethyl malonate is a diethyl ester of malonic acid, right? Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, so it's an enone-like structure. The (E) configuration means the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other.

In the Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. But wait, in the presence of a base like NaOEt (sodium ethoxide), the malonate would deprotonate to form the enolate. The enolate would attack the acrylate's beta carbon.

So the acrylate has a structure like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituents are in the E configuration. When the enolate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part), it would add across the double bond. The addition would follow the conjugate addition mechanism, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond between the malonate's alpha carbon and the acrylate's beta carbon.

Wait, the product after the Michael addition would have the malonate's two carbonyl groups attached to the new carbon from the acrylate. So when the enolate attacks, the acrylate's CH2 becomes connected to the malonate's CH2(CO2Me)2. So the product would have a longer carbon chain.

The structure after the addition would be something like CH2(CO2Me)2 attached to CH2-C(C6H4-4Me)=CH2? Wait, maybe I should draw this out. The acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. When the enolate of dimethyl malonate (which is CH2(CO2Me)CO2Me-) attacks the beta position, the addition would occur at the CH2 part. So the product would have the structure CH2(CO2Me) attached to the CH2 from the acrylate, and the rest would be connected.

Wait, the enolate would attack the acrylate, leading to the attack at the beta carbon (the CH2). So the acrylate would be CH2-CH(CO2Me)-p-tolyl, but wait, no, the acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the Michael addition would form a new bond between the enolate's alpha carbon (the
