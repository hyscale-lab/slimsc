Okay, I'm trying to tackle this physics problem. Let me read it again. So, a light beam is going through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, without any motion involved, the speed would just be 1/n since c is given as 1 here.

But wait, the glass is moving. So this is a case where the medium (glass) is moving relative to the observer. I think this involves the concept of relative velocity and maybe some relativity. Oh right, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly because of the way velocities transform between frames.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the glass is moving at velocity v. So the glass is a material medium moving through the lab frame. The light is propagating within this moving glass. So the question is about the speed of light as observed in the lab frame.

In Newtonian mechanics, you'd just add velocities. The light in the glass is moving at v_light = (1/n) in the glass's frame. If the glass is moving at v in the lab, then the lab would see the light's speed as (1/n) + v. But that's probably not correct because of relativity.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Wait, in reality, according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light is always c (or 1 in these units) in any inertial frame. But the medium's motion might affect the direction or perhaps the observed speed due to other factors, but the speed itself can't exceed c.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the speed of light in the medium is 1/n, right? But if the medium is moving, then in the lab frame, how does that affect the speed of light? Or is it that the speed of light in the medium is still 1/n, regardless of the medium's motion.

Hold on, I'm getting confused. Let me think about this again.

In the rest frame of the glass, light travels at 1/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, what's the speed of the light beam?

But wait, in the lab frame, the speed of light in a moving medium... Hmm, I think this is where the Doppler effect comes into play, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's about relativistic velocity addition. Because if the glass is moving, the light's velocity in the lab frame would be (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²), where u' is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame.

Wait, but wait. The speed of light in the glass's frame is 1/n, direction-wise same as the glass's velocity. So u' would be (1/n) in the same direction as the glass's velocity, which is v.

So applying the velocity addition formula, u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v)/c²]

Substituting u' = 1/n, c=1:

u = [ (1/n) + v ] / [1 + ( (1/n) * v ) ]

Which can be rewritten as (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/(n)).

Wait, let's factor numerator and denominator. Let me write it as (v + (1/n)) / (1 + (v/n)).

Wait, I can factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (v n + 1)/n

Denominator: (n + v)/n

So when I divide, (v n +1)/(n) divided by (n +v)/(n) equals (v n +1)/(n +v).

Wait, because denominator is (n +v)/n, so reciprocal is n/(n +v).

So the entire thing becomes (v n +1) * [n/(n +v)] ) / n?

Wait, no, let me compute it properly.

Wait, u = [ (1/n) + v ] / [ 1 + (v*(1/n)) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate the fraction:

Numerator: 1 + v n

Denominator: n + v

So u = (1 + v n) / (n + v )

Hmm, that's the same as (n v + 1)/(n +v).

Looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). Oh so that's what I got. So is that the answer?

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, if the medium is moving, does the speed of light in the medium change? No, I think the speed is fixed in any frame. Wait, but no, because in the medium's frame, the speed is 1/n. But when the medium is moving, the lab frame would observe a different velocity.

Ah, but wait, according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. But here, the medium is moving. So if the light is in the medium, but the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed? Because from the lab's perspective, the medium is moving, but light still must travel at c.

Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought before. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let me think again. If the glass is moving at velocity v, what's the speed of light relative to the lab?

In the lab frame, the glass is moving, but the light is within the glass. So according to relativity, the light should still travel at speed c (1) in the lab frame, regardless of the glass's motion. So the answer would be 1, which is option B.

But wait, that can't be right. Because if the medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium is 1/n relative to the medium. But from the lab frame, the light's speed can't be more than 1, right?

Wait, no, according to relativity, the speed of light in any frame is c. So regardless of the medium's motion, the lab will observe the light moving at speed 1.

Wait, so that would make the answer B) 1.

But wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier calculation. Which approach is correct?

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the medium's movement.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light travels at 1/n. So if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, but light is moving at 1/n in the glass's frame.

But according to relativity, in the lab frame, the light's speed would still be 1. Because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the medium is moving. Hmm, perhaps the scenario is more about light in a moving medium, so the speed is different.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused because in reality, the speed of light in a medium depends on the frame. Or does it? Wait, no, in reality, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So even if the medium is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame is c.

Wait, but that doesn't quite make sense because the medium's motion should affect the light's speed. Or does it?

Wait, in reality, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but that's in the medium's rest frame. So when the medium is moving, the lab frame would see the light moving at a different speed.

But according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab frame must be c. So this implies that the speed of light in the lab is always c, regardless of the medium's motion.

Wait, that can't be right because if I have a medium moving towards me, the light should be blueshifted in frequency but still moving at speed c.

Wait, but velocity addition in relativity says that you can't just add velocities the way you do in classical mechanics. So if the medium is moving at v, and light in the medium is moving at 1/n in the medium's frame, then what is its speed in the lab frame.

Hmm, perhaps I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

In the medium's frame, the light is moving at u' = 1/n in the same direction as the medium's motion (since the medium is moving toward the observer in the lab, and the beam is also in the same direction).

So in the medium's frame, the light's velocity is u' = 1/n (since it's moving in the same direction as the medium's velocity). The medium itself is moving at v in the lab.

So according to the velocity addition formula, the lab measures the light's speed u as:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² )

But since c is 1, that becomes:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v)

Substituting u' = 1/n:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate denominators:

Numerator becomes 1 + v n,

Denominator becomes n + v.

So,

u = (1 + v n) / (n + v )

Which is (n v +1)/(n +v), same as option A.

But wait, according to relativity, the speed of light should be c, which is 1 in these units. So how come this calculation gives a different value?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the velocity addition formula should ensure that if u' is c, then u is also c.

Wait, let me test that. Suppose u' is 1 (c). Then:

u = (1 + v) / (1 + v ) = 1. Which is correct.

But in this problem, u' is 1/n, which is less than 1, so the velocity addition formula can give a different speed.

Wait, but isn't that contradicting relativity? Because the speed of light should still be c in the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction. Because the medium is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving in the same direction. So perhaps the light's velocity in the medium's frame is 1/n, and we're adding that to the medium's velocity v in the lab frame.

But according to the velocity addition formula, the lab frame would see the light moving at (1/n + v) / (1 + (v)/(n) )

Wait, but according to relativity, light must always move at 1 in the lab. So perhaps the assumption that u' is 1/n is wrong.

Wait, perhaps in the medium's frame, the speed of light is 1/n, but that's only in the medium's rest frame. When the medium is moving, the lab frame observes the light moving at c. So perhaps the correct answer is 1.

But now I'm really confused. Which is it?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the Galilean transformation, which would make u = u' + v. But in that case, u would be (1/n) + v. But looking at the options, none of them have that except perhaps if v is small and n is around 1. But the options don't seem to match that.

Wait, the options are A to D. Let me look again.

Option B is 1. So if the answer is 1, then it's B. But according to my earlier calculation, it's A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to think that the speed of light in the lab is 1, regardless of the medium's movement, because of the postulate of relativity.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light in a medium is c/n in the medium's frame. So when the medium is moving, the lab would see the light moving at (1/n + v) / (1 + v/(n)) as per the velocity addition formula.

Which would make the answer option A.

But if the answer is 1, then it's option B.

Hmm. I think the key is to realize that the speed of light in the lab frame must be c. Because according to relativity, no matter what frame you're in, light moves at c. So regardless of the medium's velocity, the light's speed in the lab frame is 1.

But wait, that's only if the medium's frame is moving. No, wait, the medium is moving, but the light's speed is always c.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises between the light's speed in the medium's frame and the lab frame. In the medium's frame, the light's speed is 1/n. But in the lab frame, it's 1.

Ah, that would make sense. So the answer is B) 1.

But wait, wait, that would mean that the movement of the medium doesn't affect the speed of light in the lab frame, which aligns with relativity. So despite the medium's motion, light must travel at c in the lab.

So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, but then in the velocity addition formula, if the medium is moving at v, and in its frame the light is moving at 1/n, then in the lab frame the light's velocity would be (1/n +v)/(1 + (1/n)v) = [ (v n +1) ] / (n +v)

Which can't be 1 unless v n +1 = n +v, which would imply v(n-1)=n-1, so v=1 or v=1.

Wait, that can't be correct in general.

Wait, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong and the correct approach is that the speed of light in the lab is 1, so the answer is B.

But I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me try to think of it another way.

Imagine the glass is stationary. Then the light's speed is 1/n. But if the glass is moving, does that affect the speed? According to relativity, the speed of light in the lab must be 1 regardless of the medium's movement.

Wait, but that's only if the light is in a vacuum. If the medium is moving, perhaps the speed is different. Or perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a trick question. Because in reality, the speed of light in any inertial frame is always c. So the answer is B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the speed relative to the medium, so it's 1/n, but that's not what the question is asking.

The question is asking the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So maybe the answer is (1 + n v)/(n +v), which is option A.

Wait, but according to relativity, that's not possible because the speed of light can't exceed c. So let's see, if v is positive and small, what's the behavior.

Suppose n=1 (vacuum), then (1 +v)/(1 +v) = 1. Which is correct.

If n is large, say n=2, v=0.5, then (1 + 2*0.5)/(2 +0.5) = (2)/(2.5)=0.8, which is less than 1. So that's acceptable.

If v is very large, but in reality v can't be near c because the medium's speed is non-relativistic? Or perhaps the question is assuming non-relativistic speeds.

But regardless, according to the velocity addition formula, the speed would be as in option A.

But according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab is 1.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the frames. The medium's frame is moving, but the light's speed in the medium is 1/n. But in the lab frame, the light's speed must be 1.

So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in the lab is still c. So the answer is B.

But I'm not fully confident. Maybe I should find an example.

Imagine the medium is moving at velocity v towards the observer. In the medium's frame, the light is moving at 1/n. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)v) = (v n +1)/(n + v), as I found earlier.

But according to relativity, the speed must be 1. So what's the mistake here?

Wait, perhaps the assumption that the light's speed in the medium's frame is 1/n is wrong in a moving medium. Or maybe the velocity addition formula needs to be applied differently.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the light's speed in the medium's frame is always c. So in the medium's frame, the speed is 1, but in the lab, it's also 1. So the answer is B.

Wait, but that's not correct because the medium is moving, so the lab would see the light's speed as 1, which is the same as in the medium's frame.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because if the medium is moving, the light should have a different velocity in the lab frame.

Wait, maybe I should think about the velocity of the light in the lab frame. If the medium is moving, but the light's speed in the lab is still 1, then the answer is B.

But I'm getting myself into a loop here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering relativistic effects and is expecting a classical approach. In that case, the speed would be (1/n) + v, but none of the options match that. Alternatively, using the relativistic velocity addition formula, which gives option A.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the light's speed is determined by the medium's speed plus its own speed in the medium. But in reality, relativity says it's more complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the options represent. Option B is 1, which would imply that the speed of light is always 1 in the lab, regardless of the medium's motion. So that's consistent with relativity.

So I think the correct answer is B) 1.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The glass has an index of refraction \( n \), and light travels at a speed of \( \frac{1}{n} \) in the glass's rest frame. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativity of Light Speed**: According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always \( c = 1 \) in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or medium. However, in a medium with refractive index \( n \), the speed of light is \( \frac{1}{n} \) in the medium's rest frame.

2. **Velocity Addition in Relativity**: When the medium is moving relative to the lab frame, the speed of light in the lab frame is not simply the sum of the light's speed in the medium and the medium's velocity. Instead, the relativistic velocity addition formula must be used:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u'v}
   \]
   Here, \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the medium's frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the medium relative to the lab.

3. **Substitution and Simplification**: Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) into the formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]
   Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
   \]
   This matches the expression in **Option A**.

4. **Relativistic Postulate**: While the relativistic velocity addition formula gives \( u = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v} \), the speed of light in the lab frame must always be \( c = 1 \) according to the postulates of special relativity. This creates a conflict, as the derived expression does not always yield \( 1 \).

5. **Conclusion**: The correct interpretation is that the speed of light in the lab frame is always \( 1 \), regardless of the medium's motion. This aligns with the fundamental principle of relativity, making **Option B** the correct answer.

### Final Answer:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( 1 \), consistent with the postulates of relativity.

Answer: B
