Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, harmonic oscillators I've heard of before, but relativistic? That adds a twist because relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct one.

Wait, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy at maximum speed would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so I can't just use the classical formula. Relativistic effects must be considered.

In relativity, the expressions for energy and momentum are different. The total energy isn't just kinetic; it includes rest mass energy. The kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So I need to think about how the energy relates to the potential energy in this system.

In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². So the total energy E at any point is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. At maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential: E = (1/2)kA². At maximum speed, which occurs when x=0, all energy is kinetic.

Wait, but in relativity, when x=0, the velocity is maximum, so all the energy is kinetic. So E = (γ - 1)mc². But wait, no, wait again. The total energy is actually the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So E = γmc² = (1/2)kA². Because when x is A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic is zero. So E = (1/2)
