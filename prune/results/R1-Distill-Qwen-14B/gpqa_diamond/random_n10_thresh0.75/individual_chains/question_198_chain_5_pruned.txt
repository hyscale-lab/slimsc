Okay, I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of equilibrium problems. But let's take it step by step.

So the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the ones with two SCN- ligands, so Co(SCN)_2^2+ maybe? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, let me think. The stability constants are given for the complexes, and each β corresponds to the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ions.

Wait, I think the stability constants are for the formation of Co(SCN)_n complexes. The first one, β1, is for the monomeric complex, maybe Co(SCN). Then β2 would be for Co(SCN)_2, and so on up to β4, which is Co(SCN)_4. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact definitions. Right, the stability constant β_n is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n ligands. So for each step, adding another SCN- ion.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the
