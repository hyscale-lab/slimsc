Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When we observe this star, the brightness variations due to rotation look like they could be from an exoplanet. The task is to find out what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as the spots do.

Hmm, so the key here is to compare the brightness dip caused by the planet to the dip caused by the spots. The question is asking: if the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would cause the same amplitude in the light curve.

I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, in this case, the star itself has spots. So the total brightness variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of view. So the dip in brightness isn't just a simple transit; it's more complicated because the spots are cooler and cover part of the star.

I think the problem requires calculating the total change in brightness due to the spots, and then setting that equal to the change caused by a planet transit, then solve for Rp.

Let me break it down:

First, the star's brightness without spots is L = 4πRstar² σ Teff⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The spots are cooler. The temperature difference is 1000 K, so spot temperature is 5000 K.

The spots cover a hemisphere, but only 20% of that hemisphere's area. So the filling factor is 0.2. The area of a hemisphere is 2πR², so the spot area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, actually, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So if the hemisphere area is 2πR², the spot area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R².

Each spot emits less light. The flux from a spot is σ T_spot^4. The flux from the surrounding area is σ T_star^4.

When the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, so part of the star's light is blocked, but wait no, the spots are part of the star; they are cooler regions. So when the spot is visible, the total flux from the star is lower.

Wait, actually, the star's total flux without any spots is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

When a spot is visible, it contributes less flux. The change in flux (ΔL) would be the area of the spot multiplied by the difference in flux between the spot and the surrounding.

So when the star is rotating, the total flux from the star will vary as the spots come into view.

But
