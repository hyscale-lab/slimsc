Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I think I remember that diatomic molecules have two atoms connected by a bond, and their movement can be modeled in terms of both rotation and vibration. The question is about the momentum a photon needs to have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next state. The problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." I'm a bit confused, but I think that refers to the next higher energy level, maybe the first excited state.

The molecule is modeled as a non-rigid rotor—wait, no, the question says the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. So this model accounts for both rotational and vibrational energy states.

But wait, the options are about momentum, so maybe this is about the photon's momentum. Oh right, because when a photon is absorbed, it imparts momentum to the molecule, causing it to transition to a higher energy state.

So I need to find the photon's momentum that causes the molecule to go to the next energy state. To find the momentum, I probably need to find the energy difference between the states and then relate that to the photon's energy, and then find the momentum from the energy.

Wait, photons have energy E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is frequency. Also, the momentum p of a photon is related to its energy by E = pc, where c is the speed of light. So p = E/c.

So the steps would be: find the energy needed to transition, compute the photon's energy, then find p.

But wait, what's the energy being transitioned between? The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. The next state would be the first excited state. But wait, in molecular energy levels, the energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. So I might need to consider the energy levels for both.

Wait, no, the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." Hmm, that's a bit unclear. Wait, maybe it's the next vibrational state, or the next rotational state, whichever requires less energy. Or perhaps the transition is purely vibrational or purely rotational. Wait, I'm a bit confused on this.

Wait, I should think about the energy levels. For a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot. The vibrational part is quantized, and so is the rotational part.

The fundamental state is the ground state, so the vibrational quantum number v=0 and rotational quantum number J=0. So the next state would be either increasing v to 1 (vibrational first excited) or J to 1 (rotational first excited). But which requires less energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels have a spacing of (1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. The rotational energy levels have a spacing of something like (h^2 / (8π² I)) where I is the moment of inertia. I need to calculate which energy is smaller to see which transition happens.

So let's compute both and see which is smaller.

First, let's compute the vibrational energy difference. The energy between v=0 and v=1 is (3/2 h w). Wait, no, the energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ( (1 + 1/2) - (0 + 1/2) ) h w = (1) h w. So ΔE_vib = h w.

Wait, no, wait. For the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is (1 + 1/2 - (0 + 1/2)) h w = (1) h w. So ΔE_vib = h w.

Now for rotational energy. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = [ (J (J+1) ) / (2I) ] h^2, where I is the moment of inertia. For diatomic molecules, I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

Wait, so the moment of inertia I = μ r². The reduced mass μ is (M_x * M_y) / (M_x + M_y). But the masses are given in amu, so I need to convert them to kg.

Given:

Mx = 20 amu

My = 2 amu

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate that.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ (approx 1.8 * 1.66 = 2.988) so about 3.027e-27 kg? Let's do exact computation:

1.818 * 1.6605390666e-27 = 

1.818 * 1.6605390666e-27 = 

1.818 * 1.6605390666 is approximately 1.818 * 1.66 = let's compute 1.8 *1.66=2.988, 0.018 *1.66=0.02988. So total about 3.01788. So μ ≈ 3.01788e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = 3.01788e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01788e-27 *4e-20 = 1.20715e
