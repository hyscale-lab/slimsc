Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through it carefully. I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but I'll take it step by step.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. 

The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor. Also, the point P is at a distance l from the center of the cavity, and l is greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. Wait, so l is the distance from the cavity's center to P, and s is the distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity. So the line from the conductor's center to P makes an angle theta with the line from the conductor's center to the cavity's center.

I'm trying to remember how charges are distributed in such a setup. Oh right, when you have a cavity inside a conductor, any charge placed inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, the inner surface must develop a charge equal and opposite to the charge inside the cavity. So if there's +q inside, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q. Then, because the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor was uncharged. So when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q induced on it. But since the conductor itself is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, so inner surface is -q, outer is +q. So that's correct.

But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so after putting +q inside, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, it's as if the charge is all located at the center of the conductor. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge will distribute uniformly, leading to the field outside being similar to that of a point charge at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the cavity isn't concentric with the conductor because the centers are separated by s. That complicates things. Oh, right, because the charge is placed in a non-concentric cavity, the induced charges might not be uniform on the inner and outer surfaces. Hmm, wait, but in electrostatics, the charges on a conductor's surface adjust themselves in such a way that the electric field inside the conductor material is zero.

Let me think. The conductor is a sphere, but the cavity is off-center. So, the charge +q is inside the cavity. The inner surface of the conductor must have a charge distribution such that the field inside the conductor is zero. That means the electric field due to all charges (including the inner cavity charge and the induced charges) inside the conductor must cancel out.

If the conductor's inner surface has an induced charge -q, then the outer surface has +q. But because the cavity isn't concentric, the distribution of the induced charges might not be uniform. Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge should be uniformly distributed, regardless of the position of the cavity. Because for the outer surface, any external fields would cause charge redistribution, but in this case, the conductor was neutral, and the only charge on the outer surface is +q. So perhaps the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, leading to an external electric field as if all the charge were at the center.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to the charges outside it, but wait, the conductor's outer surface charge is +q. So the electric field outside the conductor is the same as that due to a point charge +q at the center of the conductor, right? Because the charges on the outer surface of a conductor shield the interior (the conductor itself) and the field outside is as if all the charge were at the center.

Wait, but in this setup, the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is off-center. So the induced charges on the inner surface would be -q, but the outer surface is +q. So the field outside would be due to the +q on the outer surface, regardless of where the inner charge was placed.

So when you're outside the conductor, the electric field should be the same as if the +q were at the center of the conductor. Because the conductor's outer surface's charge acts as if it's a point charge at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and l is the distance from the center of the cavity to P. But since the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R, and P is outside, the field at P should be as if a point charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε0)) * (q)/(L^2). Because the field outside a sphere is as if the charge is a point at the center.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε0)) * q / L². That would make sense if the field is as if the charge were at the center.

But wait, let me think again. The presence of the off-center cavity would affect the inner induced charges, but the outer induced charges would still be uniformly distributed. So the external field would only depend on the total charge outside, which is +q on the outer surface. So the field outside is the same as a point charge +q at the center.

So the correct answer is option B. 

But wait, let me consider the setup again. The point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's material is between radius R and the point P. The conductor's outer surface has +q. So the electric field at P is due to this +q, which is located at the center of the conductor. So the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Therefore, the correct option is B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Charge Distribution**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor as a whole remains neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the system.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge on its outer surface and not on the distribution of charges inside the conductor. In this case, the outer surface has a total charge of $+q$, which is uniformly distributed due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor.

3. **Field at Point $P$**: Since the point $P$ lies outside the conductor (at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor), the electric field at $P$ is determined by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor. This field is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor. The magnitude of the electric field is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived formula for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not applicable here.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While it resembles the field of a point charge, it does not account for the correct distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
