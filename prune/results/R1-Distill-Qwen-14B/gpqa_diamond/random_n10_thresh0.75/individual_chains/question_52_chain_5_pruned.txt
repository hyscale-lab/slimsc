Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I don't know a lot about stellar atmospheres and LTE. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. Let's read the problem again.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Now, when looking at the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels, this ratio decreases when there are spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—no spots to spots.

Wait, so the ratio without spots is higher than when spots are present. So the factor would be (ratio without) / (ratio with) = some value.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Since E2 > E1 (because level 2 is higher), the exponential term becomes exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

But wait, the problem says the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy difference ΔE can be found using the relation ΔE = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. Let me compute that.

Wait, but wait! For a transition from level 1 to level 2, the photon emitted would have energy hc/λ. But wait, when an electron transitions from higher to lower energy, the energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1 (assuming E2 > E1). So the energy difference is hc/λ. But wait, let me make sure about the sign. If the wavelength is 1448 Å, that's in the near-infrared. So the energy would be hc/(1448e-10 m).

Wait, let's compute ΔE. Let me get the value. Let's see:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c = 2.99792458e8 m/s
λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) → let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divided by λ: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-
