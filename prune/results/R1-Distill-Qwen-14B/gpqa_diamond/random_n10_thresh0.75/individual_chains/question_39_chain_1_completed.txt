Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The setup is that we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So we need to find the value of 'a'.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should be 1.

The wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Let me compute its absolute square. The absolute square is ψ*(x) * ψ(x), where ψ* is the complex conjugate. So ψ* would be (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i.

Multiplying them together: [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5i)(-0.5i) + [a/sqrt(1+x)]*(0.5i) + [a/sqrt(1+x)]*(-0.5i). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, when you multiply (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + B² because the cross terms cancel out (the i terms). So in this case, ψ(x) is (a/√(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ* is (a/√(1+x)) + 0.5i. Multiplying them:

(a²)/(1+x) + (0.5i)(-0.5i) → wait, no, no, more accurately, (a/√(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, because the cross terms are (a/√(1+x))*0.5i + (a/√(1+x))*(-0.5i), which cancel each other out. So the absolute square is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.25) [since (0.5i)^2 is (0.5)^2 (i^2) = 0.25*(-1), but in the absolute square, the imaginary parts add as their squares. Wait, no, when calculating |ψ|^2, it's (A + B)^2 where A is real and B is imaginary. So it's (A)^2 + (B)^2, because the cross terms (2AB) are imaginary and cancel out. So in this case, A = a/sqrt(1+x), B = -0.5i. So |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

So we can split the integral into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3, equals 1.

Let me compute each part.

First, integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So a² times [ln(1+3) - ln(1+1)] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Second, integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So combining both parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a is the square root of that.

Square root of 0.7213 is approximately 0.849, which is about 0.85.

Looking at the options: option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To solve the problem, we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)

   The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\). Thus:

   \[
   a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx\)

   The integral of \(0.25\) over the interval \(1\) to \(3\) is:

   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
