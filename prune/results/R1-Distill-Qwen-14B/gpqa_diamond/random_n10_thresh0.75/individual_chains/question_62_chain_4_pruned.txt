Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reagents needed to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target molecule. The name suggests a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which means a methyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring, and that methyl group has both a hydroxyl (OH) group and another cyclohexane ring attached. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group (CHO) on the cyclohexane. Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, ethynylcyclohexane is like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or wait, no. Wait, ethynyl is the substituent, so it would be CH≡C- attached to cyclohexane. So it's cyclohexane with a triple bond to another carbon, making it like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait. Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane directly attached to the triple bond? Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So the structure would be cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is more accurately cyclohexane with a substituent which is a propargyl group? Or wait, no. Let me clarify: ethynyl is the substituent, so it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So the structure is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, no, maybe the ethynyl is directly attached. So it's cyc
