Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with complexes, the concentration of ions can be related through the formation constant.

The problem states that there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about other factors like hydrolysis or protonation affecting the EDTA. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so activity coefficients are probably assumed to be 1, making calculations easier.

The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. Right, K here would be the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA combine to form the complex. The formation constant is huge, so the complex is very stable, meaning that most of the Ca²+ should be tied up in the complex.

So the reaction would be something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since K is so large, the reaction favors the product, so almost all Ca²+ will form the complex.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. That means the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the initial concentrations before dissociation would be [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] would be almost zero. But due to the dissociation, a tiny amount x of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will form.

So the dissociation reaction is: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The K for this reaction would be the inverse of the formation constant, right? Because if Kf is for the formation, then Kd (dissociation) is 1/Kf. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

At equilibrium, the concentrations would be:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small compared to 0.02),
