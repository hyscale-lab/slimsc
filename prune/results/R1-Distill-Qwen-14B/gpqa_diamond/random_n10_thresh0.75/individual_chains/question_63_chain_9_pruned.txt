Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, so I need to calculate the correct p.

First, I'll recall that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is usually the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). But wait, for diatomic molecules, the rigid rotor model typically starts with J=0 as the ground state, but the non-rigid rotor might complicate things. Oh wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, but I'm not entirely sure how that affects things right now. Maybe I'll focus on the energy transitions first.

The molecule has atoms X and Y. Their masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

The question asks about the momentum of the absorbed photon. So, when a photon is absorbed, it provides energy to the molecule, causing it to transition to a higher energy state. Since it's asking for the next lowest state, I think it's either a vibrational or rotational transition. But wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model usually combines both, so the transition might involve a vibrational change as well as a rotational change.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next higher state, which could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But in quantum mechanics, the energy spacing between vibrational levels is usually larger than rotational because vibrational energy depends on the square of the quantum number, while rotational is linear. So, the photon would need to supply enough energy to cause a transition.

Let me think about the possible transitions. If the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), then the next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But which transition requires less energy? Because the
