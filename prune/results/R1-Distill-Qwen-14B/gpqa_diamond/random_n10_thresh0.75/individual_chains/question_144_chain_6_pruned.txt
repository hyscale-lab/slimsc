Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and I need to find its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's think this through step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. But how exactly? Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma (the Lorentz factor) multiplied by the velocity. Or wait, maybe it's gamma times velocity times c times lifetime. Let me get that right.

The mean decay distance L is given by L = c * τ * β * γ. Where τ is the proper lifetime, β is v/c, and γ is the Lorentz factor. Right, because from the particle's perspective, it's moving, so the lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation and the particle is moving at a high speed, so the decay distance is longer.

But wait, in this case, we're dealing with a resonance. Resonances are unstable particles with a very short lifetime. The width Γ is related to the lifetime. Oh yes, the uncertainty principle: Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ. But wait, actually, the
