Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass attached to a spring experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I think special relativity comes into play here. 

The question asks for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about what I know about relativistic mechanics.

In classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a spring is (1/2)kA², so kinetic energy (1/2)mv² equals that. Solving gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, that's the classical case. But this question is relativistic, so we can't use the classical formula directly.

In relativity, energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; there's also rest mass energy to consider. The total energy E includes the rest mass energy mc² plus the kinetic energy. So I think the total energy in this system would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement.

Wait, no, I'm not sure. Wait, in the oscillator, the potential energy varies with position, and the kinetic energy varies with velocity. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore because that's only non-relativistic. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So here's the setup: at maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². At that point, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. But wait, no—actually, the total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude. Because when the mass is at the equilibrium position (x=0), it's moving the fastest, converting all potential into kinetic. But wait, no, in the classical case, at x=0, velocity is maximum. But in relativity, maybe not exactly the same.

Wait, the total energy of the system would be the rest energy plus the maximum potential energy. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA². But wait, in the relativistic case,
