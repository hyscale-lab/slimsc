Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think this through.

So, parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. The formula for parallax (plx) is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance to the star in parsecs. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away, and a larger parallax means it's closer.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution usually means that the number density is constant in space. Wait, so if they're uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is the same everywhere. But the way the question is phrased, it's about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I need to relate parallax to the number of stars in a certain range of plx.

Let me think in terms of volume. For a given distance, the volume element in spherical coordinates includes the radius squared term. So the volume between d and d+dd is 4πd² dd. Since stars are uniform, the number of stars in that volume is proportional to d² dd.

But parallax plx is 1/d. So if I let plx = p, then d = 1/p. The number of stars per unit volume would be (number density) * 4πd² dd. But since the number density is constant, let's say n, the number of stars in a volume element is n * 4π d² dd.

So substituting d = 1/p, d² is (1/p)^2, and dd is the change in d. But I need to express this in terms of p instead of d. So when d changes by dd, p changes by dp. Because p = 1/d, dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = -d² dp. Substituting that in, the number becomes n *4π (1/p²) * (-d² dp ). Wait, but d is 1/p, so d² is 1/p². So substituting that, the expression becomes n *4π (1/p²) * (- (1/p²) dp )).

Wait, let me make this clearer. Let me change variables from d to p. So the number of stars per unit volume in terms of p would be integrating over p. So the number of stars in a range of p from p to p+dp would be n * 4π (d)^2 (dd) which is n * 4π (1/p)^2 ( - (1/p²) dp ). Wait, but that's getting a bit messy.

Wait another approach: the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area of that shell (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness in distance, and the number density. So N = n * 4π d² dd.

But since we're looking at a range of parallax, which is a change in p, and p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So let's express N in terms of p.

The differential number of stars is N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (dd). But dd in terms of dp is? Let's relate d and p. Since p = 1/d, so dp = - (1/d²) dd. Solving for dd, we get dd = -d² dp. But d is 1/p, so d² is 1/p². So dd = - (1/p²) dp.

Putting it all together: N = n * 4π (1/p^2) * (-1/p²) dp.

Wait, but the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but since we're looking for the magnitude, perhaps I can ignore the sign for now. So N = 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit range of p (parallax) would be proportional to 1/p^4. Wait, but the question is about how the number per unit range of plx changes with plx. So the number
