Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question gives me this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction between fields. Here, X is a bosonic field, and ψ_f represents fermion fields. So, the interaction term is λ times f (maybe the fermion type?) times the fermion fields, and this X field. 

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

Wait, when a boson decays into fermions, the energy of the fermions must be enough for their masses. So, the mass of the boson has to be at least twice the mass of the fermion, right? Because each fermion would get some energy, but at the minimum, their rest mass must be covered.

So, I need to recall the masses of the known fermions. Let's see:

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But wait, in terms of particles, I think when a boson decays, it can produce any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the energy is sufficient.

But wait, in this case, X is a boson with mass 6 GeV. Let me list the masses of the fermions:

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV (negligible)
Muon: ~0.105 GeV
Tau: ~1.78 GeV
Up quark: around 2 MeV (so ~0.002 GeV)
Down quark: ~3 MeV (0.003 GeV)
Strange quark: ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV
Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV
Top quark: way too heavy, like 173 GeV.

Wait, but wait, when considering a decay into fermions, each pair (like a quark and antiquark) would require the boson's mass to be at least twice the mass of the fermion. So for quarks, if the boson is lighter than twice the quark mass, it can't decay into that pair.

But wait, for X to decay into a quark-antiquark pair, the mass of X must be at least 2*m_quark. But when considering hadrons, they are made of quarks, but in this case, the decay is into a pair of quarks, which would form a meson. But considering just the kinematics, we can ignore binding energies and other complexities.

So, first, let's list the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into, based on the mass.

X's mass is 6 GeV. Let's calculate the maximum allowed fermion mass for
