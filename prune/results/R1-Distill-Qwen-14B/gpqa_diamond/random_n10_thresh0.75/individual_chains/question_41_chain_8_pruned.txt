Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm. Let me think about what I know. The question is saying that a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam towards the observer. And I need to find the speed of light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially in physics, it's all about how different frames of reference perceive things. Oh right, Einstein's theory of relativity comes into play here, but wait, since the speed is given as c=1, maybe it's using units where c is 1, so we can treat it as 1 in calculations.

Wait, but the glass is moving. So the light is inside the glass, which is moving. How does that affect the observed speed?

In a stationary glass medium, the speed of light is c/n. Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed in the medium. So normally, v_light = c/n. But when the medium is moving, does that change things?

I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. If the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, then from the lab frame, how does that affect the light's speed?

Wait, in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. But when the glass is moving, we have to consider the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh, right! Because velocities don't just add up linearly when they're close to
