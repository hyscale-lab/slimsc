Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are involved. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. It's given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y.

Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Right, for a matrix, you solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. But since A_y is proportional to S, maybe I can first find the eigenvalues of S, then scale them by c.

So let me write out matrix S:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

What are the eigenvalues of S? The trace is 0, and the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is 1.

The characteristic equation is λ² - (trace)λ + det = 0, which becomes λ² + 1 = 0. So the eigenvalues are λ = ±i. Oh, interesting, because the trace is zero, the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

Wait, but wait. The eigenvalues of S are i and -i. So when I construct A_y = c * S, the eigenvalues will be c * i and c * (-i). Let's compute that.

c is h/(4π). So eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * i and -(h/(4π)) * i. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Oh no, wait, wait. Wait, the matrix S's eigenvalues are ±i. So A_y's eigenvalues would be c*(±i) = (h/(4π))(±i). So the real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are ±h/(4π) multiplied by 1.

Wait, no, because c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are (h/(4π)) *
