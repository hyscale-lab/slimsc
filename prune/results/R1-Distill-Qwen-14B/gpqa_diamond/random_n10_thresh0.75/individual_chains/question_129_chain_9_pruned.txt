Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four steps in the reaction scheme, and some hints provided. Also, there are four options to choose from.

Let me first list out the reactions to get a clearer picture.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints given are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

I remember that IR peaks around 1750 usually indicate a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. But since in hint b, A has 1750, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Then, E's peak is at 1715, which is a bit lower. A ketone typically has a peak around 1700-1750. Maybe E is a ketone, but A could be something else, like an ester, which has a higher carbonyl stretch.

Wait, but when A reacts with HCN, which is a nucleophile, probably adding to a carbonyl group. So A must have a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an ester. HCN adds to carbonyls. So if A is a ketone, then B would be a cyanohydrin. But if A is an ester, adding HCN would do something else... Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A is an aldehyde. But no, aldehydes are usually more reactive. But the product would then be a cyanohydrin as well.

Wait, but looking at hint a), the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Propan-2-ylidene is a substituted cyclopropane ring with a methyl group? Or wait, propan-2-ylidene is a cyclopropane with a substituent. Let me think. Propane is CH2CH2CH3, but propan-2-ylidene would be CH2C(CH3)-, so the ylide would have a double bond. When a ylide reacts with a carbonyl, it usually does a [2+2] cycloaddition? No, wait, I think the Cope or Claisen rearrangement involves ylides. Or maybe it's a Wittig reaction. Oh, right! The Wittig reaction uses phosphorus ylides to form alkenes. So when a ylide reacts with a carbonyl compound, it forms an alkene.

So in hint a), the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So propan-2-ylidene is the substituent on the cyclopentane ring. Let me try to visualize this structure. The cyclopentane has substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups, and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group.

Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a cyclopropane ring attached via a single bond? No, perhaps it's a substituent that's a cyclopropane. Alternatively, maybe it's a group with a double bond. Let me think. The substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which would be CH2-C(CH3)=. So, the ylide part would be a CH2 group attached to a C(CH3)= group. So when the ylide (like a phosphorus ylide) reacts with compound
