Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by a Lagrangian equation. The specific equation is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order, and there are four options (A to D).

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that when a particle decays, the energy (and thus the mass) of the parent must be at least equal to the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. Because energy and mass are related via E=mc², so higher mass particles can decay into particles whose combined rest mass is less than or equal to the parent's mass.

Wait, but wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any decay products must have a total rest mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. So I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs can result from X decaying, considering their masses.

Looking at the options, they all have different combinations. Let's list the fermions and their approximate masses (in GeV):

- Up quark (u): ~0.005 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.005 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy, but X is only 6 GeV)
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV

So, for X to decay into a pair of particles, say f and f̄, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, actually, each fermion has its own mass, and if X is decaying into a ferm
