Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the Michael addition reactions. I remember that the Michael addition involves a conjugate addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The key is that the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, leading to a resonance-stabilized enolate intermediate. 

There are three parts to the problem: reactions A, B, and C, each producing a product, and I have to match them with the given options.

First, let's tackle Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, right? Because it can form an enolate. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group at the alpha position. E-configuration would mean the substituents are opposite each other, but for the Michael addition, the configuration might not matter as much as the structure.

So the Michael donor (the enolate) is dimethyl malonate. Dimethyl malonate has two methyl groups and two ester groups, so when deprotonated, it can attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, but wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw it out. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the acrylate. Wait, no, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or is it CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, the numbering. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be the third carbon? Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group at the alpha position, i.e., CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? No, I think the correct structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl is on carbon 2. 

So the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is the acrylate. The Michael donor is dimethyl malonate, which can
