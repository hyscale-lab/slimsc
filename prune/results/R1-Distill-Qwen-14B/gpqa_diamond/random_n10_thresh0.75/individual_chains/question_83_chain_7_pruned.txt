Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given from A to D.

First, I'll jot down what I know. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The reaction between them should form acetate ions and water. The relevant equation is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

Okay, let's tackle the two parts separately: the pH at 25% titration and the pH at equivalence.

Starting with the 25% titration. Wait, what's 25% here mean? Oh, right, it refers to the volume of NaOH added being 25% of the volume needed to reach the equivalence point.

So, step one: find the equivalence point volume.

The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When diluted with 20 cm³ water, the new volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution is... Hmm, using M1V1 = M2V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³; V2 is 40 cm³. So 0.05 * 20 = M2 *40 → M2= (0.05 *20)/40 = 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait. Because when you mix solutions, the number of moles matters. Let me check that again. The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) → 0.001 moles. When diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, correct.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is 1:1. So moles of NaOH needed at equivalence point = moles of acetic acid. Which is 0.001 moles. So the volume of NaOH needed is moles divided by concentration. NaOH is 0.1 M, so V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added to 40 cm³ of 0.0
