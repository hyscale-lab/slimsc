Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable, right?

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, I think those are for the different complexes: Co(SCN)1^+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4^2- or something like that. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact charges, but I think each β corresponds to the formation of the complex with n SCN- ions.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. So, dithiocyanato would be the complex with two SCN- ions, which is Co(SCN)2^n+? Let me think, Co(II) has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So Co(SCN)2 would be Co^(2+) with two SCN^-: that would make the overall charge 2+ - 2(1) = 0, so neutral? Or maybe I'm getting the charges wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes have varying charges. Like, the first complex would be Co(SCN)^(+), the second Co(SCN)2^0, third Co(SCN)3^- maybe? Because each β is for the step-wise formation.

Wait, maybe the β values are for the successive formation of complexes. So β1 is for the first SCN- binding, β2 for the second, etc. So the formation steps would be:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)^+ ; β1 = 9

Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)2; β2 =40

Co(SCN)2 + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)3^- ; β3=63

Co(SCN)3^- + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)4^2- ; β4=16

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact charges. But for the sake of this problem, maybe the exact charge isn't as important. The key is to find the fraction of Co(SCN)2 species.

So, the total cobalt species includes all possible complexes: Co^2+, Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3^-, and Co(SCN)4^2-.

Each of these has a certain concentration, and we need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)2.

The approach would be to calculate the concentrations of each species using the stability constants and the given concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

I remember that the formation of complexes can be modeled using the log of the stability constants and the concentrations. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact method.

Wait, the general approach is to use the stability constants to find the distribution of each species. Since the solution contains a lot of SCN- (0.1 M), but the Co concentration is low (1e-2 M), the complexes are likely to form extensively.

But how do I calculate the fraction? Maybe using the concept of log K and the concentrations.

Alternatively, I think I can model this using the formation of each complex step by step, considering the stability constants and the concentrations.

Wait, let me think about the step-wise approach. The first step is Co^2+ + SCN- ⇌ CoSCN^+. The stability constant K1 is β1=9. So K1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]).

Similarly, for the second step, CoSCN+ + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)2, K2=β2=40. So [Co(SCN)2]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-]) =40.

And so on for the third and fourth steps.

But to find the concentrations of each species, I probably need to set up expressions for each and solve them. Alternatively, maybe I can find the fraction of each species relative to the total.

Hmm, perhaps I can use the following approach:

Let me denote the total concentration of Co as c = 1e-2 M. So the sum of all Co species equals c.

Let me denote the concentrations as follows:

[Co^2+] = x

[Co(SCN)^+] = y

[Co(SCN)2] = z

[Co(SCN)3^-] = w

[Co(SCN)4^2-] = v

We know that x + y + z + w + v = c = 1e-2 M.

The formation steps are:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ CoSCN^+ ; β1 =9 = [CoSCN+]/( [Co^2
