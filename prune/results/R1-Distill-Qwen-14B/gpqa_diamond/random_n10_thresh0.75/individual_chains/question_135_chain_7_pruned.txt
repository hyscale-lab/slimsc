Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and decay modes of a boson. Hmm, let's see. The question says the bosonic field X has a mass of 6 GeV. I'm supposed to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this describes an interaction between the boson X and some fermions. So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. Oh right, because the interaction term looks like X ψ ψ, which suggests that X can annihilate a fermion pair or create one.

But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So the decay products' mass must be less than 6 GeV. Because for a decay to happen, the mass of the boson has to be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Because each fermion in the pair needs to have some energy, but the minimum is when they are at rest.

So I need to figure out which fermions have masses less than 3 GeV each. Because each fermion and antifermion would take half the mass. Wait, no, wait. The mass of the boson should be greater than or equal to twice the mass of each fermion. Because when the fermions are produced at rest, the total energy is their rest mass energy. So M
