Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let me read through it again and see what it's all about.

Alright, so the question is about a star similar to the Sun, same radius. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%, which I think means 20% of the hemisphere is covered in spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. They mention that because the star is rotating, these spots will cause brightness variations that look similar to an exoplanet transit. The question is asking what the radius of a planet would need to be to produce the same signal in the light curve as these spots do.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The same idea applies here, but instead of a planet, it's the star spots causing the variation.

Wait, but how do the spots affect the brightness? Since they're cooler, they emit less light. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the overall brightness should decrease a bit. As the star rotates, different parts of the hemisphere come into view, so the brightness variations would be periodic.

But the problem says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet. So the variation caused by the spots should mimic the planet's transit. So we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the change in brightness due to the spots.
2. Compare that to the change caused by a planet transit.
3. Find the planet radius that gives the same amplitude.

First, the star's radius (Rstar) is the same as the Sun's, which is about 7e5 km, but maybe we don't need the exact value since we're dealing with ratios.

The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere is spots. The hemisphere area is (4π Rstar²)/2 = 2π Rstar². The area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4π Rstar².

Wait, but each spot's area is R_spot²? Or perhaps it's better to think in terms of the temperature difference. The spots are cooler, so the flux from the spotted region is less than the surrounding.

Flux from a star (or spot) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4. The total flux from the star without spots would be F0 = σ T_eff^4 * 4π Rstar².

But when the spots are present, a fraction of the star's surface emits less flux. The total flux when the spots are visible can be calculated as:

F_total = F0 * (1 - f) + F_spot * f,

where f is the filling factor (0.2), and F_spot is the flux per unit area from the spots, which is σ (T_eff - ΔT)^4. Wait, no, the spot temperature is Teff - 1000 K? So T_spot = 5000 K.

So F_spot = σ (5000)^4.

But wait, no, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, so the spots are at 5000 K, right.

So the area with spots contributes (f * A_hemi) * σ T_spot^4, and the rest of the hemisphere contributes (A_hemi * (1-f)) * σ T_eff^4.

But the total flux from the star when the spots are on one hemisphere would be:

F_spotted = (Area_unspotted * F_unspotted) + (Area_spotted * F_spotted)
= (A_hemi*(1-f)) * σ T_eff^4 + (A_hemi * f) * σ T_spot^4.

The area of the hemisphere is 0.5 * 4π Rstar² = 2π Rstar². So A_hemi = 2 π Rstar².

Plugging the numbers:

F_spotted = [2π Rstar² (1-f) ] * σ T_eff^4 + [2π Rstar² f ] * σ T_spot^4.

We can factor out 2π Rstar² σ:

= 2 π Rstar² σ [ (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ].

The normal flux without any spots (assuming the hemisphere without spots is the same as the star's average) would be F0 = σ T_eff^4 * 4 π Rstar² / 2 = 2 π Rstar² σ T_eff^4. Wait, because the star emits from its entire surface. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait no, when the star is viewed from Earth, if the spots are on the hemisphere facing us, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted parts of that hemisphere.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so normally, the flux is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (4π Rstar²) / 4 = σ T_eff^4 π Rstar². Wait, no. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says the total power (luminosity) is 4 π Rstar² σ T_eff^4. But the flux at a distance is that divided by 4π (for a distant observer), so F0 = Rstar² σ T_eff^4 * (4π)/(4π) )= Rstar² σ T_eff^4. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of flux per unit area.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fractional change in brightness when the spots are present.

The fractional change, ΔF/F, is (F_spotted - F0) / F0.

Wait, but F0 is the flux when there are no spots. But in reality, when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F0. When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_spotted.

So the variation in flux is F_spotted - F0.

To compute the fractional change:

(F_spotted - F0) / F0 = [ ( (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) * (2 π Rstar² σ) - F0 ] / F0.

Wait, but F0 is the flux when no spots are visible. Wait, F0 would be the flux when the entire hemisphere (unspotted) is emitting. So F0 is the same as when the star has no spots, which would be 2 π Rstar² σ T_eff^4.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the average flux when the spots are present on the near side, then compare it to the flux when the spots are on the far side.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the flux when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us versus when they're on the other side.

So when the spots are on the front hemisphere, the total flux is the sum of the unspotted part of the front hemisphere and the spotted part.

The unspotted part area is (1-f) * (front hemisphere area) = (1-f) * 2 π Rstar².

The flux from the unspotted part: (1-f) * 2 π Rstar² * σ T_eff^4.

The spotted part: f * 2 π Rstar² * σ (T_eff - 1000 K)^4.

So F_spotted = 2 π Rstar² σ [ (1-f) T_eff^4 + f (T_spot)^4 ].

The flux when the spots are not visible (i.e., on the far side) is F_unspotted = 2 π Rstar² σ T_eff^4.

So the change in flux is F_spotted - F_unspotted = 2 π Rstar² σ [ (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ] 

= 2 π Rstar² σ [ -f T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ]

= 2 π Rstar² σ f [ T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ].

Since T_spot is less than T_eff, this difference is negative. So the flux decreases when spots are visible.

The fractional change is (F_spotted - F_unspotted) / F_unspotted.

Which is [f (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4)] / [ T_eff^4 ].

Plugging numbers:

f = 0.2

T_spot = 5000 K

T_eff = 6000 K.

So:

T_spot^4 = 5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 6.25e16.

T_eff^4 = 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 1.296e17.

So T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 = (6.25e16) / (1.296e17) ≈ 0.482253.

So T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 = negative, but we take the ratio.

Wait, the fractional change is [f (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4)] / T_eff^4.

Which is f [ (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) - 1 ]

= 0.2 * (0.482253 - 1) = 0.2 * (-0.517747) ≈ -0.10355.

So the fractional change is about -10.355%.

But wait, that's the fractional change in flux when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us. So this is the variation in the light curve. The amplitude of the dip is about 10.355%.

But wait, the problem says that this situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So we need to find the planet radius R_pl such that the dip when the planet transits is the same amplitude.

The dip caused by a planet is (R_pl / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is (R_pl^2 / Rstar^2) times the star's area. So the fractional change is - (R_pl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but the dip would be (R_pl / Rstar)^2, so the amplitude (the fractional change) is (R_pl / Rstar)^2.

So we have:

(R_pl / Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

Taking the square root:

R_pl / Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Hmm, but wait, that would make the planet radius about 32% of the star's radius. That's way larger than Jupiter, which is about 10% of the Sun's radius. So that seems too big.

Wait, but in this problem, the star is the same radius as the Sun, so Rstar = R_sun.

Wait, but let me think again. The dip amplitude caused by the planet is (R_pl/Rstar)^2. But in the case of the spots, the dip was about 10.355% or 0.10355.

So solving for R_pl/Rstar:

(R_pl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → R_pl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which matches this number.

But wait a second, the question says 'to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)'

Wait, so in the case where the star is not covered by spots, the dip would be due to the planet. So if the star isn't spotted, then the dip is only due to the planet. So the dip amplitude is (R_pl/Rstar)^2. So in our case, the dip due to the spots is about 0.10355, which is the same as the dip due to the planet.

So the planet's R_pl is about 0.32 times Rstar, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, T_spot is 5000 K, T_eff is 6000 K.

(T_spot / T_eff)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296.

625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) = (0.482253 - 1) T_eff^4 = -0.517747 T_eff^4.

So the change in flux is:

F_spotted = F_unspotted + f * (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) * (2 π Rstar² σ) / T_eff^4.

Wait, no, the fractional change is [f (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4)] / T_eff^4.

Which is f*(T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 - 1) = 0.2*(0.482253 - 1) = 0.2*(-0.517747) = -0.10355.

So the dip is about 10.355% of the star's flux.

If a planet causes the same dip, then (R_pl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355, so R_pl/Rstar ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, so option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Star and Spots Parameters**:  
   - The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\star} \), and an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere (\( f = 0.2 \)) and have a temperature \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).  

2. **Flux Variation Due to Spots**:  
   The total flux from the star when the spots are visible is:  
   \[
   F_{\text{spotted}} = F_{\text{unspotted}} + f \cdot (T_{\text{spot}}^4 - T_{\text{eff}}^4) \cdot F_{\text{unspotted}},
   \]  
   where \( F_{\text{unspotted}} \) is the flux when no spots are visible. The fractional change in flux is:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F} = f \cdot \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} - 1 \right).
   \]  
   Substituting \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):  
   \[
   \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = 0.482253,  
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F} = 0.2 \cdot (0.482253 - 1) = 0.2 \cdot (-0.517747) = -0.10355.
   \]  
   The fractional change in flux is approximately \( -10.355\% \), meaning the flux decreases by 10.355% when the spots are visible.

3. **Exoplanet Transit Signal**:  
   The fractional change in brightness during a planetary transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\star}} \right)^2.
   \]  
   To match the amplitude of the spotted star's flux variation, we set:  
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\star}} \right)^2 = 0.10355.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\star}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
   \]  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to option **D**.
