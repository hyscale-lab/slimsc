Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various power laws like 1 over plx squared, cubed, etc.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, right? And if parallax increases, the star is closer because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. Let's think about how stars are distributed. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density of stars is constant in all regions. So the number of stars in a given volume would depend on the volume itself.

Wait, the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, right? So as the distance (r) increases, the volume increases with the cube of r. Since number density n is constant, the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr would be n * 4πr² dr. Because the shell's volume is surface area times dr, which is 4πr² dr.

But wait, the question is about parallax, not distance. So let me express everything in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, where d is distance, then d = 1/plx. So as plx increases, distance decreases. So a small range in plx corresponds to a larger range in distance since d is 1/plx.

Hmm, so the number of stars in a certain plx range would relate to the number in a certain distance range. Let's say we have a small change in plx, dplx. How does that correspond to a change in distance?

Well, since d = 1/plx, then dd = -d² dplx. Wait, because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx, so plx = d^-1. Taking derivative, dplx = -d^-2 * dd => dd = -d² dplx. But since d is positive, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases.

But when considering the number of stars, I think we can ignore the negative
