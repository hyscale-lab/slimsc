Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me look at each reaction carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with nitriles. Oh wait, I think it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Right, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-), it forms a cyanohydrin. So the reaction is:

R2CO + CN- → R2C(OH)CN

But wait, how does the reagent A fit in here? I think the reaction requires an acid catalyst. Because the cyanide ion is a good nucleophile but maybe not strong enough without acid. So, adding an acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So the reagent A might be something like H3O+.

Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would have the nitrile group and the hydroxyl group on the same carbon, adjacent to the ketone’s position. That makes sense for a cyanohydrin formation.

So the first reaction uses NaCN and H3O+ as reagents. So A is H3O+.

Now, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in the presence of water) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how does that happen? Oh, right, the hydrolysis of nitriles. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Under strong acidic conditions, like with HCl and water, or perhaps under other acids, nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you might get an amide or something else, but I think in this case we're looking at acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So the conditions must be such that the nitrile is hydrolyzed all the way to the acid. I recall that using a strong acid like HCl with water and heat would do that. For example, using HCl and H2O would hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, sometimes other acids like acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be used, but I'm not sure about the specifics here.

Let me think. Reaction B is in H2O, so the reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH, as the options suggest.

So in the options, the possible B reagents are HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the nitrile group is at a position where the molecule is somewhat bulky—like having a 4-benzylphenyl group. So maybe the reaction requires strong enough conditions to hydrolyze the
