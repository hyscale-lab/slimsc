Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, rhombohedral crystal, right? I remember that a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles equal. So the lattice parameters a, b, c are the same, and the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees in this case.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh wait, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think this is calculated using the formula involving the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

The formula I remember is the interplanar distance d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h² + k² + l²)(α² + β² + γ²)/3 + 2(hk cos γ_αβ + hk cos γ_ab + ... wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh right, for a general crystal structure, the formula for d_{hkl} is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (h² + k² + l²)( (cos² α + cos² β + cos² γ - 1 ) )/(3 a²) + (2hk cos αβ + 2hl cos αγ + 2kl cos βγ)/(a²).

Wait, no, maybe there's a simpler formula when all angles are equal and all a, b, c are equal. Because in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α = β = γ. So that might simplify things.

Alternatively, I remember another formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system. Oh right, the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Since all angles are 30 degrees, θ is 30°, and the plane is (111), so h, k, l are all 1.

So plugging in the numbers, the denominator becomes sqrt( (1 +1 +1) - 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1)*cos(30°) ). Let me compute that step by step.

First, h, k, l are 1 each, so h² +k² +l² is
