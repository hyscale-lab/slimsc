Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. The options are A to D, with numbers like ~0.36, ~1.40, etc.

Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The greater the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star. Wait, but wait—no, because the shift also depends on the orbital speed of the star. Let me think.

The RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is K. The formula I remember is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²) )^(1/2) )) ) ) * something... Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula that relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period and other variables.

Alternatively, another approach: the RV method's measured velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) / (P * (1 day in seconds) )

Wait, maybe I should simplify this. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), perhaps their mass ratio is similar. So maybe M_p is the same for both, and M_* is the same for both. So, perhaps the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) ) ?

Wait, no, let me think again. The formula for K is derived from the fact that the star and planet orbit their common center of mass. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies.

The formula for K is approximately:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_*)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) )) / ( P^(1/3) ) * (some constants) )

But since M_p << M_*, the term (1 + M_p/M_*) is approximately 1, so we can neglect it. So K ≈ (G * M_p ) / ( M_*^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )
