Okay, so I have this question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let's try to think it through.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules involves different types of operations like rotations and reflections. The notation C3h suggests a specific type of symmetry. Wait, what's the C3h point group? Oh right, I think C3h has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). So the molecule must look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. The name suggests a tricyclic structure with three phenyl groups attached. Wait, triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a way that it has high symmetry. I think triphenylene has a threefold axis, maybe. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Well, if it's symmetric, maybe so. I'll keep this in mind.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So it's a benzo-fused trifuran. Let me visualize this. The benzo part is probably a benzene ring fused to the trifuran structure. Trifuran is a tricyclic system with three furan rings. Furan itself is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. If this structure is benzo-fused, it might have a certain symmetry. But I'm not sure if it has a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Borate esters, like triisopropyl borate, have a central boron atom attached to three isopropyl groups. Isopropyl groups are symmetric themselves, but when attached to a central atom, the molecule would have a high symmetry. Wait, triisopropyl borate is [B(iPr)3]. Each isopropyl is a substituent around the boron. Boron
