Okay, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Let me think about what I remember about SMEFT and the symmetries involved.

First, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model (SM) symmetries. So the operators in SMEFT are built from the SM fields and interactions, but with higher dimensions. 

The question lists four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. I think I need to determine which of these are automatically respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Starting with Lorentz symmetry (option 1). The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory. SMEFT is an effective theory that maintains the symmetries of the SM, so all operators in SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 must be correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry (option 2). Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The SM respects Poincare, so SMEFT should too. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, which is valid when the energy scale is much below the cutoff scale. Effective theories usually don't respect all the higher symmetries when you go beyond a certain scale. Hmm... Or wait, no. SMEFT maintains the same symmetries as the SM because it's the low-energy limit. So Poincare is part of the SM's symmetries, so SMEFT operators must also respect it. So 2 is correct. But wait, Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. Since SMEFT is built from SM fields, which respect Poincare, yes, the operators must respect that.

But wait, some sources say that effective theories do not necessarily include all the symmetries of the UV theory. For example, in SMEFT, the operators are constructed from SM fields, so the symmetries of the SM (like Poincare) are automatically included. Therefore, both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are respected.

Now, what about CP symmetry (option 3)? The SM doesn't have a CP symmetry that's exact. There are CP-violating terms, like the CKM phase. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, then the SMEFT operators don't need to respect it either. Wait, but wait: the operators in SMEFT can include terms that violate CP, but only those that are allowed by the SM. No, wait, SMEFT includes all possible higher-dimension operators that are consistent with the SM's gauge symmetry and other symmetries, but not necessarily CP.

Wait, wait. If the SM already has CP violation, then SMEFT can have operators that violate CP as well. So the operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators. So 3 is not correct.

Option 4 is CPT symmetry. CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. The SM respects CPT symmetry, so any effective theory derived from it must also respect CPT. Therefore, all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

So which options are correct: 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but Poincare symmetry includes translations, which might not necessarily be a symmetry in the effective theory beyond a certain cutoff. Wait, no. SMEFT is valid up to some cutoff scale, but the operators are constructed in such a way that they respect the same symmetries as the SM. So the SM respects Poincare, so the SMEFT operators must respect it as well. So 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Is Poincare symmetry automatically respected by all operators in SMEFT? The SM is Poincare invariant, so any operator built from SM fields with the same transformation properties would respect Poincare. So for example, any term in SMEFT, being a product of SM fields, would transform correctly under Poincare. Hence, yes, option 2 is correct.

So the correct symmetries that are necessarily respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2
