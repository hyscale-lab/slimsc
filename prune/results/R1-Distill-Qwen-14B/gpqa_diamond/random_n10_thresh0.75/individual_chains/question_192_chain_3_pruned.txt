Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, so there's this uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity, which is also spherical. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R, which makes sense because it's inside.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are given, and I have to choose the correct expression for E.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that conductors have some properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, but it has a cavity with a charge, I think about the concept of electrostatic shielding. Wait, no, or is it about the redistribution of charges in the conductor when charges are inside cavities?

Wait, I think when a conductor encloses a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge, and the outer surface remains neutral. But wait, in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. So any charge induced on the inner surface must be canceled by a charge on the outer surface. Or wait, noâ€”the conductor as a whole is neutral. So if the cavity has +q, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q to balance. Wait, no, that can't be because the conductor is neutral. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

No, wait, the conductor is neutral. So if the cavity has +q, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q charge (to cancel the field inside the conductor material, which is a conductor, so E must be zero there). But since the total charge of the conductor is zero, the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, and that's what contributes to the
