Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. Oh, right, so this is a 2-dimensional spacetime, maybe? Or perhaps a surface embedded in some higher dimension. 

Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh, right! A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. It's like the hyperbolic version of a sphere. Its area is different from a regular sphere because of the curvature. But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Or is it the area of the surface described by this metric?

Hmm, the metric has this denominator 4 - x² - y². Let me see, that's similar to the metric for the sphere where the denominator would be (1 - (x² + y²)/a²), but with a plus instead of a minus. Wait, no, in the sphere case, the metric is usually something like (1 - (x² + y²)/a²)⁻¹ (dx² + dy²), for the standard 2D metric on a sphere. So here, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), so perhaps it's a metric on a sphere with some radius.

Wait, but for a pseudosphere, the metric would have a negative curvature, which I think would involve a hyperbolic function. But maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps this is a metric for a sphere in some coordinate system.

Wait a second, the denominator 4 - (x² + y²) suggests that when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, so the metric blows up there. That implies that the surface is bounded within the circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane because beyond that, the denominator becomes zero or negative, which would make the metric undefined or imaginary, which doesn't make sense. So the maximum x² + y² must be less than 4, meaning the radius is 2.

Wait, but what does this metric represent? If it's similar to the standard metric for a sphere, maybe it's a metric for a 2-sphere with radius 2. But wait, the standard metric on a sphere is ds² = (dr²)/(1 - r²/a²) + a² dθ²/(1 - r²/a²), or something along those lines. Wait, no, that's for spherical coordinates with a radial component. Alternatively, in isothermal coordinates, maybe the metric looks like this.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think step by step. The metric given is 32/(4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So in 2D, this would represent a surface where the line element is scaled by that factor.

But wait, I'm trying to find the area of the pseudosphere with radius 2. So perhaps I should compute the area using this metric. For a 2D surface, the area is the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, but since this is already in 2D and the metric is conformally flat (i.e., it's just a scalar multiple of dx² + dy²), the area element is just the scalar times dx dy.

So the area A would be the double integral over the surface of sqrt(det g) dx dy. But since g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms are zero, the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². The square root of that is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but that can't be right because the area of a sphere with radius a is 4πa². Wait, but in this case, perhaps the area is being computed differently. Or maybe the metric is that of a sphere with radius 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a hyperbolic space. Wait, but the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which suggests positive curvature because when you have a denominator that's 1 - (x² + y²)/a², that's a sphere. For a pseudosphere (which is hyperbolic), I think the metric would have a denominator like 1 + (x² + y²)/a², perhaps. Or maybe it's a different form.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature of this metric to determine whether it's a sphere or a pseudosphere.

The formula for Gaussian curvature K for a metric in 2D is given by:

K = (-1/(2*sqrt(det g))) * ∂_x ∂_y (ln sqrt(det g)) - similar terms, but I might be mixing up the formula. Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula:

For a metric g = λ² (dx² + dy²), the curvature is K = - (1/(2λ)) ∇² (1/λ), where ∇ is the gradient in flat space.

Wait, let me think again. For a metric g = e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is K = -e^{-2φ} ( ( ∂²φ/∂x² + ∂²φ/∂y² ) ).

Wait, let me compute φ. Since g = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²), this is e^{2φ} = 32/(4 - (x² + y²)).

So φ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)), where r² = x² + y².

Then, the Laplacian of φ in 2D is (1/r) d/d r (r dφ/dr) for polar coordinates. Let's compute that.

First, compute dφ/dr.

dφ/dr = (1/2) * [ ( - (2r) ) / (4 - r²) ) * 32 ] / (32/(4 - r²)) ) ] ?

Wait, no, let me compute it step by step.

φ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)) = (1/2) [ ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) ) ].

So dφ/dr = (1/2) [ 0 - ( (-2r)/(4 - r²) ) ) ] = (1/2) * (2r)/(4 - r²) ) = r/(4 - r²).

Then, the Laplacian is (1/r) d/dr (r * dφ/dr) ).

Compute r * dφ/dr = r * (r/(4 - r²)) ) = r²/(4 - r²).

Now, d/dr (r²/(4 - r²)) ) = [ (2r)(4 - r²) ) - (r²)(-2r) ) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Simplify numerator: 2r(4 - r²) + 2r^3 = 8r - 2r^3 + 2r^3 = 8r.

So d/dr (r²/(4 - r²)) ) = 8r / (4 - r²)^2.

Multiply by 1/r: (8r) / (4 - r²)^2 ) * (1/r) ) = 8/(4 - r²)^2.

So the Laplacian of φ is 8/(4 - r²)^2.

Then, Gaussian curvature K = - e^{-2φ} * Laplacian φ.

Compute e^{-2φ}:

e^{-2φ} = e^{ -2*(1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)) ) } = e^{ ln( (4 - r²)/32 ) } = (4 - r²)/(32).

So K = - [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * [ 8/(4 - r²)^2 ) ] = - [ (4 - r²) * 8 ) / (32 (4 - r^2)^2 ) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

8/(32) = 1/4.

So K = - [1/(4) ] * [ 1/(4 - r^2) ) ] = -1/(4(4 - r²)).

Hmm, that's Gaussian curvature varying with r. Wait, but for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is constant and negative. So this can't be a pseudosphere because the curvature depends on r here.

So maybe I made a mistake. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Another approach: perhaps the space described by this metric is a sphere, not a pseudosphere, since the curvature is positive in some regions.

Wait, K is negative if (4 - r²) is positive, so for r² <4, which is our domain. So K is negative. That's interesting because that would imply a hyperbolic space, which is a pseudosphere. But I thought pseudospheres have constant curvature, but here the curvature depends on r². Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Gaussian curvature. Let me check again.

Wait, the formula for Gaussian curvature is K = - e^{-2φ} [ ∇² φ ].

So φ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)).

The Laplacian of φ in 2D is (1/r) d/dr (r dφ/dr).

Previously, I found dφ/dr = r/(4 - r²).

So r * dφ/dr = r^2/(4 - r^2).

d/dr (r^2/(4 - r^2)) )= [ 2r (4 - r^2) + r^2 (2r) ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

Wait, wait, let me compute that derivative correctly:

d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ] = [ (2r)(4 - r²) + r²*(2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, that's using the quotient rule: numerator derivative is (2r)(4 - r²) + r²*(d/d r (4 - r²))= 2r*(4 - r²) + r²*(2r) ) ?

Wait, no, wait: if f(r) = numerator, which is r^2, and g(r) = denominator, which is 4 - r^2, then the derivative is (f’ g - f g’ ) / g².

So f’ = 2r, g’ = -2r.

So [ (2r)(4 - r^2) - (r^2)(-2r) ) ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

Simplify numerator: 2r(4 - r^2) + 2r^3 = 8r - 2r^3 + 2r^3 = 8r.

So the derivative is 8r/(4 - r^2)^2.

So the Laplacian is (1/r) * (8r)/(4 - r^2)^2 ) = 8/(4 - r^2)^2.

So K is - e^{-2φ} * (8/(4 - r^2)^2).

But e^{-2φ} is (4 - r²)/32, as before.

So K = - [ (4 - r²)/32 ) ] * [ 8/(4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

= - [ (4 - r²) * 8 ) / (32 (4 - r²)^2 ) ) ]

Simplify denominator: 32 (4 - r²)^2.

8/32 = 1/4.

So K = - [ (4 - r²) * (1/4) ) / ( (4 - r²)^2 ) ) ]

Simplify numerator: (4 - r²) * (1/4) = (1/4)(4 - r²).

Denominator: (4 - r²)^2.

So K = - [ (1/4)(4 - r²) ) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ] = - [ 1/(4(4 - r²)) ) ]

So K = -1/(4(4 - r²)).

Hmm, so the Gaussian curvature depends on r², which means the space isn't a pseudosphere (a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature). So perhaps it's a sphere, but that's not matching with the K being negative.

Wait, but I thought that the pseudosphere (or hyperbolic space) has negative curvature, but in this case, the curvature depends on position, which might not be a pseudosphere.

Wait, but the question says, what is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So maybe the metric provided is that of a pseudosphere with radius 2, and I'm supposed to compute its area.

Wait, but the area of a pseudosphere (which is a 2D surface) depends on its radius. For a pseudosphere, the area is 4π r^2, same as a sphere. But wait, no, wait. No, that's not right. Because a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, its area is actually infinite. Wait, that's right! Because as you go further out on the pseudosphere, the area keeps increasing. So the total area approaches infinity. So for a pseudosphere, the area would be infinite.

But wait, let me think again. A regular sphere has finite area, but a pseudosphere, which is a hyperbolic surface, has infinite area. Because it's like a saddle shape that extends infinitely.

Wait, but in the metric given, the denominator is 4 - (x^2 + y^2). So the coordinates x and y are limited to x² + y² < 4, because otherwise the denominator becomes negative or zero, which would make the metric undefined. So perhaps this is not an entire pseudosphere but a portion of it, like a finite area.

Wait, but the question is, what's the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So if the pseudosphere has radius 2, perhaps the area is 4π(2)^2 =16π? But that's the same as a sphere, which is 4πr².

But wait, then why the options include 4π(x² + y²), 4π(x² - y²), etc. Wait, the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2, not a function of x and y. So the area should be a number, not a function. So looking at the options, option D is +infty. So perhaps the area is infinite.

But wait, the metric given in the question is for a surface with x² + y² <4. So that's a finite region. So perhaps the area is finite.

Wait, but that's a 2D manifold. The area would be the integral of sqrt(det g) over the allowed region.

So the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²).

So sqrt(det g) is 32/(4 - x² - y²), as I thought earlier. So the area is the double integral over x and y where x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, let me compute that integral.

Change to polar coordinates: x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ.

The integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

First, the integral over θ is 2π.

So the area A = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r ] / (4 - r²) dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r ]/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: u =4 - r² → du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [32 * (r dr)] / u.

But r dr = - du/2.

So [32 * (- du/2 ) ] / u = (-16) ∫ (du/u) from 4 to 0.

Which is (-16) [ ln|u| ] from 4 to 0.

Evaluate this:

At u=4: ln(4).

At u=0: ln(0) which approaches -infinity.

Wait, but wait, when u approaches 0 from the positive side (since r approaches 2), the integral becomes:

(-16) ( ln(0) - ln(4) ) ) = (-16) ( (-infty) - ln(4) ) ) = (-16) (-infty) )= +infty.

So the integral diverges to infinity. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but that's confusing. Because with this metric, the area would be infinite, but the options include D) +infty.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps the metric provided is for a finite portion, but the pseudosphere itself requires infinite area.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the pseudosphere's area is infinite, which would match D) +infty.

Wait, but the area we're computing here from the metric is finite because the coordinates are limited to r <2. So that's a finite area. Hmm, but the integral just computed diverges, leading to an infinite area.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me recompute.

The integral inside after substitution is:

∫ [32 r dr ]/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2.

Let me write it as 32 ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to2.

Let me do substitution u =4 - r². Then du = -2 r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes 32 * ∫ [ (-1/2) du ] / u.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (du/u) from u=4 to u=0.

So that's (-16) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Which becomes (-16)( ln(0) - ln(4) ) = (-16)( -infty - ln4 ).

Which is (-16)( -infty ) → +infty.

So the integral is infinite.

Wait, but how can that be? Because when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, and the integrand becomes 32 r/(very small positive number). So near r=2, the integrand behaves like 32*2/(something approaching zero), which is a large positive value. So the integral near r=2 would blow up, leading to an infinite area.

Therefore, the area as per this metric is infinite, which would correspond to option D) +infty.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps the metric given is for a finite portion, but the actual pseudosphere has infinite area. So the correct answer would be D.

Alternatively, maybe I confused the metric. Let me think again about what this metric represents. The denominator is 4 - x² - y², which suggests that the radius is 2. So perhaps the metric is that of a sphere with radius 2, but then the area would be 4π*(2)^2 =16π, but that's not one of the options except option B) and C) which are functions, not numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a pseudosphere with radius 2, but in that case, the area would be infinite because a pseudosphere has infinite extent.

Wait, but the options include 4π(x² + y²) and 4π(x² - y²), which are functions, not numbers. So perhaps the question is misworded, and it's actually asking for the area element or something else.

Wait, the question specifically says, "What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?"

So perhaps the pseudosphere's area is infinite, making D) the correct option.


The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional surface. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To compute the area, we use the fact that the metric is conformally flat, meaning the area element is proportional to the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is then:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To find the total area, we integrate \( dA \) over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) implies that the coordinates are restricted to \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), corresponding to a radius of 2. Switching to polar coordinates \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \). The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-16}{u} \, du = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln|u|\right]_4^0.
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln|u| \to -\infty \), so the integral diverges to infinity. This indicates that the area of the surface described by the metric is infinite.

The question specifically asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). A pseudosphere has constant negative curvature and extends infinitely, leading to an infinite area. Thus, the correct answer is:

**D) \( +\infty \)**.

Answer: D
