Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them normally because of relativity effects. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. 

The two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Wait, their masses are given as 2m and 3m, but their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. I think the problem is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. 

First, for the relative speed. Since both are moving in the same direction, I guess I need to find the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. Let me think about the formula. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity u' is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, which one is u and which is v here? Because if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Calculating the numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction. Since the question probably asks for speed's magnitude, I can say 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Wait a second, but sometimes I get confused whether it's u minus v or v minus u. Oh right, because from the perspective of the first object (A), which is moving at u=0.6c, the other object (B) is moving at v=0.5c. So in A's frame, B's velocity is u' = (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Or is it (v - u)? Wait, I think it's (u - v) when changing frames. No, wait. Let me get this straight. The formula for velocity addition is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (uv/c²)), but that's when the frames are moving in the same direction. Wait, no, wait. Actually, if frame S' is moving at speed v relative to frame S, then the velocity u of an object in S is related to u' in S' by u = u' + v/(1 + (u'v)/c²). Hmm, maybe I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll try to remember correctly.

Wait, no, the correct formula when you have two objects moving in the same direction. Let me clarify: in the lab frame, object A is moving at u=0.6c, object B is moving at v=0.5c. So in A's frame, what is B's speed? Since A is moving at 0.6c, in A's frame, B is moving slower. So the formula would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, no, because v is the speed of B in the lab frame, and u is the speed of A. So, when you switch to A's frame (which is moving at +0.6c relative to the lab), the speed of B in A's frame is (v - u) / (1 - (uv)/c²). So that's (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). That gives (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c, which matches one of the options.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So now I need to figure out the total energy.

Total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy E is given by gamma multiplied by mc². Wait, but each astronaut's mass is 2m and 3m, so their energies would be gamma1*(2m)c² and gamma2*(3m)c².

Let me compute the gammas for each. Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2)
0.6 squared is 0.36, so 1-0.36=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma1 = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² =2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):
Gamma2=1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈1/(0.8660)≈1.1547.

So E2=gamma2 *3m c² ≈1.1547 *3m c²≈3.4641m c².

So total energy E_total=E1 + E2 ≈2.5 m c² +3.4641 m c²≈5.9641 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc². Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. Option D has E=5 mc², which is less than our calculated value.

So the correct option should have v_rel=0.14c and E≈5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed calculation. The relative speed between the two astronauts is the speed of one as seen from the other. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction, from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c -0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1-0.3) )= (-0.1/0.7 )c ≈-0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. Yep, that's correct.

So the options are:

C) v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.6c\) (speed of the first astronaut) and \(v = 0.5c\) (speed of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the problem asks for the magnitude of the relative speed. Thus, \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.9641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the options:

- Option A: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 1.1c\), \(E = mc^2\) (incorrect).
- Option B: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1c\), \(E = 4.96m c^2\) (incorrect).
- Option C: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\) (correct).
- Option D: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5m c^2\) (incorrect).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
