Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength for each star. And their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. 

The question is about the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2. The options are given as A to D, all around 2.2 to 2.35. So, I need to find out by what factor Star_1 is more luminous than Star_2.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, since both stars are being compared, maybe the constants will cancel out. So, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. I think this refers to their peak emission wavelengths. From Wien's law, λ_max * T = constant (approximately 2.9e-3 m·K). So, if the λ_max are the same, then their temperatures must be inversely proportional. So T1 / T2 = λ2 / λ1. But wait, the problem says the wavelengths are the same, so λ1 = λ2. That would imply T1 = T2? Because if λ_max is same, then T must be same. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if they have the same λ_max, then their temperatures would be same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So, T1 = T2? But that might not be correct because their velocities are different. Hmm, wait. Radial velocities—oh, right, Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength would be different from their actual emission peaks. Because if a star is moving towards us (or away), the observed wavelength shifts. But the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps they have the same observed λ_max?

Wait, but in the problem statement, what exactly is given? Let me read again: "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So if they are observed to have the same λ_max, but their actual temperatures might differ because of their velocities. Oh wait, the radial velocity affects the observed wavelength. So the star's emitting at a certain λ, but because of the velocity, the observed λ is shifted.

Wait, so for Star_1, radial velocity is 0. So its observed λ_max is the same as its emitted λ_max. For Star_2, radial velocity is 700 km/s. Assuming it's moving away (since positive velocity typically indicates moving away in Doppler terms, like redshift), the observed λ would be longer (redshifted) than the emitted λ. But the problem says that the observed λ_max for both is the same. So Star_1's emitted λ_max is same as its observed, but Star_2's emitted λ must be different. Because otherwise, if they had same emitted λ, and Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ would be longer, different from Star_1. But the problem says the observed λ_max is same for both. So Star_2's emitted λ is shorter, but because of its velocity, it's shifted to the same observed λ as Star_1.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. Let me denote:

Let λ_emitted_1 be the emitted peak wavelength of Star_1. Since Star_1's radial velocity is zero, the observed wavelength λ_obs
