Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, wait. So |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard basis states for spin-½ particles. So the state |alpha> is a linear combination of these. But it's proportional, meaning there's some normalization factor I need to find.

The first task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Hmm, that's an interesting matrix. I remember that such a matrix represents an operator that's proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So this operator A would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli X. But wait, the Pauli matrices are usually represented with eigenvalues ±ℏ, but maybe here it's scaled differently. I'll have to think about that.

The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are the eigenstates of this operator A as well, since it's a multiple of X. The eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the spin-up and spin-down states along the x-axis. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates and then find the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

But before that, I should normalize |alpha>. The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me calculate the normalization factor. The state is probably a vector in a two-dimensional space, so the normalization condition is that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components equals 1.

So, the coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 -i) for |down>. Let me compute the squared magnitudes.

|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i)=1+1=2.

|2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, which I know are |+x> and |-x>. The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix (and thus of operator A) are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, I think that's right. Let me double-check. The eigenstates of X are (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2) for computational basis states |0> and |1>, which correspond to |up> and |down> here.

So, I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me express |alpha> as a combination:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x> 

Then, substitute the expressions for |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Grouping the terms:

= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But from earlier, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So setting the coefficients equal:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these as equations:

a + b = (1+i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
a - b = (2 -i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)

Wait, no, because 1/sqrt(2) times (a + b) equals (1+i)/sqrt(7). So:

( a + b ) = (1+i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
( a - b ) = (2 -i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)

Hmm, okay. Let me write these two equations:

Equation 1: a + b = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)
Equation 2: a - b = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7)

I can solve for a and b by adding and subtracting these equations.

Adding equation 1 and 2:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
Simplify the numerator: (1 +2) + (i -i) ) → 3 +0 =3
So 2a = 3 * sqrt(2/7)
a = (3/2) sqrt(2/7 )

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
Compute the numerator: (1-2) + (i +i) → (-1) + 2i
So 2b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7)
So b = [ (-1 + 2i)/2 ] * sqrt(2/7 )

Wait, but maybe I should have left the sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) as sqrt(2/7). Alternatively, sqrt(2/7) is 1/sqrt(7/2), but perhaps I should compute the magnitude squared of a and b to get the probabilities.

But wait, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

So let's compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

First, compute a:

a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7 )

So |a|² = (9/4) * (2/7) = (9 * 2) / (4 *7 ) = 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857... approximately 0.64.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that correctly. (3/2)^2 is 9/4. (sqrt(2/7))^2 is 2/7. So 9/4 * 2/7 = (18)/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.64286. Hmm, so that's approximately 0.64, which is one of the options.

Now, compute |b|².

b = [ (-1 + 2i) / 2 ] * sqrt(2/7 )

So the coefficient is [ (-1 + 2i) ] / (2 * sqrt(7/2)) )? Wait, perhaps to compute |b|^2, it's easier to compute the squared magnitude of the entire expression.

The expression for b is ( (-1 + 2i) ) * sqrt(2/7) / 2.

So |b|^2 = | (-1 + 2i) |^2 * (2/7) / (2^2 )

The magnitude squared of (-1 +2i) is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = 1 +4=5.

So |b|² = 5 * (2/7) /4 = (10/7) /4 = 10/(28) =5/14 ≈0.35714. Hmm, but wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357. Which is around 0.36. So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36. Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, with average hbar/7.

Wait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Because perhaps I made a mistake in the expressions for a and b.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to find the probabilities. Since operator A is the Pauli X scaled by ħ/2, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x> as I mentioned. The probabilities are the square of the amplitudes when |alpha> is expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Another approach is to compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x>.

So, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

Compute < +x | alpha >:

 <+x | alpha > = [ <+x|up> + <+x|down> ] / sqrt(7) * (1+i) + [ <+x|up> - <+x|down> ] / sqrt(7) * (2 -i) ?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The state |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product < +x | alpha > is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] multiplied by [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So,

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Since <up|down> =0 and <down|up>=0,

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) *1 + (2 -i)*1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i + 2 -i) ) ]

Simplify: 1 +2 =3; i -i =0. So numerator is 3.

So < +x | alpha> = 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the probability is |3/(sqrt(14))|² = 9/14 ≈0.64286.

Similarly, compute < -x | alpha >.

| -x> = (|up> -|down>)/sqrt(2).

So,

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] multiplied by [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> - (1+i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Again, the cross terms vanish.

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) *1 - (2 -i)*1 ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i -2 +i) ) ]
= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (-1 + 2i) ]

So the probability is | (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) |².

The magnitude squared of (-1 +2i) is 1² +2²=5, so probability is 5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36). So looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36 for probabilities.

Wait, but wait. I recall that operator A is given as A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, else zero. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. So the eigenvalues should be found.

The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[b, a]] are (a + b) and (a - b). So in this case, a=0, b=ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are (0 + ħ/2) and (0 - ħ/2), i.e., ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait, the trace is 0, so sum of eigenvalues is zero. The determinant is (0)(0) - (ħ/2)^2 = - (ħ²)/4, so product is - (ħ²)/4. So eigenvalues are sqrt( determinant ) ± something? Wait no, perhaps better to compute via characteristic equation.

The matrix is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det( [[-λ, ħ/2],[ħ/2, -λ]] )=0.

So determinant is λ² - (ħ²/4) =0 → λ² = ħ²/4 → λ= ± ħ/2.

So yes, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

So the average value (expected value) of operator A is < alpha | A | alpha >.

Wait, there's another approach. Since A is Hermitian (as it's an observable), and |alpha> is a state, the expectation value is the sum over eigenvalues times probabilities.

So the expectation value would be (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [9/14 -5/14 ] (ħ/2) = (4/14) (ħ/2) = (2/7) (ħ/2) ) → (2/7)(ħ/2) = ħ/(7).

So the expectation value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the expectation value is ħ/7. Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that would be option A.

Wait, but looking back at my earlier calculation of |b|², I had 5/14, which is approximately 0.357, but in the options, option A says 0.36, which is close. So that would match.

So I think the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5.
\]
The normalization factor is:
\[
\sqrt{|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2} = \sqrt{2+5} = \sqrt{7}.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, and its eigenstates are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
Substitute \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \):
\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+x\rangle + b|-x\rangle.
\]
Expanding \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) in terms of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), we get:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{a+b}{\sqrt{2}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{a-b}{\sqrt{2}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]
Comparing coefficients with \( |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle \), we find:
\[
\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad \frac{a-b}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
Solving these equations:
\[
a + b = \frac{(1+i)\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad a - b = \frac{(2-i)\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
Adding and subtracting these equations gives:
\[
2a = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad 2b = \frac{(-1+2i)\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
Thus:
\[
a = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad b = \frac{(-1+2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities
The probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \), respectively:
\[
|a|^2 = \left|\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |b|^2 = \left|\frac{(-1+2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]
Thus, the probabilities are approximately:
\[
P(|+x\rangle) \approx 0.64, \quad P(|-x\rangle) \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Average value of \( A \)
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(|+x\rangle) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(|-x\rangle) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9-5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.

Answer: A
