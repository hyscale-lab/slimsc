Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for some kind of elimination reaction, maybe a dehydrohalogenation or something like that.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates an O-H stretch. But wait, I also see a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl, like a ketone or ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. Oh, but wait, the 1720 is a bit low for a carboxylic acid; they usually are around 1700 or a bit lower if they're conjugated. Maybe it's an ester? Or maybe it's a ketone. Alternatively, could it be a carboxylic acid? Because the broad peak in the NMR around 10.5 ppm is a strong sign of an -OH group, like a carboxylic acid.

The NMR data: Starting from the top, 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet integrating to 1H. That's likely a carboxylic acid proton. Then, 8.0 ppm as a doublet (2H) and 7.2 ppm as another doublet (2H). That's typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like, in para-substituted benzene rings, you often get two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, maybe a substituent on the benzene that's in the para position.

Looking further down, 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H). That could be a CH group adjacent to an electronegative group. Then, 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (2H), which might be CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a CH(CH3) group or maybe a methyl adjacent to something else. And 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H), probably a CH2CH3 group.

Putting that all together, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent
