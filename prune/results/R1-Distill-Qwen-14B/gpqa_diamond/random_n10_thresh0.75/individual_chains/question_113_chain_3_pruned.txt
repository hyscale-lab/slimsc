Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options given are four different chemical formulas involving C, H, and O.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The absorption peaks are at 3000 cm^-1, which is a broad peak. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but also, if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol because carboxylic acids have even broader and maybe higher frequency O-H stretches, but I'm not too sure. Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups like ketones, aldehydes, or esters. The 1650 might be something else, maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C) or another carbonyl group but at a slightly lower wavenumber, maybe an ester or amide? Or maybe it's conjugated, like a carbonyl adjacent to something else.

Wait, if the compound has both 1700 and 1650, could that be two different types of carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring. Wait, aromatic C=C (like in a benzene ring) typically absorb around 1600 cm^-1. So 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, which has a carbonyl. But esters usually have around 1700-1750. Wait, maybe the 1700 is an ester, and the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester or something else. Or perhaps it's a ketone and an ester? Hmm.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the hydrogens on a double bond, like in CH2=CH groups. So the compound must have a double bond, maybe an alkene. So the structure probably has an alkene somewhere.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I remember that 45 is a common fragment, like the methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 could be (CH3O)+ because CH3O has a molecular weight of 31 (12+16+1?), wait no. Wait, 45 is C2H5O? No, wait: CH3-O- would be 32 (12+16+1). Wait, maybe it's (CH2O) which is formaldehyde, but that's 30. Hmm. Alternatively, 45 could be an acetate group. Acetate is CH3COO-, which would be molecular weight 60. Wait, maybe it
