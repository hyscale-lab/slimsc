Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when there's a Ca-EDTA complex present. Let me read it again.

The problem says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable.

Wait, the problem mentions "stoichiometric" Ca-EDTA complex. I think that probably means a 1:1 ratio, so each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA^4- ion. So the complex is CaY²−, where Y is EDTA.

The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So the total concentration [CaY²−] is 0.02 M. But we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

I recall the formation constant expression. For the reaction:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA²−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but wait, if the complex is in solution, and assuming it's the only form present (since pH is ideal, so no other species are present), then the total concentration of the complex is the sum of the free EDTA and the complex. But in this case, maybe we can assume that the majority of the EDTA is bound to Ca²+, so the free [EDTA^4-] is negligible? Or perhaps not, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The problem is about the concentration of Ca²+ ions in the solution. So perhaps the solution is that the complex dissociates a little, releasing Ca²+ ions. We can calculate that using the formation constant.

Let me think about the dissociation. The complex dissociates as:

CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−

The K for this reaction is the inverse of the formation constant, right? Because formation was K = [CaY²−]/([Ca][Y]), so the reverse (dissociation) would have K_dissociation = 1/K.

So, K_d = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. So, if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then at equilibrium, [CaY²−] = 0.02 - x. But if x is really small compared to 0.02, we can approximate [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02.

Similarly, the concentrations of Ca²+ and Y^4− would each be x. Because for every mole of CaY²− that dissociates, one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y^4− are produced.

So the expression for K_d is:

K_d = [Ca²+][Y^4−] / [CaY²−]

Which is approximately (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02. And K_d is 2e-11.

So:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11 → x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, since 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2.

Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 10^(-6.5) ≈ 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

Oh wait, but 10^(-6.5) is 3.16e-7, so 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7 M. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the concentration of Ca²+.

But wait, let me go through this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ produced. So [Ca²+] = x, [Y^4−] = x, and [CaY²−] = 0.02 - x.

But if K is 5e10, which is a very large K, so the formation is highly favorable. That means that the dissociation is not favored, so x should be very small. So using the approximation that 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 is valid.

So setting up K_d = (x^2) / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So x^2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 → 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2 *3.16e-7=6.32e-7, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.

But wait, I should check if the approximation is valid. If x is 6.3e-7, then 0.02 - x is ~0.02, which is (0.02 - 6.3e-7) ≈ 0.01999937, which is very close to 0.02. So the approximation holds.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the inverse of the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions dissociated from the complex at equilibrium. The equilibrium concentrations are:

- \([ \text{CaY}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since \( x \) is very small compared to 0.02 M),
- \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = x\),
- \([ \text{Y}^{4-} ] = x\).

The dissociation constant expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{Y}^{4-} ]}{[ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]}.
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Rearranging for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.
