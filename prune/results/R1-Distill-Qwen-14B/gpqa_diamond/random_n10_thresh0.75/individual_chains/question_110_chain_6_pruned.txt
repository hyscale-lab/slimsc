Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand the key points of the question. The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various parameters like RA, DEC, absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, distance, and some extinction values. The task is to find out which of these stars can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait—wait, wait. Oh right, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So that's apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17, since brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So apparent magnitude less than 16 for HIRES.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me clarify: the brighter a star is, the lower its apparent magnitude. So if a star has an apparent magnitude of 16, it's brighter than one with 17. So the ESPRESSO can see up to 17, meaning it can observe stars with apparent V mag of 17 or lower (brighter). HIRES can see up to 16, so only stars with apparent mag ≤16 are detectable by HIRES.

Wait, no, the question says: with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, no—wait, the wording is a bit tricky. The question says, "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Hmm. Because the magnitude scale is inverted, brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, "brighter than 17" would mean apparent mag less than 17. Because, for example, a star with mag 16 is brighter than 17. So, the maximum apparent magnitude that ESPRESSO can observe is 17. So a star with mag 17 is the faintest it can see. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so apparent
