Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution from my studies. Oh right, it's about how particles distribute themselves among different energy states in thermal equilibrium.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the ratio of excitation between the two stars is 2:1 for that energy level. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, the photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So the Boltzmann equation applies here. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, g's are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as ΔE = E_i - E_j. Let's say the lower energy level is j and the upper is i. So ΔE is positive. Since the excitation is higher in star_1, the ratio n_i/n_j for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific level. So for the same energy level, the population (n_i) is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So for star_1: n1 = 2 * n2, where n1 and n2 are the populations in their respective stars.

Wait, but actually, the ratio would be (n_i for star1)/(n_j for star1) = 2 * (n_i for star2)/(n_j for star2), because star_1 has twice the excitation. Or wait, maybe I should think about the ratio of the excitation for the same level in both stars. Let me clarify.

Let me define the ratio for star_1 as (n_i/n_j)_1 and for star_2 as (n_i/n_j)_2. The problem says that (n_i/n_j)_1 = 2*(n_i/n_j)_2. Because star_1's atoms are twice as
