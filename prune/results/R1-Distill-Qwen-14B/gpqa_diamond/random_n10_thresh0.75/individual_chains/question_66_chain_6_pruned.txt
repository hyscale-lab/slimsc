Alright, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, what's the exact question again? Oh right, which symmetries must all operators respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, CPT. 

Okay, I think I remember that effective field theories generally respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory they're based on. The Standard Model (SM) respects Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. But what about CP symmetry? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry adds translations, so it's a bigger symmetry group. Since the SM respects both, so should SMEFT. So options 1 and 2 are definitely required.

Now, what about CP symmetry? I think that depends. The SM doesn't necessarily require all operators to be CP-symmetric because some terms can violate CP. For example, the CKM matrix in QCD allows for CP violation. So operators in SMEFT might include terms that violate CP. But wait, does that mean that the operators must respect CP symmetry, or can they violate it? I think the operators can have terms that violate CP, but the theory as a whole must respect a certain symmetry. Wait, no, the operators can have any possible CP structure unless the symmetry is imposed. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, SMEFT is built with all possible operators that are consistent with the symmetries of the SM. The SM includes the Standard Model group (like SU(2), SU(3), etc.), but also includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. What about CP? The SM does not necessarily respect CP symmetry, as there are CP-violating terms. So the SMEFT must include operators that can violate CP. So the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3, CP symmetry, isn't a must for all operators.

But CPT symmetry is a big one. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT symmetry is required for Lorentz-invariant theories. Because of the spin-statistics theorem, for example. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry because they're Lorentz-invariant. So option 4 is required.

So putting it all together, the required symmetries are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators that respect the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, which includes invariance under rotations and boosts, and Poincare symmetry, which extends Lorentz symmetry by including translations. Since SMEFT is built upon the SM, all operators in SMEFT must respect these symmetries.

CP symmetry, on the other hand, is not necessarily required for all operators in SMEFT. The SM itself allows for CP violation, as seen in phenomena like the CKM matrix
