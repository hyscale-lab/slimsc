Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Right, and the operator P is a vector operator, so the total operator would be the sum of the components multiplied by the corresponding direction vector components. 

The problem asks for the normalized eigenvector. So, to find this, I need to set up the eigenvalue equation for the operator P in the direction n. 

Let me break this down. The operator P is given as a vector, so P = P_x x_hat + P_y y_hat + P_z z_hat, where x_hat, y_hat, z_hat are the unit vectors. But since our direction is arbitrary and lies in the x-z plane, the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), wait no, wait. Wait, in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be 0 or 180? Or wait, no. The direction in x-z plane implies that the direction has zero y-component. So, the unit vector n would be (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Or wait, sometimes it's from the x-axis. Hmm, no, I think in spherical coordinates, θ is from the z-axis. So, if the direction is in x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, perhaps we can just represent it as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if θ is measured from the x-axis. Wait, no, the standard spherical coordinates have θ from the z-axis. So in x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so indeed, the direction can be represented as (sinθ * cosφ, 0, sinθ * sinφ? Wait, no, wait. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, the direction can be represented using polar coordinates in the x-z plane, so it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the x-axis towards the z-axis. Hmm, perhaps that's the way to go.

So, the operator P along n is P · n, which would be (P_x * cosθ + P_z * sinθ), since in this case, the n has only x and z components. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the direction is (cosθ, 0, sinθ), then P · n would be P_x cosθ + P_z sinθ. Because P is a vector operator, so each component (Px, Py, Pz) corresponds to the x, y, z components.

So, the operator along n is (P_x cosθ + P_z sinθ). Because the y-component of n is zero. So, the operator is P_n = cosθ P_x + sinθ P_z.

So, the eigenvalue equation is P
