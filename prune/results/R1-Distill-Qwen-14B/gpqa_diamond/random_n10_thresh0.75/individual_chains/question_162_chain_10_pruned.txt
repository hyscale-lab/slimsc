Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element in two dimensions, but with a specific denominator. So, it's probably a two-dimensional metric, meaning we're dealing with a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, maybe like a sphere or something else.

Wait, a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? In contrast, a sphere has positive curvature. Pseudospheres are like the tractricoid or something similar. So they have a metric that's hyperbolic.

But how do I find the area from the metric? Oh right, the area can be found using the surface integral over the metric's determinant. Wait, the area element in two dimensions is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So I need to compute the determinant of the metric tensor.

The given metric is in terms of dx² and dy², so it's diagonal. The metric tensor components are g_xx and g_yy, which are both equal because the coefficients of dx² and dy² are the same. So the metric tensor g is a diagonal matrix with entries [32/(4 - x² - y²), 32/(4 - x² - y²)].

The determinant of a diagonal matrix is just the product of the diagonal elements. So det(g)
