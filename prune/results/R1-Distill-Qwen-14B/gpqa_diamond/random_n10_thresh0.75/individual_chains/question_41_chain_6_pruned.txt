Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light propagating through glass that's moving. Hmm. Let me see. The question is asking about the speed of light in the glass relative to an observer in the lab. The glass is moving at a constant velocity 'v' in the same direction as the light beam, and toward the observer. The index of refraction is 'n', and the speed of light in a vacuum is 'c', which is given as 1 here.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is also moving in the same direction as the beam. Oh wait, the light is going through the glass, which is moving. So I think this is a problem involving relative motion and maybe some effect like the Doppler effect or something else related to moving media.

I remember that in physics, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n. So normally, when the medium isn't moving relative to the observer, the speed is v = c/n. But here, the medium (the glass) is moving. So does that affect the observed speed of the light?

Wait, but I've heard that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, not on the motion of the medium. So like, if the medium is moving, the speed of light within it remains c/n, right? Because the speed of light in a medium is determined by the medium's refractive index, not its velocity.

But wait, that might not be considering any relativistic effects. Oh, but the problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so perhaps we can ignore
