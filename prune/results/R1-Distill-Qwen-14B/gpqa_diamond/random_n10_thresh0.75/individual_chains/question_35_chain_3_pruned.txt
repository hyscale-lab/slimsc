Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay, which is equal to c times S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S has specific elements: the first row is 0 and -i, the second is i and 0. So I should probably write down the matrix for Ay.

Wait, first, let me write down what S looks like. Matrix S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So multiplying by c, which is h/(4π), the matrix Ay should be:

[ 0          ( -i * h/(4π) ) ]
[ (i * h/(4π) )  0          ]

So Ay is a 2x2 matrix where the non-diagonal elements are ±i c.

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options given are a bit tricky, so I need to go through the process.

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

Let me set up the equation. The matrix (Ay - a I) would be:

[ -a           (-i c)       ]
[ (i c)        -a          ]

The determinant is ( (-a)(-a) ) - ( (-i c)(i c) ) = a² - ( (-i)(i) c² )

Wait, (-i c)(i c) is (-i)(i) c². Let's compute that: (-i)(i) = -(i²) = -(-1) = 1. So that term is c².

So the determinant equation becomes a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c. Since c is h/(4π), then the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which doesn't make sense because our c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are real? Because a is ±c, which is real. So the eigenvalues should be real numbers, not complex.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the matrix Ay is a 2x2 matrix with real diagonal elements (zero) and imaginary off-diagonal elements. Wait, but when I compute the eigenvalues, I get a² = c² so a is real. So the eigenvalues are real numbers.

So looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which can't be, because the eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B: the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2. No, same reasoning, eigenvalues are real. So B is also incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Well, for angular momentum operators, I know that [A_x, A_y] = iħ A_z, so they don't commute. So eigenstates of A_x are not eigenstates of A_y, etc. But, in some cases, an eigenstate of A² can be a combination. Wait, but A² would be the square of the angular momentum. Let me think: the operator A² (the total angular momentum squared) commutes with each component, so the eigenfunctions of A² are simultaneous eigenfunctions of all components? No, that's not right, because components don't commute. Wait, no, A² commutes with all components, so simultaneous eigenfunctions of A² and any one component would form a basis. But if you have an eigenstate of A_y, would it necessarily be an eigenstate of A²? Because A² is a Casimir operator, and for spin systems, any component's eigenstate is also an eigenstate of A²
