Okay, so I've got this question about planets and transits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my exoplanet stuff, but let me think it through.

So the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose which one to observe because they have limited time and want the one with the highest chance of transiting. Both are detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, which probably means their actual masses are the same. Oh, and their orbits are circular, so that's not a variable here.

Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet_2. Specifically, Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So if Planet_2's period is, say, 100 days, Planet_1's is about 33 days. That affects the probability of transit, right? Because a shorter orbital period would mean the planet is closer to the star, which might influence the chances of it passing in front from our point of view.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, why would that be? Oh, right, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. So older stars might expand, but in this case, they have same radii. Interesting.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. But more precisely, the transit probability (p) is given by the formula p â‰ˆ (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2 * (1 - e^2)), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it simplifies. Also, the star's radius and the planet's radius matter, but in this question, I think we can assume R_planet is the same for both since they're Earth-like. Also, since both stars have the same radius, R_star is the same for both.

Wait, but wait, the formula for transit probability is typically p = (R_p / a) / (R_star / a) )? Or maybe it's more like (R_p / R_star)^2 multiplied by some geometric factor. No, actually, the geometric probability is p = (R_star + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the geometric probability of a transit is the ratio of the star's disk as seen from Earth to the planet's orbital area. Wait, no, more accurately, it's the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our viewpoint. The formula is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / (a * sqrt(1 - (b^2))), but I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is given by (R_star / a) / (1 - (R_star / (2a))) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned to cause a transit) is given by p = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star
