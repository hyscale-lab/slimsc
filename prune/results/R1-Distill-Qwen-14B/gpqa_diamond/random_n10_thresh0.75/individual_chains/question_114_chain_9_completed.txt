Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let's read the question again.

The problem is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can undergo various reactions. Let me think about each step.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So when a ketone reacts with a nitrile, what usually happens? Oh wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition? Like the nitrile acting as a nucleophile.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So maybe the ketone is undergoing some kind of addition with CN-. But in a ketone, the carbonyl group is electrophilic. So the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, typically, in the presence of a strong acid, maybe? Because nucleophilic addition to ketones usually requires some activation, like in the case of the formation of cyanohydrins.

Oh right, the cyanohydrin reaction! That's when a ketone reacts with a nitrile (or CN-) in the presence of an acid catalyst. The mechanism is that the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

So the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me check the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN-, the product would have an -OH and -CN on the same carbon, which is the second carbon. So yes, that's a cyanohydrin.

So the reagent A must be an acid that protonates the carbonyl oxygen to facilitate the attack by CN-. Looking at the options, the possible reagents for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, H3O+ is just a strong acid, like sulfuric acid in aqueous solution. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid. Would either of them work as the catalyst for this reaction?

I think the cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid, maybe H2SO4 or H3O+ as the catalyst. So A is likely H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (which is H2O) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. But the reagent here is H2O. Oh wait, no, B is H2O, but perhaps it's in acidic or basic conditions.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must be under acidic conditions. Because nitrile hydrolysis can occur in acid or base. In basic conditions, it forms a sodium salt of the carboxylic acid, but in acidic, it gives the acid directly.

But looking at the reagents, B is H2O. Wait, but if B is H2O, perhaps it's in the presence of another acid. Or maybe the reagent is an acid in water, like H3O+ or HCl.

Wait, the options for B are HCl, CH3COOH, etc. Let me look at the options given.

The options are:

A) A=H3O+, B=HCl

B) A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH

C) A=NaHSO3, B=HCl

D) A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B, and it's H2O. That doesn't make sense because B is given as H2O? Wait, the question states:

"2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> ..."

Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again. The second reaction is written as:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> ...

So B is the reagent, and it's H2O. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps B is the condition, like the solvent is H2O, and the reagent is something else. Or maybe B is the acid in the water.

Wait, more likely, the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So this would require a strong acid as a catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is under acidic conditions.

Wait, the reaction of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid typically involves hydrolysis with strong acid, like HCl in H2O, or perhaps using a strong acid and heat.

Wait, another thought: The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin, which is step one. The second reaction is the oxidation of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid, but wait, no, it's hydrolysis.

Wait, actually, hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done in two main ways: one is under strong acidic conditions, and the other is under strong basic conditions followed by acid work-up.

So for the second step, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile with a benzyl group attached. So the nitrile is -CN. When it's hydrolyzed under acidic conditions, it becomes a -COOH group. So the reagent B would be an acid in water. Looking at the options, possible reagents are HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, in the options, the possible B reagents are HCl or CH3COOH. So which is used for hydrolysis of nitriles?

I think hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is usually done with HCl (concentrated) and heat. Alternatively, sometimes it's done under basic conditions and then acidified, but here the product is the acid, so likely acid conditions.

So for the second reaction, reagent B must be HCl. Looking at the options, option A has B=HCl and A=H3O+. Option C has A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl.

Wait, but the first reaction's reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Earlier, I thought that A is H3O+ because the cyanohydrin reaction requires acid. So for the first reaction, A would be H3O+.

So looking at the options, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. That seems to fit.

Alternatively, I should think about the second reaction. If B is H2O, but the reaction needs some acid, perhaps B is HCl in H2O. So the reagent is HCl, which is option A or C.

Wait, but the question says the reagents are A and B. The first reaction uses A, and the second uses B. So in the first reaction, A is H3O+; in the second, B is HCl.

Looking at the options, option A) A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that matches.

Wait, but another possibility: could the first reaction use NaHSO3 as the acid? Because NaHSO3 is a source of H+ as well, but it's a weaker acid than H3O+.

Wait, in the formation of cyanohydrin, the acid used is typically something like H2SO4 or H3O+ (like in HCl or H2SO4). I think H3O+ is a stronger acid than NaHSO3. So using H3O+ makes more sense for the first step.

So the first reaction uses H3O+ (option A or B), second uses HCl (option A or C). So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me double-check. For the second reaction's product, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. So the hydrolysis requires a strong acid, like HCl in water. So yeah, HCl is needed for B.

So the correct reagents would be A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.


The problem involves identifying suitable reagents for two reactions. 

1. **First Reaction**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the ketone reacts with CN- in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack and form the cyanohydrin. A strong acid like H3O+ is typically used for this reaction, making A = H3O+ the appropriate choice.

2. **Second Reaction**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Such hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic conditions, and HCl in water is a common reagent for this transformation. Thus, B = HCl is the suitable reagent.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H3O+, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH. While A is correct, B (CH3COOH) is not strong enough for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl. NaHSO3 is a weaker acid and less suitable for the cyanohydrin reaction.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH. Both reagents are unsuitable for their respective reactions.

The correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H3O+ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
