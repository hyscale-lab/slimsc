Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given by some 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, and the direction is in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n must be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because it's in the x-z plane, right? Because y-component is zero, and we're in x-z. Hmm, but the exact direction might not matter because we are considering an arbitrary direction. So the operator P along n would be the dot product of P and n. That is, P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the operator becomes P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

Wait, but the eigenvalue equation is P·n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

But how do I construct P·n? I have P_x, P_y, and P_z given. Let me note down their matrix forms.

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P·n = (ħ/2)[n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Because n_y is zero, so the P_y term doesn't contribute.

So the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) times [n_x (σ_x) + n_z (σ_z)], where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

The eigenvalue equation is [n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z] |ψ> = (1) |ψ>, because when we factor out the ħ/2, the equation becomes [P·n] |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, so (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = 1 * |ψ>.

Wait, let me make sure.

Wait, P·n is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). So the eigenvalue equation is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>. So we can divide both sides by ħ/2 to get (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>.

So the operator inside is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), and its eigenvalue is 1.

Wait
