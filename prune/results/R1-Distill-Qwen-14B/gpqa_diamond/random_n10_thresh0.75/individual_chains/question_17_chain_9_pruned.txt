Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of equilibrium problems. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution has a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given K for the complex is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things. Temperature is 25°C, which is standard, I think.

Hmm, I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, it's a kind of association reaction. So in this case, Ca²+ and EDTA form the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation constant, K, is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number. That suggests that the complex is very stable, so the reaction tends to go to completion.

Wait, the complex is stochiometric, so the formula must be something like CaEDTA²−. Wait, EDTA is H4Y, but in solution, it's usually deprotonated. Oh right, EDTA has multiple protons, so the form depends on pH. But the problem says pH is ideal, so I guess it's in the proper form to complex with Ca²+.

The reaction would be something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−. Or wait, maybe I should write it as the formation of the complex. Let me think: EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so it binds to Ca²+ in a 1:1 ratio. So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. Wait, Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). 

But wait, in this problem, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02 M. And we need to find [Ca²+].

Wait, but is that the initial concentration or the equilibrium concentration? Well, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric complex, which I think implies that it's the concentration after the complex has formed. So we can assume that the complex is in solution, and some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

But wait, if Kf is very large, 5e10, that suggests that the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

So, let me model the dissociation. Let's let the concentration of the complex be 0.02 M. Let’s say x is the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. Then, the complex dissociates as:

CaEDTA^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

At equilibrium, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4−] = x, and [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x. But since K is so large
