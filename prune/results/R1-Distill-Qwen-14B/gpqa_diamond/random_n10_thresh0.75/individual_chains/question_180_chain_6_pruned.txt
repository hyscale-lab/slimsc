Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. So, first, I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Since the system is isolated, we're probably looking for the potential energy stored in the configuration of these charges.

Each charge is 2e, so each has a charge of twice the elementary charge. The elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge here is 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

Now, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the distances between the 13th charge and each of the 12 are 2 meters. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at 2 meters from P, but how about their mutual distances?

Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of them is 2 meters away from P. But they are all at the same distance, but arranged around P. So their mutual distances would be varying. However, since the problem is about the minimum energy, I think the configuration of the 12 charges would be such that their mutual potential energy is minimized. But wait, waitâ€”no, perhaps the potential energy we are considering is only the potential between the 13th charge and the others.

Wait, the total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So each charge at 2m contributes to the potential energy due to their interaction with the fixed charge at P, and also due to their interactions with each other.

But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So maybe the configuration of the 12 charges is such that their mutual potential energies are arranged to be as low as possible. Hmm. Wait, but if all the 12 charges
