Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty stable and has multiple bridgehead carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms attached to adjacent bridgehead carbons.

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I think when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, specifically dehydrohalogenation, to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a 1,3-dihalide, not vicinal. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think. In adamantane, the bridgehead carbons are connected in a way that the positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent bridgeheads. So heating with KOH would likely cause an elimination, but maybe a double elimination? Hmm.

Wait, wait. When you have two bromines on adjacent carbons in a structure like adamantane, heating with a strong base like KOH would lead to a double elimination, producing an alkene. Because each Br can leave, and with the base abstracting protons, the molecule would lose two HBr molecules and form a double bond. So the product would be a diene? Or maybe a mono-alkene?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on carbons 1 and 3. If each of these bromines leaves, and the adjacent (vicinal) hydrogens are abstracted by the base, then the structure would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and another between 2 and 3? Or maybe a single double bond? Wait, no, elimination would form a single double bond. But adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so the elimination might form a bridgehead double bond, but I thought bridgehead double bonds are generally not possible because of Bredt's rule. Oh right, Bredt's rule states that bridgehead double bonds are unstable in small bridged bicyclic systems. So, maybe the elimination leads to a different structure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. 1,3
