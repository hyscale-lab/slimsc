Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one fits the given information.

Alright, the data provided includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak is typical for alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, if it were a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be even broader and maybe appear around 2500-3300. But here it's 3000, which could fit either. Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm. The 1700 cm⁻¹ area is where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc.) show up. The 1650 could be an conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some sort of substitution. Alternatively, it might be an amide, but I don't think that's one of the options here.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule must have a double bond, maybe part of a ring or an isolated double bond.

Then the mass spectrum has a fragment at m/z 45. I'm trying to think what that corresponds to. Common fragments: m/z 45 could be a CH3CO+ (acetyl) group, or maybe a CH2CH2O group, but wait, 45 is molecular weight. Let me calculate the possible fragments. 45 might be the molecular ion of something like C3H7O, but I'm not sure yet.

Now, looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So all are six carbons, varying in H and O. Let's think about each possibility.

Option B is C6H10O. That would have a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here. So (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. That could be one ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings. But in the NMR, vinyl hydrogens are present, so maybe a double bond.

Option D is C6H12O. DoU is (14 -12)/2 =1. So maybe a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond is more likely. But IR had 1700, which is a carbonyl.

Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl. So the molecule must have a carbonyl group (C=O). So options with O and O2 are potential candidates.

Looking at the options, A and C have two oxygen atoms.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU: (14-12)/2=1. So maybe one ring or a double bond. But if it has a carbonyl (which would account for one DoU), then there's another DoU elsewhere. Maybe an aromatic ring, but if it's a ring, the NMR would have different features. Alternatively, another double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so maybe a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. Could be two double bonds, or a ring
