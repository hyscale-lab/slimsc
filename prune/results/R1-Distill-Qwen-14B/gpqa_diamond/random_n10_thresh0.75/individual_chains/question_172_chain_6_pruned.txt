Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when atoms are in a specific energy level, their excitation depends on temperature, right?

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Oh wait, but I think excitation actually refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state relative to a lower one. So maybe the ratio of excited atoms is given. If they're twice as excited, that means n1/n2 = 2, where n1 is the number in star_1 and n2 in star_2.

Wait, but the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation is higher in star_1. That would mean the population in the higher energy level is more in star_1 than star_2. So n_upper for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

But wait, how does temperature relate to excitation? Oh right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play. The ratio of populations in two energy states is given by (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

Assuming that the energy levels are the same for both stars, so ΔE is the same. And if the statistical weights (g) are the same for both, then the ratio of n_upper to n_lower would just depend on exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but in this case, both stars are considering the same energy difference, so ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. But maybe the statistical weights are the same, so I can ignore them for now.

So for star_1, n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the question says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Wait, I'm a bit confused. The problem says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So does that mean n_upper for star_1 is twice that of star_2? Or perhaps the excitation is the ratio of n_upper to n_lower, and that's twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, "twice as excited" could be referring to the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. So maybe (n_upper / n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper / n_lower)_2.

In that case, let's write that:

(n_upper_1)/(n_lower_1) = 2 * (n_upper_2)/(n_lower_2)

Which would mean:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / (g1/g_l1) ) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) / (g2/g_l2) )

Wait, but if the levels are the same for both stars, then g_upper and g_lower are the same for both. So g1 = g2 and g_l1 = g
