Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing A and B.

Hmm, okay. Let's break down each step.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So what's the product? The product structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure: the molecule would have a nitrile group (CN), a hydroxyl (OH), and methyl groups on the same carbon. So, the structure is CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait no, wait. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the numbering is such that the nitrile is on carbon 4, but that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)C(OH)CN. Wait, wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be: CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3? No, that's five carbons. Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons with CN on C4, so the molecule would be CH2CH2CH2CN. No, wait, but butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN, but that's pentanenitrile? Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, which is four carbons in a row. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)C(OH)CN. So the starting material is (CH3)2CO (butan-2-one), reacting with NaCN. So, NaCN would act as a nucleophile. Oh, wait, but in the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps?

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, butanenitrile is four carbons, so the product must have four carbons. Let me imagine the structure. So the central carbon is C2. The structure is probably: CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be five carbons. Wait, wait, butanenitrile is four carbons: CH2CH2CH2CN
