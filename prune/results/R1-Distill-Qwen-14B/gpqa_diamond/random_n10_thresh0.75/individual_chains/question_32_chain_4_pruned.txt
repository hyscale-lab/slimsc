Okay, so I have to find the energy of the RHIC when it accelerates a certain nucleus to a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, the question says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So what's the mass number here? Lithium normally has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6, right? Because Li usually has isotopes, like Li-6 and Li-7. So X is Li-6.

So, first, I think I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, but how do I calculate that? I remember that the rest mass of a nucleus is the sum of the rest masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy. Oh wait, but maybe for this problem, they're giving me the nucleus, so I should probably look up the approximate mass or use a formula.

Alternatively, I can consider the atomic mass. The mass of a nucleus can be approximated by using the atomic mass of the isotope. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact value, but perhaps I can proceed with the formula.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0c².

But wait, I don't know the rest mass energy of Li-6. Hmm, maybe I can calculate it using known values. Let's see, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0141 g/mol. Wait, not sure about the exact value. Wait, but I think the standard approach is to find the rest mass of the nucleus.

The nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. So for Li-6, it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So each proton has a rest mass of about 1.007276 GeV/c², and each neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². Oh wait, I need to remember the units. Wait, no, the mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c². Oh right, but let me be precise.

Wait, I think the exact numbers are:

Proton mass (m_p) ≈ 938.272 MeV/c²
Neutron mass (m_n) ≈ 939.565 Me
