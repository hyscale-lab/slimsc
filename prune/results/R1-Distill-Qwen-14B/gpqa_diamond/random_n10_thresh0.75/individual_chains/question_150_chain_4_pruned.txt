Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let's start by reading the question carefully. 

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and it's reacting with a series of reagents. I need to figure out what the final product is after these reactions. The options are A to D, all of which are aliphatic aldehydes with some substituents. 

First, let me think about the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), which probably indicates an aldehyde proton because aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The peak at 9.72 is a triplet, so maybe it's coupling with two protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons usually are deshielded and show as a singlet unless there's something near. Hmm, maybe it's a triplet because it's adjacent to a CH2 group or something.

Next, the peaks at 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). The 6.98 and 6.51 look like they could be from a para-substituted aromatic ring. Each is a doublet, so each pair of protons is in a diad, which would make sense for a para-substituted benzene. So maybe there's a substituent on a benzene ring, like an -OCH3 or something else. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO, so let's see: 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, one oxygen. 

Wait, a benzene ring (6 carbons) and the rest. So perhaps two aromatic rings? Or maybe a single ring with substituents. Let me think, the molecular formula can be broken down. Let's see, C8H9NO: the degree of unsaturation can be calculated. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, for C8H9NO, X is 0, so (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's like a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a carbonyl group (1), perhaps. So maybe an aromatic ring with a ketone or aldehyde group and a double bond somewhere.

Looking back at the NMR. The aldehyde peak suggests a carbonyl at the end. The triplet at 9.72 ppm suggests that the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2 group. So maybe it's something like R-CH2-CHO. But wait, looking at the other peaks: 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That could be an OCH2 group. Like an -OCH2-CHO? Or maybe an ethyl group adjacent to an oxygen? Hmm, but the 3.66 is a doublet, which suggests coupling with one neighboring group. Maybe it's something like an OCH2CH2 group, but that's a thought for later.

The aromatic peaks: 6.98 and 6.51 as doublets. If it's a para-substituted benzene, then the two sets of doublets would correspond to the two protons on each of the two adjacent carbons. So maybe the benzene has an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro or carbonyl, but considering the molecular formula, maybe an oxygen substituent.

Wait, another peak is at 6.27, a broad singlet with 2H. Broad singlet usually suggests either exchangeable protons (like -OH) or perhaps an aromatic ring in a different environment. But if it's a singlet, maybe it's not aromatic. Wait, but 6.27 is still in the aromatic region. Maybe it's a di-substituted ring with two substituents, and the two protons are equivalent, hence a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkenyl group. Oh wait, if it's a conjugated diene or a vinyl group, maybe. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the 6.27 could be an aromatic ring with two protons that are equivalent, but in a meta position, leading to a singlet? Or perhaps it's a substituent that's causing the splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a diastereotopic proton, but that's less likely. Hmm.

Putting this together: maybe the structure has a benzene ring with substituents, and another benzene attached via an aldehyde group. Or perhaps the molecule is something like a nitro compound, but wait, the formula includes an N. Let me think: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, 8 carbons, 9 H, 1 N, 1 O. So the O could be part of a carbonyl, like an aldehyde or ketone, or an ether. The N is likely part of an amine, nitro group, or amide. But the given reagents are NaNO2 and HCl, which are typically for diazotization, which suggests that the compound has an aromatic amine group.

Wait, the reagents are: first, NaNO2 and HCl. That's a typical nitrous acid condition, used for diazotization. So the compound must have an aromatic amine (like aniline). So, in the starting material, there is an -NH2 group attached to a benzene ring.

So, the starting compound would have a benzene ring with an NH2 substituent. Then, when treated with NaNO2 and HCl, it would form a diazonium salt. Then, when aqueous KOH and heat are added, that's a hydrolysis condition, probably leading to the formation of a phenol (since diazonium salts hydrolyze to phenols under such conditions).

Wait, but the starting material's molecular formula is C8H9NO. If the starting material is an aniline derivative, then after diazotization and hydrolysis, the NH2 would become a phenol group (-OH), which would decrease the number of H's, but not sure.

Wait, but let me think about the reactions step by step.

Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl. This is usually for making diazonium salts. So the starting material must have an -NH2 group attached to an aromatic ring. So the starting compound is an aromatic amine.

Reaction 2: H2O. Maybe just a workup or perhaps a hydrolysis step. Alternatively, maybe a hydrolysis of the diazonium salt.

Reaction 3: aq KOH, heat. That's a condition for either hydrolysis of a diazonium salt to phenol, or for elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. But given that the first step is diazotization, it's more likely to be hydrolysis to form phenol.

So, the initial compound is an aniline. After diazotization, it becomes a diazonium chloride. Then, in aqueous KOH and heat, the diazonium group (Ar-N2+) is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (Ar-OH). So the product after reaction 3 would have an -OH group where the NH2 was.

But wait,
