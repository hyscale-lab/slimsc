Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what it's asking. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like calcium, forming a complex. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so less of the free ions are present.

In this problem, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Since it's a 1:1 complex (I think EDTA is usually in a 1:1 stoichiometry with metal ions), the initial concentration is 0.02 M for the complex. But we need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

I think the formation constant equation is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). Because the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But wait, in solution, the EDTA is usually in different protonated forms. However, the question says pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is present as the Y^4- form. So I don't have to worry about the protonation states complicating the calculation; that's good.

So, the complex is formed as CaY²- (since Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to CaY²-). The formation constant is Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

Wait, but in the problem statement, they provided K_Ca-EDTA as 5x10^10. So that's Kf, the formation constant. Right.

Now, the solution is 0.02 M CaY²-. Let's assume that the complex dissociates a little to give some free Ca²+ and Y^4-.

But wait, since Kf is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable. That means that the dissociation is minimal, so the concentration of free Ca²+ will be very low.

But to be precise, I should set up the equilibrium expression.

Let me denote the concentration of CaY²- as 0.02 M. Let's say that x amount dissociates. So,

CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-

Initially: 0.02 M, 0, 0

Change: -x, +x, +x

At equilibrium: 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small), and [Ca²+] = x, [Y^4-] = x.

So plugging into the Kf expression:

Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02 / x².

We know Kf is 5e10, so:

5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / 5e10 = (2 /5 ) * 1e-12 = 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12, which is 0.4e-12, so 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-12)=1e-6, but 1e-13 is sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5 = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

Wait, that would make x approximately 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca²+] is 6.
