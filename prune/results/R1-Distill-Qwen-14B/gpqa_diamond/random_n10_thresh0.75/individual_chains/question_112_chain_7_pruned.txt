Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that there's an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin states can be represented as vectors, and the z-projection corresponds to the Pauli matrix sigma_z.

But wait, the question isn't just about the z-component. Oh right, the next part says we need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Let me think about what kind of matrix that would be.

So for a 2x2 matrix, since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the operator would look like:
[0   hbar/2
 hbar/2   0]
Because when iâ‰ j, it's hbar/2, else zero. Oh wait, that's the sigma_x operator multiplied by hbar/2, right? Because sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by hbar/2, that's exactly the matrix given here. So the operator in question is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

Wait, but sigma_x is the Pauli matrix for the x-direction. So the eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of this operator. So the eigenstates of A (the operator) are the same as those of sigma_x, which are |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or wait, actually, the eigenstates might not be exactly those, but in any case, that's what I should focus on.

The first task is to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A. Since operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, the probabilities will be the square of the amplitudes when |alpha> is expressed in terms of these states.

But wait, wait. Let me
