Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

The key data given are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines of the stars. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift. The RV semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum velocity the star moves towards or away from us. But wait, the problem gives the wavelength shift, not velocity. So I probably need to relate that shift to velocity.

Wait, but maybe I can relate the shifts directly to some other parameters without velocity. Let me think about the RV method formula. The semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. But perhaps there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps it's about the Doppler shift formula. The Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star. The formula for wavelength shift is (delta lambda)/lambda = v/c, where v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light. But since the shifts are given in milliangstroms, which is delta lambda, I can find the velocity ratio between the two stars.

So let's compute the velocity for each planet. Let me write down the data:

- Planet #1: delta_lambda1 = 5 milliangstroms.
- Planet #2: delta_lambda2 =7 milliangstroms.

Assuming the same spectral line is observed, so the rest wavelength lambda is the same for both. Therefore, the velocity of the star is proportional to the wavelength shift. So v1 = (5/lambda) * c, and v2 = (7/lambda)*c. So v2 = (7/5) v1. So v2 is 1.4 times v1.

Wait, but wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is the
