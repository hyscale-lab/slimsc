Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about luminosities of two stars. The stars are Star_1 and Star_2. 

Alright, let's read the details again. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and the mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Interesting. But wait, the question is about luminosity, so maybe mass is a distractor? I'm not sure yet. 

They found the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength due to blackbody radiation, which relates to temperature. So the peak wavelength λ_max is given by Wien's Law: λ_max * T = constant. So if the λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, T must be same. Because the constant (Wien's displacement constant) is the same for both. So T_1 = T_2.

Wait, so both stars have the same temperature? Interesting. So the next part is about radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, but how does that affect luminosity? Oh, maybe this is about Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength, but since we're talking about the star's intrinsic properties, the luminosity shouldn't depend on the velocity. Because luminosity is an intrinsic property, right? The observed brightness (apparent brightness) depends on distance and velocity (like Doppler effect and maybe redshift), but the actual luminosity is independent of motion. So maybe the radial velocities are a red herring here, or maybe not. Let's think.

Wait, the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So I'm supposed to find L1/L2. 

Luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R² T⁴. Oh wait, yes, because the surface area is 4πR², and each square meter emits σ T⁴. So if
