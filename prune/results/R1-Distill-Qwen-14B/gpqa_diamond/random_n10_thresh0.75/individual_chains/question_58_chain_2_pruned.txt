Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? Oh right, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method, and then you remove it later after the infinities have been handled.

So, the question is about which theory doesn't need this regularization when high energies are involved. Let's look at each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics with general relativity. It deals with high energies because it incorporates gravity and is supposed to work at all scales. String theories, like superstring theory, are finite? Or do they still require regularization? Wait, I think that one of the big advantages of string theory is that it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as, say, quantum electrodynamics. Because particles are replaced by strings, which have length scales, so maybe the theory doesn't require the same divergent integrals. Or maybe it does at some levels but handles them differently. I'm not totally sure. I'll have to think more on this.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD has a property called asymptotic freedom, where the force between quarks becomes weaker at high energies. But wait, when you calculate loop diagrams in QCD, you get divergences. So I think you need regularization here. Like, the beta function calculations and things like that—regularization is necessary. So QCD does require regularization. So option B would not be the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. QED definitely has divergences, especially in calculations like the electron self-energy or the vacuum polarization. Without regularization and renormalization, these infinities would be a problem. So QED requires regularization, so option C is not the right answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Hmm, this is the non-quantum version. In classical theory, you don't have the same issues with divergences because you're not dealing with the same mathematical structures as in quantum field theories. Like, classical Maxwell's equations don't have the same kind of infinities when you calculate things like the field of a point charge. Wait, but wait—classical point charges do have some issues, like the infinite self-energy of a point charge. But in reality, in classical theory, you might just accept these as limitations because you model point charges, but you don't use the same regularization techniques as in quantum theories. So classical electrodynamics might not require regularization because it's not a quantum theory where renormalization is a process. So the infinities are present, but you don't regularize them in the same way.

Wait, but the question is which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So let me think again.

Quantum theories (QED, QCD, string theory) all involve dealing with divergences, so they require regularization. But classical theories don't use regularization since they're not using the same mathematical framework. So the correct answer would be D, Classical Electrodynamics.

But wait, the options are about whether they require regularization. So the question is, which theory never requires it. So which of the options don't require regularization at high energies? Because I'm thinking that for QED and QCD, you do need regularization. For superstring theory, I'm not entirely sure—maybe it doesn't require it because it's a different approach.

Wait, superstring theory is a quantum theory. So if it doesn't have the same divergences as QED and QCD, perhaps it doesn't require regularization. Or maybe it does but uses different methods. I'm not certain. Hmm.

Another angle: Regularization is a
