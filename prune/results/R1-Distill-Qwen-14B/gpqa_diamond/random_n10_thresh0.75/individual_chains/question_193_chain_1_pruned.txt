Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. 

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. The key part is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, parallax is a measure of distance, right? I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the farther away a star is, the smaller its parallax.

Wait, the formula given is number of stars (n) varies as 1/plx^5. So n ∝ 1/plx^5. But I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance (r). Since plx is inversely proportional to r, plx = k/r, where k is some constant. Oh wait, actually the formula for parallax is plx = (1 AU) / (distance in parsecs). So distance r (in parsecs) is 1/plx. So r = 1/plx. That means plx = 1/r.

So substituting plx into the original formula. The number of stars n is proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me calculate that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that would be r^5. So n ∝ r^5. Wait, but wait a second, that can't be right. Because if the number of stars increases with r^5, that would mean that as you look further away, you see more
