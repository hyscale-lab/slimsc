Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, I need to figure out where the given density matrix is located in the qubit space. Wait, what do I remember about density matrices and their geometrical representation?

So the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I think this is a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>. Because when you have |0><0| and |1><1|, each is a projection operator, and adding them together gives me a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. But then I multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So ρ is a 2x2 matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I remember that qubits can be represented as points on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Each qubit state is a unit vector on the sphere. But wait, how does this apply to density matrices?

Density matrices are used to describe mixed states. For a qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh right, I think that's the formula.

So if I have ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, then comparing that to the given matrix. Let me compute that. The given ρ is 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). Let's compute each part.

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ would be r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz.

So let's compute (I + r·σ)/2. That would be (1/2) * [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ].

Now the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]]/2, which is the same as (I)/2 because I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So (I)/2 is the given ρ.

Wait, wait. So if ρ = (I + r·σ)/2 is equal to I/2, then that implies that r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So r·σ is zero, which would mean that r is a zero vector. Because if r is (0,0,0), then r·σ is zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would place the state at
