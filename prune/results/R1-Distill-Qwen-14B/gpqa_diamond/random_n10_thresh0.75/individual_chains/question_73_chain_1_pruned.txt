Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics; I need to apply special relativity principles. Let me think about this.

First, the problem gives me two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the other is 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but wait—are they moving in the same direction? The question says both in positive x, so yes. So their velocities are in the same direction. But I'm supposed to find the relative speed between them. Oh right, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting the two velocities. I think the formula for the relative velocity is different. 

I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. If an observer in one frame measures two objects moving at u and v, the relative speed between them isn't u - v. Instead, it's (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me get that right. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So I have to plug in u and v into this.

Wait, but wait—am I calculating the speed of one from the other's frame? Oh yeah, because relative speed is how fast one is moving from the perspective of the other. So for example, if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v, then from A's frame, B's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait—if A is moving at u, and B at v, and both are in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (v - u) divided by (1 - (vu)/c²). But wait, in this problem, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction. Let me think: astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 is at 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6
