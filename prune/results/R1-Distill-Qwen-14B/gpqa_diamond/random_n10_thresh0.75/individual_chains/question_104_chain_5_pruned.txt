Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my exoplanet detection methods, but let me think this through.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have each been found to have a planet using the RV method. Both planets are similar in mass to Neptune. So, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines, which tells us about the planet's existence because the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, I think. But wait, the Doppler shift also depends on other factors, like the orbital period and the planet's distance from the star.

The problem gives two planets. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. They ask how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

I need to recall the formula related to the RV method. Oh right, the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity is given by some equation. I think K is proportional to (M planet * sin i) / (M star^(1/3)) ) * (1/(1 + M planet/M star))^(1/3) ) multiplied by (1/(P)^(1/3)), where P is the orbital period. Wait, that's a bit complicated, but I think I can simplify it.

Wait, since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun) and the planets' masses are similar (Neptune), the M planet and M star terms might be similar enough to cancel out or be treated similarly. Let me see. So, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ (P)^(1/3)) )

But wait, that's not the exact formula. Let me think again. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the mass of the star. So, K ≈ ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) )

But wait, sin i is probably similar for both planets if we assume circular orbits and similar inclinations, like edge-on. Or maybe the question doesn't account for that, so perhaps we can ignore it or assume sin i is the same for both planets. So, sin i would cancel out when taking the ratio of K1 and K2.

So, let me write the equation for K1 and K2.

K1 = [ (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) ] / [ (c^(1/3)) * (M_*^(2/3
