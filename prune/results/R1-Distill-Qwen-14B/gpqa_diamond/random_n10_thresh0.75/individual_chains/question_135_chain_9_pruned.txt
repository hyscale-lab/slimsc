Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question is about the possible decay products of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian.

First, I remember that when a boson decays, the decay products must have enough energy, which is determined by the rest mass of the boson. So the total mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of X for it to be possible. Oh right, because energy and mass are related via E=mc², so the rest mass energy has to be considered.

The Lagrangian given is L = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that looks like a Yukawa interaction. Right, Yukawa couplings describe the interaction between fermions and bosons, like how mesons interact with nucleons. So the fermions here are interacting with the X boson.

So the interaction term would allow the X boson to couple to fermion-antifermion pairs. So the decay X → f f̄ should be possible, right? Because the Lagrangian includes a term with X, so X can emit fermion pairs.

But the mass of the X is 6 GeV. So the fermions that can be produced must have a combined rest mass less than 6 GeV. Each fermion has a rest mass, so for a pair, it's twice the mass of the individual.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But wait, top quarks are really heavy, around 173 GeV. So that's way higher than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks because 2*m_t is like 346 GeV, way more than 6 GeV. So top is out. So any option with t tbar is invalid.

Now the other quarks: up and down are the lightest. Up quark is about 2 MeV, down about 4-5 MeV. So their sum is negligible. So X can decay into uū, dđ, s s̄, c c̄, b b̄, but wait, wait. Wait, what about the masses of the quarks?

Wait, no, the mass of the quark in the Lagrangian—actually, in the Standard Model, quark masses come from the Higgs mechanism. But in the interaction term given, it's (v + X), where v is the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the Higgs. So when the boson X couples to the fermions, it's through this term. So the interaction is λf ψ̄ (v + X) ψ. So this would imply that the Yukawa coupling is proportional to λf, but the mass term comes from the v. So the mass term is the v part, and X is the fluctuation.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. The main point is that the X boson can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it couples to, provided their combined rest mass is less than 6 GeV.

So first, let's list the fermions:

Leptons: electrons (m≈0.5 MeV), muons (≈105.7 MeV), taus (≈1.78 GeV), and their antiparticles.

Quarks: up (2 MeV), down (4 MeV), strange (about 100 MeV), charm (≈1.5 GeV), bottom (≈4.5 GeV). Top is way too heavy, as said earlier.

So for each fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than 6 GeV.

Let's see:

Electron pair: 2 * 0.5 MeV = 1 MeV → allowed.
Muon pair: 2 * 105.7 MeV = 211 MeV → allowed.
Tau pair: 2 * 1.78 GeV = 3.56 GeV → allowed because 3.56 < 6.

Now quarks:

Up pair: 2 * 2 MeV = 4 MeV → allowed.
Down pair: 2 * 4 MeV = 8 MeV → allowed.
Strange pair: 2 * 100 MeV = 200 MeV → allowed.
Charm pair: 2 * 1.5 GeV = 3 GeV → allowed.
Bottom pair: 2 * 4.5 GeV = 9 GeV → oh, that's more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄.

Wait, wait, 4.5 *2 is 9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So b b̄ is not allowed.

So possible quark decays are u, d, s, c.

So X can decay into uū, dđ, s s̄, c c̄.

But wait, what about the leptons? mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

So the possible decay products are:

u, d, s, c quarks and their antiquarks, and the leptons e, mu, tau and their antiparticles.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let's check each option.

Option A) X→b b̄, s s̄, uū, dđ, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

But wait, option A includes b b̄, but from our analysis, the bottom quark pair is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. So option A is incorrect.

Option B) X→ c c̄, s s̄, uū, dđ, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So this includes c, s, u, d, and the three leptons. All their masses are below 3 GeV (since 2*m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is under 6 GeV. Wait, 2*1.78 GeV is 3.56 <6. So tau is allowed. So option B includes all the allowed fermions except top and bottom. Wait, but in our analysis, bottom pair is 9 GeV, which is too heavy. So in option B, the available quarks are c, s, u, d. The bottom isn't included, which is correct
