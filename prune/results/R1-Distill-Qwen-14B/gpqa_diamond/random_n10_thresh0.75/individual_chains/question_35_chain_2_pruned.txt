Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A_y, for a muon. The operator is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and determine which statement among the options is correct.

Hmm. So, my first thought is that since A_y is a 2x2 matrix operator, finding its eigenvalues and eigenvectors should be straightforward, albeit a bit calculation-heavy. Let me jot down the given information.

Given:
- c = h/(4π)
- S matrix:
  [ [0, -i],
    [i, 0] ]
So, A_y = c * S = (h/(4π)) * S.

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. But before I jump into calculations, the question provides multiple-choice options, so perhaps I can reason out some properties to eliminate wrong options without doing all the math.

Wait, but maybe I should just calculate the eigenvalues. Let's proceed.

The eigenvalue equation is A_y |φ> = a |φ>, where a is the eigenvalue and |φ> is the eigenvector.

First, find the matrix representation of A_y. Since S is given, multiplying by c gives the matrix of A_y.

So, A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

Let me compute that. The S matrix is:

0   -i
i    0

So, multiply each element by c:

A_y elements:
[ [0 * c, (-i)*c],
  [i * c, 0 * c] ]

Which is:

[ [0, -i c],
  [i c, 0 ] ]

Now, the general approach to find eigenvalues is to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

The matrix (A_y - a I) is:

[ [ -a, -i c ],
  [i c, -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Calculating the second term: (-i c)(i c) = (-i * i) c². Since i² is -1, that becomes (-i^2) c² = (1) c². So the determinant is a² - (c²)(1) = 0.

So, a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

Wait, but c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a would be ±h/(4π).

Wait, that's the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the real parts are these, and the imaginary parts are zero. Because the eigenvalues are real numbers here. Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Looking at option A: "The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π." Wait, but in our case, the eigenvalues are purely real, so the imaginary parts are zero. So option A is wrong because it's talking about imaginary parts being ±2πh. So that can't be correct.

Option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't fit our calculation, so B is probably wrong.

Option C states that the eigenfunction of A_y can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, A_z. Hmm. Well, since A is the angular momentum operator, the square A² commutes with all components (like A_x, A_y, A_z), so their eigenfunctions can be shared. So the eigenfunctions of A_y should also be eigenfunctions of A². So C's statement is saying yes for A², but no for Az. That could be correct, but I'm not sure yet. I'll keep this in mind.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, the basis functions being the eigenvectors. I think that's correct because any operator's eigenfunctions form a basis for the space. But not sure yet. Let's see.

Wait, but let's get back. So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So any options that talk about eigenvalues with imaginary parts can be eliminated, which is options A and B.

So now the options are either C or D.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Let me think. For angular momentum, the components don't commute. So, knowing that [A_x, A_y] = iħ A_z, etc., the eigenstates of A_y are not eigenstates of A_x or A_z, except for the case when the system has higher symmetry. But generally, they are not. However, the square A² commutes with A_y, so any eigenstate of A_y is also an eigenstate of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of A_z, which is correct because A_y and A_z don't commute, so the eigenfunctions of A_y won't be eigenfunctions of A_z. So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the operator's matrix is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space. So yes, the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) are the basis functions. So D is also correct? Hmm. So now I'm a bit confused because both C and D could be correct, but I need to see whether the statements are correct during the calculation.

Wait, the question says, "During the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct?"

Wait, maybe during the calculation, when I'm finding the eigenvectors, I don't have to worry about whether they form a basis, but perhaps the statement is about the properties.

Wait, the eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix, as long as the matrix is diagonalizable, should form a basis. So D's statement is correct. Because the operator is 2x2 and we found
