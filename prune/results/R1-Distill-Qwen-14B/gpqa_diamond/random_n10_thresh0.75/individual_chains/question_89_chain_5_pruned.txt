Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think it through step by step. The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and it goes through several steps, each producing a new product. The question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Alright, let's break it down. First, I'll try to figure out what each reaction step does. 

The first step is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with strong bases like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene via the E2 mechanism. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a 1,3-dihalide, not vicinal. So I'm a bit confused here. Do they still eliminate?

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, for E2, the leaving groups need to be on adjacent carbons. If the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is a bicyclic system, so the positions are important.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. But KOH is a strong base, so perhaps it's more about elimination. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane—could it form a conjugated diene? Or maybe it's a different process.

Wait, but the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. That makes me think of something like an epoxide, but wait, epoxides are usually formed from alkenes via acid catalysis. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol? No, because diols would be from two substitutions, but KOH is a base, maybe acting as a nucleophile. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: when a dihalide reacts with a strong base, especially in a vicinal dihalide, it forms an epoxide. Wait, wait no—that's for epoxide formation. But in this case, the dihalide isn't vicinal, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Because adamantane is a polycyclic structure, carbons 1 and 3 might actually be adjacent when considering the structure. Oh wait, no. Let me think about adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The positions 1 and 3—if they're on the same bridge, maybe they are actually adjacent. Wait, I think in the structure of adamantane, certain positions are bridgeheads, and others are on the same bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. If the base attacks and removes a bromide, but with two bromines, perhaps it's a double elimination? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction forms a ketone. How? Because, wait, if the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, elimination could
