Hmm, okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is closer than one with 0.5 parsecs, right? So, plx is 1/distance, meaning that larger plx means closer distance.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, so their number increases with volume, but since the universe is expanding or something, but wait, the distribution is uniform in the sky, probably meaning in all directions. So, the number density is the same in all regions.

Let me think in terms of volume. The number of stars per unit volume is constant. So, for a given shell at distance d, the volume of the shell would be the surface area times a small thickness. Oh wait, in 3D, for a thin shell at distance r, the volume element would be 4πr² dr, where dr is the thickness. So if I can express this in terms of parallax, that might help.

Parallax plx is equal to 1/d, where d is the distance. So, d=1/plx. Let me express r in terms of plx. So r = 1/plx. Then, dr is the change in r, which would be -1/plx² dplx, since dr/dplx = -1/plx². Hmm, but I'm more interested in how the number of stars in a range of plx relates to plx.

Wait, the number per unit range of plx. So, if I have a small change in plx, say delta_plx, how many stars are there in that range?

Alternatively, the number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx would depend on the volume of that shell and the number density of stars. Since the number density is uniform, let's say n stars per cubic parsec.

The volume of the shell is 4πr² dr, which is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx/(plx²)). Wait, let me think again. r = 1/plx, so dr = -dplx / plx².

So the volume
