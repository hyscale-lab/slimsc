Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves enolates attacking a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let's break down each part step by step.

The first reaction is between dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. NaOEt is a base, so it probably deprotonates the alpha position of the malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate has two methyl groups and two ester groups, right? So when the enolate is formed, it's a strong nucleophile. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. In the presence of a base, the enolate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. 

Let me draw this out. The methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has a structure where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So, the enolate from the malonate (which is a diethyl ester with two CH2 groups) would attack the beta carbon, which is the one next to the carbonyl. That should add the malonate's enolate to the acrylate's beta position. 

After the addition, the product would have the malonate part attached to the acrylate. Since malonate is a diester, adding it would create a new ester group. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH2, right? So when it forms the enolate, it's the CH2 that becomes the nucleophilic site. When it attacks the acrylate, the acrylate's structure is CH2=CH-p-tolyl (but as an ester, so it's OMe attached). No, wait, the structure is more like CH2-C(O)OMe. Wait, no, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or maybe I got that wrong. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So in this case, it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-p-tolyl? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-p-tolyl group, but wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but when substituted at position 3, perhaps? Or maybe the substituent is on the double bond. Oh wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, but 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on
