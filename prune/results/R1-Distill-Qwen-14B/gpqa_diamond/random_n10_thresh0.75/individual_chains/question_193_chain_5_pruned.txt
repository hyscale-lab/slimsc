Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, so that's N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Hmm.

I remember that parallax and distance are related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, but wait. Parallax in what unit? Oh, right, in parsecs. So if a star is at distance d parsecs, its parallax is 1/d arcseconds. So plx ∝ 1/d. Or, d = 1/plx.

But wait, the problem here is about how N, the number of stars, depends on parallax. So N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). So substituting plx in terms of d, since plx = 1/d, then 1/(plx^5) would be (d)^5. Because plx = 1/d → 1/plx = d. So 1/(plx^5) = (d)^5.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me think again. If N ∝ 1/plx^5, then substituting plx = 1/d, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Does that mean the number per unit distance? Or the total number up to that distance?

Wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Oh, so they're asking for the number of stars per unit distance. So it's the density, perhaps. So maybe the number per unit distance r would be the derivative of N with respect to r, or perhaps N is a function of r, and we're looking for how the number in a thin shell (a small change in r) scales.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of stars in a given volume as a function of distance. Wait, but the question says per unit range of distance. Hmm
