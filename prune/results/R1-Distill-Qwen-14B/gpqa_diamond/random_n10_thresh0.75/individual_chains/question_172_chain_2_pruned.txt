Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, when atoms are excited, it relates to their energy levels. I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the population of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium.

Wait, so the Boltzmann equation is probably involved here. The equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ), where n is number density, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k_B is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. 

In this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as Î”E = 1.38e-23 J. Also, the excitation level is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. So for star_1, the ratio n1/n_lower = 2 times that of star_2, n2/n_lower. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So I think the excitation ratio is n1/n2 = 2. Or wait, maybe the excitation per unit in their respective photospheres. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify that.

Wait, the problem states: "iron atoms in the
