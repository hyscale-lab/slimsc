Alright, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice science question. Let me read through it carefully and break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a reaction involving Substance X and Liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, precipitate G, and another substance B. There's also some information about a keto acid reacting with X. The goal is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Let me list out the given information:

1. Substance X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements.
2. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons.
3. A precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is about 4°C.
4. The product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms.
5. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

First, I need to identify what X, Y, W, G, and B could be.

Starting with B: its melting point is about 4°C. What substances have a melting point near that? One that comes to mind is water (H2O), which melts at 273 K (0°C). Wait, 277 K is about 4°C, so maybe B is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a different form or a different compound. Another thought: maybe B is sodium chloride? No, NaCl has a much higher melting point. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the reaction steps.

The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So G might be a compound that decomposes upon heating to give B. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating might release CO2 and leave behind a metal oxide. Alternatively, G could be a sulfate or another salt.

Looking at gas W: its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecular formula would be something where the sum of the atoms' protons and neutrons is equal. Wait, but the molecule itself must have equal numbers of protons and neutrons for each atom? Or the entire molecule's total protons equals total neutrons? I think it's the latter. So, for example, if the molecule is H2O: H has 1 proton and 1 neutron each (protium), O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's the common isotope). So total protons: 2*(1) + 8 = 10. Neutrons: 2*(1) + 8=10. So H2O fits, as W could be water.

Wait, but W is a gas released when X reacts with Y. So what reaction produces water as a gas when a heavy liquid reacts? Maybe a metal reacting with an acid. For example, if X is a metal reacting with an acid Y (like HCl), producing H2 gas (water doesn't fit because H2 has same protons and neutrons but that's another possibility). Hmm, let's think again about gas W.

Wait, H2 is a possibility because each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium, but maybe not). Another possibility: CO2. Let's see, CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and two O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 =22; neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. So CO2 would fit. But is CO2 a gas released in such a reaction? Maybe if Y is carbonated, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, what about NH3? Let's see, N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if it's Nitrogen-14), H has 1 each. So for NH3: 7 + 3*(1) =10 protons; 7 + 3*(1)=10 neutrons. So that works. But would a reaction between X and Y produce ammonia? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else.

Wait, another option: O2. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits. But O2 is a diatomic gas, and is it produced in this reaction? Maybe if Y is a peroxide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, CO: carbon has 6 p and 6 n, O has 8 p and 8 n. So total p=14, n=14. That works. But again, is CO a likely gas here?

Wait, let me think about the reaction. X reacts with Y violently, releasing gas W. Y is a liquid. So perhaps Y is a strong acid, like H2SO4, HCl, etc. If X is a metal, perhaps an alkali metal like Na or K, which reacts violently with acids to produce H2 gas. So W could be H2.

H2: each H atom has 1 p and 1 n. So two H atoms: 2 p and 2 n. So total p and n are equal. So W could be H2.

So if W is H2, then the reaction between X and Y is a metal reacting with an acid to produce H2 gas. So X would be a metal, Y is an acid, like H2SO4 or HCl.

So the reaction would be, for example, Mg (magnesium) reacting with HCl to produce MgCl2, H2 gas, and some precipitate? Wait, but magnesium reacts with HCl to produce MgCl2 and H2 gas, but no precipitate because MgCl2 is soluble. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe another metal, like Ag, which doesn't react with HCl because it's less reactive, but perhaps reacts with a stronger acid like HNO3. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between a carbonate and an acid, but that would produce CO2 gas.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that W could be H2 or CO2 or something else. Let's think further.

The precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. If Y is an acid, and X is a metal, then perhaps X is a metal that forms an insoluble salt. For example, if Y is H2SO4 and X is Ag, Ag2SO4 is soluble, but maybe if X is another metal like Ba, BaSO4 is a precipitate.

Wait, let's think: if X is Ba, then reacting with H2SO4 would produce BaSO4 precipitate and H2 gas? No, because Ba reacts with H2SO4 to produce BaSO4 (s) and H2 (g). That fits.

Wait, but wait, Ba metal is quite heavy and reacts violently with H2SO4. So, when Ba reacts with H2SO4, the reaction is:

Ba (s) + H2SO4 (l) → BaSO4 (s) + H2 (g)

So in this case, W is H2, G is BaSO4, and when BaSO4 is heated, does it release B? Hmm, heating BaSO4 doesn't typically decompose. So maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base, but then the reaction would produce a different gas.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G upon heating releases B. If G is a carbonate, such as calcium carbonate, heating would produce CO2 and leave behind the oxide. But earlier, the gas W would have to be CO2 in that case. Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, heating might dehydrate it.

Wait, let's think again about B. Its melting point is close to 277 K (about 4°C). What has a melting point near 4°C? Maybe water (0°C), but that's 273 K. Alternatively, perhaps ice? Or another substance. Wait, maybe B is sodium chloride? No, that's way higher. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid like glucose? No, melting points vary. Or maybe B is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a solid, like a metal, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the other clues.

The product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid is an organic acid with a ketone group. For example, pyruvic acid has a ketone group. So when this reacts with X, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition or some kind of alkylation.

Wait, if X is a metal, maybe it's used in a Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents are organometallic compounds, like MgBr2 (but I'm not sure). Wait, no, Grignard reagents are usually RMgX, where R is an alkyl or aryl group and MgX is the bromide or chloride.

Wait, the question says that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X must have an element with a heavy isotope. For example, maybe chlorine which has a common isotope Cl-35 and Cl-37. So perhaps X contains Cl.

Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Grignard reagents use Mg, which is a metal. Another possibility is something like LiAlH4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction:

X (which may be an organometallic reagent) reacts with a keto acid. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, if X is something like NaH, which is a strong base, but maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, if X is a metal like Na, and the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid. When they react, perhaps an elimination occurs, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal hydride. For example, LiAlH4 is a strong reducing agent, used in organic reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal like lithium or sodium, used in the Birch reduction or similar reactions.

But maybe I should go back to the reaction steps.

So, X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W, precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B.

If W is H2, then perhaps Y is an acid.

So, X is a metal that reacts with an acid (Y) to produce H2, the metal sulfate (if Y is sulfuric acid) as precipitate G.

Wait, but for G to be a precipitate, the metal sulfate must be insoluble. So if X is Ba, then BaSO4 is insoluble. So when Ba reacts with H2SO4 (liquid Y), it produces BaSO4 (G) and H2 (W).

Then, heating BaSO4 doesn't produce anything; it's a stable solid. So maybe B isn't from BaSO4. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another acid. For instance, if Y is HNO3, then the reaction would produce a nitrate. But if X is Ag, AgNO3 is soluble. So perhaps X is a metal that forms an insoluble nitrate. Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: G is a carbonate, which when heated, releases CO2 and forms the oxide. Then, W would be CO2. So let's see:

If W is CO2, then what reaction produces CO2? Maybe the reaction is between a carbonate and an acid. For example, CaCO3 reacts with HCl to produce CO2, CaCl2, and water. But in this case, Y is an acid (like HCl), X would be CaCO3 (a solid), but the question says X is a substance that reacts with Y. So X could be CaCO3, Y is HCl. But then, the reaction would produce CO2 (W), CaCl2 (soluble, so no precipitate?), but wait, CaCl2 is soluble, so perhaps G is something else. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, but the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X contains an element with a heavy isotope, like Cl-37. Wait, if X is a chloride, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a halogen. Wait, no, because X would have to have a heavier isotope, like Cl.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. So if the keto acid is something like H2CO (formaldehyde), but that's not an acid. Wait, pyruvic acid is CH3COCH2COOH. When it reacts with X, perhaps a substitution occurs, replacing an oxygen with something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if X is a metal like Li, reacting with a keto acid like glyoxylic acid (which has a ketone group and two COOH groups), the product might have fewer oxygen atoms. Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms. That seems unclear.

Let me try to think about B again. It's a solid with a melting point near 4°C. Another thought: maybe B is a different compound, like a hydrate. For example, sodium hydroxide doesn't fit. Wait, maybe B is something like a metal oxide that has a low melting point. Or perhaps B is a solid formed from the decomposition of G.

Wait, maybe G is a carbonate that upon heating decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. Suppose G is NaHCO3. Heating NaHCO3 (baking soda) produces Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. Wait, but the melting point of B is around 4°C. Na2CO3 has a much higher melting point, around 850°C. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G could be a hydroxide. For example, if Y is water and X is a metal that reacts to form a hydroxide, which upon heating dehydrates. But I'm not sure how that would fit with the other clues.

Let me try to approach this from the elements present in X. X has a heavier isotope. So the elements in X must include an isotope that's heavier than the common one. For example, Cl has a common isotope Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if X contains Cl, it might be Cl-37.

Now, what substances that are used as reagents in organic chemistry contain Cl and heavier isotopes? One possibility is CCl4 (carbon tetrafluoride), but that's stable and doesn't react much. Alternatively, perhaps X is a chlorinated compound, like dichloromethane, but that's not a reagent that reacts violently.

Wait, another reagent is LiAlH4, which contains H and Al. But Al has isotopes, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps X is a Grignard reagent, which is an organomagnesium compound. Grignard reagents are used in organic chemistry to form new carbon-carbon bonds. So, for example, Mg is involved.

If X is a Grignard reagent, it would be something like CH3MgBr. So, the elements involved are C, H, Mg, and Br. Now, Br has isotopes, including Br-79 and Br-81. So X could be CH3MgBr, which contains Br, which has heavier isotopes.

But wait, Grignard reagents are typically made by reacting Mg with an alkyl or aryl halide, like CH3Br. So, when Mg reacts with CH3Br, it forms CH3MgBr.

So, if X is a Grignard reagent (like CH3MgBr), then Y could be a keto acid. Let me think about that.

The reaction between a Grignard reagent and a keto acid (like a ketone acid) would typically add the organometallic to the carbonyl group. For example, adding CH3MgBr to a ketone would form an alcohol after protonation.

Wait, but the product is said to contain two oxygen atoms. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me think: a typical Grignard addition to a ketone (like acetone) would produce a secondary alcohol, which has an -OH group. The starting ketone has one O, and the product would have one O as well (in the -OH). Wait, but the product here has two O atoms. Maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a Grignard reagent and a carboxylic acid. Grignard reagents can add to carboxylic acids, but that usually requires activation, like converting the acid to an acid chloride. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with a ketone, and the product has two oxygen atoms from somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is something like H2CO3 (carbonic acid), but that's not a common reagent. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the reaction steps.

X reacts with Y violently, producing H2 gas (if W is H2), precipitate G (like BaSO4 if X is Ba), and when G is heated, it produces B with a melting point near 4°C. Wait, BaSO4 is a white precipitate, but when heated, it doesn't change. So I'm back to thinking that maybe W isn't H2.

Alternatively, maybe W is CO2. Then, the reaction is between a carbonate and an acid, producing CO2 gas. In that case, X would be a metal carbonate, and Y the acid.

So, X is a metal carbonate (like CaCO3), Y is HCl. The reaction is:

CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O.

But then, the precipitate G would be CaCl2, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt, like AgNO3, and X is a carbonate. Then, the reaction would produce CO2, Ag2CO3 (if it's insoluble). Wait, but Ag2CO3 is not a common compound; silver carbonate is slightly soluble. Maybe X is a different carbonate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base. But that complicates things.

Another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If B is a solid with a low melting point, perhaps it's a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate when heated loses water, but that doesn't fit with a low melting point.

Wait, another thought: B could be ice, but ice melts at 273 K (0°C), which is close to 277 K (4°C). But ice is H2O. So perhaps B is H2O, but that's a liquid, not a solid.

Wait, perhaps B is a solid with a melting point close to 4°C. Maybe it's something like ammonium chloride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think about the reaction where a precipitate forms upon reaction, which upon heating produces B.

Suppose G is a sulfide, like FeS. Heating FeS doesn't release anything, so that probably isn't right.

Wait, perhaps G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is Al and Y is NaOH, but that's not producing a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate, but I'm stuck.

Another approach: Let's think about what the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. These would be sums of two elements' atomic masses. Let's list the possible pairs.

Option A: 35 → maybe Cl (35.5) and something else? Wait, 35 is close to the atomic mass of Cl (35.45). But perhaps another element.

Wait, wait, the question says, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. So if X has multiple elements, each with their own isotopes, but for the purpose of this calculation, sum the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses in X.

So, for example, if X is CH3MgBr, the elements present are C, H, Mg, Br. The lightest is H (1), the heaviest is Br (80 approximately). Their sum would be around 81. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps that's not the right X.

Another possibility: X is a metal with a heavier isotope, like Cl. Wait, if X is Cl2, but that's a diatomic gas and doesn't fit with being a reagent in organic chemistry. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing Cl and another element.

Wait, another thought: X is a metal, like sodium, which has isotopes. The common isotope is Na-23, but it also has Na-24, etc. But that's not a heavy isotope. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with a heavier isotope, like Cl.

Wait, if X is Cl2, then the lightest and heaviest elements in X would just be Cl. So the sum would be 35.5 (Cl's atomic mass). But 35 isn't exactly that, but option A is 35. So that might be a possibility.

But wait, the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So if X is Cl2, it's possible that some of the Cl atoms are the heavier isotope (Cl-37). But that wouldn't change the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements, as both are Cl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about the product with the keto acid. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. If X is a diatomic molecule, like O2, but that doesn't fit with the reaction.

Alternatively, if X is a metal, like Li, and the reaction with a keto acid adds Li to the acid. For example, a keto acid like glyoxylic acid (O=C(OH)-COOH) reacting with Li would form Li-O-C(OH)-COOH. But I'm not sure how that would result in two oxygen atoms.

Wait, perhaps X is a hydride like LiAlH4. When it reacts with a keto acid (like a ketone), the product would be an alcohol, which has an -OH group. But that's only one oxygen.

Another possibility: X is a thiol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a borohydride, like NaBH4, which is used in organic reactions to reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols. But the product would add H, not O.

Wait, let's think about the product again. It contains two oxygen atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like HCOOH (formic acid), which has one carbonyl group. If X is a Grignard reagent, adding to form HCOO-R, which has two oxygen atoms in the acid group. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something with two oxygen-containing functional groups.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another angle. Let's think about the initial reaction's products. If W is CO2, then X could be a carbonate reacting with an acid.

But then X would be a metal carbonate, which when reacted with an acid produces CO2, the metal salt, and water. The precipitate would be the metal salt only if it's insoluble. So if X is CaCO3, which is insoluble in water, reacting with HCl (Y) would produce CO2 (W), CaCl2 (G, which is soluble, so no precipitate). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a weak acid, and X is a metal carbonate that is only slightly soluble. For example, SrCO3 is slightly soluble. So when it reacts with HCl, it produces CO2, SrCl2, and H2O. If SrCl2 is more soluble, then G would be a precipitate of SrCl2 only if it's not soluble. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe X is a basic carbonate. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt, but I'm not making progress.

Another approach: the melting point of B is close to 277 K (4°C). What is a common solid that melts around there? Maybe a hydrated salt. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate has a melting point around 23.3°C, but that's not close. Alternatively, maybe it's a different hydrate.

Wait, another thought: B could be solid water (ice), which melts at 273 K (0°C). The given B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is 4°C. So perhaps B is a hydrate that melts just above 0°C. For example, calcium nitrate tetrahydrate has a melting point around 2.5°C. That's close to 277 K (4°C). So B could be calcium nitrate tetrahydrate.

If B is calcium nitrate tetrahydrate, then when G is heated, it releases B. So G must be something that upon heating gives Ca(NO3)2·4H2O. Hmm, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps G is calcium nitrate hexahydrate, which upon heating loses some water to form a different hydrate. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a different compound that upon heating gives B as a byproduct. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating it might produce CO2 and B as a metal oxide. But I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to connect the elements in X to the options given. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

These numbers suggest the sum of two atomic masses. Let's think which pairs of elements could sum to these numbers.

Option A: 35 → maybe Cl (35.5) and something with a mass of 0? No. Or perhaps Na (23) and Mg (24.3): 23+24.3=47.3, not 35.

Option B: 25. Maybe carbon (12) and oxygen (16): 12+16=28. Close but not 25. Or maybe nitrogen (14) and something else? 14 + 11 (Na)=25. So Na and N.

Option C:31. Let's see: O (16) and S (32): 16+32=48. No. Cl (35.5) and H (1): 36.5. Close to 35 but not 31. Wait, 15 (P) + 16 (O)=31. So P and O.

Option D:29. Let's see: 12 (C) + 17 (Cl)=29. So C and Cl.

Wait, but the question says the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So if X contains elements A and B, with A being lighter and B heavier, sum their atomic masses.

Looking back, the options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

So, which pair sums to these numbers?

Option D: 29 → C (12) + Cl (17?) Wait, Cl's atomic mass is about 35.5. So 12 + 17=29. So perhaps the elements are C and S (32)? No, 12 +32=44. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the heaviest is Cl (35.5) and the lightest is Na (23), sum 58.5. Not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the elements are O (16) and F (19): sum 35. So that's option A. But I'm not sure if X contains O and F.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are O (16) and S (32), but that's 48.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the elements are H (1) and Cl (35.5), sum 36.5 → closest to option A (35). But if X only has H and Cl, like HCl, then the sum would be 35.5 + 1 =36.5. So option A is 35, which is close.

But earlier, X is a reagent in organic chemistry. HCl is more of an acid, not a reagent in organic chemistry for forming carbon-carbon bonds.

Wait, another thought: X could be a chloroform, CHCl3. Then the elements are C (12), H (1), Cl (35.5). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, which is close to option A (35). But chloroform is used as a solvent, not a reagent in forming carbon-carbon bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3Cl (methyl chloride), which is used in some reactions, but again, the sum would be 12 (C) + 35.5 (Cl) = 47.5, but the lightest element is H (1), so 1 +35.5=36.5.

Hmm, not matching any options except possibly A (35).

Wait, another possibility: X contains two elements, one being O and another being F. O (16) + F (19) =35. So option A is 35. So sum is 35. So X could be something like OF2. But I'm not sure if such a compound is used as a reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains O and S: 16 +32=48, which isn't an option. So maybe that's not right.

Another possibility: X contains C and O. 12 +16=28, not an option. Or C and S: 12 +32=44, no.

Wait, option C is 31. Maybe the elements are P (31) and something else. But P's atomic mass is around 31. So perhaps X has elements like C (12) and P (31), sum 43. Not matching.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a molecule with two oxygen atoms, like H2O2 or something else. But that seems unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ether with two oxygen atoms. But I'm not making progress.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to summarize what I have so far.

- X is a reagent in organic chemistry, possibly a Grignard reagent or a hydride.

- X has a heavier isotope, probably Cl.

- The product with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms.

- The reaction of X with Y produces H2 gas, a precipitate G, which upon heating gives B with a melting point near 4°C.

Since I'm not making progress on the reaction, perhaps I should focus on the atomic mass part.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. These are likely the sum of two atomic masses.

Looking for pairs:

Option D: 29 → Could be C (12) and Cl (17?), but Cl is 35.5.

Wait, 12 (C) + 17 (Cl) =29? No, 12+17=29. So that's possible if the Cl is a lighter isotope? Wait, Cl has isotopes, but the atomic mass is still around 35.5. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe the elements are N (14) and O (16). 14+16=30, not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 25: 12 (C) +13 (Al)=25? No, 12+13=25. So C and Al.

If X contains C and Al, like in some organometallic compound, then the sum of lightest (Al is 27, C is 12). So Al is heavier than C. So lightest is C (12), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 39, not matching any options.

Another possibility: lightest is O (16), heaviest is F (19). Sum 35. So option A is 35.

But earlier, I thought W might be H2, but if X contains O and F, perhaps it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains O and Cl. Sum would be 16 +35.5=51.5, not matching any options.

Wait, another thought: what if X is a diatomic molecule like O2? Then the sum is 16 +16=32, which is not an option.

Alternatively, X could be a compound like CO, which has C (12) and O (16). Sum is 28, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the elements are F (19) and something else. 19 +6 (C)=25. So option B is 25. So F and C.

But do any reagents in organic chemistry contain C and F? Maybe TFE (tetrafluoroethylene), but that's more of a polymer precursor.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a fluorinated compound, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck on this part. Let me think about the possible answers.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

If I have to choose, perhaps the correct answer is A)35, considering that X might contain Cl (35.5) and H (1), sum 36.5, but option A is 35. Alternatively, if the elements are O (16) and F (19), sum 35.

But I'm not confident. Another angle: the product of X with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. If X is a Grignard reagent (RMgX), adding to a keto acid would produce an alcohol. But that has one oxygen. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between X and the keto acid to form a hemiacetal, which has two oxygen atoms. But I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, I think I should make an educated guess based on the available data.

The melting point of B is close to 277 K (4°C). If B is sodium chloride, its melting point is around 800°C, so that's not it. If B is something like ammonium chloride, melting point is around 340 K (67°C), which is higher.

Wait, another possibility: B is a hydrate, like MgSO4·7H2O, which has a melting point of around 20°C. That's close to 4°C? No, it's higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different hydrate.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Wait, another thought: B could be a solid with a melting point near 4°C. Maybe it's a solid with a crystalline structure that melts at that temperature.

But I'm not making progress. Considering the time I've spent, I'll proceed to the conclusion.


The question involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with Liquid Y to produce Gas W, Precipitate G, and ultimately releases B upon heating G. B has a melting point close to 277 K (4°C). Additionally, the product of X with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The goal is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include H₂ (2 protons, 2 neutrons) or CO₂ (14 protons, 14 neutrons). However, H₂ is more likely due to its simpler composition and commonality in reactions involving metals and acids.

2. **Precipitate G and B**: G forms when X reacts with Y and releases B upon heating. B has a melting point near 4°C, suggesting it could be a hydrate or a compound with a low melting point. For example, calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca(NO₃)₂·4H₂O) has a melting point close to 4°C.

3. **Reaction of X with a Keto Acid**: The product contains 2 oxygen atoms. This suggests X may react with a keto acid to form a compound with two oxygen-containing functional groups, such as an alcohol or a hydrate.

4. **X as a Reagent in Organic Chemistry**: X is likely an organometallic compound or a reducing agent, such as a Grignard reagent (e.g., CH₃MgBr) or a hydride (e.g., LiAlH₄). Grignard reagents are known for forming carbon-carbon bonds and reacting with carbonyl compounds.

5. **Heavier Isotope in X**: X incorporates a heavier isotope, likely chlorine (Cl-37) or another halogen. This aligns with the use of halogens in organometallic compounds.

6. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The options provided (25, 29, 31, 35) suggest the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. For example:
   - **Option A (35)**: Could correspond to chlorine (Cl, ~35.5) and hydrogen (H, ~1), summing to ~36.5, close to 35.
   - **Option D (29)**: Could correspond to carbon (C, ~12) and chlorine (Cl, ~17), summing to 29.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are **35**, corresponding to chlorine and hydrogen. This aligns with the use of halogens in organometallic compounds and the reaction described in the question.
