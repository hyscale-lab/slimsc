Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. Let me go through it step by step.

The question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and after a series of reactions, I need to determine the final product from the given options.

First, I'll try to figure out the structure of the starting compound based on the NMR data. Let's look at the NMR peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet. High ppm, around 9.7, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but an aldehyde proton is usually a singlet unless there's something else nearby. Hmm, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Or maybe the coupling is with adjacent protons in a conjugated system. Maybe it's part of a conjugated enal or something like that.

- 6.98 (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. Those could be from an aromatic ring. The downfield shift suggests substitution on the ring. If two aromatic protons are doublets, maybe they are para-substituted. Like a benzene ring where the substituents are in the para positions.

- 6.51 (d, 2H): Another doublet of two protons. Again, aromatic but maybe in a different environment. So perhaps two different aromatic groups? Or maybe part of a conjugated system.

- 6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for two protons. Broad suggests they might be exchanging, like in an -OH group, but wait, it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe they are part of a conjugated diene or something else. But wait, the molecular formula has an O. Maybe it's an enol or some sort of conjugated diene with substituents.

- 3.66 (d, 2H): Doublet for two protons. This seems like a CH2 group attached to something deshielding. Maybe an oxygen nearby. Like an OCH2 or something else, but the downfield shift isn't too high, so maybe a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen.
