Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with stability constants and complexation equilibria. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate ions, and the stability constants for the different complexes.

Let me start by jotting down what I know. So, the initial concentrations are [Co²+] = 1e-2 M (that's 0.01 M), and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The stability constants, β1 to β4, are given as 9, 40, 63, and 16 respectively. I think these β values correspond to the different complexes, like Co(SCN)₁, Co(SCN)₂, up to Co(SCN)₄.

Wait, wait, I need to clarify. Stability constants (formation constants) typically represent the equilibrium for the formation of a complex. For example, β1 would be for the complex [Co(SCN)]²+ where n=1. So the complexes are: Co²+ + SCN⁻ ↔ Co(SCN)²+ (β1), then Co(SCN)²+ + SCN⁻ ↔ Co(SCN)₂²+ (β2?), but wait, maybe the β values are cumulative. Hmm, right, often the stability constants are cumulative, meaning βn is the constant for the complex with n ligands.

Wait, the notation can be confusing. The stability constant for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise constants up to that point. So, for example, β1 is K1 = [Co(SCN)]²+ / ([Co²+][SCN⁻]). Then β2 would be K1*K2 = [Co(SCN)₂²+]/([Co²+][SCN⁻]^2), and so on.

So, given that, the four stability constants provided are for the complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 SCN⁻ ligands respectively. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

Our goal is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think dithiocyanato would be two SCN⁻ ligands, so Co(SCN)₂²+. Wait, but the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." So the complex in question is the one with two SCN⁻ ions attached, Co(SCN)₂²+.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the color is associated with the number of ligands. For example, [Co(SCN)]²+ is pink, [Co(SCN)₂]²+ is blue, [Co(SCN)₃]³- is something else, etc. So the blue one is the one with two SCN⁻ ions.

Wait, no, wait. I think I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think: I remember that the [Co(SCN)₆]³⁻ complex is the one that's intensely colored, like blue. But wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato," which would be two SCN⁻, so that's [Co(SCN)₂]²+? Or is it [Co(SCN)₂]³+? No, Co²+ with two SCN⁻ would be Co(SCN)₂²+.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact colors, but the problem states that the dithiocyanato complexes are blue, so the question is about the percentage of Co(SCN)₂²+ in the solution.

So, the approach is to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are in the form Co(SCN)₂²+.

In a solution with Co²+ and SCN⁻ ions, the Co²+ will form complexes with varying numbers of SCN⁻ ligands. The distribution depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex, then sum them up and find the percentage for the desired complex.

But how do we model this with the given β values? Let me think about the possible complexes. The possible species are:

1. Co²+ (free ion)
2. Co(SCN)²+ (monomeric complex)
3. Co(SCN)₂²+ (dimeric complex)
4. Co(SCN)₃³- (trimeric complex)
5. Co(SCN)₄³- (tetramer, but wait, Co²+ can't have four SCN⁻ and charge zero... Wait, maybe it's Co(SCN)₄²-? Because each SCN⁻ is -1, so four would contribute -4, and the Co²+ is +2, so overall charge would be -2. Hmm, but that's getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about each possible complex and their charges.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each complex as Co(SCN)_n^(2+ - n). Because each SCN⁻ is -1, so n SCN⁻ would contribute -n. The Co²+ is +2, so the overall charge is (2 - n). But wait, for n=1, it's +1? Because 2-1=1. But earlier I thought the complexes are [Co(SCN)]²+, which would be 2+ charge. Hmm, so perhaps I got the charges wrong.

Let me make sure: for n=1, Co²+ + SCN⁻ → [CoSCN]^(+). Because Co²+ (charge +2) + SCN⁻ (charge -1) → the complex has charge +1. But wait, I'm getting conflicting info. Wait, no, let's think: the complex [Co(SCN)]²+ would imply that the overall charge is +2. So Co²+ (charge +2) plus one SCN⁻ (charge -1) gives a complex with charge +1? That can't be, because 2 + (-1)= +1, so the complex would be [Co(SCN)]^+.

Wait, that doesn't add up. Because the formula would be Co²+ plus SCN⁻ → [CoSCN]^(+1). So the complex charge is +1. But I thought β1 is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)]²+? Maybe I've been misinformed. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^(2+ -n) in charge. So for n=1, charge is +1, n=2 → 0 charge, n=3 → -1, n=4 → -2.

But that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^m, and
