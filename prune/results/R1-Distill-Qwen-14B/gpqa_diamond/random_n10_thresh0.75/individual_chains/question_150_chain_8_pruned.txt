Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

Okay, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let me see, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Hmm, maybe something with a phenyl group and an amine or something similar. The NMR data might help figure this out.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a pretty high ppm, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the molecule.
- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This could be aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted because two protons are equivalent.
- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. Maybe adjacent to the substituent?
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an enol proton or something with an OH group. Or maybe conjugated double bonds.
- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This seems like it could be a CH2 group next to something electronegative, like an oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or adjacent to a carbonyl.

Putting this together. The aldehyde at 9.72, so maybe a butanal or something similar. The aromatic protons could be from two phenyl groups attached somewhere. The 3.66 ppm for two H suggests maybe a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen. So perhaps the structure has a phenyl group, a CH2O group, and an aldehyde.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X is 0 (no halogens), N is 1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. That's five degrees. Could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring or double bond again. So maybe a benzene ring, an aldehyde (a double bond), and a conjugated double bond or another ring.

Wait, maybe it's a diphenyl compound. Let me think about the options given. The options are all but-enals or but-anals with diphenyl groups.

Looking at the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 is one H, which is the aldehyde. Then, the two doublets around 6.98 and 6.51. If there are two phenyl rings, each with two H as doublets, that would make sense if they're para-substituted. So each phenyl group has substituents in the para positions, leading to two doublets each integrating to 2H. So maybe each phenyl has a substituent in the para position.

The 6.27 ppm with 2H as a broad singlet. Hmm, could that be an enol form or maybe an adjacent CH2 group? Or perhaps a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether or something else. Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a CH2 which is a doublet. So maybe it's OCH2, like in a glycol structure or adjacent to a carbonyl group.

So, putting it together, perhaps the structure is something like 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Let me draw that. So the aldehyde is at position 1, a double bond between C2 and C3, and phenyl groups at positions 2 and 4.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A) 2
