Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. The question gives me a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are various points in a 3D space, like vectors (r).

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices for single qubits can be represented as 2x2 matrices. So let's write that out.

|0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and 0 elsewhere, same for |1><1| but 1 in (2,2). So adding them gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Then I multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal entry becomes 1/2. So ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

But wait, how does this translate into a vector in the qubit space? I think qubit states are often represented as vectors in a Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states. Each qubit state can be written as a vector on the surface of a unit sphere in 3D space.

For a pure state |ψ⟩, it's on the surface because it's normalized. But ρ here is a mixed state because it's a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability. The density matrix for a mixed state is a convex combination of projectors. So ρ is a mixed state with equal probability in |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Wait, how do you find the corresponding point in the Bloch sphere for a mixed state? Oh right, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector (x, y, z) where the components are related to the density matrix elements.

The general form of a single qubit density matrix is [[(1 + z)/2, (x - iy)/2], [(x + iy)/2, (1 - z)/2]]. So the parameters x, y, z define the Bloch vector.

Let me write down this general form and compare it to the given ρ. Our ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So setting these equal:
