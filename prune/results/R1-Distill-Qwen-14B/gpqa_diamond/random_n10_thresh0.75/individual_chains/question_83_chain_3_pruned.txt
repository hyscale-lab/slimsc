Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. What will be the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay, so first, I need to find the pH at two different points during the titration: 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, let me break down the problem. So, initially, we have some acetic acid solution. Then we dilute it by adding water. Then we titrate it with NaOH. So the first thing is to find out the concentration of acetic acid after dilution, right?

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when we titrate, we'll be neutralizing the acid with the base.

Let me think about the initial dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution can be calculated using M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 *20)/40 = (1)/40 = 0.0125 M? Let's calculate that: 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025? Wait wait, 20 divided by 40 is 0.5, so 0.05 * 0.5 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's correct.

So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. So the equivalence point calculation would depend on the moles of acetic acid and the mo
