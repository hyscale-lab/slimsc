Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. The classic example is a mass on a spring.

In this case, the setup is relativistic, which means we have to consider effects from Einstein's theory of relativity. Oh right, so as speeds approach the speed of light c, the relativistic effects become significant. The problem gives the maximum amplitude A and asks for the maximum speed v_max.

Let me read the question again. The force is F = -kx, which is Hooke's law. So it's a harmonic oscillator scenario. The question is about finding the maximum speed in the relativistic case.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but that's non-relativistic. But since the question is relativistic, we can't use that formula directly.

So in the relativistic case, energy considerations change because of the total energy including rest mass energy. The total energy E in relativity is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, the total energy in the oscillator's case would be the sum of the rest energy and the oscillating energy.

Wait, but for a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the expression for kinetic energy is different. Oh right, the kinetic energy (K) is (gamma - 1)mc². And the potential energy (U) for the spring is (1/2)kx² as before, but since it's relativistic, maybe we have to be careful about how x relates to other variables.

Hmm, but wait, the system is 1-dimensional, so x is just the displacement. The maximum potential energy occurs at x = A, so U_max is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, when the mass is at maximum displacement,
