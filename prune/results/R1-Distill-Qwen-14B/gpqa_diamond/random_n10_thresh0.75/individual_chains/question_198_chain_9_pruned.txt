Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) are given for the complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. And the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, the blue dithiocyanato complex is probably [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ or something like that. Let me recall: the different Co(SCN)_n species have different colors. The blue one is likely [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or maybe [Co(SCN)_3]^3-? I think for Co(II), the common complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.

So the stability constants are for each step. Stability constants are for the formation of the complex from the previous one. Like β1 is the constant for the first complex formation: Co²+ + SCN- ↔ CoSCN+ , with β1=9. Then β2 is the constant for adding another SCN- to form Co(SCN)₂^2+; β2=40. Similarly, β3 would be for Co(SCN)₃^3- with β3=63, and β4 is perhaps for a four-membered complex, but wait, normally Co(II) can form up to a certain number of ligands. Wait, wait, cobalt can form complexes with different numbers of SCN-. I think for Co(II), the common ones are [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} where n is from 1 to 3 or 4?

But the question is about the dithiocyanato complex. So that would be n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

We need to find the percentage of this species, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, among all the Co species present.

To find this, I think we can model the speciation of Co in the solution. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all the species: [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^3- + [Co(SCN)_4]^4- (if that exists). But wait, the problem only gives β1 to β4. So maybe for each step, the stability constant is the cumulative product?

Wait, no. Stability constants can be given as stepwise or cumulative. In this problem, it's likely that the β values are the cumulative stability constants. Let me think: for a general complex, the formation can be stepwise. So the first step is Co²+ + SCN- → CoSCN+ with K1=β1=9. The second step is CoSCN+ + SCN- → Co(SCN)₂^2+ with K2=β2=40. The third step is Co(SCN)₂^2+ + SCN- → Co(SCN)3^3- with K3=β3=63
