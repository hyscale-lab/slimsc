Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1 + i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So the first thing I need to do is probably normalize this state because it's given as proportional, not exactly equal. So I should find the normalization constant.

Wait, the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. To normalize it, I need to compute the inner product <alpha|alpha> and then divide by its square root. 

The inner product would be (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i), because when you take the conjugate transpose, the coefficients become (1-i) for |up> and (2+i) for |down>. Wait, wait, maybe I should calculate it properly.

So |alpha> is (a)|up> + (b)|down>, where a is 1+i and b is 2-i. The inner product <alpha|alpha> is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

Calculating |a|^2: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Similarly, |b|^2 is (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + (i)^2 (wait, no: 2*2 is 4, 2*i is 2i, -i*2 is -2i, and (-i)i is -i² which is 1). So (2 - i)(2 +i) = 4 + 2i -2i -i² = 4 + (2i-2i) + 1 = 5. So |b|^2 is 5.

So the total inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, but the question didn't specify that the state is already normalized. So when the question says it's proportional, that's correct.

Next part: The operator whose matrix representation is A, where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix (since it's in the spin up and down basis), the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because i and j run from 1 to 2. So diagonal elements are 0, off-diagonal are hbar/2.

So this operator is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (hbar/2) σ_x.

Wait, yes, because σ_x has 1s in the off-diagonal, so A is (hbar/2) σ_x. So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the |+x> and |-x> states. The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1, so for A, the eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), so ± hbar/2.

Wait, but the question is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator A. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x> which are the eigenstates of σ_x.

So the problem boils down to finding the probability that the state |alpha> is in |+x> and |-x>, then computing the average value of operator A.

Hmm, so first, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>. Alternatively, since |+x> and |-x> can be written in terms of |up> and |down>, and vice versa, maybe I can compute the inner products.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to σ_x, perhaps the expectation value can be found more easily.

Wait, but maybe I should find the probabilities first.

So, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x. Let me write down |+x> and |-x>.

The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, actually, I think it's the other way around. Because σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, and its eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but actually, I'm not sure about the order. Wait, when you apply σ_x to |+x>, you get +1*(|+x>), so σ_x |+x> = |+x>. Let me confirm: 

σ_x |up> = |down>, σ_x |down> = |up>.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is better. Let me express |alpha> in the basis of |+x> and |-x>.

So, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

Expressing |alpha> as a combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- | -x>.

So I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of the eigenstates of A. Then the coefficients c_+ and c_- are the inner products of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x>, respectively.

So c_+ = < +x | alpha >.

Similarly, c_- = < -x | alpha >.

Let's compute c_+ first. 

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < +x | alpha > is [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] times [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, because |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the inner product is [ (1/sqrt(2)) (1, 1) ] . [ (1+i, 2 -i) ] / sqrt(7).

Dot product is (1)(1+i) + (1)(2 -i) = 1 + i + 2 -i = 3.

So < +x | alpha > = (3) / [ sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ) ].

Similarly, |c_+|^2 is (9) / (2 *7) ) = 9/(14).

So probability of +x is 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64.

Similarly, c_- is < -x | alpha >. 

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < -x | alpha > is [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) ] times [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Which is [ (1)(1+i) - (1)(2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ).

Calculating the numerator: 1+i -2 +i = (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i = (-1 +2i).

So |c_-|^2 is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / (2 *7) ) = (1 +4)/(14) )= 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, for c_+:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (1 + 1) terms.

Wait, no, let's re-calculate:

(1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) multiplied by [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7).

That's (1+i + 2 -i ) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)).

Which is 3 / (sqrt(14)).

So |c_+|^2 is (3^2) / (14) )=9/14.

Similarly, for c_-:

(1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) multiplied by [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So (1)(1+i) - (1)(2 -i) = (1+i) -2 +i = (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i.

So the magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = 1 +4=5. So |c_-|^2 is 5/(2 * 7) )=5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but looking at the options, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36. That's 9/14≈0.642857, which is about 0.64, and 5/14≈0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded. So option A has 0.64 and 0.36, so the first two probabilities match.

Now, the average value of the operator A. Since A is an observable, the expectation value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha> .

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, because σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1.

So <A> = (hbar/2) <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

But sigma_x is the operator that flips the spin. So <sigma_x> is the expectation value.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is given in the z basis, perhaps it's easier to compute <sigma_x> via the formula.

The expectation value of sigma_x for a state |psi> is given by:

<sigma_x> = ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) / ( |a|^2 + |b|^2 ) + 2 Re( a b* ) / ( |a|^2 + |b|^2 )

Wait, perhaps another way. For a two-level state |psi> = c1 |up> + c2 |down>, the expectation value of sigma_x is (c1 c2^* + c1^* c2 ) / (|c1|^2 + |c2|^2) * 2.

Wait, because sigma_x has matrix [[0 1],[1 0]], so <sigma_x> = [ [c1*, c2* ] [0 1; 1 0] [c1; c2] ] / (|c1|^2 + |c2|^2) ) 

Which is (c1 c2^* + c2 c1^* ) / (|c1|^2 + |c2|^2 )

Which is 2 Re(c1 c2^*) / (|c1|^2 + |c2|^2 )

So in our case, c1 = (1+i)/sqrt(7), c2 = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So c1 c2^* = (1+i)(2 +i) /7.

Multiply this out: 1*2=2, 1*i=i, i*2=2i, i*i = i²= -1.

So numerator: 2 +i +2i -1 = (2-1) + (i + 2i) = 1 + 3i.

So Re(c1 c2^*) is 1.

So <sigma_x> = 2 * 1 /7 = 2/7.

So the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Putting it all together, the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.64) and 5/14 (≈0.357), and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So that matches.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Yes, so that's correct. So the answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization is determined by computing the inner product \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle \), which gives \( |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7 \). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Next, we analyze the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix scaled by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \), i.e., \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with these states. The probability of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) is:

\[
P(+x) = |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

Similarly, the probability of measuring \( |-x\rangle \) is:

\[
P(-x) = |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of the operator \( A \) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the formula for \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) in terms of the coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \), we find:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2 \, \text{Re}(c_1 c_2^*)}{|c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2},
\]

where \( c_1 = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( c_2 = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Calculating \( c_1 c_2^* = \frac{(1+i)(2+i)}{7} = \frac{1+3i}{7} \), we find \( \text{Re}(c_1 c_2^*) = \frac{1}{7} \). Thus:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2}{7}, \quad \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Combining these results, the probabilities are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches option **A**.
