Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, it's about cobalt complexes and stability constants. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The problem states that we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I'm assuming is the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex, maybe that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ ion. So, I think the question is asking for the percentage of this particular species relative to all cobalt species.

First, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) are used to determine the concentrations of metal-ligand complexes in solution. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the highest β here is β3=63, which would be the most stable complex, maybe [Co(SCN)_3]^3−. Wait, but the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]²+—so that's the complex with two SCN- ligands attached. So that's the third species in the series, but wait, no. Wait, wait: the stability constants are for different orders. Let me list them:

For Co²+ with SCN-, the complexes are:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1=9
- [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} → β2=40? Or wait, wait, I might be getting this wrong. No, wait, the β's given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the order is β1 < β2 < β3, and then β4 is lower than β3.

Wait, maybe the complexes are:

n = number of SCN- ligands attached. So:

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1=9
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} → β2=40
n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3=63
n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → β4=16

Wait, but β4 is 16, which is less than β3. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So the most stable complex is n=3 (β3=63), and the next is n=2 (β2=40). Wait, but wait, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} has a lower β than [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

So the possible species are [Co]^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} complex, so that's the n=2 case, with β2=40.

Wait, but the problem gives the stability constants as β1, β2, etc., but I think I need to clarify which complex each β corresponds to. Because sometimes, the stability constants are given for the stepwise formation, not the overall. Wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc., but that's stepwise formation. Or maybe they are overall formation constants.

I think in this context, the β's are the overall stability constants for each complex. So, for each complex, βn is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands.

So, for [CoSCN]^+, β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, β2=40. That would be the formation constant for adding two ligands, but wait, that's unlikely because the stepwise constants would be different. Wait, maybe it's better to think about the stepwise formation. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify.

Alternatively, the stability constants are given as the overall formation constants for each complex. So for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+, the β is 9. The second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, would have a β of 40. The third, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, has β=63, and the fourth, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, has β=16.

Hmm, but that would mean that the third complex is the most stable, then the second, then the first, and the fourth is less stable than the third but more than the first. That seems a bit odd, but okay.

Wait, but in any case, the problem is asking about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, β2=40) among all cobalt species.

So I need to calculate the fraction of Co in each possible complex, then find what fraction is in the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex.

The general approach is to model the distribution of Co(II) among the various complexes and free Co²+ ions. The species present are:

Co²+ (free ion)
[CoSCN]^+ 
[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}
[Co(SCN)_3]^-
[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}

But wait, the problem states that the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. So the sum of all these species equals this concentration.

The idea is to calculate the fraction of Co in each species. The dominant species will depend on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

But wait, the ligand here is SCN⁻, which is present at 0.1 M. So, the concentration of SCN⁻ is high enough that the more stable complexes may form.

But the problem is that the solution has a lot of SCN⁻, so perhaps the Co²+ will form the more stable complexes.

But how do we model this?

I remember that when dealing with multiple complexes, the distribution can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the metal and ligand.

The general method is to set up expressions for each species' concentration and find the ratio of their concentrations based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal.

But for this, perhaps it's easier to use the concept of the formation of each complex step by step and calculate the fractional concentrations.

Alternatively, since the problem involves multiple complexes, perhaps the fractional composition can be determined by considering the effective formation constants.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formation of each complex relative to the free ion. For each complex, the concentration can be expressed in terms of β and the product of [Co²+] and [SCN-]^n, where n is the number of ligands.

So, for each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, the concentration is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = β_n * [Co²+] * [SCN-]^n

But wait, I think the correct expression is [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} = β_n * [Co²+] * [SCN-]^n.

Wait, but β is the formation constant, which is equal to [ML^n]/([M][L]^n), so the expression would be [ML^n] = β * [M][L]^n.

So, each complex's concentration is proportional to β multiplied by [Co²+] times [SCN-]^n.

So, for each n, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} is β_n * [Co²+] * [SCN-]^n.

But since the total Co is 1e-2 M, the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} plus [Co²+] equals 1e-2 M.

But since SCN- is present in high concentration (0.1 M), and the β's for higher n are higher, perhaps the majority of Co is tied up in the more stable complexes.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact approach here. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach is to express all the species in terms of [Co²+], and then set up an equation for the total.

Let me denote [Co²+] as x. Then, for each complex:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN-]^1 = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} = β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 x * 0.01 = 0.4 x.

Wait, but wait, β2 is 40, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. So [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4 x.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3}^- = β3 * x * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 x * 0.001 = 0.063 x.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = β4 * x * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * x * (0.1)^4 = 16 x * 0.0001 = 0.0016 x.

So, the total cobalt species is:

Total Co = [Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} + [Co(SCN)_3}^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}

Which equals:

x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) x

Let me sum these coefficients:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.

So, total Co = 2.3646 x.

But the total Co given is 1e-2 M, so 2.3646 x = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.223e-3 M.

Wait, but [Co²+] is x, so [Co²+] ≈ 4.223e-3 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

[CoSCN]^+ = 0.9 x ≈ 0.9 * 4.223e-3 ≈ 3.801e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} = 0.4 x ≈ 0.4 *4.223e-3 ≈ 1.689e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_3}^- = 0.063 x ≈ 0.063 *4.223e-3 ≈ 2.66e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = 0.0016 x ≈ 0.0016 *4.223e-3 ≈ 6.757e-6 M.

So, the concentration of the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} complex is 1.689e-3 M.

The total Co species sum to 1e-2 M as given.

Now, to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} among all cobalt species, we calculate ( [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} ) / (total Co) * 100.

Which is (1.689e-3) / (1e-2) ) *100 = (0.1689) *100 = 16.89%.

Wait, but that's 16.89%, which is close to option D) 16.9%.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, wait a second. Perhaps I made an error in setting up the expressions for the complexes. Because for each complex, the formation constant is given for the nth ligand addition, but wait, sometimes the formation constants are stepwise, meaning β1 is the constant for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc. If that's the case, then the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of the stepwise β's up to n.

Wait, this complicates things. Because if the given β's are stepwise, then the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} would be β1 * β2, not 40.

Wait, wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. I'm not sure whether these are the overall constants or the stepwise ones.

If they're stepwise, then the overall β for each complex is the product of β1 through βn.

So for [CoSCN]^+, β_total would be β1 =9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, β_total = β1 * β2 = 9 *40 = 360.

For [Co(SCN)_3}^-, β_total = 9*40*63 = 22680.

For [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, β_total = 9*40*63 *16 = but wait, that's if β4 is the fourth step.

Wait, but in that case, the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} would have a β of β1 * β2 * β3 * β4, which would be 9*40 *63 *16. Let me calculate that:

9 *40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16= 362,880.

Wait, but that's a very high value compared to the others. Hmm, but in the problem, β4 is given as 16, which is lower than β3. That would suggest that the fourth complex might not be that stable, but if it's stepwise, then adding the fourth ligand would require β4=16, which is lower than β3=63. Which is possible.

Wait, but that changes the entire approach. Because if the given β's are stepwise, then the overall β for each complex would be the product.

So, let me reevaluate the setup.

Assuming that each βn is the stepwise formation constant for adding the nth ligand.

So, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So for n=1: β=9.

n=2: β=9*40=360.

n=3: 9*40*63= 22680.

n=4: 9 *40 *63 *16 = 362880.

Wait, that's a huge β for n=4, but let's proceed.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the β4 is lower than β3. So, the stepwise addition for the fourth ligand is less favorable than the third. So, perhaps the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} would not form much, but the [Co(SCN)_3]^- would be the most stable.

But let's proceed.

So, given this, the concentration expressions would be:

[Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} = β1 * β2 * ... * βn * [Co²+] * [SCN-]^n.

So, for each n, the concentration is the product of the stepwise β's up to n multiplied by [Co²+] and [SCN-]^n.

So, let's compute each concentration:

n=0: [Co²+] = x.

n=1: [CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} = β1 * β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 = 9 *40 *x * (0.1)^2 = 360 * x * 0.01 = 3.6 x.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3}^- = β1 * β2 * β3 * x * [SCN-]^3 = 9*40*63 *x * (0.1)^3 = 22680 x * 0.001 = 22.68 x.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = β1*β2*β3*β4 *x * [SCN-]^4 = 9*40*63*16 x * (0.1)^4 = 362880 x * 0.0001 = 36.288 x.

Wait, but wait a second. Let's compute each term:

n=1: 9 *0.1 = 0.9 → 0.9 x.

n=2: 9*40=360 → 360 *0.01=3.6 → 3.6 x.

n=3: 360 *63=22680 → 22680 *0.001=22.68 →22.68 x.

n=4: 22680 *16=362880 →362880 *0.0001=36.288 → 36.288 x.

But wait, the sum of all these concentrations plus [Co²+] x must equal 1e-2 M.

So, total Co:

x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = (1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) x.

Sum the coefficients:

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So, 64.468 x = 1e-2 → x = 1e-2 /64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

So [Co²+] is 1.551e-4 M.

Now, each complex's concentration:

n=1: 0.9 x = 0.9 * 1.551e-4 ≈1.396e-4 M.

n=2:3.6 x ≈3.6 *1.551e-4 ≈5.584e-4 M.

n=3:22.68 x ≈22.68 *1.551e-4≈3.519e-3 M.

n=4:36.288 x≈36.288 *1.551e-4≈5.624e-3 M.

Now, the question is about [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which is n=2. Its concentration is 5.584e-4 M.

Wait, but wait, adding all these up:

1.551e-4 +1.396e-4 +5.584e-4 +3.519e-3 +5.624e-3.

Let me compute in order:

1.551e-4 = 0.0001551

1.396e-4 = 0.0001396 → sum so far: 0.0002947.

+5.584e-4 → 0.0008531.

+3.519e-3 → 0.0043621.

+5.624e-3 → 0.010 (approx 0.010).

So, yes, the sum is about 0.010 M, which matches the given total Co concentration.

Now, the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is (5.584e-4 / 1e-2) *100.

Which is (5.584e-4 / 0.01) ) *100 →5.584e-2 *100 →5.584%.

Wait, that's 5.584% which is 5.58%, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%.

Hmm, so that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the given β's are the overall stability constants, not stepwise. So, going back to the first approach.

In the first approach, the overall β's are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, each βn is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}.

So, [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} = βn * [Co²+] * [SCN-]^n.

So, for n=1: 9 *x *0.1 = 0.9 x.

n=2:40 *x * 0.01 = 0.4 x.

n=3:63 *x * 0.001 = 0.063 x.

n=4:16 *x * 0.0001 = 0.0016 x.

Summing these:

x (free) +0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x = (1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016)x = 2.3646 x.

Set to 1e-2 M: 2.3646 x = 1e-2 → x=1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.223e-3 M.

So, [Co²+] is 4.223e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} (n=2) is 0.4 x ≈0.4 *4.223e-3 =1.689e-3 M.

Now, the percentage is (1.689e-3 / 1e-2 ) *100 = 16.89%, which is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the question specifically asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}. So in that case, the percentage is about 16.9%, which matches option D.

Wait, but in the initial approach, I thought the given β's are the overall constants, but when I assumed they were stepwise, I got a different answer. So, which is correct?

I think the key is to correctly interpret the β's. The problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. In the context of such problems, unless stated otherwise, the β's are the overall stability constants for each complex. So, each βn is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands, not the stepwise addition.

So, in this case, the correct approach is the first one, leading to 16.9% as the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex.

Wait, but in the first approach, the sum of all the species is 2.3646 x, which equals 1e-2. So, x is about 4.223e-3.

Therefore, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is 0.4 *4.223e-3 ≈1.689e-3 M.

So, 1.689e-3 / 1e-2 = 0.1689 → 16.89%, which is option D:16.9%.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought higher βs would lead to more of the corresponding complex. In this case, β3 is the highest, so [Co(SCN)_3]^- would have the highest concentration.

In this first approach, let's compute the concentrations of all species:

[Co²+] =4.223e-3.

[CoSCN]^+ =0.9 x=0.9 *4.223e-3=3.801e-3.

[Co(SCN)_2]=0.4 x=1.689e-3.

[Co(SCN)_3]=0.063 x=2.66e-4.

[Co(SCN)_4]=0.0016 x=6.757e-6.

So, adding these up:

4.223e-3 (0.004223)

3.801e-3 (0.003801)

1.689e-3 (0.001689)

0.000266 (≈2.66e-4)

0.000006757 (≈6.757e-6)

Adding these: 0.004223 +0.003801=0.008024; +0.001689=0.009713; +0.000266=0.009979; +0.000006757=0.009985757 M.

Which is close to 1e-2 M (0.01 M), so the math checks out.

Now, the [Co(SCN)_3]^- concentration is 0.000266 M, which is about 0.0266%? No, wait, wait. Let me compute the percentage of each:

[Co²+] →4.223e-3 /1e-2 =42.23% →42.23%.

[CoSCN]^+ →3.801e-3/0.01 →38.01%.

[Co(SCN)_2]→1.689e-3 →16.89%.

[Co(SCN)_3]→2.66e-4 →0.266%.

[Co(SCN)_4]→6.757e-6 →0.006757%.

So, the largest fraction is [Co²+] at ~42%, then [CoSCN]^+ at ~38%, then [Co(SCN)_2] at ~16.89%, and the rest are negligible.

So, the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is about 16.89%, which is option D.

Wait a minute, but the problem says 'blue dithiocyanato', which I thought was [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, but according to the percentages, that's 16.89%, which is option D.

But looking at the options, option C is 38.1% and option A is 42.3%.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the concentrations. Let me recheck.

Wait, the [Co(SCN)_3}^- complex has a β of 63, which is higher than β2=40. So, why is [Co(SCN)_3}^- only 0.266%? That seems counterintuitive because higher β should mean more of that species.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the expressions.

Wait, in the first approach, I used [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co²+] * [SCN-]^n.

But perhaps the correct expression is βn = [Co(SCN)_n]/( [Co²+][SCN-]^n ), so [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co²+] * [SCN-]^n.

So that part is correct.

But in the case of n=3, [SCN-]^3 is (0.1)^3=1e-4=0.0001.

So, [Co(SCN)_3}^- =63 *x * 1e-4.

Wait, x is 4.223e-3.

So, 63 *4.223e-3 *1e-4 =63 *4.223e-7 → let me compute that.

63 *4.223e-7 = (63 *4.223) * 1e-7.

63 *4=252; 63 *0.223≈14.029 → total≈266.029 → 266.029e-7 =2.66029e-5 M.

Wait, that's 2.66e-5 M, not 2.66e-4 as I previously calculated. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let me recompute the concentrations.

Wait, the earlier mistake: for [Co(SCN)_3}^-, it's 63 *x * (0.1)^3.

(0.1)^3 is 0.001, which is 1e-3, not 1e-4. So, 63 *x *1e-3.

Ah, I see where I went wrong! I think I made an error in calculating 0.1^3.

So, let me correct all the calculations.

Recalculating all:

x = [Co²+] =4.223e-3 M.

n=1: [CoSCN]^+ = β1 *x * [SCN-] =9 *4.223e-3 *0.1 =9 *0.0004223 =0.003801 M.

n=2: β2 *x * [SCN-]^2 =40 *4.223e-3 * (0.1)^2 =40 *4.223e-3 *0.01 =40 *4.223e-5 =1.689e-3 M.

n=3: β3 *x * [SCN-]^3 =63 *4.223e-3 * (0.1)^3 =63 *4.223e-3 *0.001 =63 *4.223e-6 =2.66e-4 M.

n=4: β4 *x * [SCN-]^4 =16 *4.223e-3 * (0.1)^4 =16 *4.223e-3 *0.0001 =16 *4.223e-7 =6.757e-6 M.

So, the concentrations are:

[Co²+]=4.223e-3 → 0.004223 M.

[CoSCN]^+ =0.003801 M.

[Co(SCN)_2] =0.001689 M.

[Co(SCN)_3} =2.66e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_4] =6.757e-6 M.

Now, sum all these:

0.004223 +0.003801 =0.008024.

+0.001689 →0.009713.

+0.000266 →0.009979.

+0.000006757 →0.009985757 M.

Which is approximately 0.01 M, which matches the total.

So, now, the fractions are:

[Co²+] →4.223e-3 /0.01 =42.23%.

[CoSCN]^+ →0.003801/0.01=38.01%.

[Co(SCN)_2] →0.001689/0.01=16.89%.

[Co(SCN)_3} →0.000266/0.01=0.266%.

[Co(SCN)_4] →0.000006757/0.01=0.06757%.

So, the [Co(SCN)_3}^- has a concentration of 0.266%, which is much lower than I expected because β3 is higher than β2. Hmm, why is that?

Because while β3 is higher, the [SCN-]^3 term is (0.1)^3=1e-4, which is much lower than (0.1)^2=1e-3 for n=2. So, the higher β may not compensate for the lower [SCN-]^3 term.

So, the dominant species are the free Co²+ and [CoSCN]^+.

Wait, but the [CoSCN]^+ has a β of 9, and [Co(SCN)_2] has a β of 40. Wait, but [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.001689, which is about 16.89% of total, and [CoSCN]^+ is 38.01%, and [Co²+] is 42.23%.

So, the [CoSCN]^+ is more concentrated than [Co(SCN)_2], which is perhaps expected because while β2 is higher, [SCN-]^2 is lower than [SCN-]^1. So, the product β * [SCN-]^n may be lower for higher n.

So, given that, the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.89%, which is option D:16.9%.

But looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, so that's the answer.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β) and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN⁻.

### Key Information:
- **Total cobalt concentration**: \( [\text{Co}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- **Thiocyanate concentration**: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- **Stability constants**:  
  \[
  \beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = 40, \, \beta_3 = 63, \, \beta_4 = 16
  \]
  These constants correspond to the overall stability constants for the complexes:
  - \([Co(SCN)]^+\), \([Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}\), \([Co(SCN)_3]^-\), and \([Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}\), respectively.

### Approach:
The concentration of each cobalt species is proportional to the product of the stability constant (\(\beta_n\)), the free cobalt ion concentration (\([Co^{2+}]\)), and the ligand concentration raised to the power of the number of ligands (\([SCN^-]^n\)):

\[
[Co(SCN)_n] = \beta_n \cdot [Co^{2+}] \cdot [SCN^-]^n
\]

Let the free cobalt ion concentration be \(x = [Co^{2+}]\). The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:

\[
[\text{Co}] = x + \beta_1 x [SCN^-] + \beta_2 x [SCN^-]^2 + \beta_3 x [SCN^-]^3 + \beta_4 x [SCN^-]^4
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \( \beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = 40, \, \beta_3 = 63, \, \beta_4 = 16 \)
- \( [SCN^-] = 0.1 \)

The concentrations of the species are:
1. Free cobalt: \( [Co^{2+}] = x \)
2. \([CoSCN]^+\): \( 9x \cdot 0.1 = 0.9x \)
3. \([Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}\): \( 40x \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4x \)
4. \([Co(SCN)_3]^-\): \( 63x \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063x \)
5. \([Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}\): \( 16x \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016x \)

The total cobalt concentration is:
\[
[\text{Co}] = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = 2.3646x
\]

Given \( [\text{Co}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), solve for \(x\):
\[
2.3646x = 10^{-2} \implies x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.223 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

Now, calculate the concentration of each species:
1. \([Co^{2+}] = x \approx 4.223 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\)
2. \([CoSCN]^+ = 0.9x \approx 3.801 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\)
3. \([Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} = 0.4x \approx 1.689 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\)
4. \([Co(SCN)_3]^-\ = 0.063x \approx 2.66 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}\)
5. \([Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = 0.0016x \approx 6.757 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}\)

### Percentage of \([Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}\):
The percentage of \([Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}\) is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}}{[\text{Co}]} \times 100 = \frac{1.689 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}} \times 100 \approx 16.89\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, \([Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}\), among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**.
