Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. The spectrographs mentioned are ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory and HIRES at Keck Observatory. I need to figure out which of the given stars are visible to both.

First, let's understand the constraints. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17? Wait, wait. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than 17 mag, that means it's magnitude is less than 17. Because the scale is invertedâ€”like, the lower the number, the brighter the object. So, when it says "brighter than 17 mag," that's apparent magnitude < 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent magnitude <16.

So the key here is the apparent V magnitude of each star. Because both instruments must be able to detect the star. So the star's apparent V mag must be less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, because the star has to be detectable by both. So the star must satisfy both conditions. That means the apparent V magnitude must be less than 16. Because if it's less than 16, it's automatically less than 17. So the star's apparent V must be less than 16 mag for both to be able to see it.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So it can see stars with apparent mag up to 17. HIRES can see up to 16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent magnitude must be brighter than both 16 and 17. Wait, no, because if a star is brighter than 16, it's also brighter than 17. So the stricter limit is 16. So the star's apparent V must be <16 mag. Because that's the more restrictive condition.

Wait, no. Let me make sure. The question says: with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So stars with V less than or equal to 17 can be observed
