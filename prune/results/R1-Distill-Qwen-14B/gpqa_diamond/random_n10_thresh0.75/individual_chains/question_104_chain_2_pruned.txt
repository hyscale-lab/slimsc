Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum to detect planets. When a planet orbits a star, the star wobbles, causing the spectral lines to shift as the star moves toward or away from us.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key data is the periodic shifts in the spectral lines: Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The stars are like our Sun in mass.

Wait, so the RV shift depends on the mass of the planet and its orbital period. I think the formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is something like K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) )^(1/ something?) No, wait, maybe I should recall the precise formula.

Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) * (1 / (P * (1 year in seconds) )) )^(1/3) )

Wait, that's getting a bit confusing. Another approach: since both stars have the same mass (same as Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), which is much less than the star's mass. So M_p << M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

The formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is approximately:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) * (1 AU)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the more simplified version. Alternatively, another formula I remember is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (c^3 * P) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star) ) )

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the RV shifts and the orbital periods. Since both stars are similar and the planets have similar masses, the main factors affecting K would be the orbital period and other parameters.

Wait, another thought: the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is related to the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination. But since both planets have similar masses and presumably similar inclinations (since they were detected, and perhaps we can assume sin i is about the same), then K should be inversely related to the cube root of the orbital period. Because K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but
