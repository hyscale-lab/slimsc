Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction, and I'm a bit shaky on some of the details, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's break it down.

The question presents three separate reactions, labeled A, B, and C, and then gives four possible options for the products. I need to figure out the correct products for each and then match them to the options provided.

First, I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction A:

The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with a base (NaOEt, EtOH) as the catalyst. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, typically by an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because enolates are strong nucleophiles. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When it reacts in a Michael addition, it would act as the nucleophile (the enolate) attacking the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure here is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the substituent on the third carbon being p-tolyl. Wait, no, actually, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the correct structure would be CH2CH(C6H4-tolyl)COOCH3, but wait, E-configuration would mean the substituents are opposite each other. Wait, no. Let me think: Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- something. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a substituent on the beta carbon (the CH2 group might have the p-tolyl group). Hmm, perhaps it's CH2-CH(C6H4-tolyl)-COOCH3, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? No, the numbering might be different. Let me get this right. The acrylate has the structure CH2=C(R)COOCH3. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the R group is on the second carbon (since the carbonyl is at position 1, the next is 2). So R is p-tolyl. So the structure is CH2=CH(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Wait, no, the position is 3. Hmm, maybe the structure is (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-COOCH3? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The formula for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, that's butenyl
