Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about an isolated system of particles with charges and their potential energy. Hmm, potential energy in electric fields, right?

So, the setup: there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, so 2e would be twice that, so like 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs, right? And their masses are negligible, so maybe I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just potential energy.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the setup is like, the 13th is at the center, and the other twelve are each 2 meters away from it, forming some kind of... maybe a sphere or something around it. But since the problem doesn't specify their arrangement beyond their distance from P, I might not need to worry about the exact geometry beyond each being 2 meters away.

The question is about the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, the minimum energy—so I think this refers to the potential energy of the system. Because in electrostatics, the potential energy is the work done to bring the charges together, and the minimum would be the most stable configuration, which I guess is when the charges are as close as possible. But wait, but in this case, the twelve charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P, so their positions are fixed relative to the central charge.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the other 12 charges are each 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 is 2 meters from the central charge, which is 2e as well.

So the system's potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, how many pairs are there?

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is calculated as the work done to bring each charge to its position. Since the central charge is fixed, bringing each of the 12 charges into place would involve calculating the work done against the electric field of the central charge, and also the work done against the electric fields of the other charges as they are added.

Wait, but wait: the problem says the system is
