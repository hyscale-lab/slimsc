Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is about. 

Alright, the problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar in radius to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is only spotty on one hemisphere, when it rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that look like an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is asking, if there were no spots, what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do?

Hmm, so the key here is to compare the brightness dip caused by the spots to the dip caused by a planet. I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. But wait, in this case, it's the spots that are causing the dip, not a planet. So I need to figure out the equivalent effect of the spots on the star's brightness.

The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears dimmer. The maximum dimming would occur when the entire spotted hemisphere is in view. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. Wait, actually, filling factor is the fraction of the surface area covered by spots. So if the filling factor is 20%, then spots cover 0.2 of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, the hemisphere itself is half the star's surface, right? Because a hemisphere is half the sphere. So the area of the hemisphere is (4π R^2)/2 = 2π R^2. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

Each spot is cooler, at 6000 K minus 1000 K, so 5000 K. The brightness from a star is determined by its area and temperature. The flux from each spot would be lower than the surrounding.

The star's total flux without spots is L = 4π R^2 σ Teff^4. But when spots are present, the flux from the spots is lower. The total flux observed would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted area and the spotted area.

So the unspotted area is the hemisphere minus the spots. The area of the unspotted part is 2π R^2 * (1 - 0.2) = 1.6 π R^2. The flux from this area is 1.6 π R^2 σ (6000)^4.

The spotted area is 0.4 π R^2, and their flux is 0.4 π R^2 σ (5000)^4.

So the total flux when the spots are fully visible (if the whole hemisphere is facing us) would be F_total = 1.6 π R^2 σ (6000^4) + 0.4 π R^2 σ (5000^4).

Without any spots, the flux would be F_normal = 2π R^2 σ (6000^4). Because the entire hemisphere is at 6000 K.

So the difference in flux when the star is spotted is ΔF = F_normal - F_total.

Let me compute that. Let's compute F_normal and F_total.

F_normal = 2 π R^2 σ (6000)^4.

F_total = [1.6 (6000)^4 + 0.4 (5000)^4] π R^2 σ.

So ΔF = (2 - [1.6 (6000^4) + 0.4 (5000^4)]) * π R^2 σ.

Wait, no. Wait, F_normal is 2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4, which is when the entire hemisphere is at Teff. F_total is when 80% is Teff and 20% is cooler.

So the difference is F_normal - F_total = [ (2 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4) ] - [ (1.6 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma 5000^4) ) ]

= pi R^2 sigma ( 2 *6000^4 - 1.6 *6000^4 - 0.4*5000^4 )

= pi R^2 sigma [ (0.4 *6000^4) - 0.4*5000^4 ]

= 0.4 pi R^2 sigma [6000^4 -5000^4 ]

So ΔF = 0.4 pi R^2 σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Now, the relative change in flux is ΔF / F_normal.

ΔF / F_normal = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / (2 *6000^4 )

Simplify that:

= [0.4 (6^4 -5^4) (1000^4) ] / [2 *6^4 (1000^4) ]

Wait, the 1000^4 cancels out.

So,

= [0.4 (6^4 -5^4) ] / [2 *6^4 ]

Compute 6^4: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296.

5^4: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625.

So 6^4 -5^4 = 1296 -625 = 671.

So,

= [0.4 * 671 ] / (2 * 1296 )

Compute numerator: 0.4 *671= 268.4

Denominator: 2 *1296=2592.

So 268.4 / 2592 ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35% relative change.

Wait, but wait, that's the relative change when the spots are fully visible. But when the star is rotating, the spots would go from being fully visible (when the hemisphere is facing us) to not visible (when the other hemisphere is facing us). So the maximum dip in brightness when the star is spotted is the difference between normal and F_total. So the maximum ΔF is as we calculated, about 0.1035 F_normal.

Wait, but wait, the dip would be (F_normal - F_total)/F_normal = 0.1035, or about 10.35% drop in brightness.

Wait, no. Because when the spots are visible (the hemisphere is facing us), the flux is F_total, which is lower than F_normal. So the dip is F_normal - F_total = delta F. So the relative dip is delta F / F_normal = 0.1035, about 10.35% of the normal flux.

So the observed brightness variation would have an amplitude of about 10.35% when the star is spotted.

Now, the question states that this situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So if we were to have a planet transiting this star, what radius would it need to produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

The transit method causes a dip in brightness equal to (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is (pi Rp^2) and the area of the star is pi Rstar^2. So the fraction is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2).

So the amplitude A (as a fraction of the star's flux) is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

We need this to be equal to the observed dip from the spots, which is approximately 0.1035.

Wait, wait no. Wait, the dip from the planet would be (Rp/Rstar)^2. The dip from the spots is 0.1035. So we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

So Rp = Rstar * sqrt(0.1035).

Compute sqrt(0.1035). Let me think: 0.3^2 is 0.09, 0.32^2 is 0.1024, 0.32^2 is 0.1024. Hmm, 0.32^2 is 0.1024 which is very close to 0.1035. So sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.321. So Rp ≈ 0.321 Rstar.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which would correspond to this.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I compute the dip correctly? Because the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2. But when the spots are in view, the flux from those spots is lower. So the total flux is 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4 without spots, but when spots are present, it's 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4 * (1 - 0.2*(T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)) ?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula for the flux when part of the surface is at a different temperature. The total flux is the sum of the flux from the normal areas and the spotted areas.

So the unspotted area is 80% of the hemisphere, which is 0.8 * 2 pi R^2 = 1.6 pi R^2. The flux from this area is 1.6 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4.

The spotted area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2. Flux from this is 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (5000)^4.

So total flux is F = 1.6 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4) + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (5000^4).

Without spots, the flux when the hemisphere is facing us would be 2 pi
