Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says we've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. So the key here is understanding the stability constants and which complex is the dithiocyanato one. I remember that the stability constant (β) indicates the stability of a complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is.

Wait, dithiocyanato—so that's [Co(SCN)2]²- maybe? Or could it be another form? Oh wait, dithiocyanato would have two SCN- ligands. So let's think about the possible complexes.

The complexes would be:

Co²+ + n SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n+2) ?

Wait, no, the charge on the complex would be (charge of Co) plus (charge from each SCN⁻ times number of them). Co²+ is +2. Each SCN⁻ is -1. So, for example, [Co(SCN)]^+ has 1 SCN, so charge is 2-1=+1. [Co(SCN)₂]^0 would be 2-2=0. [Co(SCN)₃]^- would be 2-3=-1. [Co(SCN)₄]^2- is 2-4=-2.

But wait, the number of ligands for Co(II) is typically 6. Wait, no—because SCN is a monodentate ligand, right? So each SCN⁻ provides one binding site. So the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)₃]^- , etc. But wait, the given β values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So that must correspond to n=1,2,3,4.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The stability constants are for each step of complexation. Oh, right, the β values are for each successive addition. So β1 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)₂]^0 from [Co(SCN)]^+ plus another SCN⁻, and so on.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands is the product of the successive β's. Like, K1 = β1, K2 = β1*β2, K3=β1*β2*β3, etc. So each β represents the stepwise formation constant.

So, for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n+2) ??? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number
