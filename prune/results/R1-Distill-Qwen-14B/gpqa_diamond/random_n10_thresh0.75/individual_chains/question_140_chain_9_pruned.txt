Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, but it's a bit tricky. Let me read through it carefully and think about each part step by step.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. When they react, a gas W is released, and a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which I think is just a bit above the melting point of water (which is 273 K). So maybe B is a substance that's solid at that temp, like something with a slightly higher melting point than water.

The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Hmm, so the molecule must have a neutron count equal to the proton count. That typically points towards a noble gas because their atoms are stable with complete electron shells. Let me think about the noble gases and their atomic numbers.

Noble gases have atomic numbers where the number of electrons (which equals protons for neutral atoms) is 2, 10, 18, etc. Wait, but the gas W molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for a noble gas, the number of neutrons would be the atomic number (same as protons) plus the number of neutrons minus protons for each isotope. Wait, no, because each atom of the gas has a certain number of protons and neutrons. So, if each molecule is a single atom of the gas, then for each atom, the number of neutrons equals the number of protons.

So, for an atom, number of neutrons (N) = number of protons (P). So, P = N. But for an element, the number of protons is the atomic number (Z), and the number of neutrons is (N) = mass number (A) - Z. So setting N = Z, we get:

A = Z + N = Z + Z = 2Z.

So the mass number must be twice the atomic number. Let's look at the noble gases and their atomic numbers:

- Helium (He): Z=2. A would be 4. But He's common isotope is He-4, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Yes! Because 2 neutrons and 2 protons. So He atom would fit here.

- Neon (Ne): Z=10. A would be 20. So Ne-20 would have 10 protons, 10 neutrons. That's possible, but Neon-20 is a stable isotope, but the most common is Ne-20 (about 90% abundance). So that's another possibility.

- Argon (Ar): Z=18. A would be 36. Ar-36 exists, but Ar-40 is more common. But Ar-36 has 18 protons and 18 neutrons, so it would fit. So possible.

But in terms of common reactions, which noble gas is likely to be released? Let's think about the reaction between X and Y. I need more info about what X and Y are.

The product G is a precipitate, so it's an insoluble solid. When heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Let's think about substances that melt around that temperature. Water melts at 273 K, so B could be something similar. Maybe ice? But that's not a substance, just solid water. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like NaOH, but NaOH is a solid with a higher melting point. Wait, perhaps B is something like boron? No, boron's melting point is higher. Alternatively, maybe B is something else entirely.

Wait, maybe B is a compound. Let's think about heating a precipitate. For example, if X is a base and Y is an acid, they might react to form a precipitate. Then heating the precipitate could decompose it into something else. Let's think about a common reaction: perhaps a carbonate reacting with acid to form CO2 gas. But in that case, the precipitate would be a salt.

Alternatively, maybe it's a double displacement reaction. Let's suppose X is a metal carbonate, Y is an acid. When they react, they produce CO2 gas, a salt, and water. Then the precipitate would be the salt, which upon heating might decompose. Wait, but what's the product after heating? For example, if the precipitate is a hydroxide, like Mg(OH)2, which when heated might decompose into MgO and water.

Alternatively, another scenario: maybe Y is a base, and X reacts with it to form a salt and water. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let's go back to Substance X. The question says it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has at least two isotopes, but it's using a heavier one. And it's used as a reagent in organic chemistry. What reagents in organic chemistry have heavier isotopes? For example, deuterated compounds. So, perhaps X is something like deuterated water, like D2O, or maybe something else with deuterium.

Wait, no, the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So, for example, if one of the elements in X is hydrogen, the heavier isotope would be deuterium. So maybe X is something like D2O or maybe a sodium deuteroborate or something. Alternatively, maybe X is a halogen with a heavy isotope, but halogens are typically used in reactions as reagents.

Wait, another thought: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Let's think about what could happen. A keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid or something. When it reacts with something, like a base, perhaps forming a salt. Or maybe it's a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, if X is a base, maybe a metal hydroxide or something else. Alternatively, if X is a metal, like sodium, reacting with a keto acid would produce a sodium salt and water. But then, the product would have the anion of the keto acid. Let's think about the number of oxygen atoms. For instance, the keto acid could be something like (CH3CO)COOH, which when deprotonated becomes (CH3CO)COO-. But that's only one carboxylate group. The product would have, in the molecule, two oxygen atoms from the carboxylate and maybe others elsewhere. But the question says the product has two atoms of oxygen. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So maybe the product is water, which has one oxygen, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the product is something like CO2, but that's a gas. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction of the keto acid with X forms an ester or some other compound with two oxygen atoms. But I'm not making much progress here.

Let me try another approach. Let's think about the gas W. If W is He, then the reaction would produce helium gas. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, if W is CO2, but then its protons and neutrons wouldn't match because CO2 has 14 protons (C=6, O=8 each, so 6 + 8*2 =22, but that's the molecular weight). Wait, but W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons in the entire molecule. Wait no, the
