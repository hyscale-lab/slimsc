Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, let me think. I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and when they decay, they have a certain mean decay distance. The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are various distances in meters, so I need to calculate the mean decay distance using these values.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and velocity. Oh right! The formula I remember is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), but I also need to consider the particle's velocity. Because the lifetime is the proper time, and the observed lifetime is longer due to time dilation.

So the formula for the mean decay length (L) should be L = γ * v * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and τ is the proper lifetime. But wait, how do I get τ from the given width Γ?

I think Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime. The relation I remember is Γ = ħ/τ. Oh, but wait, Γ is the total width in energy, and τ is the mean lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units are important here. I should be careful with the units.

Let me jot down the equations:

1. τ = ħ / Γ
2. L = γ * v * τ
3. γ = E / (m c²)
