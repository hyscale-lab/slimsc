Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework where you write down all possible interactions that can occur at low energies, considering higher-dimensional operators that are suppressed by some scale, usually the Planck scale or something like that. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, etc.

Now, the question is about which symmetries these operators must respect. The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, I think Lorentz symmetry is one that all these operators must respect. Because in the Standard Model, Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental symmetry. Effective theories should preserve the same symmetries as the original theory. So SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry because it's an effective theory of the SM, which has Lorentz symmetry. Operators in SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz-invariant, so they must obey that.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. I think that if a theory is Lorentz symmetric, and it's a relativistic theory, it should also have Poincare symmetry. Because Poincare includes the Poincare group, which combines Lorentz transformations and translations. So I believe that SMEFT respects Poincare symmetry as well. So operators would respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. I remember that the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry on its own, because there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, then SMEFT shouldn't enforce it either, right? So the operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP. So option 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I recall that in quantum field theory, the CPT theorem states that all theories must respect CPT symmetry, provided they have a unitary S-matrix and are Lorentz invariant. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz invariant theory and unitary, it must respect CPT. So option 4 must be respected.

So putting it together, which symmetries must all operators respect? 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2 → So that leaves out 4, which I think is necessary.

Option C: 1,2,4 → Yes, that includes all three. But wait, the options given are A) 1,2; B)3,4; C)1,2,4; D)1,3,4.

So I think the correct answer should include 1, 2, and 4. So the options would be option C.

Wait, but I thought that Poincare includes Lorentz, but are they considered separate here? Because sometimes Poincare is considered a larger symmetry. So if operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz, then both 1 and 2 would be correct.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. That matches option C.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is an effective field theory of the Standard Model (SM), which respects Lorentz symmetry. Since SMEFT operators are constructed as Lorentz-invariant, they must preserve Lorentz symmetry. Thus, this symmetry is mandatory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translations. Since SMEFT is a relativistic theory and respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Therefore, this symmetry is also mandatory.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model exhibits CP violation, and SMEFT does not enforce CP symmetry. Operators in SMEFT do not need to respect CP symmetry. Hence, this symmetry is not mandatory.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that all Lorentz-invariant, unitary quantum field theories must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant and unitary, it must respect CPT symmetry. Thus, this symmetry is mandatory.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct combination of these symmetries is given in option C.

Answer: C
