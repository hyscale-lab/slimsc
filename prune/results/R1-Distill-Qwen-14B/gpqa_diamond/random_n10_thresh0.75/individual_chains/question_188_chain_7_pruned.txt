Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, let me think. I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the structure factor. Oh right, the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h² cos²α + k² cos²β + l² cos²γ) + 2(hk cosγ) + 2kl cosαβ + 2 lh cosαβγ) )... Wait, no, that seems too complicated. Maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. 

Wait, another approach: for a rhombohedral crystal, all the lattice parameters are the same, a = b = c, and all angles are equal, alpha = beta = gamma. The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be simplified. Oh right, I think the formula is d = (a) / √(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos(180 - alpha) + 2kl cos(180 - alpha) + 2hl cos(180 - alpha)) ), but wait, no, because in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are not the same as the angles in the formula. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should recall that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (h k + k l + l h) * (1 - cos²α) ) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe another approach. Oh, wait, the interplanar distance formula for a general crystal system is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (h² cos²α + k² cos²β + l² cos²γ)/(a²) + (2hk cosγ + 2kl cosα + 2lh cosβ)/(a²)

Wait, that's more precise. So, the formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) / a² - [h² (cos α)^2 + k² (cos β)^2 + l² (cos γ)^2 ] / a² + [ 2hk cos γ + 2kl cos α + 2 lh cos β ] / a²

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma. So let's denote alpha as the angle between any two axes. So in the formula, since all angles are equal, this should simplify the equation.

Given that, let's plug in the values. The question says (111) plane. So h=1, k=1, l=1. The angles are all 30 degrees. Wait, but wait a second. In crystallography, the angles are measured in a specific way. Wait, the angles in the formula are actually the angles between the crystallographic axes, which are the angles gamma, alpha, beta. In a rhombohedral system, all those angles are the same, say alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes, the angles given in the crystallography context are the angles between the lattice vectors. So, for a rh
