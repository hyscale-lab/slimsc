Okay, I need to figure out what compound E is based on the reaction scheme provided. Let me start by breaking down the steps and the hints.

So, the problem gives me a series of reactions starting from Compound A and leading to Compound E. There are also some hints that I should consider.

First, let's outline the steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form Compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form Compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form Compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form Compound E.

Now, looking at the hints:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Phosphorous ylides are usually used in Wittig reactions. So, this must be a Wittig reaction. The product formed is an alkene because the ylide adds a double bond. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this structure mentally. The cyclopentane ring has two methyl groups on carbons 1 and 2, and a substituent at position 4 which is a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is a methylene group attached to a propyl groupâ€”so it's (CH2)2C=CH-? Or wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2CH(CH3) but as a ylid. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as a substituent attached via a double bond.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane with a propan-2-ylidene group at position 4. So, the substituent is an allyl group? Or a CH2CH(CH3) group attached via a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, the ylide would typically have a structure like PR3+=CH-, so when it reacts with a carbonyl, it forms an alkene. So in this case, Compound A must be a ketone because the Wittig reaction forms an alkene from a carbonyl.

So, Compound A is a ketone. Let me think about the structure of the product from the Wittig reaction. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has substituents at carbons 1, 2, and 4. The substituent at 4 is a propan-2-ylidene, which I think is a methylene group (CH2CH(CH3)CH2? No, wait. Propan-2-yl is CH(CH3)CH2-, but as a ylid, it would be CH2=C(CH3)-. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is (CH2)2C=CH2? Or is it CH2-CH(CH3)- something?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (propan-2-ylidene) meaning a propene
