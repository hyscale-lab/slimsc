Okay, I've got this question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite results that don't make physical sense. So the question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. Let me think through each option.

Option A is Superstring Theory. I know that string theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. Since it deals with higher dimensions and quantizes gravity, maybe it doesn't have the same issues as other quantum field theories. But wait, do string theories require regularization? I'm not too sure. I think they might avoid some divergences because of the way they handle interactions, but I'm not certain.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, where quarks behave as nearly free particles at very high energies (or equivalently, at short distances). Because of this, the coupling constant becomes weak at high energies, which might mean that perturbative methods are more reliable. But I also recall that QCD calculations at low energies can lead to issues like confinement, but at high energies, maybe the theory is more well-behaved. However, I'm not sure if regularization is necessary. Oh wait, I think regularization is used in loop calculations in QCD to handle divergences, even if it's asymptotically free. So maybe B does require regularization.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED has been very successful. It's a renormalizable theory, which means that even though calculations produce infinities, you can absorb them through renormalization. But does that mean regularization isn't used? Well, regularization is a part of the process to handle divergences before renormalization. So yes, QED does require regularization, but the infinities can be handled. So option C does require regularization and thus can't be the correct answer.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the non-quantum version, right? So in classical E&M, you don't have issues like divergences in the same way as quantum theories. Because it's classical, there's no need for renormalization or regularization. So this theory might not require regularization at all. Because regularization is a quantum field theory technique, classical theories don't need it. So option D seems to fit the question.

Wait, but
