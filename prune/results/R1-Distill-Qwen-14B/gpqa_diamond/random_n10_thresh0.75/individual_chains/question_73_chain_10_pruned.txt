Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think through it.

First, the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, from the perspective of an outside observer, each has their own velocity. But the question is about their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, the relative speed isn't as simple as subtracting the two speeds because we're dealing with relativity. Oh right, you can't just do v1 - v2 when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. I remember the formula for adding velocities relativistically. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Let me recall that correctly.

So in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's speed? Or wait, I think the question is asking the relative speed of one as seen by the other, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the speed of each relative to the other, which would involve the same calculation.

Wait, the problem says "relative speed" without specifying direction. Let me see: if they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference in their speeds, but adjusted for relativity. So, for example, if B is moving at 0.5c and A at 0.6c, then in B's frame, A would be moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So that's about 0.14c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's one of the options, like option C or D.

Now for the energy part. The total energy of the system would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is gamma * m c², where gamma
