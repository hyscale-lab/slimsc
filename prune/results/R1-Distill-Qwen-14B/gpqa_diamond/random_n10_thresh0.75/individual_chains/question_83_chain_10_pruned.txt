Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration problems can get tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.0200 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, okay, I remember that when you titrate an acid with a base, the pH changes at different points. At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. At the equivalence point, all the acid has been neutralized.

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, you dilute them. So the initial 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20 cm³ of water. The volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.040 liters) because 20 + 20 is 40.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be calculated using Molarity = moles / volume. So moles = Molarity × Volume. The volume is in liters, so 0.0200 L.

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 M * 0.0200 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, because 0.05 times 0.02 is 0.001, yes.

Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the new volume is 40 cm³ or 0.040 L. So the concentration becomes 0.001 moles / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Because each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid (since it's a 1:1 reaction).

Moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 moles. So to neutralize this, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question isn't about the equivalence point calculation directly but about the pH at that point and at 25% titration.

First, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added.

Wait, wait. The volume of NaOH at 25% would be 25% of the total needed for equivalence. Since equivalence is 10 cm³, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. But wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of moles directly.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing acetate ions.

So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O

So the moles of CH3COOH initially are 0.001, and NaOH adds 0.00025 moles. So the moles after reaction:

CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

CH3COO^-: 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume at 25% titration is the initial acid volume plus the NaOH added. The initial solution was 40 cm³. The NaOH added is 2.5 cm³ (since 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³). So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.0176 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.00588 M.

Wait, wait, 0.00025 divided by 0.0425 is 0.00588235 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, actually, pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.00588235 / 0.0176)

Calculating the ratio: 0.00588235 / 0.0176 ≈ 0.334.

Log(0.334) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.733 -0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Hmm, looking at the options, I see option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Option B is 3.17; 6.73. Option C is 4.73;7.00.

So the 25% titration pH is around 4.26, which matches option A's first value. But let's also check the equivalence point pH.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized. The product is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic. The acetate ions will hydrolyze in water.

The moles of acetate ions at equivalence are 0.001 moles. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ of NaOH (since equivalence is 10 cm³). So 50 cm³, 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

To find pH, we need to calculate the hydrolysis of CH3COO^- in water.

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M, so let's set up the ICE table.

Initial: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02, [CH3COOH] = 0, [OH^-] = 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small), [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x.

So Kb = x² / (0.02) ≈ 5.405e-10.

x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6.

So [OH^-] is 3.29e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.486.

pH = 14 -5.486 ≈8.514.

Wait, that's about 8.51, which matches the first option A's second value of 8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.51, and at 25% it's around 4.26. So the correct option would be option A: 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for the equivalence point. Maybe I made an error.

Wait, wait, the Kb expression is correct? Yes. Kw is 1e-14, so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10. That's correct.

Then, using the approximation x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 1.081e-11 → x is sqrt(1.081e-11) → approx 3.288e-6.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's compute that: log(3.288) is about 0.5165. So log(3.288e-6) is 0.5165 -6 → -5.4835. So pOH is 5.4835, which makes pH 14 -5.4835 =8.5165 → approximately 8.52.

Yes, so the equivalence pH is about 8.52.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52. Looking at the options, option A is (4.26; 8.52).

But wait, looking back at the options, option D has pH 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait a second, perhaps I made an error
