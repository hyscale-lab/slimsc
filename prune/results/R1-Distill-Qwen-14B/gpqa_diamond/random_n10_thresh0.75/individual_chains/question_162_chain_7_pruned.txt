Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit strange. So it's a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. Oh, right, pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface, so this makes sense.

I remember that the area of a surface can be found using the metric. The general formula for area in two dimensions is the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the area. But wait, the metric here is given in a diagonal form, so the determinant should be straightforward.

The metric tensor g has components g_xx and g_yy. Since ds² = g_xx dx² + 2g_xy dx dy + g_yy dy², in this case, it's [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx² plus the same term for dy². So g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²) and g_yy is the same. The off-diagonal terms (g_xy) are zero because there's no cross term.

The determinant of the metric tensor g is (g_xx * g_yy) - (g_xy)^2. Since g_xy is zero, the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, but wait, no, because for a diagonal metric, the determinant is just the product of the diagonal terms, right? So determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2. Hmm, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the metric is diagonal, the determinant is g_xx * g_yy. So that's (32/(4−x²−y²))².

Wait, no, no, wait. Let me think again. The determinant of a diagonal matrix is the product of the diagonal elements. So g_xx is 32/(4−x²−y²), g_yy is the same. So det(g) = (32/(4−x²−y²))².

Wait, but the area element in 2D is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So the area would be the integral over the region where the metric is defined of sqrt(det(g)) dx dy.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the area of the pseudosphere is 4πr², but wait, pseudosphere is a different kind of surface. Alternatively, perhaps not. Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like the hyperbolic space.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the metric given. ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm.

Wait, I recall that the metric for a pseudosphere (or hyperbolic plane) can be written in terms of Poincaré coordinates. The standard Poincaré metric is ds² = (dx² + dy²)/z², where z>0. But that's when the curvature is -1. So the area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite, right? Because it's a negatively curved surface
