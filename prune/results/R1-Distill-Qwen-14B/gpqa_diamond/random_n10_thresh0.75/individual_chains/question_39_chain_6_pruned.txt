Okay, so I have this physics problem here about wave functions and particles in a tube. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function. Each system has a particle moving along the x-axis, and when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. 

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh, right, because the wave function must be normalized for probabilities. So I think I need to normalize the wave function to 1 because the total probability must be 1.

But wait, the wave function has a real part and an imaginary part. Oh, right, the wave function is generally complex. The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So the probability is |ψ(x)|².

So first, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me compute |ψ(x)|². That would be [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ]² + (0.5)², because the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5, so when squared, it's (0.5)^2.

Wait, no, more accurately: ψ(x) = A + iB, so |ψ|² is A² + B². So for ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, the real part A is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and B is -0.5. So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, the integral of the probability density over all space (or the allowed region) must equal 1. The allowed region here is from x=1 to x=3, because the particle is only found there.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1.

So the integral becomes ∫[ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3. Let me compute this.

Breaking the integral into two parts: ∫ (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to3, plus ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

The first integral is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. Because the integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is (a² ln 2) + 0.5 = 1.

So rearranging:

a² = (1 - 0.5)/ln 2 = 0.5 / ln 2.

Wait, ln 2 is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

Taking the square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849.
