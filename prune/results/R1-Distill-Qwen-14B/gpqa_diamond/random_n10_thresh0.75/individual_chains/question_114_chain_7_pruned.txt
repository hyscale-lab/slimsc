Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Alright, let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when that reacts with NaCN, what's happening here? Oh, I remember that in nucleophilic addition reactions, ketones can react with cyanide ions. But wait, isn't sodium cyanide a source of CN- ions?

So butan-2-one has a ketone group. Ketones can undergo addition reactions with nucleophiles. In the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps? Because acid might protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, no. Wait, butanone is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would add to the carbonyl. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or maybe I'm mixing up the positions.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the cyanide acting as a nucleophile. So the ketone would react with NaCN in a nucleophilic addition. The product would have the hydroxyl and the nitrile group on the same carbon, I think. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile would be four carbons with the nitrile at the end. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methyl, so the structure is (CH(CH3)(OH))CH2CN? Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, wait. Maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, not sure about the exact structure, but I think the key point is that NaCN is adding to the ketone, and the reaction requires an acid catalyst.

Wait, what's reagent A?
