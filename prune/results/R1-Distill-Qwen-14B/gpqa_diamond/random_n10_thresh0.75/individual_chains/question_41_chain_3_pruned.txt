Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Alright, the setup is that there's a light beam going through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer. And the options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, in this case, the glass is moving. Does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light within it? Oh, wait, special relativity comes into play here. Because the glass is a material moving relative to the lab frame, but the light is in the glass which is moving. So maybe I need to consider how velocities add in relativity.

Wait, no. Wait, in the medium's frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n, right? Because in any inertial frame, the speed of light in a medium would be c/n. So when the medium is moving, does the speed of light as observed in the lab change?

Wait, I might be mixing things up. Let's think carefully. The question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory. So in the glass's rest frame, the speed of the light is c/n. But since the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, we need to find the velocity of the light as observed
