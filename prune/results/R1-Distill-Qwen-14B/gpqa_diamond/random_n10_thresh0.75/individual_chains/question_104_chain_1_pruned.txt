Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think through this. I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's motion towards or away from us.

The problem says that two stars have the same masses as each other and similar to the Sun. So Star A and Star B are same mass, same as Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The RV method detected the planets. For Planet #1, the spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, so I need to find the ratio of their periods, specifically P2/P1.

I think the RV method's Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember for the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is something like K = (v * sin i) where v is the velocity. But since the orbits are circular, the inclination i is 90 degrees, so sin i is 1. So K is the actual velocity amplitude.

But wait, the Doppler shift is inversely proportional to the wavelength. Oh, no, wait. The Doppler shift formula is delta lambda over lambda is equal to (v) / c, but wait, actually, the RV shift is delta lambda / lambda = v/c, but I'm not sure about the exact formula here.

Wait, no, the formula for the radial velocity is often expressed as the velocity of the star (v) which is related to the Doppler shift. The shift in wavelength (delta lambda) is given by:

delta lambda = lambda_0 * (v / c)

where lambda_0 is the original wavelength, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light. But in terms of measurement, the RV shift is often given as the velocity, so the measured velocity amplitude K is what's used.

Wait, but in the question, they're giving the wavelength shifts as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So perhaps the measured K (the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity) is proportional to the wavelength shift. Because for a given star, the same velocity would cause the same shift. So if the shift for Planet #1 is 5 and Planet #2 is 7, then K2 is (7/5) * K1?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p)^2 ) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ) * (1 / (P * (1 day)) )^(1/3)

Wait, no, perhaps I should recall the simplified version that relates the RV semi-amplitude K to the orbital period, mass of the planet, and the mass of the star.

The formula I remember is:

K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less than Sun mass), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. And since the orbits are circular, e=0. So sin i = 1. So it simplifies to:

K ≈ (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But wait, let's write this more clearly. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * P) / (2π) ) ]^(-1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2) )

But again, with e=0 and M_p << M_star, it's approximately:

K ≈ ( (G * P )/(2π) )^(-1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) )

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), given that M_p and M_star are fixed. But in this problem, the two stars are identical (same mass), and the planets have similar masses. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2, and M_star1 = M_star2. So, for both planets, the only varying factor is the period.

Wait, but in this case, the K value is the same as the RV semi-amplitude which is proportional to the velocity. So the given shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me think in terms of the Doppler shift and velocity. The RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us, which is K. So if the shift in wavelength is larger, that implies a higher K, because the star is moving faster towards or away from us.

So if Planet #2 causes a larger shift (7 vs 5), that means K2 is larger than K1. Because a larger shift implies higher velocity.

So, K2 = (7/5) K1? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the shift in wavelength is delta lambda. The Doppler shift formula is delta lambda / lambda = v / c. So the velocity v is proportional to delta lambda.

So, K2 = (7/5) * K1.

Wait, because for the same star (same lambda_0), a larger delta lambda implies a larger v. So yes, K2 = (7/5) K1.

But wait, the
