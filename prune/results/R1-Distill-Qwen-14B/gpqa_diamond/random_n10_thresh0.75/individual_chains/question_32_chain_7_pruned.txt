Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. Lithium normally has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So nucleus X is Li-6, right? So its mass number A is 6. So I need to find the energy that the RHIC imparts to this nucleus so its speed is 0.96 times the speed of light.

I remember that in relativity, when objects move at speeds close to c, their energy isn't just kinetic. I think I need to use the relativistic energy equations. So, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. And the kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1) times the rest mass energy.

But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. I think it's referring to the total energy, not just the kinetic part. Or maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me make sure.

The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So the energy of the ion would be its total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy.

Right, so the formula for gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate that for v=0.96c.

Let me compute v squared over c squared: (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. Let me compute 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784. Hmm, what's 0.28 squared? 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.2
