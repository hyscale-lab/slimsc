Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait, wait. That's a bit confusing. The wave function usually has both real and imaginary parts, right? So in this case, the real part is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5i. Hmm.

The setup is that each particle can move along the x-axis in a tube, and when we measure their positions, none were found at x <1 or x >3. So all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a region is given by the integral of the probability density over that region. The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is given as a function that's valid in a part of space where the particle can exist. So the particle is confined between x=1 and x=3, and not found elsewhere. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside this region, but within x=1 to x=3, it's given as this expression?

But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) -0.5i. That seems a bit odd because typically in such problems, the wave functions are normalized so that the integral of the probability density equals one. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

Wait, but the wave function is given here. So maybe I need to normalize it. Normalization means that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

So |ψ(x)|² is [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ]² + [ (-0.5) ]², because when you square a complex number, you take the magnitude squared. Oh wait, because ψ(x) is A + Bi, then |ψ|² is A² + B².

Wait, ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is
