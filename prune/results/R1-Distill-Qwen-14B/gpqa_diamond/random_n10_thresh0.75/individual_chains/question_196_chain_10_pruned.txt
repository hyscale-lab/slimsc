Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is the relativistic version, so I guess I have to consider how relativity affects the equations of motion.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think about what I know about harmonic oscillators and special relativity.

In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found by considering energy conservation. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², and at maximum speed, all that potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the classical formula would be v = sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C looks like this, but wait, this is the non-relativistic case. So in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So when the oscillator is at the maximum amplitude (x = A), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in the relativistic case might be similar to the classical case, but I'm not sure. Wait, the problem states that it's obeying Hooke's law, which would suggest that the potential is (1/2)kx², so maybe the potential energy is the same as in the classical case.

So the total mechanical energy E is (1/2)kA², which equals the kinetic energy at x=0 (the equilibrium point where speed is maximum). Therefore, the kinetic energy in relativity is E = (gamma - 1)mc². Setting that equal to (1/2)kA²:

(gamma - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

Now, solving for gamma. Let me rearrange that:

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

Hmm, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

Let me denote (kA²)/(2mc²) as some term, say, alpha. So alpha = kA²/(2mc²). Then the equation becomes:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

But I think I should write it without substitution for now. So solving for v:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Let me compute that expression. 1 - 1/(something squared). Let me factor that. Let me compute it as:

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding (1 + alpha)^2 is 1 + 2 alpha + alpha². Subtract 1 and you get 2 alpha + alpha². So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Factor numerator: alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, but alpha is (kA²)/(2mc²). If kA² is much smaller than 2mc², then alpha is small, but since we're in the relativistic case, maybe alpha is not negligible. Hmm.

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps I can express 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 as:

( (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which is [1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1 ] / denominator: 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v^2 = c² [ (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2 ].

Wait, but let me express alpha in terms of the given variables. So alpha is kA²/(2 m c²). Let me substitute that back:

v² = c² [ ( 2 (kA²/(2 m c²)) + (kA²/(2 m c²))^2 ) / (1 + kA²/(2 m c²))^2 ]

Simplify numerator:

2*(kA²/(2 m c²)) is (kA²)/(m c²).

The second term is (kA²)^2/(4 m² c^4).

So numerator is (kA²/(m c²)) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Denominator is (1 + kA²/(2 m c²)) squared.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out (kA²/(2 m c²))^2 from the numerator. Let me see:

Wait, the numerator is (kA²/(m c²)) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4). Let me factor (kA²/(2 m c²)) from both terms.

Wait, (kA²/(m c²)) is 2*(kA²/(2 m c²)), right? Because 2 times (kA²/(2 m c²)) is (kA²)/(m c²).

So numerator = 2*(kA²/(2 m c²)) + [ (kA²/(2 m c²)) ]^2.

Which is 2 alpha + alpha², where alpha is kA²/(2 m c²).

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

= c^2 [ alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

Hmm, maybe there's a way to write this more neatly. Let me think: (2 + alpha) = (1 + alpha) + 1.

So, (2 + alpha) = 1 + alpha + 1. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it another way. Wait, let me compute 2 + alpha = 2 + kA²/(2 m c²).

Wait, maybe I can factor the numerator as alpha(2 + alpha) = alpha (2 + alpha).

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as v² = c² [ (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2 ].

Let me take the square root.

v = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2) )
