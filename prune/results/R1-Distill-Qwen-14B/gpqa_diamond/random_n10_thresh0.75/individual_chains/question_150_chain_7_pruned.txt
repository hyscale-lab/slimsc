Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. Let's take it step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down: each degree of unsaturation is a ring or a double bond. The formula for degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, which we don't have here. So C is 8, H is9, N is1, O is1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2. Let's compute that: (18-9-1+1)=9. 9/2 is 4.5. Oh, wait, that can't be right because DoU should be an integer. Did I mess up the calculation?

Wait, let me recalculate. The formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So 2*8=16 +2=18. 18 minus H which is 9: 9. Then subtract X (0 here) and add N (1). So 9 +1=10. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N - P)/2, where P is phosphorus or similar. Here, no P. So X is 0, N is 1.

So 2*8 + 2 = 18. 18 -9 =9, then -0 (no X) +1 (N) â†’ 10. 10/2=5. So DoU is 5. That makes sense. So five degrees: maybe two rings and three double bonds, or a ring and three double bonds, or other combinations.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H-NMR (ppm): 
9.72 (t, 1H),
6.98 (d, 2H),
6.51 (d, 2H),
6.27 (bs, 2H),
3.66 (d, 2H).

Hmm. Let's parse this. 

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) integrating for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton, which typically is around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but an aldehyde is usually a singlet. Unless it's in a coupling situation. Oh, wait, if it's an aldehyde adjacent to another proton, like in a conjugated system. Or maybe it's an enol tautomer, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents causing some coupling. Wait, but the triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group, which would cause it to couple with two protons, making a triplet. That makes sense. So, for example,
