Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries are those?

The question lists four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. And the options are combinations of these. I need to figure out which ones must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

I think I should start by recalling each symmetry.

Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Operators in the SMEFT must respect this because they're part of a Lorentz-invariant theory. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely required.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries? Oh right, because Poincare group includes both. But wait, in the SMEFT, do the operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? Well, the original Standard Model does, so I think SMEFT, being an effective theory built from it, should too. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry (option 2). So options 1 and 2 are both required.

Now, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry, except in some cases. Wait, but SMEFT is a general effective theory. So do the operators have to respect CP? I don't think
