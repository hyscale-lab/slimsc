Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving relative to an observer. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, speed of light in glass... Normally, when light travels through a medium with index of refraction n, its speed is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the glass is moving. So, how does that affect things?

I remember something about the addition of velocities, like in special relativity. Oh right, when objects are moving relative to each other, you can't just add their velocities normally. But wait, this is about light in a medium. Does that change things?

Wait, no. Because light in a medium has a speed v = c/n, but in the medium's frame. So if the medium itself is moving, we need to find the speed of the light as seen from the lab frame.

So let's break it down. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light inside the glass is moving at speed v_light = c/n in the glass's frame. But from the lab frame, the light's speed would be the vector sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity within the glass.

Wait, but direction matters. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so their velocities add? Or subtract?

Wait, no. The light is moving through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be the speed of light in the medium plus the speed of the medium. Or is it different because of relativity?

Wait, but wait. The speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? Oh wait, wait. That's only in a vacuum. In a medium, the speed is c/n, but that's in the medium's rest frame. From the lab frame, which is moving relative to the medium, how does that work?

Oh, maybe the problem is considering the speed as measured in the lab frame. So it's not c, because the medium is moving, but the light's speed is modified by the medium's motion.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because the speed of light can't exceed c.

Wait, let's think about it. Suppose the medium is moving at velocity u relative to the lab. The speed of light in the medium is v = c/n in the medium's frame. To find the speed in the lab, we apply the velocity addition formula.

The relativistic formula is: if an object has velocity v in a frame S', which is moving at velocity u relative to S, then the object's velocity in S is (v + u)/(1 + vu/cÂ²).

Wait, but wait, is that when the velocity is along the same direction? Yes.

So in this case, the light's velocity in the medium's frame is v_light = c/n, and the medium is moving at velocity v (same direction as light) relative to the lab. So the lab's frame will see the light's velocity as (v_light + v)/(1 + v
