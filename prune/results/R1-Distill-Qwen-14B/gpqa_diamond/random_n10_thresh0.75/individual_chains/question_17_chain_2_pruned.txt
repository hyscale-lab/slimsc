Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. 

The problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. And the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Wait, what's a formation constant again? Oh right, it's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- â†” CaEDTA^2-, and K is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

The solution assumes the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is mostly in its active form. But wait, I think EDTA can have different protonation states depending on the pH. Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, so I guess that the concentration of EDTA^4- is high enough, so I can consider that [EDTA^4-] is effectively the same as the total EDTA concentration if it's all in that form. Or wait, no, because the complex is already formed. Hmm.

Wait, but here the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So I think the main species in solution are the complex and any free calcium and EDTA. But the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions. 

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me
