Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? It's probably in some kind of curved space because the denominator has x² + y², which makes me think it's related to a sphere maybe. But wait, pseudosphere... Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, unlike a sphere which has positive curvature.

So the question is about calculating the area of this pseudosphere when the radius r is 2. But wait, I'm not completely sure how the radius relates here. In a sphere, the area is 4πr², but for a pseudosphere, maybe it's different, or maybe the formula is similar but with a negative sign somewhere?

Wait, no, area can't be negative. So perhaps the metric is telling me about the geometry here. Let's see. The given metric is written in terms of x and y, but maybe it's easier to switch to polar coordinates since it's symmetric in x and y. Yeah, that makes sense because x² + y² is r² in polar coordinates.

So let's say x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). That looks like a standard form for a metric in
