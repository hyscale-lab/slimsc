Okay, I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me start by understanding the given information.

So, from the question, I know that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait: wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, no, wait. No, wait again: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, wait, no, wait, I think I got that wrong. Wait. Let me read again. It says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag" can be observed. So that's apparent magnitude less than 17, because lower magnitude is brighter. Wait, no, wait: in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So for example, a star with V=10 is brighter than V=20. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that would mean apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17. Because anything brighter than 17 (lower magnitude number) is okay. Wait, no, wait: the wording is a bit confusing. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". So, brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So the maximum apparent magnitude that ESPRESSO can observe is
