Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and NMR spectra.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two opposite bridgehead carbons. Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid, product 1.

KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's some kind of elimination reaction. When dihalides react with bases, they often undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes, but wait, in this case, both bromines are on adamantane. So perhaps it's a double elimination, removing two HBr molecules? But wait, no, wait—adamantane is a polycyclic structure. Maybe it's a Diels-Alder type reaction? Or perhaps, since it's KOH, it's an E2 elimination.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh, right, when you have two adjacent (or vicinal) dihalides, especially with a strong base, they can undergo elimination to form an alkene. But adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the two bromines are on bridgehead carbons. So when they eliminate, they might form a double bond between those two carbons, making 1,3-diene adamantane? Or wait, no, elimination would form a double bond.

Wait, but adamantane is a cage structure. So if you eliminate HBr from each bridgehead, you might form a bridge with a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon dehydrohalogenation would form 1,3-diene adamantane, which is called adamatene? Or maybe it's a norbornene-like structure? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the structure, but the product is a bicyclic diene.

But let's look at the NMR spectrum of product 1. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, that IR peak is around the carbonyl region. Wait
