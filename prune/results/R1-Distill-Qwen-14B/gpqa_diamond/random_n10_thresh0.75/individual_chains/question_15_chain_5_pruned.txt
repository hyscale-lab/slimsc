Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. 

The problem states that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 orbits closer to its star since the period is shorter. 

The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. Wait, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's not necessarily larger in radius. I think more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe in this case, they're similar because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, which might have caused it to expand a bit? I'm not exactly sure about that part, but probably not critical for the transit probability.

Transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but wait, no, I think it's actually the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Or maybe it's the orbital distance divided by the star's radius. Wait, no, the probability of transit is higher when the planet's orbit is more edge-on to our line of sight. The probability is proportional to (R_star / a_orbital)^2, where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The probability is approximately (R*/a), where R* is the radius of the star, and a is the semi-major axis (orbital distance) of the planet. Because the chance that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet crosses our line of sight is higher when the star is larger relative to the planet's orbit.

Wait, I think the formula for the probability P is roughly (R* / a), because the area where the planet can transit is a circle with radius R*, and the total possible area is the area of the planet's orbit. So, the probability is (R* / a)^2 times the chance that the inclination is correct. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me get this
