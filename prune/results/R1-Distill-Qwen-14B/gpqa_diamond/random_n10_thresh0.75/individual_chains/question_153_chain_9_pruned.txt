Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I remember Michael addition is when a nucleophile attacks a beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The reaction is named after Michael B. Smith, right? So the question has three different reactions, A, B, and C, each with their own set of reactants and conditions, and I need to find the products.

Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with reaction A: it's dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate under NaOEt and EtOH conditions. NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base, so probably deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is O=C(CO2Me)2. So when it forms the enolate, the base (NaOEt) would abstract a proton from the alpha position. The alpha positions are the ones next to the carbonyl. So, the enolate would have a negative charge on the central carbon.

So the other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this is CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O-OCH3)-R where R is p-tolyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2-CH(C6H4-p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent at carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached to the beta position, so maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The acrylate part is CH2=CHCOO-. So when it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the third carbon? Or wait, perhaps the numbering is different. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O-OCH3)-p-tolyl? No, maybe not. Let me draw this out.

Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure: 

The acrylate group is CH2=CHCOO-. So the substituent (p-tolyl) is on the third carbon, which is the beta position of the carbonyl. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, that can't be right because that would be the gamma position. Hmm, maybe I should reconsider.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tol
