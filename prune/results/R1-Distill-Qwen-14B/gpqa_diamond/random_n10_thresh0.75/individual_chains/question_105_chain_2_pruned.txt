Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a star with some spots on it, and how that affects the observed brightness variations. Then, it's comparing that to the effect a planet would have if it were causing the same brightness changes. The goal is to find what the planet's radius would need to be relative to the star's radius.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet passes in front of a star (transit), it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. So, the bigger the planet compared to the star, the larger the dip in brightness.

But in this problem, the star itself has spots. The spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, I think. So when the star rotates, those spots come into and out of view, affecting the star's brightness. But wait, the problem says that the situation can closely resemble that of an exoplanet. So, the brightness variations due to the spots are being mistaken for a planet transiting the star.

So the question is: what's the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same light curve amplitude as these spots are causing?

Let me jot down the given data:

- Radius of the star, Rstar, is equal to the Sun's radius. So Rstar = R_sun.

- The spots cover one hemisphere, filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the total area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area. Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So total area of spots is 0.2 * (surface area of hemisphere).

Wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4πR². So a hemisphere would be 2πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

The star's total surface area is 4πR². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4πR²) / (4πR²) ) = 0.1 or 10%. So the spots cover 10% of the star's surface area.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler. The temperature difference is 1000 K, so T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

Since the spots are cooler, when they are on the visible hemisphere (facing us), they contribute less light than the rest of the star. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing a dip in brightness.

But how does this dip compare to a planet transiting the star?

Wait, but the problem states that the star is covered by spots, but the photometric observations are looking for periodic variations in brightness due to rotation. The star's brightness variation is due to spots rotating in and out of view. So when the spots are on the visible side, the brightness is lower because the spots are cooler, so emit less
