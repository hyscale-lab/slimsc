Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step because honestly, it's a bit confusing at first glance. I'll think it through as if I'm explaining it to someone else.

Alright, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's another clue about a keto acid reacting with X to give a product with two oxygen atoms. Finally, the problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A to D, all numbers.

Hmm. Let's start by trying to figure out what each of these substances could be. I'll go through each part.

First, X reacts with Y violently, releasing gas W. Let's think about common violent reactions. If Y is a liquid, maybe water. But more likely, perhaps it's an acid or a base. Wait, but the reaction is violent, so maybe it's a metal reacting with an acid? Like magnesium with hydrochloric acid, but that's not too violent. Alternatively, maybe something like sodium reacting with water, which is pretty violent, producing hydrogen gas.

Wait, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. Let's see: the simplest gas is H2, but that's just two H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Oh wait, that's only one proton and one electron, but maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, the molecule of W has same number of neutrons and protons. So total for the molecule.

Wait, H2 has two protons and two neutrons? No, each H is 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So total for H2: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. But that's not same. So maybe another gas.

Wait, what about CO2? No, that's a gas but let's see. Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's C-12), O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (O-16). CO2 would have 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons, and 6 + 16*2 = 38
