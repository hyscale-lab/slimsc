Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given data includes an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees each. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Oh right, rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, so it's a special case of the hexagonal system or maybe a cubic? No, wait, no—rhombohedral is part of the cubic system when angles are 90, but here the angles are 30 degrees, so it's a rhombohedral crystal with a cubic lattice but with all angles 30°, not 90°. So it's a more general case.

I remember that the interplanar distance, d_hkl, is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor. The formula is 1/d² equals the sum of (sin²θ)/(h² + k² + l²), but wait, no, that's for cubic systems with all angles 90 degrees. For rhombohedral, the formula is a bit different.

Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles α, β, γ is given by the reciprocal of the square root of ( (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) + ... some cross terms involving the angles). But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula from the Miller indices.

Wait, another approach. For a rhombohedral crystal, all the lattice parameters are equal, right? So a = b = c. Let's denote this as 'a'. The angles are all equal to 30 degrees, so α = β = γ = 30°. So, the unit cell is rhombohedral with a cubic lattice in terms of edge lengths but with all angles 30 degrees.

So for the (111) plane, the interplanar distance d is given by the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk (cos α + cos β cos γ ))/(a²) * ... Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, I think the formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )

Wait, no, perhaps that's the formula for a general hexagonal system. Hmm. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. The interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) )

Wait, but that sounds more accurate. Because in a cubic system, cos α, cos β, cos γ are zero, so the formula reduces to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which I know is correct.

So in this case, since all angles are 30°, and the plane is (111), h=k=l=1.

So substituting the values:

d = a / sqrt( (1² + 1² + 1²) - 2(1*1 cos 30) - 2(1*1 cos 30) - 2(1*1 cos 30) )

Wait, let's compute each term step by step.

Compute the numerator and denominator:

h² +k² +l² = 1+1+1 =3.

The next terms are 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ). Since all angles are 30°, and h=k=l=1, each term becomes 2*(1*1 * cos30).

So each term is 2*1*1*(√3/2) )= √3.

There are three such terms: hk, hl, kl.

So sum of these terms: 3 * √3.

So the denominator inside the sqrt becomes:

3 - 3 * (√3).

Wait, let me see. So denominator:

sqrt(3 - 3*(√3)).

So d = a / sqrt(3 - 3√3 ).

Wait, but wait. Wait. 3 - 3√3 is a negative number because √3 is about 1.732, so 3*1.732 is about 5.196. 3-5.196 is about -2.196. So sqrt of a negative number? That can't be possible. That would imply that the interplanar distance is imaginary, which isn't possible.

Hmm, that can't be right. Did I get the formula wrong? Perhaps I have the sign wrong. Maybe the formula is 3 + 3√3? Or maybe I'm missing a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 3 + 2*(sum of cos terms). Let me double-check the formula for d in rhombohedral systems.

Wait, another source. Ok, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d² = a² / [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) ]

Wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral system all a, b, c are equal. So the formula becomes d² = a² / [3 - 2( cos α + cos β + cos γ ) ].

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. For a general hexagonal system, the formula is more complicated, but for rhombohedral, perhaps it's similar to the cubic but with some adjustment.

Wait, maybe it's better to approach this using vectors. The interplanar distance formula can be derived from the unit cell vectors.

In a rhombohedral lattice, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, all of equal length, and all angles between them are 30 degrees. So the unit cell is defined by vectors a, b, c, each with magnitude a, and the angles between any two vectors is 30 degrees.

The plane (111) corresponds to the plane normal vector being (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of this normal vector in reciprocal space, but perhaps it's easier to compute using the formula.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance d is given by:

d = [ (a² (hk + kh) cos γ + similar terms ) ]^(-1/2)

Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, using the formula from crystallography textbooks.

Wait, I think the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d² = a² / [ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ]

Wait, but wait, cos α is the angle between the vectors. Wait, in rhombohedral structures, the angle between a and b is alpha, between a and c is gamma, etc. But in this case, all angles are 30 degrees.

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

d² = [ (h a + k b cos α + l c cos β )^2 + ... ].

No, I'm getting stuck. Let me refer to the formula from memory.

I recall that for a rhombohedral lattice, the d-spacing formula is:

d^2 = (a^2) / [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) ]

Wait, but if all angles are 30 degrees, and a = b = c, then:

d^2 = a^2 / [3 - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos 30 ]

In this case, h, k, l are all 1.

So substituting:

Denominator = 3 - 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) * cos 30°
= 3 - 2*(3) * (√3/2)
= 3 - 3*√3
≈ 3 - 3*1.732 ≈ 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

So d^2 = a^2 / (-2.196), which is negative. That can't be right. So that must mean I have the formula wrong.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d^2 = a^2 / [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) ]

But then, with all cosines positive, and angles 30°, that would make the denominator larger, perhaps positive.

Wait, but wait, cos 30 is positive (≈0.866). So let's compute that.

Denominator would be 3 + 2*(1+1+1)* (√3/2) = 3 + 2*(3)(√3/2) = 3 + 3√3 ≈ 3 +5.196=8.196.

So d = a / sqrt(8.196) ≈ a / 2.863.

Wait, but a is the interatomic distance. The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait! Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal is not necessarily the same as a, the lattice parameter. Oh, right, because in a crystal, particularly in a close-packed structure, the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest atoms, which is typically a fraction of the lattice parameter.

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance d_ia is equal to a, since the atoms are at the corners of the cube, so the nearest neighbors are along the cube edges. But in other structures, like face-centered or body-centered, the interatomic distance is a√2/2 or a√3/2, etc.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a simple cubic structure (SC), the interatomic distance is a, because each atom is at the corner, and the nearest neighbor is along the edge.

In a face-centered cubic (FCC), the nearest atoms are along the face diagonal, so the distance is a√2/(2) = a/√2.

Wait, but the given question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So that would imply a is 10 Angstroms for a simple cubic structure, but if it's another structure, a would be different.

But in this case, the problem refers to a rhombohedral crystal. So it's a more complex structure. So I think the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance. So we need to find a relationship between the interatomic distance and the lattice parameter a.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance can be found as the magnitude of the vector between two adjacent lattice points.

In a rhombohedral lattice, the vectors are a, b, c, each of length a, and the angles between them are 30 degrees.

So, the nearest neighbor vector would be the vector from (0,0,0) to (1,0,0), which has magnitude a. But wait, maybe the nearest neighbor is along some other direction. Hmm, not necessarily. But in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbors are along the edges of the unit cell. So the interatomic distance would be a.

Wait, but then a would be 10 Angstroms.

Wait, but then if a=10 Angstroms, then let's compute d.

Earlier, I tried a formula and got a negative denominator, which is impossible. So perhaps that formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses the sum of terms with cosines being subtracted.

Wait, perhaps I should have:

d² = a² / [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) ]

But in this case, all angles are 30°, so:

Denominator = 3 - 2*(cos30 + cos30 + cos30) * (h k + h l + k l)?

Wait, not exactly. Because h, k, l are 1,1,1.

Wait, h*k + h*l + k*l = 3.

So denominator = 3 - 2*(3) (cos30).

Which again would be 3 - 6 * (√3/2) = 3 - 3√3 ≈ 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

That can't be right. So perhaps the formula is actually:

d² = a² / [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) ]

Wait, but then with h=k=l=1 and cos30 positive, the denominator would be 3 + 3 * √3 ≈ 8.196.

So d = a / sqrt(8.196) ≈ a / 2.863.

If a is 10, then d ≈ 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.494 Angstroms. But that's for (111) plane. But wait, that's way too small compared to the options given. The options are all around 9 Angstroms.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the interatomic distance is not 'a' but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is for the reciprocal lattice. Or maybe I'm confusing the reciprocal space with real space.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this using the relation between the interplanar distance and the unit cell vectors.

The interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by the formula:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \alpha) - 2(hl \cos \beta) - 2(kl \cos \gamma)}} / (a \cdot something)

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the magnitude of the plane's normal vector in the reciprocal lattice. Hmm, perhaps using vector methods.

Let me think of the lattice vectors. The vectors defining the rhombohedral unit cell are a, b, c, each of magnitude a, with angles between them as 30 degrees.

The plane (111) has a normal vector n = a + b + c. The interplanar distance d is the magnitude of the projection of this vector onto the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, no, more accurately, the interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the projection of the reciprocal lattice vector onto the plane. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the magnitude of the normal vector in real space.

Wait, the interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes in the crystal. For a plane defined by (hkl), the distance can be found by considering the vectors a, b, c.

The formula for d is:

d = \frac{|\vec{n}|}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma) + 2(hl \cos \beta) + 2(kl \cos \alpha)}}}

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact signs. Alternatively, perhaps:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \alpha) - 2(hl \cos \beta) - 2(kl \cos \gamma) } } \times a.

Wait, but that's what I tried earlier, leading to a negative denominator, which is impossible. So perhaps the correct formula is with a plus sign.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the volume of the unit cell. The volume V is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 α - cos^2 β - cos^2 γ + 2 cos α cos β cos γ).

Wait, but since all angles are 30°, let's compute V.

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(cos30)^2 + 2*(cos30)^3 )

Wait, cos30 is √3/2 ≈0.8660.

So cos^2 30 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So 1 -3*(0.75)= 1 -2.25= -1.25.

Then, 2*(cos30)^3 = 2*( (√3/2)^3 ) = 2*( 3√3 / 8 ) )= 3√3/4 ≈ 1.299.

So V = a^3 * sqrt( -1.25 + 1.299 ) = a^3 * sqrt(0.049) ≈ a^3 * 0.221.

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal lattice vectors. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) ( 1, 0, 0 ) in terms of the original lattice vectors, but that's for a cubic system.

But in a rhombohedral system, this is more complex. Alternatively, maybe we can express the reciprocal vectors in terms of the unit vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α } }

But in this case, with all angles 30°, and h=k=l=1,

d = a / sqrt( 3 + 2*(3) cos30 )

= a / sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2) )

= a / sqrt(3 + 3√3 )

Let me compute the denominator.

3 + 3√3 ≈ 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

Then, d ≈ a / 2.863.

If a is 10 Angstroms, then d ≈ 3.494 Angstroms. But none of the options are around 3.5. The options are around 9, so this can't be correct.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong value for a. Because in the problem statement, it says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps 'a' is not the interatomic distance, but the lattice parameter, and the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighbors, which depends on the structure.

In a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is along the edges of the unit cell, so the interatomic distance would be a. Wait, but that would mean a=10. Then d for (111) is around 3.5, which isn't matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is not along the edges but along some other direction, making a larger.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along a diagonal. Wait, but in a simple cubic, the nearest is along the edge. But in a rhombohedral structure, if the angles are small, perhaps the nearest atoms are along another vector.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is not along the edges. Let's compute the distance between (000) and (111) points.

Wait, no, that's for the (111) plane. But the nearest neighbors are the closest points in the lattice. So perhaps the rhombohedral structure's nearest neighbor is not along (1,0,0), but some other combination.

Wait, the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,1) would be sqrt( (a)^2 + (b)^2 + (c)^2 + 2ab cos γ + 2ac cos β + 2bc cos α ). Wait, no, the formula for the distance between two points in the lattice depends on the vectors.

Wait, the distance squared between two points (h1,k1,l1) and (h2,k2,l2) is:

d^2 = a^2 (h2 - h1)^2 + b^2 (k2 - k1)^2 + c^2 (l2 - l1)^2 + 2a b (h2 - h1)(k2 - k1) cos γ + 2a c (h2 - h1)(l2 - l1) cos β + 2b c (k2 - k1)(l2 - l1) cos α.

So the nearest neighbor would be the minimum possible d.

In a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbors could be along the edges, face diagonals, or body diagonals, depending on the angles.

So let's compute the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,0,0): that's 'a' since vectors a, b, c are orthogonal? No, wait, no. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the vectors are at 30 degrees to each other.

Wait, the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,0,0) is simply the magnitude of a, which is a. Similarly, (0,0,0) to (0,1,0) is b, etc.

But between (0,0,0) and (1,1,0), the distance is sqrt(a² + b² + 2ab cos γ ), since γ is the angle between a and b, which is 30 degrees.

Wait, a = b = c = lattice parameter.

So distance (1,1,0) to (0,0,0) is sqrt( a² + a² + 2a² cos 30 )

= a * sqrt(2 + 2*(√3/2)) )

= a * sqrt(2 + √3) ≈ a * sqrt( 2 + 1.732 ) ≈ a * sqrt(3.732) ≈ a * 1.931.

So this distance is about 1.931 a. If a is 10 Angstroms, the distance is about 19.31 Angstroms, which is bigger than the interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms.

Wait, but the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. So perhaps the nearest neighbor is along the edge direction, so a=10 Angstroms.

But then, as before, the (111) plane's interplanar distance comes out to about 3.5 Angstroms, which doesn't match any option.

Hmm, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, or perhaps I'm confusing the reciprocal space.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the formula for the interplanar distance is d = a / (sqrt( h² + k² + l² )) when the angles are 90 degrees, and when the angles are not 90, a correction is needed.

In a cubic system, d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²).

In a rhombohedral system, the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), where α is the angle between the vectors.

Wait, but in this case, with α=30°, the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 2*(3) * cos30 )

= a / sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2) )

= a / sqrt(3 + 3√3 )

Which is the same as earlier.

If a is 10 Angstroms, then d ≈10 / 2.863 ≈3.494 Angstroms.

But the options are all around 9 Angstroms. So perhaps the formula is reciprocal.

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I have the formula inverted. Maybe d = 1/( sqrt(...) )

No, that doesn't make sense. Because d is a distance, it should be in Angstroms, and a is in Angstroms as well.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another source.

Upon recalling, the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but in this case, if α is 30°, which is acute, cos α is positive, so the denominator would be larger, making d smaller.

Wait, but this brings us back to the same issue.

Hmm, perhaps in this problem, the interatomic distance refers to the lattice parameter a. So a=10 Angstroms.

Then, using the formula for (111):

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2) ) ≈ 10 / 2.863 ≈3.494 Angstroms.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and 'a' is not the interatomic distance.

Wait, perhaps 'a' is the interatomic distance. Wait, but in that case, for the (100) plane, d would be a, which is 10 Angstroms, which isn't one of the options either. But the problem is about (111).

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between (1,1,1) and (0,0,0) which is sqrt(3a² + 2a² cos30° * ... ).

Wait, let's compute the distance between (1,1,1) and (0,0,0).

r² = a² + a² + a² + 2a² cos30 * (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 )

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

r² = a²( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α )

Wait, in this case, h=k=l=1. So,

r² = a² [ 3 + 2*( cos30 + cos30 + cos30 ) ]

= a² [3 + 6*(√3/2) ]

= a² [3 + 3√3 ] ≈a²*(3 +5.196) = a²*8.196.

So r = a*sqrt(8.196) ≈ a*2.863.

If the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, then this implies that r =10 = a *2.863.

So a =10 /2.863 ≈3.494 Angstroms.

Ah, that's a different approach.

So if the interatomic distance (r) is 10 Angstroms, then the lattice parameter a is about 3.494 Angstroms.

Now, the problem asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, but the (111) plane's interplanar distance is the same as the distance between adjacent (111) planes, which depends on the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, no. Wait, the interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes in the crystal. For the (111) planes, the distance is the same as the r I calculated for (1,1,1), which is 10 Angstroms. But that can't be right because the interplanar distance is typically smaller than the interatomic distance.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the distance between two points in the lattice with the interplanar spacing.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance d is given by d = a / (sqrt( ... )) as before, but with a being the interatomic distance.

Wait, no, earlier calculation shows that if a is 10, then d is about 3.5. Which is not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me approach it from the definition.

The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes. For the (111) plane, the normal vector is (1,1,1). The distance between two planes is given by the formula:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk \cos \gamma) - 2(hl \cos \beta) - 2(kl \cos \alpha)}} / ( a )

Wait, but this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another way.

Another approach is to note that in a rhombohedral lattice, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral, and the interplanar distance in the reciprocal lattice is related to the structure factor.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to find another formula.

Wait, I found another formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system:

d^2 = (a^2) / [ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl +kl) cos α ]

Wait, with α=30°, and h=k=l=1, this becomes:

d^2 = a^2 / [3 - 2*(3) * cos30 ]

= a^2 / [3 -6*(√3/2) ]

= a^2 / [3 -3√3 ]

But 3√3 ≈5.196, so denominator is 3-5.196 = -2.196. Which is negative. So this can't be correct.

So this must mean that the formula is wrong, or perhaps the sign is opposite.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d^2 = a^2 / [ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl +kl) cos α ]

Which would make the denominator positive.

So with the same numbers:

Denominator=3 + 6*(√3/2)=3+3√3≈8.196.

Then d= a / sqrt(8.196)=a/2.863.

If a is 10, then d≈3.494 Angstroms.

But that doesn't match any option.

But wait, the problem says the 'interatomic distance' is 10 Angstroms. So interatomic distance is the distance between nearest atoms, which in a rhombohedral lattice might not be the same as 'a'.

Ah, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is not along the (1,0,0) direction but along some other vector. Let's compute the nearest neighbor distance.

The distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,1) is sqrt(3a² + 2a² (3 cos30) ), as earlier. Which is a*sqrt(3 + 3√3) ≈ a*2.863.

If the nearest neighbor distance is 10 Angstroms, then 10 = a *2.863 → a=10/2.863≈3.494 Angstroms.

Now, using this a, find the interplanar distance d for (111).

Using the formula:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 3√3) → a=3.494.

So,

d =3.494 / sqrt(3 +3√3) → but wait, sqrt(3 +3√3) = sqrt(3*(1+√3)) ) ≈ sqrt(3*2.732)≈sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So,

d =3.494 / 2.863≈1.22 Angstroms.

Hmm, that's even smaller. Doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I should be using a different approach. Maybe the interplanar distance is the same as the interatomic distance. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is along the (111) vector, making d=10 Angstroms.

But that doesn't seem right, because the interplanar distance is the distance between planes, which is generally smaller than the interatomic distance.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me try looking for the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal.

After some quick checking, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha} }

But since all angles are 30°, and h=k=l=1, this becomes:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) ) = a / sqrt(3 +3√3) ≈ a/2.863.

So, if a is the lattice parameter, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, what is a?

Assuming the nearest neighbor distance is along the (1,1,1) direction, then interatomic distance r is:

r = a * sqrt(3 +3√3) ≈ a *2.863.

So a = r /2.863 ≈10 /2.863≈3.494.

Now, the interplanar distance d is a /2.863 ≈3.494/2.863≈1.22 Angstroms.

But again, that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (1,0,0) direction, so r=a=10 Angstroms.

Then, using the formula, d= a/2.863 ≈3.494 Angstroms.

Still not matching options.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the volume of the unit cell and the relation to the interplanar distance.

The volume of the rhombohedral unit cell is given by V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α ), since all angles are α.

For α=30°, cos α=√3/2≈0.866.

So,

V= a^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(3/4) + 2*(3√3/8) )

= a^3 * sqrt(1 -9/4 + (3√3)/4 )

= a^3 * sqrt( (4/4 -9/4 ) +3√3 /4 )

= a^3 * sqrt( (-5/4) + 3√3/4 )

= a^3 * sqrt( ( -5 +3√3 ) /4 )

= a^3 * ( sqrt( -5 +3√3 ) ) / 2.

Compute sqrt( -5 + 3*1.732 )

= sqrt( -5 +5.196 )

= sqrt(0.196 )≈0.443.

So V ≈ a^3 * 0.443 / 2 = a^3 * 0.2215.

But I'm not sure how this helps.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and need to find another way. Let me think about the options. The options are all around 9 Angstroms.

Wait, the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. The options are 9.08, 8.95, 9.54, 10.05.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the formula and the given parameters.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / (h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )^{1/2}.

But if a is 10, and h=k=l=1, then:

Denominator = 3 + 6*(√3/2) =3 +3√3≈8.196.

So d=10/2.863≈3.494, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = (a sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(3 + 3√3)).

Wait, sqrt(3)=1.732. So 3 +3√3≈3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d = (10 *1.732)/2.863≈17.32/2.863≈6.053 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm. Maybe the correct approach is to use the reciprocal of the plane's normal vector's magnitude.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vector for (111) is given by:

n = (1/a) [ (1,1,1) - ... ] ? No, maybe.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined as:

b1 = (1/a)(1, 1, 1) + something. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance d is given by:

d = 2π / |G|,

where G is the reciprocal lattice vector.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is to be solved using the formula d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk +hl +kl) cos α ), but all angles are 30°, so substituting:

d =10 / sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +3√3 )

=10 / approximately 2.863 → ≈3.494, which isn't among the options.

Wait, but perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length a, and the formula is correct. Then, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, which can't be. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem uses the formula for a cubic system, ignoring the angles. Then, d= a / sqrt(3) ≈10 /1.732≈5.77 Angstroms. Still not matching.

But that's not considering the angles, which are 30 degrees. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe the formula for d is:

d = a/(sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) ) * something involving cos.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to use the general formula for a general hexagonal crystal, but I'm not familiar with that.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * something ). I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the relation between the interplanar distance and the unit cell parameters.

The formula for interplanar distance for a general rhombohedral system is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha} }

Wait, but in this case, since all angles are 30°, and h=k=l=1, this becomes:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 * cos30 )

= a / sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2) )

= a / sqrt(3 +3√3 )

= a / (sqrt(3(1+√3)) )

= a / (sqrt(3) * sqrt(1+√3) )

But perhaps that's not helpful.

Let me compute the denominator numerically.

3 +3√3 ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So, if a is 10, d=10/2.863≈3.494, which isn't an option.

Wait, but the options are all around 9. So perhaps I should take the reciprocal of this value.

But then 1/3.494 is ~0.286. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using a wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which would make d = a * sqrt(3) / sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2) )

= a * 1.732 / sqrt(8.196 )

= a * 1.732 / 2.863 ≈ a *0.604.

So for a=10, d≈6.04 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the given interatomic distance as the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,1), which is 10 Angstroms.

So,

r^2 = a²(3 +3√3 )

So, r= a *sqrt(3+3√3 )=10.

So,

a=10/(sqrt(3+3√3 ))=10/2.863≈3.494 Angstroms.

Now, the interplanar distance is d= a / sqrt(3 +3√3 )= (3.494)/(2.863 )≈1.22 Angstroms.

Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the (111) plane in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are:

b1 = (1,1,1) / ( a^2 * sqrt(3 +3√3) )

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

At this point, I'm stuck because none of the approaches I'm trying are matching the options given. But perhaps I should just proceed with the initial calculation, assuming that the formula I used is correct, and see if any of the options make sense.

Given that a=10, and using the formula d= a / sqrt(3 +3√3 ), which is about 3.494, but the options are around 9, perhaps I have the formula backwards. Maybe the formula is d = a * sqrt(...), instead of dividing.

Wait, if d= a * sqrt(3 +3√3 ), then for a=10, d=10*2.863≈28.63 Angstroms, which is way too big.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a * sqrt(3) / sqrt(3 + 3√3 ), which for a=10 would be:

(10 *1.732 ) /2.863 ≈ (17.32)/2.863≈6.05 Angstroms.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should use the volume formula and calculate the volume, then find d.

But I don't see a direct connection between the volume and the interplanar distance.

Alternative approach: perhaps the interplanar distance is given by the formula for the (111) plane in a cubic system, ignoring the angles. So d= a /√3 ≈10/1.732≈5.77 Angstroms. But that's not close to any option.

Wait, perhaps the angles are so small (30 degrees) that the interplanar distance increases.

Wait, another way: perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula d = a / [ sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) ] multiplied by some factor due to the angles.

But I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look for another angle.

Wait, perhaps the formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, with all angles 30°, and h=k=l=1:

Denominator=3 - 2*3 * (√3/2 )=3 -3√3.

Which is negative, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which gives denominator=3+3√3≈8.196.

So d=10/2.863≈3.494 Angstroms.

Still not matching.

At this point, perhaps the intended answer is option C:9.54 Angstroms, which is approximately 10 / (sqrt(3)) * (something). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula uses the reciprocal of the denominator. So, if the denominator is 8.196, then 1/sqrt(8.196)=0.349, and 10 * 0.349≈3.49 Angstroms.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (a) multiplied by sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + ... ), which could give a larger value.

Wait, for example, if I calculate sqrt(3 +3√3 )=2.863, and multiply a=10 by this, I get 28.63, which is too big.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the inverse of the formula.

But I'm stuck. It seems that none of the approaches I'm taking are leading to an option that matches the given choices. So perhaps I should consider that I made a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator correctly.

Wait, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

With all angles 30°, h=k=l=1,

Denominator=3 - 2( cos30 + cos30 + cos30 )=3 - 6*(√3/2 )=3-3√3≈3-5.196= -2.196. Which is negative, so not possible.

So perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Which gives denominator=3 +6*(√3/2 )=3+3√3≈8.196.

So d=10 / 2.863≈3.494.

But no option matches. So I'm forced to consider that perhaps the given interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter a, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,0), which is sqrt( a^2 + a^2 + 2a^2 cos30 ).

= a * sqrt(2 + 2√3/2 )= a * sqrt(2 +√3 )≈a *1.931.

If this distance is 10 Angstroms, then a=10/1.931≈5.175 Angstroms.

Then, using the formula:

d = a / sqrt(3 +3√3 )≈5.175/2.863≈1.807 Angstroms.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a different approach entirely.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/ (h² +k² +l²) )

But since a=b=c, and angles are 30°, perhaps this is not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d is:

d = (a) / ( sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) )

Which brings us back to same calculation as before.

Given that, and the options not matching, perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance given is the distance between (1,1,1) and (0,0,0), which is r=10 Angstroms.

So,

r² = 3a² + 2a² (cos30 + cos30 + cos30 )

= 3a² + 6a²*(√3/2 )

=3a² +3a²√3

So,

r= a * sqrt(3 +3√3 )

Given r=10,

a=10 / sqrt(3 +3√3 )=10 /2.863≈3.494 Angstroms.

Now, the interplanar distance d for (111) is a / sqrt(3 +3√3 )=3.494/2.863≈1.22 Angstroms.

But again, not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt(3 +3√3 ) →3.494 *2.863≈10 Angstroms, which would explain the interatomic distance. But then the interplanar distance would be 10 Angstroms, which is option D.

But that can't be right because the interplanar distance should be shorter than the interatomic distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is more complex and I'm missing a factor. Maybe the interplanar distance is calculated using the volume.

Wait, but perhaps, instead, considering that the rhombohedral angles cause the planes to be further apart.

After much confusion and calculation, I'm not getting the correct answer, but perhaps the correct option is A)9.08 Angstroms.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the expression 1/d² = (h² +k² +l² )/(a²) - 2(hk cos α +hl cos β + kl cos γ )/(a²)

But with all angles 30°, and a=10.

So,

1/d² = (3)/(10^2) - 2*(3 * cos30 )/(10^2 )

= 3/100 - (6 * (√3/2 )) /100

= 3/100 - (3√3)/100

≈ (3 -5.196)/100= (-2.196)/100 → negative, which is impossible.

Thus, this approach must be wrong.

Perhaps the correct formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l² )/(a²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ )/(a² )

So,

1/d² = 3/100 + (6*(√3/2))/100.

= 3/100 + (3√3)/100.

= (3 +5.196)/100 =8.196/100.

So d=10/sqrt(8.196)≈10/2.863≈3.494.

No, same result.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option C)9.54 Angstroms.

But I'm not sure how to get there.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the calculation was done using a=10 Angstroms, and the formula gives d= a * sqrt(3) / sqrt(3 +3√3 ), which is 10*1.732/2.863≈6.05 Angstroms.

But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) ) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which would be d=10*sqrt(3)/sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2 ))= 10*sqrt(3)/sqrt(3+3√3 )=10*sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3(1+√3)) ))=10*sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3)*sqrt(1+√3))=10/sqrt(1+√3).

Compute 1+√3≈2.732. sqrt(2.732)=1.652.

So d=10/1.652≈6.05 Angstroms.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and have to make an educated guess based on the options. Since the only option close to 3.5 is not present, perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is using the inverse of the denominator.

Wait, denominator is 3 +3√3=8.196.

So, 1/sqrt(8.196)=0.349.

So, a=10, d=10*0.349≈3.49 Angstroms. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is using 1/d² = sum( ... ) and in reciprocal space.

But I'm not reaching any conclusion. Perhaps the intended answer is A)9.08 Angstroms, which is approximately 10 * 0.908.

But I'm not sure.

After trying all possible approaches, I think the correct formula is d= a / sqrt(3 +3√3 ), with a=10, which gives d≈3.494. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that I made a mistake earlier in considering the interatomic distance.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter a, but something else, and the correct approach is to find a such that the nearest neighbor distance is 10, then compute d.

So, let's assume that the nearest neighbor distance is along the (1,1,1) direction, which gives a=10/(sqrt(3 +3√3 ))=10/2.863≈3.494.

Then, using this a, the interplanar distance is:

d =a / sqrt(3 +3√3 )=3.494/2.863≈1.22 Angstroms. Still no.

Alternatively, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along (1,1,0), which has distance sqrt(2a² + 2a² cos30 ), which is a*sqrt(2 +√3 )≈a*1.931.

Setting this to 10: a=10/1.931≈5.175.

Then, d =5.175 / sqrt(3 +3√3 )≈5.175/2.863≈1.807 Angstroms. Still not matching.

I think I've exhausted all approaches and am still not getting an answer that matches the options. Therefore, I must conclude that the correct answer is option A)9.08 Angstroms.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Å and angles \(\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ\), the following steps were considered:

1. **Understanding the Crystal Structure**: A rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal (\(a = b = c\)) and all angles equal (\(\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ\)). The interplanar distance \(d_{hkl}\) is calculated using the formula:

   \[
   d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}}
   \]

   For the (111) plane, \(h = k = l = 1\).

2. **Substituting Values**: Substituting \(h = k = l = 1\) and \(\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), the denominator becomes:

   \[
   \sqrt{3 + 6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \sqrt{3 + 3\sqrt{3}}
   \]

   Numerically, \(3 + 3\sqrt{3} \approx 8.196\), so \(\sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863\).

3. **Interatomic Distance and Lattice Parameter**: The problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Å. Assuming this corresponds to the lattice parameter \(a\), the interplanar distance is:

   \[
   d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3 + 3\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.494 \, \text{Å}
   \]

   However, this result does not match any of the provided options.

4. **Revisiting the Interatomic Distance**: If the interatomic distance corresponds to the distance between (1,1,1) and (0,0,0), the relationship is:

   \[
   r = a \cdot \sqrt{3 + 3\sqrt{3}}
   \]

   Solving for \(a\) when \(r = 10 \, \text{Å}\):

   \[
   a = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3 + 3\sqrt{3}}} \approx \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.494 \, \text{Å}
   \]

   Using this \(a\) in the formula for \(d_{111}\):

   \[
   d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3 + 3\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{3.494}{2.863} \approx 1.22 \, \text{Å}
   \]

   This result is also inconsistent with the options.

5. **Alternative Interpretations**: Various other approaches were considered, including different definitions of the interatomic distance and adjustments to the formula. However, none yielded a result that matched the provided options.

6. **Final Conclusion**: After extensive calculations and considerations, none of the derived values matched the given options. Based on the closest plausible reasoning, the most reasonable answer appears to be **A) 9.08 Å**, though the exact derivation remains unclear.

Answer: A
