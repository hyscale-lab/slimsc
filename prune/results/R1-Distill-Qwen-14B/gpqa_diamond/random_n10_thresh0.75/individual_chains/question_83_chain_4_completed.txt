Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, with various pH values.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, the reaction should form acetate ions and water. The reaction equation would be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

Now, the initial solution is made by diluting 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid here.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So for the initial acetic acid: 0.05 M in 0.02 liters (20 cm³). Moles = M × V = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³, so the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you mix 20 cm³ of 0.05 M with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration is (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04. Let me calculate that again: 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001 moles, and 0.04 L is 0.04. So 0.001 / 0.04 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, for the titration, we're using 0.1 M NaOH. So the first step is to find the equivalence point. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 moles. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So that's when 25% of the equivalence volume has been added. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. Let me confirm that: 25% of 10 is 2.5, yes.

So, at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let's find moles of NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1, this means 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized, forming acetate ions.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, so after adding 2.5 cm³, which is 0.00025 moles of NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed would be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume at this point isn't just the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³. Wait, original solution is 40 cm³, then adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH solution. So the total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, to find the pH at this point, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

First, find pKa. Given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.333. So log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. That's approximately 4.26. So the pH at 25% is around 4.26.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I should redo the calculations with exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to compute the ratio.

Wait, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025) / (0.00075) ) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.33333) = -0.4771. So pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.2559. So about 4.26.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 4.26; 8.52.

Other options have different first values. So the first pH is about 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, the solution will be basic. The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water.

So, the concentration of acetate ions comes from the moles of NaOH added. At equivalence, we added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.001 moles. The total volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³=0.05 L. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate (CH3COO^-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So, it will hydrolyze according to:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.

So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the ICE table.

Initial: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M, [CH3COOH] = 0, [OH^-] = 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kb is small, x is negligible).

So Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02.

x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ about 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, none have the equivalence point at ~9.02. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the concentrations.

Wait, at equivalence, the solution is 0.001 moles of acetate in 0.05 L, so 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. That's correct.

So [CH3COO^-] is 0.02, so Kb = x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14-4.98=9.02.

But the options don't have 9.02 as an equivalence point. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → equivalence pH is 8.52.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92.

Hmm, none match 9.02.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the initial volume after adding NaOH is incorrect. Wait, the initial volume was 40 cm³ (after mixing 20 +20). Then adding 10 cm³ at equivalence, so total 50 cm³. So 0.05 L.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when you add NaOH, which is a strong base, it reacts completely with the acetic acid. So in the equivalence solution, the concentration of acetate is (0.001 mol) in 0.05 L → 0.02 M.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution uses the formula for buffer solutions, but at equivalence, it's a solution of acetate, so we can use the formula for weak base.

The Kb is (Kw)/(Ka) = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈5.405e-10.

Then, the hydrolysis reaction is as before.

But perhaps I should compute [OH-] more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation:

OH- concentration is sqrt(Kb * C). So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So pOH is log(1/1.04e-5) → let me compute it.

Wait, pOH is -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04e-5) = log(1.04) + log(1e-5) → log(1.04) is about 0.017, so 0.017 -5 = -4.983. So pOH is 4.983, so pH is 14 -4.983 = 9.017. Approximately 9.02.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the equivalence pH is 8.52 as in option A. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in determining the moles. Let me recheck.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Correct.

When diluted to 40 cm³, concentration is 0.025 M. Correct.

Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume at equivalence is (0.001) / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. Correct.

So the total volume at equivalence is 40 +10=50 cm³=0.05 L.

So moles of acetate is 0.001, so concentration is 0.02 M. Correct.

So why am I getting pH 9.02 when the options don't have that?

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the equivalence point isn't after adding 10 cm³. Or perhaps the initial dilution affects it differently.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the dilution again. Wait, when you add 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, the concentration becomes 0.025 M, correct. So 0.025 M.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation after adding NaOH. Wait, no, the calculation for the equivalence point seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial solution's pH is different and affects the equivalence point. Hmm, but no, wait, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, so it's all acetate.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the pH at equivalence. Let me try using the exact expression without approximation.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced.

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

But perhaps I should set it up without the approximation.

So:

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02, so x² = Kb * 0.02 → x= sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → same as before.

So pH is 9.02.

Hmm. But none of the options have 9.02. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52.

B)3.17;6.73.

C)4.73;7.00.

D)4.57;6.92.

So none have 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the pH at 25% titration.

Wait, let me re-calculate that.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So, since it's a 1:1 reaction, 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized, producing 0.00025 moles of acetate.

The total volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) +2.5 cm³ =42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = (0.001 - 0.00025) / 0.0425 = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is 4.733.

[A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.333.

log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈4.733 -0.477 =4.256. So approx 4.26. So the first part is 4.26, which matches option A and D.

Wait, option A's first value is 4.26, and option D is 4.57.

Wait, but earlier I thought option A's equivalence point is 8.52, which doesn't match my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the equivalence point calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the solution after equivalence is not just the acetate, but maybe considering other factors. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is not just the acetate ion, but perhaps the solution includes excess OH- from the NaOH. Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, so no excess OH-; the solution is just acetate.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should calculate the pH using the exact H-H equation, but perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, let me recompute Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈4.733.

Kw =1e-14 → Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10. Correct.

So, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M. So the Kb expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] → [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5.

pOH is about 4.98 → pH ≈9.02.

But the options don't have 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of acetate.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the moles.

At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001, from the initial 0.001 moles of acetic acid. Total volume is 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial concentration after dilution is different. Let me recheck that.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles =0.05 *0.02 =0.001.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the pH at 25% of the equivalence point, but I calculated 25% of the volume, not 25% of the moles.

Wait, let me see: 25% titration means 25% of the moles needed for equivalence, not 25% of the volume. Because the volume of NaOH needed depends on the concentration.

Wait, wait, no. No, the 25% titration refers to 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence.

Wait, no. No, in titration, when they say 25% titration, it usually refers to 25% of the volume required to reach the equivalence point has been added. So earlier calculation is correct.

But perhaps the problem is that when I add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 42.5 cm³, but perhaps I should calculate the concentrations more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Let me recalculate the pH at 25% titration again.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 mol.

Moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume: 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

Concentration CH3COOH: 0.00075 /0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Concentration CH3COO^-: 0.00025 /0.0425 ≈0.005882 M.

H-H equation: pH = pKa + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) ) = 4.733 + log(0.3333)

Log(0.3333)= -0.4771.

So pH=4.733-0.4771=4.2559 → 4.26. So the first pH is 4.26.

So looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. The equivalence point is 8.52 according to option A.

But earlier calculation gave 9.02. So I'm getting conflicting results.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using a different approach. Perhaps I should set up the equation for the hydrolysis of acetate correctly.

Wait, perhaps using the same approach as before:

CH3COO^- reacts with water to produce CH3COOH and OH^-. The Kb is 5.405e-10.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M CH3COO^-.

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 -x.

[CH3COOH] = x.

[OH^-] = x.

So, Kb = x^2 / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x^2 =5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= ~1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the problem is that I didn't consider that the solution is a buffer, but that's only for before equivalence.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the equivalence point. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial solution is not 0.025 M but different.

Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is 0.001 mol. Diluting to 40 cm³ gives 0.025 M.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the NaOH is 0.1 M, which is a higher concentration. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equals moles of acetic acid.

Moles of NaOH needed: 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed: 0.001 /0.1 = 0.01 L=10 cm³. So, correct.

So, why is the equivalence point pH not matching any options?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using Kb for acetate, but perhaps I should consider that the solution is a strong base's salt and that the pH calculation may involve more steps.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the acetate concentration is incorrect.

Wait, at equivalence, the solution is 0.001 mol of CH3COO^- in 50 cm³ (40+10=50 cm³=0.05 L). So [CH3COO^-] =0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for Kb.

Wait, let me compute Kb again.

Ka =1.85e-5.

Kw=1e-14.

Kb= Kw/Ka = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not just the acetate but also the presence of sodium ions. But sodium is a spectator ion and doesn't affect the pH.

Hmm, I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the equivalence pH is around 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in another step.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial dilution is different. Let me recheck the initial dilution.

Diluting 20 cm³ of 0.05 M with 20 cm³ of water.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.05 * 0.02=0.001 mol.

Total volume:20+20=40 cm³.

Concentration:0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the equivalence point calculation using exact numbers without approximations.

The exact expression is:

Kb = x² / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is very small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=√(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5. Same as before.

So, [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is that the initial solution's pH is different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial solution's pH affects the equivalence point. No, equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, so the solution is determined by the acetate ion's hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for other options where the first pH is 4.26 and the equivalence is lower. But looking at the options, only option A has 4.26 as the first pH. But its equivalence is 8.52.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that at equivalence point, the solution is a buffer of acetate and acetic acid. No, that's not correct because at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact formula without approximation.

So, Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Let me write the equation as x²=5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5. So same as before.

But perhaps the approximation isn't good enough. Let me check if x is significant.

x=1.04e-5 →0.02 is 2e-2.

So x/0.02 =5.2e-4, which is 0.052%. So the approximation holds. So the pH is 9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps the problem lies elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution is not 40 cm³. Wait, no. 20+20=40.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the initial pH of the acetic acid solution, but that doesn't affect the equivalence point.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for other approaches.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the equivalence point but about another point. No, it says equivalence point.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I used the initial concentration after dilution as 0.025 M, but perhaps I should have used a different approach.

Wait, another thought: after adding NaOH, the solution's volume changes, so the concentrations change accordingly.

But I think I accounted for that.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I considered the solution at 25% titration as a buffer when in fact it's not. Wait, no, because some of the acid has been neutralized, so it's a buffer solution.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that after adding 2.5 cm³, the total volume is 42.5 cm³, but perhaps I should recalculate the concentrations more accurately.

Wait, [CH3COOH]=0.00075 mol /0.0425 L=0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-]=0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

H-H equation:

pH = pKa + log (0.005882/0.017647) → log(0.3333)= -0.477.

pH=4.733−0.477=4.256 →4.26.

So first part is correct. So looking at the options, the only option with 4.26 is option A, which says equivalence pH is 8.52.

But I calculated 9.02, which is not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should use the same approach for the equivalence point as for the 25% point, but using the exact expression.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, but perhaps I should use a different Kb value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Ka=1.85e-5. So Kb=Kw/Ka=1e-14/1.85e-5.

1e-14 /1.85e-5= (1/1.85) *1e-9 = 0.5405e-9=5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the concentration. Perhaps the concentration is 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula pH = ½ (pKa + pKb) but not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution's pH can be found using the formula for a weak base.

pOH = ½ (pKa + pKw - pKb).

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute it directly.

Wait, let me compute pOH again.

[OH^-]=1.04e-5 M.

pOH= -log(1.04e-5).

Log(1.04)=0.017 → log(1.04e-5)=0.017 -5= -4.983 → pOH=4.983 → pH=14-4.983=9.017.

Still, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial moles.

Wait, the original solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles are 0.05 M *0.02 L=0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, 0.001 mol of acetate are present. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is not considering that the NaOH solution is 20 cm³ in total volume. No, no, the NaOH volume is 10 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH at equivalence point using the exact quadratic equation without approximation.

So, Kb =5.405e-10.

Equation: x²/(0.02 -x) )=5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, approx same as before.

But perhaps I should solve it exactly.

Equation: x² =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

x²=1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Bring all terms to left:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ]/(2a).

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: b² +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.

Compute:

(5.405e-10)^2 = (approx 2.92e-19).

4*1.081e-11=4.324e-11=4.324e-11.

So discriminant is 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible compared to 4.3e-11).

So sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/(2).

Only positive root makes sense.

x=( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 )/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514.

Ah! So pH at equivalence is approximately 8.51, which is about 8.52. So option A's equivalence pH is 8.52.

Wait a minute—this changes everything. I must have made a mistake earlier in assuming x was 1e-5, but with the quadratic, x is 3.288e-6, which is about three times smaller than what I thought earlier.

Wait, wait, why is this different? Because when I used the approximation, I neglected the x in the denominator, but in reality, the x isn't negligible. Let me see: if x is 3.288e-6, then 0.02 -x is ≈0.0199967, which is very close to 0.02. So why is the quadratic approach giving a different result?

Wait, perhaps because the initial approximation was incorrect. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic formula. Let me recompute it.

Wait, in the equation x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0,

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= b² -4ac.

Wait, wait, no, when you have the equation ax² +bx +c=0, the discriminant is b²-4ac.

Wait, in our case, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So D = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11).

Compute:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.92e-19.

-4 *1*(-1.081e-11) =4.324e-11.

So D=2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11 (since 2.9e-19 is negligible).

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= approximately 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/(2).

Taking the positive root:

x=(6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6/2=3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=14-5.486=8.514 →≈8.51.

So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.51, which rounds to 8.52. So option A, which has 4.26 and 8.52, fits.

So earlier mistake was assuming x was 1e-5, but the correct x is ~3.288e-6, which gives a pH of 8.52.

So the correct option is A: pH 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, followed by titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### Step 1: Initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution
The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}.
\]

The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 2: Equivalence point calculation
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH required are equal to the moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The volume of NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At the equivalence point, the solution contains 0.001 mol of acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) in a total volume of:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 3: pH at the equivalence point
The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. Its hydrolysis in water is governed by:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_b = \frac{[\text{OH}^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Let \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \implies x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-].
\]

Substituting \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \):

\[
x^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydroxide ion concentration is \( [\text{OH}^-] = 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \). The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{[\text{OH}^-]} = -\log{(3.288 \times 10^{-6})} \approx 5.486.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.486 = 8.514 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Step 4: pH at 25% titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (10.00 cm³) has been added, which is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0025 \, \text{L}.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1, 0.00025 mol of acetic acid is neutralized, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ions} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log{\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}}.
\]

The \( \text{p}K_a \) is:

\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log{(1.85 \times 10^{-5})} \approx 4.733.
\]

Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log{\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}} = 4.733 + \log{(0.333)} \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values match the data in **Option A**.
