Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that. Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system in Joules, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm. So first, I remember that electric potential energy between point charges is what's being considered here. Since all the particles are identical and have the same charge, this must involve calculating the potential energy between each pair of charges.

Wait, but wait a second. The 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the 13th. Also, the 12 charges are arranged in some way, but the problem doesn't specify their arrangement relative to each other. Oh, but wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So maybe the arrangement of the 12 charges relative to each other affects the potential energy.

Wait, but wait, no. Since all the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, their positions relative to each other might vary, but maybe the problem simplifies things by assuming they are all at the same distance from P and perhaps in some symmetric arrangement. So maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P. But wait, that can't be all because each of the 12 charges would also interact with each other. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

Wait, but that's a lot of terms. So let's break it down. The system consists of 13 charges. Charge 13 is fixed at P. Charges 1-12 are each at 2 meters from P. Each of these 12 charges is 2e, so each of them is a point charge.

The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But since the charges are identical and the system is isolated, the total potential energy arises from two contributions: each of the
