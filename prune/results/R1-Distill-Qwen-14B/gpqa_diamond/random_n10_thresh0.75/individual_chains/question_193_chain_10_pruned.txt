Okay, I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. So the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, so the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5. But I'm not sure about how parallax relates to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Parallax (plx) equals 1 over distance (r), right? So plx = 1/r, which means r = 1/plx. 

So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, I can substitute plx with 1/r. Let's see: 1/(plx)^5 becomes (r)^5. Because plx is 1/r, so (1/(plx))^5 would be r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm getting the substitution right. The original relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So substituting plx with 1/r, since plx = 1/r, then N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. 1 divided by (1/r)^5 is the same as (r)^5, because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1/(1/r^5) is r^5. So yes, N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Hmm, so maybe it's about the differential number of stars with respect to distance. Like, how many stars are there at a particular distance interval. Or perhaps it's the rate of stars with respect to distance. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the way to approach this is to express the number of stars as a function of distance and then find how it scales. So N = k * (1/(plx)^5), where k is a constant. Since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N = k * (r^5). 

Wait, but that would imply that the number of stars increases with r^5. But wait, wait. Wait, no, higher distance would mean lower parallax, right? Because when you look further away, the parallax is smaller. So if the number of stars goes as 1/plx^5, and plx is small (because r is large), then 1/plx^5 would be a very large number. So,
