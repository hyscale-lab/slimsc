Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's read it again. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane with eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So I think the operator P itself would be the sum of these components multiplied by the respective direction cosines of the unit vector n. Because in quantum mechanics, the operator for a component along an arbitrary direction is the dot product of the vector operator with the direction vector.

Right, so let me denote the direction vector n as having components (l, 0, m) because it's in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. So n = (l, 0, m), and since it's a unit vector, l² + m² =1. 

But wait, the operator P is along the direction n, so the operator would be P = l P_x + m P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero, so the Py term doesn't contribute.

Each of P_x, P_y, and P_z is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a Pauli matrix. Let me write down each component:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P along n is:

P = l * P_x + m * P_z 

Substituting the matrices:

P = (ħ/2) * [ l * [[0,1],[1,0]] + m * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that:

The matrix for P becomes:

Top-left element: (ħ/2)(m)

Top-right: (ħ/2)(l)

Bottom-left: (ħ/2)(l)

Bottom-right: (ħ/2)(-m)

So P is:

(ħ/2) * [ [m, l], [l, -m] ]

Wait, no. Let me re
