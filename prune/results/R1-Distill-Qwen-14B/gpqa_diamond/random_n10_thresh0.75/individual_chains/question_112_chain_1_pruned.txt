Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so Sz. So the state is a linear combination of these basis states.

First, the question is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and zero otherwise. Oh wait, so what does that matrix look like? Since it's a 2x2 matrix (since we're dealing with up and down), the operator A would have zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal.

Wait, so the matrix would look like:
[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0  ]

Is that correct? Because for i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2, and diagonal (i=j) is zero.

So what's this operator? Hmm. Let me think about spin operators. The Pauli matrices come to mind. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? And the Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Pauli Z is diagonal. But this operator's matrix isn't any of the Pauli matrices directly, but maybe it's proportional to one.

Alternatively, the operator could be (hbar/2) times the Pauli X or Y matrix. Wait, because for A, the elements are zero on diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. So if I take (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]], then each off-diagonal element becomes hbar/2. That fits. So the operator A is (hbar/2) * σ_x. Because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the matrix representation matches.

So the operator A is proportional to the Pauli X operator. Therefore, the eigenstates of A will be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, just scaled by a factor.

Wait, but wait. The eigenstates of σ_x are
