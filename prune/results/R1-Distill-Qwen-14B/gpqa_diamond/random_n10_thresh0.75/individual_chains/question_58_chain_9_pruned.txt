Okay, so I've got this question here about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like when calculations give infinite results which don't make physical sense. The idea is to introduce a cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, then take the cutoff to infinity in the end.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me think about each option. Starting with option D, Classical Electrodynamics. I remember that classical theories don't really deal with the same issues as quantum ones because they're not quantized. So in classical ED, you don't have things like infinities from loop diagrams because you aren't calculating probabilities amplitudes or anything like that. So maybe classical ED doesn't need regularization. But wait, am I mixing things up? Because regularization is a quantum field theory tool. So if a theory is classical, it doesn't require regularization.

Wait, but the other options are quantum theories. So let's look at those. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory. I remember that in QED, when you calculate certain processes, like the electron self-energy or the vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. So you need a method like regularization to handle that. So QED does require regularization, which means option C is not the answer.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. Since it's a quantum field theory, it probably has similar issues. Wait
