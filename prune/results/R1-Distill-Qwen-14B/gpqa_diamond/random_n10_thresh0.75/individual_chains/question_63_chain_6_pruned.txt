Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmmm, I remember that in such models, the molecule can be in different energy states which involve both rotational and vibrational modes. The question is about what happens when a photon is absorbed, causing the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the question specifies that the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state.

But wait, what's the energy structure for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model? Oh right, the energy levels are quantized and given by the formula E = (rotational energy) + (vibrational energy). The rotational energy is related to the rotational quantum number J, and the vibrational energy depends on the vibrational quantum number ν.

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by E = B J (J + 1) - D J² (J +1)^2 + ... but wait, maybe that's for the rigid rotor. Oh, but the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe the energy includes centrifugal distortion. But I'm not sure if that's important here. Let me think.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. For a diatomic, the fundamental state usually refers to the state where both J and ν are at their lowest values. So J=0 and ν=0. So the ground state is the lowest rotational and vibrational state.

But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state. Now, what's the next state with the lowest possible energy? That would be either increasing J by 1 (so J=1, ν=0) or increasing ν by 1 (ν=1, J=0). Which of these has lower energy?

I think that the vibrational energy is usually much higher than the rotational energy. The vibrational energy for ν=1 is like (3/2)ħω, whereas the rotational energy for J=1 is B(1)(2) = 2B. But I'm not sure about the actual values here.

Wait, the problem gives the angular frequency ω as 4e14 rad/s. Let me calculate the vibrational energy quantum. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vibrational = (ν + 1/2)ħω. So for ν=0, it's (1/2)ħω, and for ν=1, it's (3/2)ħω.

The rotational energy levels are E_rotational = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by (h²)/(8 π² μ R²), where μ is the reduced mass, right?

So I need to calculate both possible transitions and see which has a lower energy.

Wait, the question is about the photon's momentum. Since the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the initial and final states. So the momentum of the photon is related to its energy via p = E/c, since for photons, E = pc.

Wait, no. Wait, the photon's momentum p is equal to E/c. Because E = pc for photons. So once I find the energy difference ΔE, I can find p by dividing ΔE by c.

So my plan is:
