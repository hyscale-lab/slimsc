Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let's try to think this through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh, and the photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a gas. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). So, since the problem is about the same element (iron) in two different stars, I think the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) would be the same for each transition in both stars. Or wait, maybe the energy levels are the same, but the excitation depends on temperature.

Wait, the question says the energy difference (E) is 1.38e-23 J. So, E = E_i - E_j, where i is the higher energy level and j is the lower one. So the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, meaning n_i for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n_i1 / n_j1 is (n_i2 / n_j2) * 2.

Wait, no. Let me read again. "Iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, the population in the excited state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So the ratio (n_i1 / n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2). 

Alternatively, maybe (n_i1 / n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2). Since both are in LTE, I can set up the Boltzmann equation for each star.

So for each star, (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-E/(k*T)). But assuming that the energy levels are the same for both stars, so E is the same for both. Also, the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for each transition in each star. So for
