Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. But let's take it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the substitution reaction, like maybe a hydrohalogenation or something else. Or wait, wait—red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydroxy group conversion. Oh right! If there's a hydroxyl group (like in an alcohol), reacting with red phosphorus and HI would probably lead to a substitution where the hydroxyl is replaced by an iodide. Because HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. So if the compound has an -OH group, that reaction would replace it with an -I.

Now, looking at the data for Compound X. The IR and NMR data are given. Let's start by analyzing the IR first. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, that usually indicates O-H stretching (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid), or maybe an amine. But looking at the other peaks: 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak that suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together, maybe it's a substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group and an -OH group.

Wait, but wait, 1720 cm-1 is a bit high for an aromatic ketone. Wait, no, aromatic ketones can have around 1680-1720. Hmm. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be in the broad region, but the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1. Oh, but there's another peak at 1720, which might be a ketone.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad. Let me check the NMR to see if that makes sense.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, if it's an -OH in a carboxylic acid, that would be a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But this is at 10.5 and broad singlet, which might be an aldehyde. Wait, but aldehyde is usually around 9.5-10.5, and a singlet if it's only one H. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak around 10-12, but also maybe in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 is an exchange with D2O, but maybe that's more for amines.

Wait, looking again: The NMR shows 10.5 (bs, 1H). Could that be an aldehyde? But aldehydes are usually
