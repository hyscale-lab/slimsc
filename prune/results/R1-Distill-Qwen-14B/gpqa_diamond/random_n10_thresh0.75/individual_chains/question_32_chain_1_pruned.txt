Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC colliders deal with heavy ions moving at relativistic speeds, so I think I'll need to use some relativity formulas here.

The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

So the nucleus is Li-6, and I need to find the total energy when it's moving at 0.96c. I think the total energy in relativity is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Oh right, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First, I should calculate gamma. Since v is 0.96c, let me plug that into the gamma formula. So v = 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². Let me compute (0.96)^2. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. So the square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1, because 0.28 *3.5714 ≈ 1. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but let me be precise. Maybe I should calculate sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. Let me see, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 exactly. So no problem, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is mc². The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, but I think a more accurate way is to use the atomic mass. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the molar mass and find the mass of one nucleus.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.014 atomic mass units (u). Wait, I remember that each proton is about 1.007276 u, each neutron is about 1.008665 u, but perhaps a better approach is to look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, I can approximate the mass of Li-6 as
