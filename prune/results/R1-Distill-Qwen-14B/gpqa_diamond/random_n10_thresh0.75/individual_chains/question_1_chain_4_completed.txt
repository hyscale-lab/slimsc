Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. 

Hmm, that's 6.59e-7 eV. Approximately 7e-7 eV. 

Now for the second state, Δt2 =1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2 = (1.055e-34)/(1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. 
Convert to eV: 1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.59e-8 eV. 

So the uncertainties are about 6.6e-7 eV and 6.6e-8 eV for states 1 and 2, respectively.

Wait, but the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties. Because if the actual energy difference is smaller than their combined uncertainty, we can't distinguish them — the measurements would overlap in uncertainty.

So the required ΔE should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Let's compute that.

ΔE1 is ~6.6e-7 eV, ΔE2 is ~6.6e-8 eV. Adding them together gives roughly 7.26e-7 eV. 

So, the energy difference must be larger than approximately 7e-7 eV. Now, let's look at the options.

Option A: 1e-9 eV → that's 0.001e-6 eV, which is way smaller than 7e-7. So this is too small.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller, definitely too small.

Option C:1e-4 eV → which is 1e-4, which is 1e3 times larger than 7e-7. So this would be clearly distinguishable.

Option D:1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6 eV, which is smaller than 7e-7. So not enough.

Wait, but wait a second. The calculation I did earlier was for the uncertainty in each state's energy. But when considering the energy difference between E1 and E2, perhaps I should consider Δ(E2 - E1) which would be the absolute energy difference. But the uncertainty in this difference would come from the uncertainty in E1 and E2. 

Wait, I think the correct approach is to model the energy difference as ΔE = E2 - E1. The uncertainty in ΔE would be the sum of the uncertainties in E1 and E2, since E2 and E1 are measured with their own uncertainties. So, if the actual ΔE is much larger than the uncertainty in ΔE, then we can clearly distinguish the two states. 

So the uncertainty in ΔE is ΔE1 + ΔE2, which is about 7.26e-7 eV as I calculated before. So the energy difference must be greater than this value. 

Looking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 7e-7. So option C is the correct answer. 

Wait, but looking back at the options: option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's 1e4 times larger than 7e-7. So definitely, this would allow clear distinction.

The other options are way too small. So the correct choice is C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The energy uncertainty \( \Delta E \) for each state is inversely proportional to its lifetime \( \Delta t \). For two states with lifetimes \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties in their energies are:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]

\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting these to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]

\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the actual energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be significantly larger than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is even smaller than Option A and also insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \), which is \( 10^3 \) times larger than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient for clear distinction.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 0.01 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it is the only energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two states.
