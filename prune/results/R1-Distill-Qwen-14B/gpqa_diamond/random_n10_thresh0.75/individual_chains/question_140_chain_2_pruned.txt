Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius, so room temperature. 

Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 atoms of oxygen. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's noted that X and its analog are used as reagents, which might mean something like a strong base or oxidizing agent.

The question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Oh, and if there are multiple isotopes, sum all their masses. So I need to figure out which elements are in X and calculate their atomic masses.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. The reaction is violent, which makes me think of something reactive, like a strong base reacting with an acid. Or maybe a metal reacting with something to produce gas. 

The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, each molecule of W has same number of n and p. Let's think about possible gases. For example, CO2 has 12 protons (carbon) and 16 oxygen, but its molecule has 22 neutrons (12 from C, but wait, carbon's atomic number is 6, so each C has 6 protons, and each O has 8. So in CO2, each molecule has 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons? For C-12 isotope, 6 neutrons, O-16 has 8. So each CO2 molecule would have 6 + 8*2 = 22 neutrons. So protons=22, neutrons=22. So W could be CO2.

Wait, but CO2 is a gas when produced? Or maybe another gas. Alternatively, H2O is a liquid, but maybe CO2 is a gas here.

Wait, wait, if W is CO2, that suggests that maybe Y is a carbonate, but then X could be an acid. Alternatively, if Y is something else.

Alternatively, another gas with equal protons and neutrons per molecule. Let's think - gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So the molecule's total protons equals total neutrons.

Let me think of possible gases—like H2, but H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons (if it's hydrogen, H-1). So H2 would have 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not equal. What about O2? O has 8 protons, each O has 8 neutrons if it's O-16. So O2 would have 16 protons (8*2) and 16 neutrons (8*2). So O2 is a possibility. But O2 is diatomic, but in reaction with what?

Wait, another possibility is CH4. But CH4 has 6 protons (from C) + 4*1 (H) = 10 protons. Each molecule has 6+4=10 protons. Neutrons: C-12 has 6, each H has 0, so total 6. So 6 neutrons. Not equal, so no.

What about NH3? Each molecule has 14 protons (N has 7, H has 1 each: 7 +3 =10? Wait no, N is 7, H is 1 per, so 7+3=10? Wait, NH3 is N with 7 protons, 3 H's each with 1. So total 10 protons. Neutrons: N is 7, so for N-14, 7 neutrons. H is 0. So total neutrons is 7. So 10 protons vs 7 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, maybe CO, carbon monoxide. Each molecule has 6 (C) + 8 (O) protons =14. Neutrons: C-12 has 6, O-16 has 8. So 6+8=14. So CO has 14 protons and 14 neutrons per molecule? Oh wait, wait, that's per molecule. So yes, CO would have same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. So W could be CO.

But CO is a gas, yes. So what reaction produces CO? Maybe oxidation of something. Or maybe decomposition.

Wait, another possibility is H2O. Each molecule has 2 H (1 each) and 1 O (8), so 2+8=10 protons. Neutrons: H has 0, O-16 has 8. So total neutrons 8. So 10 protons vs 8 neutrons. Not equal, so no.

Wait, maybe CH3Cl? Not sure. Alternatively, let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, G releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. So B is a solid near 0 degrees C. Common substances with that melting point—water melts at 273 K (0C), but B's melting point is very close, so perhaps B is water. But if G is a precipitate, maybe it's a carbonate or something.

Wait, but B is released when G is heated. So G might be a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into B (like CO2 and something else). Wait, if G is a carbonate, heating might release CO2. But earlier we thought W could be CO2.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide. If X is a strong base, like NaOH, reacting with an acid Y (like H2SO4), but that would produce a sulfate and water, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think of the reaction. X reacts with Y violently, releasing gas W, and forming precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B.

If X is a metal and Y is an acid, then the reaction would produce hydrogen gas, a salt, and perhaps a precipitate if the acid is in excess. But if Y is a carbonate, and X is an acid, then the reaction would produce CO2, water, and a salt (precipitate maybe).

Wait, for example, if X is HCl (a strong acid) and Y is NaHCO3
