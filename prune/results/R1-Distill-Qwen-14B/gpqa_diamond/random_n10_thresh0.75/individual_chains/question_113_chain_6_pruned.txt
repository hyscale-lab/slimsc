Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with C6H and varying O and H counts.

First, the data given:

1. FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. The broadness suggests it's not an aliphatic alcohol because those are usually broader. Wait, but wait—vinyl groups are also in the NMR, so maybe it's something like an ester or a ketone with an -OH group? Or perhaps a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have very broad O-H stretches.

But wait, the FTIR also shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated, or an aromatic ring with some substitution. Wait, what do those regions correspond to?

- 1700 cm^-1 is typically a carbonyl, like in ketones, aldehydes, esters, carboxylic acids, etc.
- 1650 cm^-1 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in an aromatic ester or a conjugated carbonyl, or maybe an amide? But there's no mention of amide in the options. So maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, like an enone. Or possibly an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl, like in a substituted benzene with a carbonyl group attached.

Wait, but the NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's on a double bond, so that suggests the presence of a double bond, maybe an alkene. So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond.

So combining that, the IR shows a broad O-H (like a carboxylic acid, maybe), a strong C=O, and another peak that might be conjugated.

Wait, but wait—if the broad peak is O-H, that could also be an alcohol. But aliphatic alcohols have broad but maybe not as intense peaks. Carboxylic acids have very strong and broad O-H stretches because the -OH is more acidic and tends to form hydrogen bonds. So maybe that's a carboxylic acid.

But let me think about the options. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

So let's consider each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be a diol, ester, or a carboxylic acid with another O-containing group.

Option B: C6H10O. Maybe a cyclic ether or an alcohol with a double bond (like an alkene). But the IR doesn't show a strong C-O stretch for an ether. But the broad peak in IR could be an alcohol.

Option C: C6H10O2. Could be an ester (like methyl
