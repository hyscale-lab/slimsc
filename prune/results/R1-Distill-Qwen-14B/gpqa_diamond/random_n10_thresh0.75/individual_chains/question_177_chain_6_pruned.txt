Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but I'll try to remember the formulas involved.

So, the problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, the question is about luminosity, so maybe the mass part isn't directly relevant unless it's affecting something else. I'll keep that in mind but focus on the luminosity part.

The stars' brightness peaks at the same wavelengths. Oh, right! That's Wien's Law. Wien's Law says that the wavelength where a black body radiates most intensely is inversely proportional to its temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but then the question says they computed the luminosities based on black body radiation. Luminosity for a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, right? Where R is radius and T is temperature, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So since both have the same temperature, the luminosity ratio would depend only on the radius squared. Because L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1=T2, the ratio becomes (R1/R2)^2.

Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Plugging into the ratio: (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2? But wait, that's the initial thought. But wait, the options have some values around 2.23 to 2.35. Hmm, 2.25 is option A. But wait, I might be missing something.

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, right! Because stars can have Doppler shifts due to their velocities. So their observed wavelengths would be affected by their velocities. But wait, earlier I thought the peak wavelengths are the same, which was determined by spectroscopy. So the observed wavelengths are the same, but the actual emitted wavelengths (before considering velocity) would differ because of Doppler shift.

Wait, so perhaps the star's actual temperature isn't what it seems because of their velocities. Let me think. Because when a star is moving towards or away from us, the wavelengths are shifted. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; moving away, redshifted.

So, the observed wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity over the speed of light. Oh, but wait, I'm getting confused. The Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift is: λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r/c), but only for non-relativistic speeds. Alternatively, the relativistic formula is more precise but perhaps for velocities like 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), so 700 is 0.002333c, so maybe non-relativistic approximation would work.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But the actual emitted peak wavelengths (which would be based on their temperatures) might be different.

Hmm, so the stars have the same observed peak wavelength, but their emitted wavelengths could be different due to Doppler shift.

Wait, let me rephrase. The peak wavelength observed is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r/c), assuming v_r is positive when moving away. So if a star is moving towards us, v_r is negative, leading to a blueshift (shorter λ). If moving away, longer λ.

But in the problem, both stars appear to have the same λ_peak (as observed). So for each star, λ_obs is the same. So for Star_1, which has v_r =0, λ_obs = λ_1. For Star_2, which has v_r=700 km/s, λ_obs = λ_2 * (1 + v_r2/c) = λ_1.

Wait, but according to Wien's law, λ_peak is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ_peak = b / T, with b the Wien displacement constant.

So for Star_1, λ_1 = b / T1.

For Star_2, the observed λ_peak is λ_2_obs = λ_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2/c) = (b / T2) * (1 + 700e3/(3e5)).

Wait, let's compute that factor. 700,000 m/s divided by 3e5 km/s is 700/300,000, wait no, wait, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s and c is ~3e8 m/s. Oh wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. So v_r2 is 7e5 m/s, c is ~3e8 m/s.

v_r2 / c = 7e5 / 3e8 ≈ 7/300 ≈ 0.02333. So (1 + v_r2/c) ≈ 1.02333.

So Star_2's observed peak
