Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me take a deep breath and try to work through it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me first try to break down the target molecule.

Looking at the name, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main structure is a cyclohexane ring. At position 1, there's a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group on the cyclohexane, probably at position 1 as well, but wait, I need to get the structure right.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane with two substituents at position 1: a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group and a carbonyl group (since it's an aldehyde). Or perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group with a hydroxymethyl attached, and that's all on the same carbon as the aldehyde. Hmm, maybe the structure is like this: a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (let's say carbon 1) is connected to two groups: one is a cyclohexyl group, and the other is a hydroxymethyl group. Additionally, that same carbon has a carbaldehyde group, making it a geminal substituent. Wait, no, that can't be right because you can't have two substituents on the same carbon if they're both attached in a way that would make the structure stable. Maybe the structure is such that the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1 which is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH, and also a formyl (CHO) group at the same position. So, the carbon at position 1 has three substituents: cyclohexyl, CH2OH, and CHO? That might be possible, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, maybe it's a cyclohexane with a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a CHO group on the same carbon? Hmm, perhaps I should draw it out, but since I don't have paper right now, I'll have to visualize.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (C≡CH) attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡C- group. So, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. Like, cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So it's cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH.

Now, the target molecule: we have a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, and that's all connected to another cyclohexane ring which also has a formyl (CHO) group. Wait, maybe the target is a bicyclic structure? Or perhaps it's a cyclohexane with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl-CH(OH)- group and a formyl group on the same carbon.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the steps needed to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. Let's think about possible reactions.

The first step in all options is NaNH2 and something. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. If the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane with -C≡CH), adding NaNH2
