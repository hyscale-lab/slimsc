Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, what's the mean decay distance again? I remember that particles decay over time, and the mean lifetime is related to the width. Oh right! The mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the decay width. But wait, decay width is energy, right? So Γ has units of energy.

But how does that connect to the distance? Oh, right, the particle is moving, so the decay distance depends on how long it lives and how fast it's moving. So the mean decay distance L would be the velocity v multiplied by the mean lifetime τ. So L = v * τ.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of relativistic particles. The particle has a certain energy, so maybe I should calculate its velocity based on that energy. Alternatively, since it's a resonance, perhaps the energy is close to its mass, but wait, E_X is 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV? That seems way higher than the mass. Hmm, but wait, for a resonance, the energy is around the mass. Or is the production energy the same as the mass? Hmm, I'm a bit confused
