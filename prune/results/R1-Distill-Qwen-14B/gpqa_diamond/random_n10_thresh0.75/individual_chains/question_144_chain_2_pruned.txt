Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me think. I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And decay distance has something to do with their lifetime and speed. Oh wait, the mean decay distance is how far they travel before decaying.

The problem gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. 

Wait, I think the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula I vaguely remember is that the decay length L is c multiplied by the lifetime τ, where c is the speed of light. But how do I find τ from the given information?

Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ. The uncertainty principle! Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Let me get the value straight. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, Γ is given in MeV, so I should convert that to GeV to make the units consistent. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.
