Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then it's treated with a series of reagents, and I need to determine the final product from the options provided.

First, I'll start by analyzing the NMR data to figure out the structure of the initial compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down: Each C contributes 4 bonds, so 8*4=32. Each H is 1, so 9*1=9. N is 3 (since it can form 3 bonds), O is 2. Total valence = 32 + 9 +3 +2 = 46. Each double bond or ring contributes 2 to the valence. So, 46 - (2* (number of H in formula)) = but wait, maybe I should use the degree of unsaturation formula.

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. I think it's DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0 (no halogens), so:

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Wait, because N is treated as +1. Let me double-check: the general formula is DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So for this, C=8, H=9, X=0, N=1.

So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which has 3 DoU: 3 double bonds), a double bond, and a ketone or something else.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H-NMR (ppm):
- 9.72 (t, 1H)
- 6.98 (d, 2H)
- 6.51 (d, 2H)
- 6.27 (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 (d, 2H)

Let me interpret each peak.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t), integrating for 1H. That's a good indicator of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), which typically appears around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or sometimes a triplet if coupled with neighboring protons. But wait, in this case, it's a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's adjacent to another proton, like in an enal structure where the aldehyde is next to a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system.

Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 peaks are doublets, each integrating for 2H. These could be from aromatic protons.
