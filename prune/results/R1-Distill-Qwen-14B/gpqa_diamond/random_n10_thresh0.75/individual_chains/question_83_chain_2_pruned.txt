Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we're diluting acetic acid with water and then titrating it with NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll need to calculate both values and see which option matches.

First, let's break down what's happening. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they react to form acetate ions and water. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The initial step is diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the initial concentration will change because of dilution.

Wait, right, the dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / (40 cm³) = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the volume needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, V = 40 cm³ (since 20 +20 =40), so moles = 0.025 * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Moles of NaOH needed: same as moles of acetic acid, 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the question asks about 25% titration. Hmm, wait, does 25% mean 25% of the equivalence volume? Because the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized. So 25% titration would be adding 25% of the equivalence volume.

Wait, or is it 25% of the moles? Because 25% of the equivalence point would be adding 2.5 cm³ (since 10 cm³ is equivalence, 2.5 is 25% of that).

So at 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³.

Now, let's tackle each part: the pH at 25% titration and the pH at equivalence.

Starting with the 25% titration point. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions.

Let me think about the reaction. The moles of NaOH added will be 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Oh wait, wait, 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L, right? So moles NaOH = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, so after adding NaOH, moles of CH3COOH will decrease by 0.00025, and moles of CH3COO^- will increase by 0.00025.

So moles of CH3COOH now: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.0002
