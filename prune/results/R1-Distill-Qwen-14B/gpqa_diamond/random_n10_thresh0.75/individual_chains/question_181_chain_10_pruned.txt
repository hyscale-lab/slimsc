Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Sun's core has different layers with different fusion processes. The pp chain is a series of reactions that lead to helium production, and I think the pp-III branch is one of the steps in that chain.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the process stopped, the change in neutrino flux would take that time to reach us. But since it's already happened, we're seeing the effects now.

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of the fusion process. I think the pp-III branch produces a certain type of neutrino, maybe the Beryllium-7 neutrinos? Or wait, the main contributors to solar neutrinos are the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. Oh right, the pp chain produces neutrinos when a boron-8 nucleus decays into carbon-8, emitting a neutrino. And the CNO cycle contributes as well, but I'm not too sure about the specifics.

Wait, the pp chain has different branches. The main one, pp-I, leads to helium-4 via two protons fusing. Then, I think there's a branch where three protons fuse to form boron-6, which then captures a proton to become boron-7, and then another proton captures to become carbon-8. That's the pp-III branch. Oh, right, and that's where some of the neutrinos come from.

So if the pp-III branch stops, that means the production of those specific neutrinos would stop. The neutrinos from the pp-III branch would be the ones in certain energy bands. I need to figure out which bands are affected.

I remember that the Beryllium neutrinos (from pp-III) have a specific energy. Like, when the boron-8 decays into carbon-8, it emits a neutrino with an energy around 15-20 MeV. But wait, that's higher than the bands we're looking at (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV). Hmm, that's a problem. Did I get that right?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the B-
