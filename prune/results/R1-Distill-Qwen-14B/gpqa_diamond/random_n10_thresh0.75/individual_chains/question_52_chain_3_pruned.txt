Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The question focuses on the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spot-free compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…, and we can assume the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). 

Wait, but wait. Here, the ratio is n1/n2, right? So when the temperature changes, this ratio will change. But the problem says that when spots are present, the ratio decreases. So, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K). 

Wait, no: the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K when spots are present. But does that mean that the temperature of the photosphere is now 5500 K? Or do the spots have a lower temperature, and the rest is at 6000 K? Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff decreases. So that suggests that the spots are cooler than the surrounding. Oh, but the Teff is the effective temperature of the whole star, which would be a combination of the spotted and unspotted areas. 

Wait, but the problem then says that when examining the ratio of Ti atoms in the photosphere
