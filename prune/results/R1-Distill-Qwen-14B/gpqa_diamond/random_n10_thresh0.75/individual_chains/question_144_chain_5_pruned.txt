Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with different values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. The formula for the lifetime (τ) is related to the width Γ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is something like τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the exact formula is τ = ħ/(Γ), where Γ is the total decay width.

But wait, is that right? Oh right, because the uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, so Δt ≈ ħ/(2ΔE). But in this case, Γ is the width, which is the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Or maybe it's ħ divided by Γ times some factor? I should double-check that.

Wait, no, actually, the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy uncertainty in the particle's lifetime. So yes, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, sometimes I've seen the formula written as Γ = ħ/τ, so that makes sense. So tau is inverse of gamma over hbar
