Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift tells us something about the planet's mass and orbit.

So the problem says there are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected shifts in their spectral lines—Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1?

Wait, let's think about what the RV method tells us. The semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital parameters. I think the formula involves the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, the inclination (but since it's a circular orbit and we're detecting it, I guess inclination isn't an issue here), and the distance.

The formula, if I recall correctly, is K = (v) which is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1/(P^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3))) ). But since M_p is much less than M_star (Neptune's mass is way smaller than the Sun's), that term can be neglected. So K is approximately proportional to (M_p / M_star^(1/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)).

Wait, let me get the exact formula. I think the correct relation is K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) ] * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/(c)) ) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the equation that relates K to the orbital period. The formula for the Doppler semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (2πG) / (c * P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star. So,

K ≈ [ (2πG) / (c * P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Since sin i is close to 1 (because we can detect the planet, so the orbit is edge-on, or close to it), we can ignore variations in sin i.

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait no, let's re-arrange the formula. Let me think again. Let's write the formula as:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 sin^3 i) / (c^3 (M_star + M_p)^2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2
