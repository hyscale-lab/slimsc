Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Let me calculate ΔE1. And for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1. To resolve them, we need ΔE >> ΔE1 and ΔE >> ΔE2. Because if ΔE is much bigger than the uncertainties, the peaks won't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal required ΔE is the sum of the uncertainties, or maybe the larger uncertainty. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, I remember that the natural line width is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ), because the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but in the context of this question, each state has its own line width. So for state 1, the line width (full width at half maximum) is proportional to 1/τ1, and similarly for state 2.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of their individual line widths. Otherwise, the lines would overlap and we can't distinguish them.

So let's calculate the individual line widths for each state.

The line width ΔE is approximately ħ/(τ). Let me get the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

But since the options are in eV, I'll need to convert Joules to eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So let's compute for each state the ΔE.

First, state 1: τ1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.05457e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05457e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ΔE1_eV = (1.05457e-25 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, that's about 6.58e-7 eV, which is 0.658 micro-eV.

State 2: τ2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.05457e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.05457e-26 J.

Convert to eV: (1.05457e-26) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 6.58e-8 eV, which is about 0.0658 micro-eV.

So the line widths are around 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV.

Now, to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between them, ΔE = E2 - E1, must be larger than the sum of their line widths, I think. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the two lines might overlap, making them indistinguishable.

So the minimal ΔE required would be roughly ΔE_min ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2. Let's compute that.

ΔE_min ≈ 6.58e-7 eV + 6.58e-8 eV = 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than about 7e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 meV → too small, since 7e-7 is much bigger.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV. That's much larger than 7e-7. So this would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01 micro-eV → smaller than 7e-7, so not enough.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Let me double-check. Because 1e-4 eV is 100 micro-eV. My calculation for ΔE_min is about 723 micro-eV. So 1e-4 eV is 100 micro-eV, which is less than 723 micro-eV. Oh wait, no, 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 * 1e6 micro-eV = 1e2 micro-eV, which is 100 micro-eV. Oh, wait, but 7e-7 eV is 0.7 micro-eV. So 1e-4 eV is 100 micro-eV, which is much larger than the required 0.7 micro-eV. So 1e-4 eV is way bigger than needed. So that would resolve them.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because the line width is about 0.658 micro-eV for state 1 and 0.0658 micro-eV for state 2. So the total line widths are about 0.7238 micro-eV. So the energy difference must be bigger than that. So if the energy difference is, say, 1e-4 eV (which is 100 micro-eV), which is way bigger than 0.7238 micro-eV, then yes, they can be resolved.

But let me think again. Are we considering the sum of the two line widths, or just the larger one? Because in reality, the Lorentzian lines have a width of 2Γ, where Γ is the decay rate. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is 2ΔE, where ΔE is the uncertainty. So to avoid overlap, the energy difference between the two states should be larger than the sum of their FWHMs. Or perhaps just a little larger than the sum.

Wait, another approach: The resolving power R of a spectrograph is defined as ΔE_min = E / ΔE, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, the resolving condition is that the separation between the two lines must be greater than the sum of their half-widths. So the minimal ΔE required is approximately ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2. Wait, no, the full width is 2ΔE, so to resolve two lines, the separation should be greater than the sum of half their widths.

Wait, let's clarify. The FWHM of each line is about 2ΔE. So to resolve two lines, the separation between their centers (ΔE) should be greater than the sum of their FWHMs divided by 2, perhaps?

Wait, I think the condition is that the separation between the two lines' centers (ΔE) should be greater than the sum of their half-widths (Γ1 + Γ2), where Γ is the FWHM divided by 2 (since FWHM is 2Γ).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look for the correct condition. Oh, right, the resolving condition for two lines is that their separation must be greater than the sum of their half-widths. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Let's say each line has a certain width (say, FWHM of 2Γ_i). To resolve two lines, the separation between the centers should be greater than the sum of their Γ_i. Because if the separation is equal to the sum, the lines just touch, and if it's less, they overlap.

So, in our case, the FWHM for each line is 2ΔE_i, where ΔE_i is the uncertainty in energy (the line width is twice that). So the half-width is ΔE_i. So to resolve the two lines, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their half-widths, i.e., ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, that makes sense. So the required condition is ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let me compute that sum.

ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV

ΔE2 = 6.58e-8 eV

Sum = 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

Now, looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 meV → 0.1 micro-eV → way too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → 0.01 pico-eV → definitely way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV, which is 100 micro-eV. 1e-4 eV is larger than 7.24e-7 eV (which is 0.724 micro-eV). So this would satisfy ΔE > sum.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01 micro-eV → which is smaller than 0.724 micro-eV. So no.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, what's 1e-4 eV in micro-eV? Since 1 eV = 1e6 micro-eV. So 1e-4 eV is 0.1 micro-eV? No, wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 0.1 micro-eV. Oh wait, no, 1 micro-eV is 1e-6 eV. So 1e-4 eV is 100 micro-eV.

Wait, no: 1 eV = 1e6 micro-eV. So 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV = 0.0001 * 1e6 micro-eV = 100 micro-eV. Oh, right, that's 100 micro-eV.

So 100 micro-eV is much larger than the required 0.724 micro-eV. So option C is way bigger than needed, so it should work.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV which is 100 micro-eV, which is larger than our required 0.724 micro-eV. So that should allow clear resolution.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar / 2 \). Here, the lifetimes (\( \tau \)) of the two states are \( 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), respectively. The uncertainty in energy for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E_i = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_i},
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Converting \( \Delta E \) to electron volts (eV) using \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), we calculate:

For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05457 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \, \text{J} = 1.05457 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J},
\]
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05457 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} = 0.658 \, \mu\text{eV}.
\]

For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05457 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \, \text{J} = 1.05457 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05457 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.0658 \, \mu\text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{min}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 0.658 \, \mu\text{eV} + 0.0658 \, \mu\text{eV} \approx 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV}.
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.001 \, \mu\text{eV} \):** This is much smaller than \( 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV} \), so the states cannot be resolved.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} = 0.01 \, \text{pV} \):** This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be resolved.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 100 \, \mu\text{eV} \):** This is much larger than \( 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV} \), so the states can be resolved.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.01 \, \mu\text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV} \), so the states cannot be resolved.

The only option that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is **C**.
