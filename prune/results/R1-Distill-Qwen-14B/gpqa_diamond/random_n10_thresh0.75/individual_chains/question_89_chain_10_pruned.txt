Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy. But let's take it step by step.

The first part of the question describes a reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let me break this down.

First Reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH.

I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene via an E2 mechanism. But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine on adjacent carbons in a diamondoid framework. So heating with KOH would likely eliminate HBr twice, forming a double bond.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. When KOH is used, each Br would undergo elimination. Since it's a dihalide, perhaps two eliminations happen. So each Br would lose HBr, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two carbons where the Brs were.

Wait, but with two adjacent Br atoms, when KOH (a strong base) is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. Each Br on adjacent carbons would lose HBr, forming a double bond. So the product would be an adamantane derivative with a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe 1,3-diene? No, wait, because adamantane is a structure with four rings; adding a double bond would change the structure.

Wait, no. Wait: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, would lose two equivalents of HBr to form an alkene. So the product would be an adamantane with a double bond between carbons 1 and 3. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene? Or perhaps 1,2-diene? Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the adamantane structure is a diamondoid, with each carbon connected in a way that there are four cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on adjacent carbons. When KOH is added, each Br would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C3. So product 1 is 1,3-diamantadiene? Or maybe 1,2-diamantadiene? No, wait, 1 and 3 are two carbons apart, perhaps. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the numbering. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an alkene, making an adamantene structure. Wait, perhaps product 1 is an adamant
