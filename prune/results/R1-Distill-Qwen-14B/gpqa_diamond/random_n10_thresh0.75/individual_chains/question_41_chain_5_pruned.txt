Okay, so I have this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass. Let me try to think through it. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium... Oh right, normally the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, c is given as 1 here, so in the glass, the speed is 1/n normally. But because the glass is moving, does that affect the speed we observe?

Oh wait, this is a relativity problem. Because when the medium itself is moving, you have to consider the frame of reference. But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about the glass moving close to the speed of light, so maybe it's non-relativistic. Because if it's non-relativistic, maybe I can use the Galilean addition of velocities.

Wait, Galilean addition applies when speeds are much less than c (or 1 in this case). So the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the light's speed in the glass is 1/n, but the glass is moving at v. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, but wait.
