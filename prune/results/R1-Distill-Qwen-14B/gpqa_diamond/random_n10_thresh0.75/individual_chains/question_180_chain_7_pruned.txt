Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. 

Alright, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right, 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 * 1.6e-19 = 3.2e-19 coulombs. Got that. 

They're in an isolated system. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, wait, the 13th is at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So the setup is like the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are arranged around it, all at the same distance.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Oh right, energy in an electric system is the potential energy between all the charges. Because potential energy is a measure of the work done to assemble the charges in that configuration.

So I remember that the electric potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². 

But wait, because there are multiple charges, I need to calculate the potential energy for each pair and sum them all up. But wait, but how many pairs are there?

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are each 2 meters away. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the 13th. So for the interactions involving the 13th charge, each of the 12 contributes a potential energy term. 

So for each of the 12 charges, the energy between each and the 13th is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Wait, wait, each charge is 2e, so each has charge 2e. So for each pair between the 13th and others, q1 = 2e, q2 = 2e, r = 2 m. 

So each such pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2). Let's compute that. 

But wait, I also need to consider the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Because each of the 12 is at the same point (or, actually, constrained at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other—wait, the problem doesn't specify their arrangement. Hmm, I think the minimum energy would be when all the 12 are as close as possible to each other, but wait, no. Wait, if they're constrained to stay at a fixed distance from P, perhaps they're all on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 meters, so each is at the same distance from P, but what about their mutual distances?

Wait, but the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P. It doesn't say anything about their mutual distances, so I can't assume they're at the same location. So their
