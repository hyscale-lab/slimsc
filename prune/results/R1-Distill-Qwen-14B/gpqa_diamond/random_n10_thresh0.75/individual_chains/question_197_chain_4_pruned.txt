Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. It says that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to find the final product. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of esters, or maybe for some kind of elimination reaction. Wait, no, wait. Oh right! Red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, specifically for the dehydrohalogenation or maybe elimination. Or wait, another thing: they're used in the Hofmann elimination. No, wait, Hofmann uses a different setup. Oh! Right, when you have an alkyne and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to do a hydration or something else. Or wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is often used for the elimination of HX from an alkyl halide. Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Or perhaps it's a way to cleave certain bonds. Oh wait, another possibility: when you have an ester, and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it might cause some kind of reaction. Alternatively, wait, let's look at the IR and NMR data first because that might give me more clues about what compound X is.

So the IR data: peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, probably an O-H stretch. But wait, that's a big region. Could be an alcohol, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong indicator. That's usually a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H around 3000 and a carbonyl around 1700. So the 1720 might be an ester (which is usually around 1740-1720) or a ketone (around 1700-1680). Also, there's a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an -OH proton. Like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But given the IR, if it's a broad peak, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid -OH. Wait, but the IR has a 1720 cm-1 which would match with an ester or ketone. Hmm, but let me not get stuck yet.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. This suggests para-substituted aromatic protons. So maybe the aromatic ring has two substituents, one at para positions. Like in para-xylene or similar.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, which would be the other two protons on the aromatic ring. So that
