Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The key things given are their radii, masses, the wavelengths they appear brightest at, and their radial velocities. The main question is about the luminosity factor of Star_1 compared to Star_2.

First, let's note down the given data:

- Radius of Star_1 (R1) = 1.5 * Radius of Star_2 (R2)
- Mass of Star_1 (M1) = 1.5 * Mass of Star_2 (M2)
- The wavelengths where they are brightest are the same. Hmm, so that's the peak wavelength. Oh wait, I remember from blackbody radiation that the peak wavelength depends on the temperature. Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that both stars are black bodies. So yes, their luminosity depends on their radius and temperature. Luminosity for a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So since both have the same T, the ratio of their luminosities would be (R1² / R2²) because T is same, so T⁴ cancels out. Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, so L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would be option A, which is ~2.25. But wait, the options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, C) 2.35, D) 2.23.

Wait, but wait. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh, wait, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, I'm not sure how that affects the problem. Because luminosity as calculated from blackbody radiation is intrinsic, not depending on their motion relative to us. Unless perhaps we're
