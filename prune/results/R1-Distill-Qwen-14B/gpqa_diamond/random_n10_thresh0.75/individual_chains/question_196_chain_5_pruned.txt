Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by its amplitude and frequency. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are probably different. Let me think about what I know.

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA², and this gets converted into kinetic energy at the equilibrium position. So (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², which gives v_max² = (kA²)/m, so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = A*sqrt(k/m). That's the non-relativistic maximum speed.

But this is a relativistic problem, so I can't use that directly. Relativistic effects become significant when velocities approach the speed of light c. So I need to consider the relativistic expressions for energy and momentum.

In special relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Also, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore; it's (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but how does this apply to a harmonic oscillator? The potential energy is still (1/2)kx², right? Or is there a relativistic correction to the potential? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure. Maybe the problem assumes that Hooke's law holds, so the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So, considering energy conservation in the relativistic case: At maximum amplitude A, all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the total energy E should be equal to both cases.

At x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². The kinetic energy is zero because the mass is at rest at maximum displacement (in the ideal case), so the total energy is just the potential energy.

At x = 0, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is entirely kinetic. So, E = K = (γ - 1) mc² = (total energy) = (1/2)k A².

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because in the relativistic case, when the mass is at x = A, its speed is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy must be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Wait, no, at x = A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, and the total energy is just the rest energy plus the potential energy. Hmm, wait no, because in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the total energy is that, leading to the kinetic energy at x=0 being equal to it. So in the relativistic case, the total energy must be the sum of potential energy and the rest energy?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In the classical case: E = (1/2)k A² (potential) = (1/2)mv_max² (kinetic). But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (γ-1) mc², so the total energy is (γ) mc². So when x=A, the potential is (1/2)k A², and kinetic is zero. But wait, the total energy must include the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. So at x=A, E = (1/2)k A² + mc². Wait, that can't be right because in the non-relativistic limit, E would be mc² +
