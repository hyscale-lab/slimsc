Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Alright, let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's a scalar multiple, right? So I think that means it's (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, but maybe normalized? Or maybe we have to normalize it later on.

The question is asking about two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix representation has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, okay, let's think about that matrix. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we have spin-up and spin-down states), the matrix would look like this:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, no, because if i ≠ j, then A_ij is hbar/2. So rows and columns go from 1 to 2. So row 1, column 2 is hbar/2, and row 2, column 1 is hbar/2. The diagonals are zero.

Wait a second, I'm not sure if I'm interpreting the matrix correctly. Let me double-check. The operator's matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, else 0. So for a 2x2 case, the matrix would be:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Yes, that's right. So this operator is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, operators are usually Hermitian, right? Because observables are represented by Hermitian operators. So let's check if this matrix is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, the conjugate transpose should equal the matrix. The given matrix has real elements, because hbar/2 is real, and the off-diagonal elements are real. So the matrix is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So this operator is a valid observable.

Alright, so the first part is to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of this operator. That means we need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of operator A, right? Because the probabilities correspond to the square of the coefficients in that basis.

Wait, but the given state is expressed in the z-basis (|up> and |down> are the eigenstates of S_z). So I need to find the eigenstates of operator A and then expand |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates, and the coefficients will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, another approach is to find the eigenstates of A, call them |a+> and |a->, and then compute the inner products of |alpha> with each of these eigenstates. The modulus squared of these inner products will give the probabilities.

So let's proceed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The operator A has the matrix:
[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Let me denote hbar as ħ for simplicity.

So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

The determinant is:

| -λ      ħ/2      |
| ħ/2    -λ      |  = 0

Which is λ^2 - ( (ħ/2)^2 ) = 0 → λ^2 = (ħ^2)/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are λ_+ = ħ/2 and λ_- = -ħ/2.

The corresponding eigenvectors can be found by solving (A - λI)|v> = 0.

For λ = ħ/2:

The equations become:

- (
