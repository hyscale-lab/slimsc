Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that each spectroscopic technique gives certain clues. Let's start with the FTIR data. The IR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches. So that suggests the compound has an -OH group, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, a broad peak in IR could also be due to an alcohol. However, the other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ are more telling. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. But if there's a peak at 1700, that's a strong indicator of a carbonyl group like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond, perhaps an alkene. Also, the presence of vinyl protons in the NMR suggests that the molecule isn't fully conjugated in a way that would make all the hydrogens disappear, like in an aromatic ring. So maybe it's an isolated double bond or part of a conjugated system but not fully aromatic.

Now, the Mass Spectrometry (MS) data is interesting. The fragment peak is at m/z =45. I remember that 45 is a significant mass. Let me think about what fragments could give that. Common fragments include a water molecule (18), but 45 is more than that. Oh wait, maybe it's a fragment like a methyl group attached to something. Wait, 45 could also be from a ketene ion (like CH3CO+ if it breaks off, but I'm not sure). Alternatively, 45 is the mass of CH3COO⁻ (methyl acetate ion?), but wait, the molecular weight of CH3COO⁻ (which is 45) would be because 12 (C) + 3*1 (H3) +12 (C) +16 (O) +16 (O) minus maybe some electrons? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a cleavage. For example, if the molecule is an ester, when it breaks, it might lose a part that's 45. Let me think about possible compounds.

Putting the IR and NMR together. We have a carbonyl group, an -OH group, and a double bond. So maybe the compound is an unsaturated ester or a ketone with an alcohol group. Wait, but the formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Wait, the IR shows a broad peak, which suggests an -OH. So the molecular formula must have at least one O from that. The 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl, so that's another O, so the formula should have two O's. That would eliminate options B and D because they have only one O. So the possible formulas are A (C6H12O2) or C (C6H10O2).

Now, looking at the molecular formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen. So for A, 2*6 +2 =14; H=12, so 14-12=2. Divided by 2 is 1. So one degree of unsaturation. But wait, each double bond or ring is one. So if the molecule has a carbonyl group (double bond C=O) and, say, a ring, that would make two DoU. Wait, no, let me calculate again. For option A: DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So 1 DoU. But wait, a carbonyl (C=O) is one DoU, and if there's a double bond (like an alkene), that's another, so that's two DoU. So if the formula has only one DoU, that suggests that maybe there's either a ring or a double bond. But wait, if IR shows a vinyl proton, that implies a double bond, which is another DoU. So there's a problem here. Because if the formula only has one DoU, but we have both an alkene (from the vinyl H) and a carbonyl, that's two DoU. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate the DoU for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So one DoU. But if the compound has both a carbonyl (C=O) and a double bond (C=C), that's two DoU. So that can't be possible. Therefore, this formula may not fit if there are two double bonds.

So perhaps the IR's 1700 is from a carbonyl, but the 1650 might be something else. Maybe it's an aromatic ring, but that requires conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl with a double bond.

Wait, maybe the 1650 cm⁻¹ is from a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So maybe the molecule has a carbonyl group and a double bond adjacent to it. So that would account for the two peaks in IR.

But let's think about the molecular formula again. If the formula has two oxygen and six carbons, but only one DoU, then how can it have both a carbonyl and a double bond? Because each of those contributes one DoU each. So that would require two DoU, but the formula only allows one. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me try each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 → (14-12)/2=1.

So one DoU.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU: (12 +2 -10)/2 → (14-10)/2=2.

So two DoU. That makes sense because we can have a carbonyl (1 DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), plus maybe a ring. Wait, no, because 2 DoU would allow for one ring plus a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Wait, let's think about the IR and NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene (so one DoU). The carbonyl is another (so another DoU). So for the compound to have both, the DoU should be two. So option C has two DoU, which would fit.

So the formula must be C6H10O2 (option C). But wait, the FTIR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, what if the 1650 is from an aromatic ring? But without aromatic peaks in the NMR, but wait, the NMR has vinyl protons, which are typically from alkenes, not aromatics. Aromatic rings typically don't show vinyl protons but rather as multiplets or singlets depending on substitution.

Alternatively, the 1650 is an C=C stretching. So an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

So, if the compound has a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond, that would account for two DoU. So the formula must have two DoU. Only option C and A have O2, but A has only one DoU, which can't account for two double bonds. So option C
