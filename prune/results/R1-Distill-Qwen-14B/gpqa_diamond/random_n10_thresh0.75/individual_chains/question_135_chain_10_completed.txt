Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian term that describes the interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f̄(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, the Lagrangian terms usually involve interactions between fields. The boson X is interacting with fermions ψ_f. 

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I'm supposed to find which particles X can decay into, considering their masses.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of X. So each possible pair of particles must have a combined rest mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Oh, and each fermion pair comes in a particle-antiparticle pair, like b b-bar, etc.

Let me list the possible fermions that X can decay into. The options given include things like bottom quarks (b), charm quarks (c), strange (s), up (u), down (d), tau leptons, and others.

First, I need to figure out the masses of the fundamental particles. Let me recall their approximate masses:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.1 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV, but X is only 6 GeV, so t quarks are out.

Wait, but wait, top quarks are way beyond 6 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks because each top is about 173 GeV, which is way more than X's mass. So any option that includes t t-bar is out. Looking at the options, option C includes t t-bar. So probably C is incorrect.

Next, the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So each pair must have a combined mass ≤ 6 GeV. Let's consider each possible fermion pair.

Let me list the fermions in order of increasing mass:

- u (up quark): ~0.003 GeV
- d (down): ~0.004
- s (strange): ~0.1 GeV
- c (charm): ~1.3 GeV
- b (bottom): ~4.1 GeV
- τ (tau): ~1.78 GeV
- e (electron): negligible
- μ (muon): ~0.1 GeV

So the possible pairs would be:

- e+ e-: combined mass ≈ 0 GeV, which is way below 6. So allowed.

- μ+ μ-: each about 0.1 GeV, so together 0.2 GeV, allowed.

- τ+ τ-: each 1.78 GeV, so together about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

- u u-bar: 0.006 GeV, allowed.

- d d-bar: 0.008 GeV, allowed.

- s s-bar: each 0.095 GeV, so 0.19 GeV, allowed.

- c c-bar: each 1.27 GeV, together 2.54 GeV, which is less than 6. So allowed.

- b b-bar: each 4.1 GeV, so together 8.2 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So not allowed. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

Wait, wait, wait. Because each b is 4.1 GeV, so two would be 8.2 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, that's not allowed. So any decay into b quarks is kinematically forbidden.

So which options include b b-bar? Looking back at the options:

Option A includes b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau pairs, and e pairs.

Option D includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but according to my analysis, b b-bar is not allowed because 4.1*2 = 8.2 >6 GeV. So any option that includes b b-bar as a decay channel is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A) X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ-, e+e−.

So option A includes b b̄, which is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c c̄, s s̄, etc. But does it include b b̄? No. Let me check. Option B says:

X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ-, μ+μ−, e+e−.

Wait, but what about the c c̄ mass? 2.54 GeV, which is allowed. So B includes c, which is allowed. But what about tau? 3.56 GeV, allowed.

So option B is possible. But wait, looking at the options, I need to see which are correct.

Wait, another thing: the fermions involved are the ones that the Lagrangian allows. The given Lagrangian is written as -λf f̄ (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm not sure, but I think the ψ_f is the fermion field interacting with X. So the interaction term is λ f f̄ X, perhaps. But maybe the fermion types f are all the quarks and leptons. So X can couple to any fermion in the theory, as long as the Lagrangian is written that way. So the decay depends on which fermions are present and their masses.

Wait, but the question is about the possible decays. So the allowed ones are all the fermion pairs where the sum of the masses is ≤6 GeV.

So possible fermions are:

e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c, b, t. But since X is 6 GeV, t is out. B is 4.1, so 2*4.1=8.2>6, so b's are out.

So the allowed fermion pairs are:

e+ e−: yes.

μ+ μ−: yes.

τ+ τ−: yes, as 3.56 <6.

u ū: yes.

d d̄: yes.

s s̄: yes.

c c̄: 2.54 <6, yes.

But not b b̄.

So which options have all the allowed pairs except for b?

Looking at the options:

Option A includes b, which is not allowed.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all the allowed except b. So Option B is X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+, tau−, μ+ mu−, e+ e−.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? It's not included in option B. So option B would have all the allowed fermions except the bottom.

Wait, but option D says X→ b̄b, s s̄, etc. So that's incorrect.

Wait, let me look again at the options.

Option A: includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all allowed. So is B correct?

Wait, but option D includes b, so it's incorrect. Option C includes t, which is impossible.

Wait, but wait, what about the possible decay into tau? Tau is allowed, as 2*1.78≈3.56 <6.

So the correct allowed decays should include all the fermion pairs except b b̄ and t t̄.

Looking at the options:

Looking at option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all allowed, but no b.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed, so D is incorrect.

Wait, but let me check what the options are again.

Options:

A) X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ-, e+e−.

B) X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ-, μ+μ−, e+e−.

C) X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau, mu, e. This includes t, so incorrect.

D) X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+, tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

So correct allowed decays are all except b and t.

So the correct option is B, because it includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but wait, option B has c c̄ decay. Because 2*1.27=2.54 GeV, which is allowed. So yes, it's allowed. So yes, option B is correct.

Wait, but option B is option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−.

So that's all allowed.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The decays must satisfy the condition that the combined mass of the decay products is less than or equal to 6 GeV. The Lagrangian provided indicates that \( X \) interacts with fermions, and the possible decay channels depend on the masses of the fermions.
