Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then there's a reaction sequence with three steps. I need to figure out the final product from the options given.

Let me start by interpreting the NMR data. The 1H-NMR peaks are:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet around 9.7. That seems like an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the structure.
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet for two protons. This could be aromatic protons, perhaps adjacent to substituents. Maybe part of a benzene ring with substituents.
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, two protons. Possibly another set of aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted or meta?
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for two protons. Broad usually means exchange broadening, like from an -OH group, but since it's a singlet and two protons, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like an enol.
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for two protons. This could be a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe part of an ether or ester, or perhaps an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, one ring (benzene), a double bond, and maybe another ring or double bond. Or maybe a benzene ring and a conjugated system.

Looking at the NMR again, the aldehyde at 9.72 is probably part of a conjugated system. The aromatic signals suggest two different benzene rings, maybe para-substituted. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be two para-substituted benzene rings with substituents that deshield the protons. The 6.27 might be an enol proton or perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents that cause it to be deshielded but not as much as others.

Wait, the 6.27 is a broad singlet for two protons. Maybe it's an enol proton. Enols have broad peaks because they can exchange with water. But two protons? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or something else.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for two H. Possible structures: if it's a CH2 group next to an oxygen, maybe it's part of an acetal or an ether. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an aldehyde. Because the aldehyde is at a higher ppm, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to it, like in a propenal structure. Wait, but where?

Putting this together, maybe the structure has a benzaldehyde group with a substituent that includes another benzene ring and some conjugated double bonds. Let me sketch a possible structure.

Suppose the molecule is a di-substituted benzaldehyde. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures.

Another approach: the reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 and HCl. That's usually used for diazotization of aromatic amines, especially in the presence of HNO2, forming a diazonium salt. But wait, the compound's formula is C8H9NO. If there's an aromatic amine, like aniline, but with a substituent, that would fit.

Wait, but wait: the given formula is C8H9NO. If the starting compound has an amine group, that would make sense for the first step. But let me check the NMR again.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 9.72, which is likely an aldehyde. So perhaps the structure is an aromatic aldehyde with some substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's an aminobenzaldehyde.

Wait, can I have an aromatic aldehyde with an amino group as a substituent? Let's see. For example, 4-aminobenzaldehyde. But then, the molecular formula would be C7H7NO. But our formula is C8H9NO. So perhaps it's a larger structure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the degrees again: 5. So, perhaps one benzene ring (3 degrees), one double bond (1), and another ring or double bond (1). Or maybe two double bonds and one ring.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a ketone or another aldehyde. Hmm, not sure.

Let me think about the reaction steps.

First step: NaNO2 and HCl. That typically is for diazotization. So the starting material must have an aromatic amine group (like -NH2). Because diazotization occurs with amines, especially aryl amines, under cold (0-5Â°C) conditions with NaNO2 and HCl.

Wait, but in the NMR, there's no peak around 4-5 ppm that would correspond to -NH2, which usually appears as a broad peak around 1-5 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps the amine is part of a substituent that isn't deprotonated.

Wait, but if the starting compound is an aromatic amine, then after diazotization, the next step is H2O. Wait, but the second step is H2O. Then the third step is aqueous KOH and heat.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms a diazonium salt, which could undergo hydrolysis or some other reaction in the next steps.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The first step is diazotization, which forms an aryl diazonium chloride
