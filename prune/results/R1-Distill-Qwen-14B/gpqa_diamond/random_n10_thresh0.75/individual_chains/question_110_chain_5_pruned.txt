Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think this through.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various properties, and I need to figure out which ones are observable by both instruments. The key points are the apparent V magnitude each star would have because both spectrographs have different brightness limits.

Wait, from the question: ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V mag 17, so apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17. And HIRES can handle stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent magnitude up to 16. So, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detected by both.

But wait wait, no, I think I should check if each star's apparent magnitude is within both limits. Wait, no—ESPRESSO can go up to 17, HIRES up to 16. So, a star must be brighter than both 17 and 16? No, no. Wait, the wording says 'brighter than 17' for ESPRESSO and 'brighter than 16' for HIRES. So, to be detected, a star's apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO, and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. So, for a star to be detected by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 (since that's the stricter condition). Because if it's brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can't see it. Wait, no, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO"—wait, wait, no. Wait, apparent magnitude works inversely. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, "brighter than 17" probably refers to apparent magnitude less than 17. Let me think.

Wait, the way it's phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So, the actual apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because lower magnitude means brighter. So, if a star has apparent V mag of 16, it's brighter than 1
