Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different v_rel and E.

First, I'll tackle the relative speed. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as simple as subtracting the two velocities because you can't just do v1 - v2 when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving at u and v relative to a rest frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So I think the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So relative speed is (0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ 0.1428c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C says 0.14c and D also 0.14c. So that's the relative velocity part. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

Now, the total energy of the system. Since each astronaut is a separate object moving at high speeds, I think the total energy would be the sum of their individual relativistic energies.

The relativistic energy for each is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Wait, but the masses here are 2m and 3m. So for
