Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W, form a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, so let's break this down. First, let's think about what X and Y might be. The reaction is violent, so maybe an acid-base reaction or something exothermic. Gas W has same number of neutrons and protons. So that's a hint. Which gases have equal protons and neutrons? Well, let's think of W's molecule. If it's a diatomic gas, maybe H2O? No, because H2O isn't a molecule with same protons and neutrons. Wait, wait, the molecule of W has same number of neutrons and protons in each molecule. So the molecule's composition must have equal numbers of p and n in each atom.

Wait, maybe W is hydrogen gas? But H2 has 1 proton each, and for neutrons, it depends on isotope. Or maybe CO2? No, that's three atoms. Wait, what about O2? But O has 8 protons, and each O atom has 8 neutrons in the common isotope (O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons per molecule. So that worksâ€”each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so per molecule O2, 16 p and 16 n. That fits.

Wait, but O2 isn't a gas released in many reactions. Alternatively, maybe W is NH3? Wait, no, that's a gas but perhaps not in this context. Alternatively, maybe it's CH4? No. Wait, another possibility: maybe W is CO2, but each CO2 molecule has 12 (C) + 16 (O) = 28 atoms. Wait, but the question says
