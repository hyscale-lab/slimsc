Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance to a star. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, the star is far away, and if plx is large, the star is nearby.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. I think that means the same number density of stars in all directions. But how does that translate into the number of stars we observe with a certain parallax?

Wait, number per unit parallax range. So if I pick a range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

I recall that the number of stars we observe at a certain distance depends on the volume of space at that distance. But since parallax is inversely related to distance, maybe I can find a relationship between plx and distance, then use that for volume.

The formula for parallax is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So distance d = 1 / plx. But how does the volume per unit distance work?

The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is approximately 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the difference between two spheres of radius d and d+dd would be roughly 4πd² dd.

If the number density of stars is uniform (n stars per unit volume), then the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But since we're looking at the number per unit plx, I need to express this in terms of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, plx is in arcseconds, so as plx increases, d decreases. So when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (d (plxd) )? Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the differentiation. If d = 1/plx, then dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So dd = (-1/plx²) dplx.

But when calculating the number of stars per unit plx, I'm interested in how many stars are between plx and plx + dplx. So it's the delta in number per delta plx.

The number of stars in a shell at distance d is N = n * 4π d² * dd.

Substituting d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx squared). And dd is (1/plx²) dplx, but the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're considering an infinitesimal range, the magnitude is what's important.

So N = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, that can't be right. Because dd is ( -1/plx² ) dplx, but when you integrate, you take the absolute value, so it's (1/plx²) dplx.

So N = n * 4π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * dplx? Wait, that would give 1/plx^4 times dplx, which would make the number per unit plx proportional to 1/plx^4. But that's one of the options, option A.

But wait, let's double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in substitution.

Let me think again. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = 4π d² dd * n.

Now, d = 1/plx → dd = (-1/plx²) dplx. So, substituting:

N = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² ) dplx * n.

But since dplx is positive, and the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but for the number of stars, we just take the magnitude.

So N = 4 π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/(plx^4). That would suggest option A, which is ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that seems really steep. Let me think of another approach.

Another way: The number density is uniform. So the number of stars is proportional to the volume. The volume element in terms of parallax.

Wait, since d = 1/plx, the volume per unit distance is 4π d² dd. So to get the same volume in terms of plx, I need to express it in terms of plx.

d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d. So dd = - (1/d^2) dplx → d = 1/plx → 1/d^2 = plx².

So, substituting into the volume:

Volume per unit distance (dd) is 4π (1/plx)^2 (1/plx^2) dplx? Wait, that would make 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Which again gives N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number of stars per unit plx is 1/plx^4.

But wait, I might be getting confused because I'm transforming variables. Let me think about the differential.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of differential number of stars, dN, as a function of plx. So:

dN = n * Volume.

The volume element in terms of plx is the volume between plx and plx + dplx.

But wait, wait, no. Because when you change variables from d to plx, the volume isn't just a simple function.

Wait, wait, another approach: The number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx.

Each such shell corresponds to a distance d and d + dd, where dd is the change in distance for that dplx.

So, the volume for that shell is 4π d² dd.

But d = 1/plx → dd = ( -1/plx² ) dplx.

So substituting:

dN = n * 4π d² dd = n *4π (1/plx)^2 ( -1/plx² ) dplx.

The negative sign implies direction, but since dN is positive, we can ignore the sign.

So dN = (4 π n) * (1/plx^4) dplx.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the answer should be option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I've heard that the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to 1/plx^4, but I thought that the number of stars per unit volume is uniform. So maybe that's why the number per unit plx scales as 1/plx^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again.

If stars are uniformly distributed (n is constant), then the number in a volume element is n * dV.

But the volume in terms of plx is the volume between plx and plx + dplx.

Wait, the product of the surface area at distance d and the thickness in plx. Wait, no, the thickness in d is dd, and that relates to dplx.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of distance. The number of stars between distance d and d + dd is n * 4π d² dd.

But d = 1/plx, so dd = ( -1/plx² ) dplx.

Substituting, the number is n *4π (1/plx)^2 ( -1/plx² ) dplx → n*4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars in a dplx range is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4.

So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star in parsecs. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). If the number density of stars is uniform (\( n \)), the number of stars in the shell is:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd.
\]

Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we have \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the expression for \( dN \), we get:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) d\text{plx}.
\]

Ignoring the negative sign (which indicates direction), the number of stars per unit range of parallax becomes:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), making the correct answer:

**Answer: A**
