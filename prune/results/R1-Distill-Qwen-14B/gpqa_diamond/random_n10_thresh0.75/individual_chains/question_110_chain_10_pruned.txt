Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand the key points. The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with different RA, DEC, magnitudes, and distances. Each star has specific characteristics. The spectrographs have different brightness thresholds—ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, and HIRES can see down to brighter than 16. So a star must be brighter than 17 in V to be seen by ESPRESSO, but wait, no, wait—I think I'm getting this wrong. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its magnitude is less than 17. Because the scale is such that lower magnitudes are brighter.

So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, which is V < 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V < 16. So for a star to be observable by both, it must have V mag less than 16 because HIRES is more sensitive (needs brighter, lower mag) than ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait again. Let me clarify: If a star's apparent V magnitude is m, then to be detected, m must be less than the threshold. Because lower m means brighter. So for ESPRESSO, m <17, for HIRES, m <16. So a star must have m <16 to be seen by both, because if it's <16, it's certainly <17, so both can detect it. But wait, no, because the other way around: ESPRESSO can see up to 17, which is fainter than HIRES's 16. So for a star to be detectable by both, it must be brighter than the stricter limit. Wait, no. Wait, the way the question is phrased: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So stars with V <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16
