Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with excitation of atoms in stellar atmospheres, the Boltzmann equation comes into play. Oh wait, right, the Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And since the photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I can apply the Boltzmann equation here.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, n_i and n_j are the number densities of particles in energy levels i and j, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, I think the two stars are being compared. Let's say for star 1 and star 2. The problem states that the excitation level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So, n1/n2 = 2. But wait, the equation would involve the ratio between two states. Let me get this right.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio of excitation for the same energy level. But wait, no, the energy difference is given between the considered levels, so maybe the question is about two different energy levels for the same ion in each star.

Wait, no, maybe each star has the same energy levels, and their iron atoms are in different states. So, for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state (or another state) is given.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, I think it's that in star_1, the number of atoms in a specific energy level is twice that in star_2. So, n1 = 2 * n2, where n is the number in that specific level. But wait, maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state
