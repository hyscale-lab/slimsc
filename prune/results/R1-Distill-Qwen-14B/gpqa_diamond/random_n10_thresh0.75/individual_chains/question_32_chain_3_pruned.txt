Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, let me think. So first, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Let me figure out the isotope. Li usually has 3 protons, and since it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? So the mass number A is 6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy, so I remember that the energy of a moving particle includes its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in particle accelerators, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy, or is it the total energy? Hmm, I think in colliders, the energy given is the total energy, which includes the rest mass. Or maybe it's the kinetic energy. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. So I think it's the total energy that's being asked. Because the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, for a particle moving at speed v, the Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. The speed v is 0.96c, so v squared is 0.9216 c squared. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that more accurately. Let me compute 0.96 squared. Oh, 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57
