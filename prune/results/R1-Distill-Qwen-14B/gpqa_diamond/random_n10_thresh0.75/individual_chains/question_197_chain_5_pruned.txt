Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... Oh right, that's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen removes ketone groups, turning them into alkanes. So the starting material has a ketone, and the product after the reaction would have a CH2 group there.

First, I need to figure out what the original compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data.

Starting with the IR: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests maybe an O-H stretch (like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol) or an alkyne (but 3400 is more like O-H). Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl, probably a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but 1720 is a bit on the lower side for a ketone. Wait, typical ketone is around 1700–1750. So yes, 1720 fits. If it were an ester, the carbonyl is higher, maybe around 1740. So perhaps a ketone. Also, the 1610 and 1450 peaks might be aromatic C=C stretches. So that suggests an aromatic ring in the compound.

Now looking at the NMR. Let's go through the peaks:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, but carboxylic acids are usually broad, around 10-12 ppm. So 10.5 could be a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's an aldehyde, the peak is usually around 9-10, but a carboxylic acid is broader and higher. So maybe it's a COOH proton. But wait, looking at the other
