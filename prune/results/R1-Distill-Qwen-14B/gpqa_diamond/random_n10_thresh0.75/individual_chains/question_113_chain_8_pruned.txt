Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that an unknown compound was prepared, and they used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to identify it. The options given are four possible chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. I need to determine which one is correct based on the given spectral data.

Let me start by going through each piece of data one by one.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is very broadâ€”could it be a carboxylic acid? Those have very broad O-H stretches because of hydrogen bonding. But sometimes, alcohols can also show a broad peak, but maybe less so than carboxylic acids. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group in another form, like phenol.

Then, there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which is often indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm^-1 peak is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl, but maybe it's an conjugated carbonyl or something like that. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a conjugated carbonyl system or maybe an amide? Wait, but amides have N-H stretches which might not be the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

So, two carbonyl peaks suggests either two different carbonyl groups or perhaps one carbonyl and another functional group that has a peak around 1650. Wait, what else? The 1650 cm^-1 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a diene or an aromatic system with conjugation. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. For example, a ketone
