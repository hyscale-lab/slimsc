Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question gives a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending with E. There are also some hints provided, which I should probably use to figure out the structures.

First, let's outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form E.

The hints given are:
a) A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR of A has a strong peak at ~1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is at ~1715 cm^-1.

Hmm, the IR peaks suggest carbonyl groups. A has a peak around 1750, which is typical for a ketone (maybe a cyclic ketone because they tend to be around 1700-1750). E's peak is at 1715, which is a bit lower, maybe indicating a different environment, perhaps an aromatic ring or a conjugated carbonyl?

But let's focus on the reaction steps.

Reaction 1: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN is a nucleophile and typically adds to carbonyl groups. So A must have a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde. But given the IR, it's likely a ketone. So when HCN adds to a ketone, it forms a cyanohydrin. Wait, but the product would have an alcohol and a cyano group attached to adjacent carbons. So B would have an -OH and -CN group next to each other.

Reaction 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation, probably adding H2 across a double bond. Wait, but B is the product of HCN addition, so if A was a ketone, then B would have a secondary alcohol and a nitrile? Wait, no. HCN adds to a ketone via the cyanohydrin formation. So A is a ketone, B is a cyanohydrin, which
