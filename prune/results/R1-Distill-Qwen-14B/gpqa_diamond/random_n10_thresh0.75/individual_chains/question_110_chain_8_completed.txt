Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm. I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, including exoplanet studies and measuring stellar velocities.

Wait, the first thing I need to recall is the brightness limits of each spectrograph. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, does that mean apparent magnitude less than 17? Because typically, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter (lower number) than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so they can see down to 16 mag, which is brighter than ESPRESSO's limit of 17. So HIRES can observe fainter stars than ESPRESSO? Wait no, wait. No, wait. Because the magnitude scale is a bit tricky. Wait, lower magnitude means brighter. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than (i.e., with magnitudes less than) 16, that's a brighter cutoff. So, ESPRESSO can go up to 17, which is fainter than 16. So in terms of brightness, HIRES is more sensitive (can see fainter stars) than ESPRESSO? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, if a star is brighter, its magnitude is lower. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than, say, 16, that means it can pick up stars as faint as 16. Because stars with higher magnitudes are fainter. So, for example, a star with V=16 is fainter than V=15.

So ESPRESSO can detect stars with V up to 17, which is fainter than 16, which is the limit for HIRES. So that means, HIRES can only observe stars brighter than 16, while ESPRESSO can observe up to 17. So any star that's brighter than 17 can be seen by both. But if a star is, say, 16.5, which is brighter than 17 (since 16.5 is lower), wait no. Wait, 16.5 is higher than 16 but lower than 17. So wait, let's think again. The magnitude scale is 1st magnitude is brighter than 2nd, etc. So if a star has V=16, that's fainter than V=15. So the limit for HIRES is brighter than 16, meaning it can observe stars with V <=16. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <=17. So stars that are brighter than 17 can be seen by both. But wait, no. Wait, correction: the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So if a star is brighter than 17, which would have a V magnitude lower than 17, then ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly for HIRES, they observe stars brighter than 16, meaning V mag less than 16.

Wait, that's right. So the HIRES can observe stars with V < 16, while ESPRESSO can observe V <17. So the overlapping range is V <16. So any star that is brighter than 16 mag (V <16) can be detected by both. But if a star has V=16.5, then it's fainter than 16, so HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can.

Wait, but looking at the stars, I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes. Because some of the stars have absolute magnitudes given, and some have apparent, so I need to compute whether their apparent magnitude is within the detectable range for both instruments.

Let's look at each star:

Star1: RA=15, DEC=-75, absolute V=15.5, distance 10 pc. Absolute magnitude is M. Apparent magnitude m is M + 5 log10(d/10). So 15.5 +5 log10(10/10)=15.5 +0=15.5. So m=15.5. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect this, because 15.5 <16 and <17.

Star2: RA=30, DEC=55, apparent V=16.5, distance 5 pc. Wait, but wait, wait. Is the apparent magnitude given already the observed magnitude, or is that the absolute? Wait, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag". Oh, so m=16.5. So Star2's apparent magnitude is 16.5. So for HIRES, which requires m <16, 16.5 is not acceptable. So HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can, as 16.5 <17. So Star2 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Star3: RA=11h, DEC=48, apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. Also, E(B-V) is the color excess, and the total absorption in V band is 3.1 * E(B-V). So extinction (or absorption) reduces the apparent brightness, making stars appear dimmer (higher magnitude). So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_true + extinction. Wait, wait, no. The formula for extinction is m - M = 5 log10(d/10) + A_V, where A_V is the extinction. Wait, no, more accurately, the observed apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V. Alternatively, if the star's intrinsic (absolute) magnitude is M, then the apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V, where A_V is the extinction in the V band.

Wait, but in Star3, the apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, but that's before considering dust extinction? Or is that the observed magnitude? Hmm, the question says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and E(B-V) =0.6. Oh, but wait, I think the apparent magnitude given is the observed (corrected) magnitude. Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the difference between the observed color and the intrinsic color. So the observed V magnitude would be m = M +5 log(d/10) + A_V. So if M is the absolute magnitude, and d is the distance, then m_observed = M +5 log(d/10) + A_V.

Wait, but Star3's data: it's given as apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the apparent magnitude is the observed one, which already accounts for the extinction. Or wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and the extinction is to be applied. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, the question says for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag... and E(B-V)=0.6. And that the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So that would mean A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_V. But wait, if the apparent magnitude given is the observed one, then the intrinsic magnitude (what you'd see without extinction) would be m_intrinsic = m_obs - A_V. Alternatively, if the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, then the observed would be m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, the question says for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5. But that's probably the observed magnitude, because it's given as the apparent. So to find the intrinsic (or the actual m without extinction), we subtract the absorption. Wait, but no, wait. The apparent magnitude includes the extinction. Because when we observe a star, the light is absorbed, making it appear dimmer. So the observed apparent magnitude is higher than the intrinsic (if there were no extinction). So if the given apparent magnitude is 15.5, and the extinction A_V is 1.86, then the intrinsic (what it would have been without extinction) would be 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But wait, I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, but for the purpose of determining whether the star is bright enough for the spectrographs, we need the observed apparent magnitude. Because the brightness limits are based on what the instruments can detect, which depends on the observed light. So Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which is already the observed value. So m=15.5. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it, because 15.5 <16 and <17. So Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, but waitâ€”no, wait. The apparent magnitude is 15.5, so it's brighter than the HIRES limit (which is 16). So yes, both can detect.

Star4: RA=85, DEC=-48, absolute V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4. Distance is 10 pc. So first, calculate the apparent magnitude without extinction: m_intrinsic = M +5 log10(d/10) = 15.5 +5 log10(10/10) =15.5. Then, apply extinction. A_V=3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed m = m_intrinsic + A_V =15.5+1.24=16.74. So m=16.74. Now, check the brightness limits. HIRES requires m <16, so 16.74 is above 16, meaning HIRES can't detect. ESPRESSO can detect up to 17, so 16.74 <17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Star5: RA=10h, DEC=60, absolute V=16.5, distance=5 pc. So m_intrinsic = M +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995. So m_intrinsic ~15.0. Now, any extinction? No, because E(B-V) isn't given. So m_observed is 15.0. Both spectrographs can detect it, because 15 <16 and <17. So Star5 is detectable by both.

Wait, wait a second. Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, distance is 5 pc. So m = M +5 log(d/10) = 16.5 +5 log(0.5) = 16.5 +5*(-0.3010) = 16.5 -1.505 =14.995, which is approx 15.0. So apparent magnitude is 15.0. So yes, that's brighter than both limits, so can be detected by both.

Now, let's go through each star's detectability:

Star1: m=15.5. Both can detect.
Star2: m=16.5. Only ESPRESSO can detect it (since 16.5 <17 but >16).
Star3: m=15.5. Both can detect.
Star4: m=16.74. Only ESPRESSO can detect.
Star5: m=15.0. Both can detect.

So which stars are detectable by both?

Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, wait. Let's double-check:

Star1: m=15.5, can be observed by both.

Star3: m=15.5, can be observed by both.

Star5: m=15.0, can be observed by both.

So which options have stars that can be detected by both?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5. But Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not both.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. Both can be detected by both.

Option C: Star2 and Star3. Star2 can only be detected by ESPRESSO. Star3 can be detected by both. So this option has one that's in both, but the other (Star2) only in ESPRESSO.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star1 can be detected by both. Star4 only by ESPRESSO.

So the correct answer would be any option where both stars are detectable by both. Looking at the options, only option B (Star3 and Star5) and option D (Star1 and Star4) don't fit except for B. Wait, wait:

Wait, let's check each star again.

Wait, Star5: absolute V mag is 16.5, distance 5 pc. m = 16.5 +5 log(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5) =16.5 -1.505=14.995, which is approximately 15.0. So yes, both can see it.

Star3: given as apparent V mag of 15.5. No info on distance or absolute magnitude for extinction calculation. Wait wait a second! Oh wait, no. Star3's data includes E(B-V)=0.6, so the apparent magnitude given is 15.5, but that's the observed magnitude. So, no need to calculate. Because the observed magnitude is already 15.5, which is within both spectrographs' limits. So Star3 can be detected by both.

So, which of the stars can be detected by both? Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Looking at the options, the only option that includes two stars that can be detected by both is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait. Let me check again each star:

Star1: m=15.5. Can both detect. So in D: Star1 and Star4. Star4 is m=16.74, can't be detected by HIRES. So D is wrong.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. Both are detectable by both. So B is correct.

Option A: Star4 and Star5. Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so A is wrong.

Option C: Star2 and Star3. Star2's m=16.5, which is only detectable by ESPRESSO, so C is wrong.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the brightness limits of the two instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., \( m < 17 \)), while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (i.e., \( m < 16 \)). A star must satisfy both conditions to be detectable by both spectrographs.
