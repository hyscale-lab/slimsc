Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. Hmm. So, the question is about stars with dark spots on their surface and how that affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels.

Alright, let's break it down. So, the star has a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature is 6000K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500K. Wait, but wait—does that mean the spots are cooler, so when they cover part of the surface, the average temperature goes down? Yeah, that makes sense because dark spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, when there's no spots, the ratio is higher, and when spots are present, it's lower. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so, the original ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2, right? Or is it n2/n1? The problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So, normally (without spots) the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. Let me think: the ratio in question is n1/n2. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower. Therefore, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

But wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is [ (n1/n2)_no_spots ] / [ (n1/n2)_with_spots ].

The transition between these levels is at 1448 Angstroms. Oh, that's in the ultraviolet range, so probably a forbidden line or something else, but the exact nature might not matter right now.

The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so we can use the Boltzmann equation for this calculation. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is:
