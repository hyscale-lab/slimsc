Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law. So the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature T of the star. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So T1 = T2.

Now, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. Wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh right, that's the Doppler effect. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, and if moving away, it's redshifted. But wait, the peak wavelengths are the same as measured. So does that mean anything about their actual temperatures?

Wait, but I think I need to be careful here. The peak wavelengths are the same as observed. So if Star_2 is moving towards us (velocity positive towards us?), wait, radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s. Wait, the question says radial velocities are 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2. So Star_1 is not moving towards or away from us (v=0), while Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s—I think I need to check the sign. Oh, wait, the radial velocity formula is usually (source moving towards observer: blueshift, so positive velocity might indicate moving away? I get confused sometimes. Let me think. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ = λ0 (1 + v/c), where v is the velocity of the source moving away. So if v is positive and the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). If the source is moving towards, v is
