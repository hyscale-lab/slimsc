Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, you get a buffer solution before the equivalence point, and a salt solution at the equivalence point. The pH changes depending on where you are in the titration.

First, let's figure out the initial situation after dilution. So, the initial solution is made by mixing equal volumes of acetic acid and water. Dilution usually reduces the concentration.

Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be half of 0.05 M because volume doubles. So, 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M acetic acid. But wait, is that right? Molarity is moles per liter. So moles of acetic acid initially are 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, yes. So diluted concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, but when I titrate this with NaOH, which is 0.1 M. So the equivalence point calculation is important too.

Let me think about each part.

First, the 25% titration. So 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So we need to find the pH at this point, which would be in the buffer region.

Then
