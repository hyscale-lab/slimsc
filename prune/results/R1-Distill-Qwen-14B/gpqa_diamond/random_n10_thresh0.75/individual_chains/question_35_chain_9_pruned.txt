Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay, which is equal to c multiplied by S. Here, c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0 -i) and the second row as (i 0). So, let me write that down.

So, S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Then, Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), I can write Ay as:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Wait, but wait, I think I need to remember that in quantum mechanics, spin operators are usually given in terms of Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me think about that. Oh right, the Pauli matrices sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z are 2x2 matrices. And the spin operator S for each component is (ħ/2) * sigma. So S_y would be (ħ/2) times the sigma_y matrix.

Wait, but in this problem, S is given as that matrix, and c is h/(4π). Let me compute the value of c. Planck's constant h is 2π times ħ. So h/(4π) is (2π ħ)/(4π) = ħ/(2). Oh, interesting. So c is ħ/2. So Ay is (ħ/2) multiplied by S.

Wait, S here is the sigma_y matrix? Let me see. The standard sigma_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which matches the given S. So S is sigma_y. So Ay is (ħ/2) * sigma_y. Which is the standard form of the spin angular momentum operator for the y-component, because S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay should be the same as those of sigma_y, scaled by ħ/2.

Eigenvalue equation is Ay phi = a phi. Since sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1, when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues a should be (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1). So a = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but ħ is h/(2π), so substituting that in, a = (h/(2π)) / 2 = h/(4π) * (1/2) ? Wait, no. Wait, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So a would be plus and minus h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So when looking at the options, any option that says the eigenvalues have these real parts would be correct. But looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, and real ±h/(4π). That seems off because the eigenvalues of Ay should be real, right? Because spin operators are Hermitian. Wait, but wait a second, wait: S is sigma_y, which is Hermitian because sigma matrices are Hermitian. So Ay is c times S, which is Hermitian. So Ay is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues should be real. So any option that talks about the eigenvalues having both real and imaginary parts is incorrect. Because if the operator is Hermitian, eigenvalues are real.

So looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). The eigenvalues would be complex, which can't be right. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Also complex, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of
