Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, right, eigenvectors and eigenvalues are important in quantum mechanics because they relate to the possible outcomes of measurements.

Wait, the operator is P, and it's a vector operator with components Px, Py, Pz. Each of these components is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So I think each component is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write them down to get a clearer picture.

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix:
[0  1]
[1  0]
So Px = ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]]

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
And Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

The operator we're interested in is P·n where n is in the x-z plane. So n would have components (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane, meaning the y-component is zero. And since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

So the operator P along n is P·n = nx Px + nz Pz. Because Py contributes nothing here since n's y-component is zero.

So let me write that out. P·n = nx * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's factor out ħ/2:

P·n = (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

Because when you add the matrices, the (1,1) element is nz * 1, (1,2) is nx * 1, (2,1) is nx *1, and (2,2) is (-nz). So the matrix becomes:
[ nz  nx ]
[ nx -nz ]

All multiplied by ħ/2.

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's denote the eigenvalue as λ = +ħ/2. So the equation is (P·n - λ I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Wait, no. The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |v> = λ |v>. So we can rewrite it as (P·n - λ I) |v> = 0. The determinant of (P·n - λ I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

Let me construct the matrix P·n - λ I. Since λ is ħ/2, and P·n is (ħ/2) times the matrix I wrote earlier, let's plug in the values.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the matrix P·n as ħ/2 times the matrix [[nz, nx],[nx, -nz]]. So the matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [[nz, nx],[nx, -nz]]

Subtracting λ I, which is (ħ/2) * I, because λ is ħ/2:

So P·n - λ I = (ħ/2) * [[nz, nx],[nx, -nz]] - (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]]

Which equals (ħ/2) * [ [nz - 1, nx], [nx, -nz - 1] ]

So the matrix is:

[ (nz -1) , (nx)        ]
[ (nx)     , (-nz -1) ]

Wait, no. Wait, the identity matrix has 1s on the diagonal, so when you subtract ħ/2 * I from each component, it's (nz -1) in the top left, and (-nz -1) in the bottom right. Hmm, maybe it's easier to factor out the ħ/2:

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write this as:

P·n |v> = (ħ/2) [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, no, because the eigenvalue is (ħ/2), so:

(ħ/2) [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Divide both sides by (ħ/2):

[ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] |v> = |v>

So the eigen equation becomes [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] |v> = 1 * |v>

So the matrix is [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] and the eigenvalue is 1.

Wait, no, because the matrix is (P·n)/(ħ/2) acting as an operator. Let me think again. Because P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix, so when I write the eigenvalue equation (P·n)|v> = λ |v>, but here λ is (ħ/2). So if I factor out the (ħ/2), the equation becomes (matrix part)|v> = (λ/(ħ/2)) |v>, which is (1) |v>.

So the matrix equation is [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] |v> = 1 |v>

So the matrix equation becomes:

nz*v1 + nx*v2 = v1
nx*v1 - nz*v2 = v2

Wait, no, the matrix is [[nz, nx],[nx, -nz]], so when multiplied by |v> = [v1, v2]^T, we have:

First equation: nz * v1 + nx * v2 = v1 (since the right-hand side is 1*v1)
Second equation: nx * v1 + (-nz) * v2 = v2

So rearranging:

nz v1 + nx v2 = v1 → (nz -1) v1 + nx v2 = 0
nx v1 - nz v2 = v2 → nx v1 + (-nz -1) v2 = 0

So we have two equations:

(nz -1) v1 + nx v2 = 0 ... (1)
nx v1 + (-nz - 1) v2 = 0 ... (2)

We can solve this system. Let me write them again.

Equation 1: (nz -1) v1 + nx v2 = 0
Equation 2: nx v1 + (-nz -1) v2 = 0

Assuming v1 and v2 are not both zero (since we're looking for eigenvectors), we can set up a ratio. Let me express equation 1 as:

(nx) v2 = (1 - nz) v1 → v2 = [(1 - nz)/nx ] v1, assuming nx ≠ 0.

Similarly, substitute into equation 2:

nx v1 + (-nz -1) v2 = 0
Substituting v2 from above,

nx v1 + (-nz -1) * [ (1 - nz)/nx ] v1 = 0
Factor out v1:

v1 [ nx + (-nz -1)(1 - nz)/nx ] = 0

Since v1 can't be zero (unless v2 is also zero, which isn't allowed), the term in brackets must be zero.

So,

nx + [ (-nz -1)(1 - nz) ) ] / nx = 0

Multiply both sides by nx to eliminate denominator:

nx^2 + (-nz -1)(1 - nz) ) = 0

Let me compute (-nz -1)(1 - nz):

First, expand this:

= (-nz)(1) + (-nz)(-nz) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-nz)
= -nz + nz^2 -1 + nz
Simplify:

-nz + nz = 0, so left with nz^2 -1.

So equation becomes:

nx^2 + (nz^2 - 1) ) = 0 → nx^2 + nz^2 = 1.

But wait, since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, nx² + nz² = 1, which is exactly what we have here. So this equation is satisfied because of the normalization condition.

Therefore, the two equations are consistent, and we can choose v2 = [(1 - nz)/nx ] v1.

But wait, if nx is zero, we'd have a division by zero. So perhaps in the case where nx is zero, we'd have to handle it differently. But given that the direction lies in the x-z plane and is arbitrary, I think it's safe to proceed under the assumption that nx is not zero.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [v1, v2] = [v1, [(1 - nz)/nx ] v1 ] = v1 [1, (1 - nz)/nx ]

We can choose v1 to be a normalization factor. Let me denote c = v1, so the eigenvector is proportional to [1, (1 - nz)/nx ]

But wait, I should probably make this more concrete. Let me express (1 - nz)/nx as some variable, say, tan(theta/2) or something, but perhaps I can find a more straightforward approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the direction vector n. Since it's in the x-z plane, n can be written as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So nx = cosθ, nz = sinθ.

That might make things easier. So let's substitute nx = cosθ, nz = sinθ.

So the ratio becomes:

(1 - nz)/nx = (1 - sinθ)/cosθ.

Wait, (1 - sinθ)/cosθ can be rewritten as [ (1 - sinθ) ] / cosθ. I know that (1 - sinθ) = (sin(π/2 - θ)), but not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we can express this in terms that can be simplified.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the eigenvector in terms of θ.

So the eigenvector components are [v1, v2] = [1, (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ].

But let's think about normalization. The eigenvector is [v1, v2], so the squared magnitude is |v1|^2 + |v2|^2. Since we're dealing with quantum states, the vector should be normalized.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar, so perhaps I can find the normalized eigenvector.

Let me compute the normalization factor. The vector as [1, (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ].

Let me call a = (1 - sinθ)/cosθ.

So the vector is [1, a]. The magnitude squared is 1^2 + a^2 = 1 + a² = 1 + [(1 - sinθ)^2 ]/(cosθ)^2.

Which is [ cos²θ + (1 - sinθ)^2 ] / cos²θ.

Compute numerator: cos²θ + (1 - 2 sinθ + sin²θ) = cos²θ + 1 - 2 sinθ + sin²θ.

But cos²θ + sin²θ =1, so this becomes 1 + 1 - 2 sinθ = 2 (1 - sinθ).

So the magnitude squared is [2 (1 - sinθ)] / cos²θ.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this differently.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me try again:

cos²θ + (1 - sinθ)^2 = cos²θ + 1 - 2 sinθ + sin²θ = (cos²θ + sin²θ) + 1 - 2 sinθ = 1 +1 -2 sinθ = 2 (1 - sinθ).

Yes, that's correct. So the magnitude squared is [ 2 (1 - sinθ) ] / cos²θ.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt( 2 (1 - sinθ) / cos²θ ) ) = cosθ / sqrt(2 (1 - sinθ)).

So the normalized eigenvector would be [ cosθ / sqrt(2 (1 - sinθ)), (1 - sinθ)/(cosθ) * cosθ / sqrt(2 (1 - sinθ)) ) ].

Simplify the second component: (1 - sinθ) / cosθ * [ cosθ / sqrt(2 (1 - sinθ)) ) ] = (1 - sinθ) / sqrt(2 (1 - sinθ)) ) = sqrt( (1 - sinθ ) / 2 )

Wait, let me write it out step by step.

Component 1: [ cosθ / sqrt(2 (1 - sinθ) ) ]

Component 2: [ (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ] * [ cosθ / sqrt(2 (1 - sinθ)) ) ] = (1 - sinθ) / sqrt( 2 (1 - sinθ) ) ) = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) * (1 - sinθ) / (1 - sinθ)^0.5 )

Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Let me compute sqrt(2 (1 - sinθ)) as denominator, so:

Component 1: cosθ / sqrt( 2 (1 - sinθ) )

Component 2: (1 - sinθ)/cosθ * [ cosθ / sqrt(2 (1 - sinθ)) ) ] = (1 - sinθ) / sqrt(2 (1 - sinθ)) )

Which is equal to sqrt( (1 - sinθ) ) / sqrt(2) )

Wait, because (1 - sinθ) / sqrt(2 (1 - sinθ)) ) = sqrt(1 - sinθ) * sqrt(1 - sinθ) / sqrt(2 (1 - sinθ)) )

Which simplifies to sqrt( (1 - sinθ) ) / sqrt(2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cosθ / sqrt(2 (1 - sinθ)) ), sqrt( (1 - sinθ) ) / sqrt(2) ) ]

Hmm, this looks a bit messy. Maybe I can find a better approach or a trigonometric identity to simplify this.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the eigenvalue problem with the matrix (P·n)/(ħ/2) = [[nz, nx],[nx,-nz]].

We know that the eigenvalues of this matrix are ±1, because the trace is nz + (-nz) = 0, and the determinant is (nz)(-nz) - (nx)^2 = -nz² - nx² = -(nx² + nz²) = -1, since nx² + nz² =1. So the eigenvalues are solutions to λ^2 - (trace) λ + determinant = λ^2 - 0 λ -1 = 0 → λ = ±1. Which makes sense because the eigenvalue we're considering is +1/ (ħ/2) → +1 in this scaled matrix.

But perhaps using another method, like diagonalizing the matrix. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps expressing the eigenvector in terms of spin-up or spin-down states.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are involved in spin operators. The operator P is analogous to the spin operator S, scaled by ħ/2. The eigenstates of S·n are the spin-up and spin-down states along direction n.

The spin-up state along direction n is given by a specific formula. For a direction n = (nx, 0, nz), the spin-up eigenstate can be written as:

|+n> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) ]^T

But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle φ is zero because the y-component is zero. So the state simplifies to:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, since e^{i 0} = 1.

But wait, because the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is zero. So the eigenstate should be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Wait, let me check. The general spin-up state along an arbitrary direction (nx, ny, nz) is given by:

|+> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) ]

Where θ is the polar angle (angle from z-axis) and φ is the azimuthal angle (angle in the x-y plane). But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, which means φ=0. So the state becomes [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

So, considering that, the normalized eigenvector would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Looking at the options provided:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which looks like what we have here. But wait, the question says 'the elements of the normalized eigenvector'. So the correct option would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. The options are given as:

A) (√(2/3)ħ, √(1/3)ħ)
B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ)
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (√(2/3)ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

So option C seems to match our conclusion. But wait, in our earlier calculation, we derived the eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

But wait, our earlier approach using the matrix led to a more complicated expression, but the spin state approach gives a much simpler one. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But wait, is there any scaling factor I'm missing? Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, and the spin operator S has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 when considering spin-1/2 particles.

Wait, in our problem, the operator P is given, and it's stated that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the corresponding eigenvector should be the spin-up state along n.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which matches option C.

But wait, I think I may have made a mistake in the earlier derivation. Because when I considered the matrix and tried to solve the equations, I ended up with a more complicated expression, but perhaps I made an error in that approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the spin approach is more straightforward. The spin-up state along direction n is indeed [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized as $(\cos\theta, 0, \sin\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator Along $\vec{n}$**:  
   The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \cos\theta P_x + \sin\theta P_z.
   \]
   Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, we find:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \sin\theta & \cos\theta \\ \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   (\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}) |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
   \]
   where $|v\rangle$ is the eigenvector. Factoring out $\hbar/2$, the matrix equation becomes:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \sin\theta & \cos\theta \\ \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Solving for Eigenvector**:  
   Solving the eigenvalue equation, the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ is proportional to:
   \[
   |v\rangle \propto \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Normalization**:  
   The eigenvector is normalized to ensure it represents a valid quantum state. The normalized eigenvector is:
   \[
   |v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This does not match the derived eigenvector, as it introduces unnecessary scaling factors dependent on $\hbar$ and does not depend on $\theta$.

- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$  
  This is incorrect because it does not account for the $\theta/2$ dependence in the eigenvector components.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the derived normalized eigenvector and is consistent with the spin-up state along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This introduces unnecessary scaling factors dependent on $\hbar$ and does not match the derived eigenvector.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
