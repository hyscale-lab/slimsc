Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's going on.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ionization and excitation states of atoms depend on temperature. So when the temperature changes, the ratio of atoms in different energy levels changes according to the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

But in this problem, the transition between these two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I wonder if that's relevant for calculating anything else, like energy difference. Because knowing the wavelength allows us to find the energy difference between the two levels using E = hc/λ.

Oh right, Planck's equation relates energy and wavelength: E = hc/λ. Let me note that down. H is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, λ is 1448 Angstroms. So I can calculate the energy difference ΔE between the two levels.

Wait, but wait. The energy difference is actually E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So ΔE = hc/(1448e-10 m) because 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters.

Once I have ΔE, I can plug it into the Boltzmann factor.

But the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2. So the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, no. Let me think. The ratio n_i/n_j is (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So for level 1 and level 2, if E2 > E1, then the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher than when there are spots.

Which would mean that when the temperature is lower (with spots), the ratio is lower. How does temperature affect this ratio?

If I have n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (ΔE) / (k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

If T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-x) becomes smaller. So n1/n2 would decrease as T decreases. So when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Which matches the problem statement.

But wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the star is without spots (T=6000 K), the ratio is higher. So we're looking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Let me denote R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So the factor F is R1 / R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out because they are the same in numerator and denominator. So F = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Wait, because R1 is for T1 (without spots, T1=6000 K), and R2 is with T2=5500 K.

So F = exp( [ (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] )

Because:

F = exp( [ (ΔE/(k T2) ) - (ΔE/(k T1) ) ] ) = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Now, let's compute that
