Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The question is about a star whose properties change when dark spots cover part of its surface. We need to find the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't.

First, let me understand the given data. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (let's call them level 1 and level 2) when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(kT)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The ratio could be n1/n2 or n2/n1 depending on the levels. Since the ratio is decreasing when spots are present, let's think. When the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature drops. Lower temperature would affect the population ratio.

Wait, the spots cause the effective temperature to decrease. But wait, the effective temperature is the temperature we observe from the star as a whole. But the actual photospheric temperature where the Ti lines form might be different? Or does the problem assume that the entire photosphere's temperature is measured by Teff? Hmm, the question says that when spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the spots are cooler, but the unspotted regions are at a higher temperature. But the problem is considering the ratio in the photosphere. Wait, but the wording says 'the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), when the star's surface is not covered by spots' and when it is. So perhaps both times, the photosphere is assumed to be at Teff. So without spots, Teff is 6000 K. With 40% spots, Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere (where the line forms) is at 6000 K when no spots, and 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but wait. No, that might not be accurate. Because when spots are present, the star's total luminosity changes. The spots are cooler, so they emit less. But the unspotted regions are perhaps at a higher temperature. However, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So perhaps the photosphere's effective temperature refers to the average; but for the purpose of the problem, we can assume that the temperature relevant for the line formation is 5500 K when spots are present.

But wait, the line is formed in the photosphere. So if the photosphere's effective temperature is lower, then the line formation region's temperature is lower. So the ratio n1/n2 would be governed by the Boltzmann factor.

Let me think about the ratio when the star has no spots (T=6000 K) and when it has spots (T=5500 K). Let's denote the ratio as R = (n1/n2) when no spots, R' = (n1/n2) when spots are present.

We are told that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R' < R. Therefore, R/R' is the factor by which the ratio increases when spots are absent. The question asks for R/R'—the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.

Wait, the question says, "the ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when spots are present, the ratio is lower than when they're not. So R is the ratio without spots, R' is with spots. So R > R'.

We need to find R / R' = (n1/n2)_6000K / (n1/n2)_5500K.

But let me get the formula right. The ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then higher T would lead to a higher ratio. Let's say for a transition from level 1 to level 2, which emits at 1448 Å. The energy difference is E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

So, let's compute the energy difference. The wavelength is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-6 meters.

But wait, perhaps the exact value isn't necessary because it will cancel out in the ratio.

Wait, the ratio R is n1/n2. From the Boltzmann equation:

n2 = n1 * (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

So, n1/n2 = [g1/(g2)] * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive. So when T increases, the exponent becomes larger, making the ratio n1/n2 larger. Wait, no: exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases as T increases, because the denominator is smaller. So for higher T, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) is smaller, because T is in the denominator. Wait, wait, let's think again.

Wait, no: (E2 - E1) is a positive number. So as T increases, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) decreases, because the denominator increases. Therefore, exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) decreases as T increases.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's take an example. Suppose E2-E1 = 1000 K * k. For T = 5000 K: the exponent is (1000)/(5000) = 0.2 → exp(0.2) ≈ 1.22.

For T = 6000 K: exponent is 1000/(6000) ≈ 0.1667 → exp(0.1667) ≈ 1.181.

Wait, wait. So as T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) gets smaller, so the exponential term becomes smaller.

Wait, that means n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If T increases, the exponential term decreases. So n1/n2 decreases as T increases, if E2 > E1 and g1/g2 is a constant.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the overall T is lower (5500 K), and the ratio of n1/n2 decreases. So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. But wait, according to our earlier conclusion, when T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases (since denominator is smaller), so the exponential term increases. So n1/n2 increases as T decreases, which would cause the ratio to increase. But the problem states that when spots are present (lower T), the ratio decreases. That seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I got the ratio wrong. Maybe the ratio is n2/n1, not n1/n2.

Let me re-express this. The Boltzmann equation gives n2 = n1 * (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then the exponent is negative. So as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, making the entire term larger. So higher T → higher n2/n1.

If T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes larger, so the exponent becomes more negative. So exp(-x) decreases as x increases.

So, when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases.

So, if the ratio being observed is n2/n1, when T decreases, the ratio decreases.

In the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) decreases. So yes, that makes sense.

But wait, the question says "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio is n1/n2, then when T decreases, the ratio would increase. But that's not what's happening.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio is n1/n2. Let's clarify.

The problem says that the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when T goes down from 6000 to 5500 K, the ratio R = n1/n2 decreases. So according to the Boltzmann equation, R = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, so when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp(positive number) increases. So R would increase, meaning the ratio n1/n2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Therefore, perhaps the ratio being observed is n2/n1.

Because when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases. So the observed ratio, which is lower, is n2/n1.

So the situation is: without spots, T=6000 K, ratio R = n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

With spots, T=5500 K, R' = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k * 5500) )

So R/R' = [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k * 5500) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/6000 - 1/5500 ] )

Wait, let me compute that exponent.

Compute (E2 - E1) is equal to hc / lambda, where lambda is 1448 Å. Let's compute E2 - E1 in terms of energy.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent in terms of temperature.

Wait, let me think about the variables.

We can compute the exponent as:

Δ = (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/6000 - 1/5500 ]

But (E2-E1) is proportional to 1/lambda. So E = hc/(lambda) * 1. But let me think about the exact expression.

Alternatively, since E = hc / λ, and k is Boltzmann's constant, the term (E)/(k) would be hc/(k lambda).

But I think it's better to compute delta as:

delta = (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ]

Wait, since T1 is 6000 K and T2 is 5500 K. So:

delta = (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

Let me compute 1/6000 - 1/5500.

1/6000 = approx 0.000166667

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

So 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 * 5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -5/(330,000) ) = approx -0.0000151515

So delta = (E2-E1)/(k) * (-0.0000151515 )

But (E2-E1) is hc/(lambda), so delta becomes [ hc/(lambda k) ] * ( -0.00001515 )

But hc/(lambda k) is (hc/(k)) * (1/lambda) ). Wait, hc/(k) is a value known as the Wien's displacement law constant times something else.

Wait, hc is approximately 12400 eV·Å (since 1240 eV·nm = 12400 eV·Å). So hc/(k) would be 12400 eV·Å / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) ≈ 12400 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 1.438e8 K·Å.

Wait, let me compute that. 12400 divided by 8.617e-5:

12400 / 0.00008617 = 12400 * (1/0.00008617) ≈ 12400 * 11600 ≈ 143,840,000 ≈ 1.4384e8 K·Å.

So hc/(lambda k) = (1.4384e8 K·Å) / lambda.

lambda is 1448 Å, so hc/(lambda k) = 1.4384e8 / 1448 ≈ 1.4384e8 / 1.448e3 ≈ approx 1.4384e8 / 1.448e3 ≈ 1.4384e5 / 1.448 ≈ ≈ 99,320 K.

Wait, let me be precise.

1.4384e8 K·Å / 1448 Å = (1.4384e8 ) / 1448 K.

Compute 1.4384e8 / 1448:

1448 is 1.448e3. So 1.4384e8 / 1.448e3 ≈ (1.4384 / 1.448) ) * 1e5 ≈ approximately 0.993 * 1e5 = 99,300 K.

So, back to delta:

delta = (99,300 K) * (-0.00001515) ≈ 99,300 * (-1.515e-5 )

Compute 99,300 * 1.515e-5:

99,300 * 1.515e-5 = (99,300) * (0.00001515) = let's compute:

99,300 * 0.00001515 = 99,300 * 1.515e-5.

Well, 99,300 * 1e-5 = 0.993.

So 0.993 *1.515 = approximately 1.503.

So delta ≈ -1.503.

So delta is approximately -1.503.

So the exponent in R/R' is delta, which is -1.503.

So R/R' = exp( delta ) = exp(-1.503) ≈ e^-1.503 ≈ approximately 0.221.

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present. Wait, let me make sure.

Wait, R = n2/n1 at 6000 K.

R' = n2/n1 at 5500 K.

We are to find the factor by which R changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. That is, R/R'.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:

"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots."

So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So R' < R.

So the factor is R / R' which is (n2/n1 at 6000 K) / (n2/n1 at 5500 K) = exp(delta), which is exp(-1.503) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, that would mean R/R' is approximately 0.221, which is less than 1. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so R' is less than R, so R/R' is greater than 1. Oh wait, no, because R = (n2/n1) at 6000 K, and R' = (n2/n1) at 5500 K.

So R/R' = [ (n2/n1)_6000 ] / [ (n2/n1)_5500 ]

Which is [ (g2/g1 exp( -E/(6000k) ) ) ] / [ (g2/g1 exp( -E/(5500 k) ) ) ]

The g2/g1 cancels out, so we have exp( [ -E/(6000 k) + E/(5500 k) ] ) = exp( E/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

Hmm, I think I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me recalculate delta correctly.

So E is E2 - E1 = hc/(lambda). So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -E/(k T) )

Thus, the ratio R = (n2/n1)_T = (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k T) )

So R1 (at T1=6000 K) = (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k*6000) )

R2 (at T2=5500 K) = (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k*5500) )

The ratio R1/R2 is [ exp( -E/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( -E/(k*5500) ) ]

Which is exp( E/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 1/(66,000) )

So 1/5500 - 1/6000 = 1/66,000 ≈ 1.515e-5.

So E/(k) is (hc/(lambda k)) = hc/(lambda k) = as we computed earlier, approximately 99,300 K.

So E/(k) * [1/5500 - 1/6000] = 99,300 K * (1.515e-5) ≈ 99,300 * 0.00001515 ≈ 1.503.

So the exponent is 1.503.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.503) ≈ e^1.503 ≈ 4.49.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) under the influence of temperature changes due to the presence of stellar spots. The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Without spots**: \(T = 6000 \, \text{K}\).
2. **With spots**: \(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\).
3. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(1448 \, \text{Å}\), so the energy difference is:
   \[
   E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
   \]
   where \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\).

### Step 1: Compute the energy difference in terms of \(kT\)
The term \((E_2 - E_1)/(kT)\) can be rewritten using the relation \(E = hc/\lambda\):
\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT} = \frac{hc}{\lambda kT}.
\]
Substituting \(hc/k \approx 1.4384 \times 10^8 \, \text{K·Å}\) and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\), we find:
\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT} = \frac{1.4384 \times 10^8}{1448 \times T}.
\]
For \(T = 6000 \, \text{K}\):
\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT} \approx \frac{1.4384 \times 10^8}{1448 \times 6000} \approx 1.83.
\]
For \(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\):
\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT} \approx \frac{1.4384 \times 10^8}{1448 \times 5500} \approx 1.94.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the ratio of populations
The ratio of populations at two temperatures is:
\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{5500}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k \cdot 6000}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k \cdot 5500}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right)\right).
\]
Substituting \((E_2 - E_1)/k \approx 99,300 \, \text{K}\) and computing:
\[
\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \cdot 5500} = -\frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{5500}} = \exp\left(99,300 \cdot (-1.515 \times 10^{-5})\right) = \exp(-1.503) \approx 0.221.
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
The ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which the ratio changes is:
\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{5500}} \approx 4.5.
\]

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.
