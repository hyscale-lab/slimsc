Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about stars with dark spots and how they affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The problem gives a lot of data, so I need to parse it carefully.

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, spots are making the star cooler overall.

Now, the main point is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And the photosphere is in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium holds, so the usual equations apply.

Wait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio n2/n1 is equal to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K vs 6000 K). So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower. The ratio of n2/n1 is lower when the star has spots.

Wait, the ratio is n2/n1. So when T decreases, what happens to the ratio: since the exponential term is exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), which is exp(-something positive) because ΔE is positive. So if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, and the exponential term gets smaller. So n2/n1 decreases as T decreases.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is lower, so the ratio (when spots present) is lower than when spots are not present. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher.

The question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So, the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

Let's denote R = (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

So R = [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_no) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_yes) ) ]

The g2/g1 cancels out, so R = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no) + ΔE/(k T_yes) ] )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_yes) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Wait, let me recast that:

ΔE/(k) is a positive value. So,

[1/(T_yes) - 1/(T_no)] = [ (1/T_yes) - (1/T_no) ] 

Since T_yes (5500) < T_no (6000), 1/T_yes > 1/T_no. So the difference is positive. Thus, the exponent is positive, so R is greater than 1.

So R would be exp( [ΔE/(k)] [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] )

Wait, let's compute (1/5500 - 1/6000). Let me compute that.

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 and 1/6000 ≈ 1.667e-4.

Subtract: 1.818e-4 -1.667e-4 ≈ 0.151e-4 = 1.51e-5.

So the exponent is:

ΔE/(k) * 1.51e-5.

Wait, but what is ΔE? ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels, which can be found from the wavelength of the transition.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, λ wavelength.

So ΔE = hc/λ.

Given λ is 1448 Å. Let's convert that to meters: 1448e-10 meters.

So compute ΔE:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Then hc/λ = 1.9878e-25 / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) )

Calculate denominator: 1.448e-7 m → 1.448e-7 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc/λ ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) → Let's compute 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ ~1.373 → 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, another way: 1e-25 / 1e-7 =
