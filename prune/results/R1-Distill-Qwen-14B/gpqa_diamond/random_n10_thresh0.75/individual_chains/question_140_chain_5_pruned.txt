Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading through the question carefully.

The question describes a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 

Another part mentions that the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it. 

And the main question is about calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes present.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, I need to figure out what Substance X is. The reaction with liquid Y is violent, which makes me think of something reactive. Gas W has equal neutrons and protons in its molecule. Since protons and neutrons are in each atom, this suggests that each molecule of W has atoms where each has equal protons and neutrons. Wait, but the molecule itself has same number of neutrons and protons. So, maybe each molecule has two atoms, each with equal p and n. Or wait, the molecule as a whole has equal p and n. 

Wait, let's think of common gases. For example, O2: each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's the common isotope O-16). So O2 would have 2*(8p +8n) in each molecule. So each O atom contributes 8p and 8n, so the molecule has 16p and 16n. But that's 16 each, so equal. So O2 would fit as W. Alternatively, another molecule like H2O would have H and O, but their total p and n wouldn't be equal. Let's think: H has 1p each, O has 8p. So H2O has 2+8=10 p, and 1+1+8=10 n. Oh wait, that's 10 each. So that could also fit. But H2O is a liquid, not a gas under normal conditions. Wait, at room temp, H2O is a liquid, but when it's produced in a reaction, maybe it's a gas? Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, another gas could be CO2. Let's check. CO2 has one C and two O atoms. C-12 has 6p, 6n. Each O is 8p, 8n (assuming O-16). So total p: 6 + 2*8=22. Total n:6 + 2*8=22. So 22 each. So CO2 could also fit. But under what conditions does CO2 form as a gas in a reaction? Maybe.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like NH3. Let's see. Each N has 7p, 7n (N-14). H has 1p, 1n. So NH3: 7+3*(1) =10p. Neutrons:7 +3*(1)=10. So same, 10 each. So NH3 is a possibility. But again, under what reaction conditions would this form?

Wait, but the reaction of X with Y produces W. Let's think about possible reactions. If X is a metal, reacting with an acid (Y could be an acid like H2SO4 or HCl), producing a gas. For example, metals reacting with acids produce hydrogen gas. Let's see: If X is a metal and Y is an acid (like HCl), the reaction would produce H2 gas. So, W would be H2. Let's check H2: each H atom has 1p, 0n (if it's H-1, but wait, H can have isotopes. H-2 has a neutron, but in H2 gas, the isotopes could vary. Wait, but the problem states that W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. For H2, each H has 1p and either 0 or 1n. So if the molecule is H2, each H is H-1 (protium), which has 1p, 0n. So the molecule has 2p, 0n. That's not equal. So H2 wouldn't fit here. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: maybe W is CO2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe W is O2. Let me think: O2 has 16p and 16nâ€”so equal. So O2 would fit. So when X reacts with Y, it produces O2, which is a gas. What reactions produce O2? Decomposition reactions, or reactions where a peroxide breaks down. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal and Y is a solution containing something that reacts to produce
