Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are all different momenta values.

First, I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, molecules can absorb photons that cause transitions between energy levels. Since the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, I think we're dealing with both rotational and vibrational energy states.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the next state would be the first excited state. But in the rotation-vibration model, energy transitions can involve changes in both rotational and vibrational levels. Oh right, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration.

Vibrational energy levels are quantized in quanta of ħω, where ω is the angular frequency given. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The fundamental state is v=0, so the next vibrational state would be v=1, which would require a photon with energy equal to ħω.

But wait, the problem states it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's a transition that requires the least energy? Oh wait, the fundamental state is the lowest. So to get to the next state, perhaps it's the first excited state, which could be either a transition in vibration or rotation.

Wait, the rotation-vibration model includes both, so the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational. But when moving from the fundamental state, which is the lowest possible, the next state would be the next higher energy level, which could involve either a vibrational transition (v=1) or a rotational transition (like changing J). But which one requires less energy?

Vibrational transitions usually require higher energy because the vibrational energy levels are spaced by ħω, which is much larger than the rotational energy spacing. So if the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, it would be the next rotational state, not the vibrational one.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. Fundamental state is the state where both rotational and vibrational are in their lowest (v=0, J=0 perhaps). So the next state
