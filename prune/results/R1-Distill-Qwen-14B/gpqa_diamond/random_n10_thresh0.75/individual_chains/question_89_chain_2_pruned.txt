Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When heated with excess KOH, it forms product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to give product 2. Finally, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, leading to product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Alright, let's break this down.

First Reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess), heated to 240°C. What's happening here? KOH is a strong base. When dibromides are treated with a strong base, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, it typically leads to elimination, forming alkenes. Wait, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in a diamond-like framework.

So, heating with KOH would likely cause an E2 elimination, removing two equivalents of HBr. The structure would lose two bromides and form a double bond. Wait, but wait—adamantane's structure is a cage-like structure. So where would the double bond form? If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the elimination would form a bridged double bond, perhaps.

Alternatively, considering the product's NMR data. The product 1 has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That peak is indicative of an ester or maybe a ketone? Wait, wait. Wait, 1720 is more in line with an ester (C=O stretch), but it could also be a ketone. But wait, with KOH, which is a strong base, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution or elimination.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a substitution. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dibromide. Heating with KOH (excess) would likely lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. So product 1 would be an adamantene (adamantane with a double bond). But then, the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. That doesn't fit with an alkene. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong here.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a substitution. Let's think—if KOH is in excess, maybe it's a double substitution. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo a double SN2 substitution. But the structure of adamantane is quite rigid, so each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. SN2 reactions are more feasible on primary or secondary carbons, but bridgehead positions are typically not good for SN2 because of the structure's constraint. So substitution might not be feasible here, which suggests elimination is more likely.

Wait, but if elimination occurs, forming a double bond, then product 1 would be 1,3-diene adamantane? But then, where's the carbonyl group in the IR? Oh
