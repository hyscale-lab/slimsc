Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the answer choices are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on dilution. So first, I should probably calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after dilution.

Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid before dilution are Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L, so the new concentration is moles divided by volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait, when I add 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of acetic acid, that's 40 cm³ total. So yes, that calculation makes sense.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O. 

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid present. Let's calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. It's 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 moles. So the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence are the same, 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.0
