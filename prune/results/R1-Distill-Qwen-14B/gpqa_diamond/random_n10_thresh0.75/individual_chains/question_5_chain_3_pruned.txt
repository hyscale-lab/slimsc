Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator, specifically the spin operator for a muon. Hmm, muons are like heavier electrons, right? But the specifics don't matter too much here, I think.

The operator in question is P, and we're looking for an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The direction is arbitrary, lying in the x-z plane. Wait, so the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. So n would have components (nx, 0, nz), where nx² + nz² = 1.

The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the overall operator P along direction n is the sum of the components multiplied by their respective direction cosines. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me compute that matrix. Let's write out each part:

n_x P_x = n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
= (n_x ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
= [[0, n_x ħ/2], [n_x ħ/2, 0]]

n_z P_z = n_z * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]
= (n_z ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]
= [[n_z ħ/2, 0], [0, -n_z ħ/2]]

Adding them together, the total operator matrix P is:

P = [[n_z ħ/2, (n_x ħ/2)], [(n_x ħ/2), -n_z ħ/2]]

So, the matrix P is:

[ (n_z ħ/2)      (n_x ħ/2)     ]
[ (n_x ħ/2)     (-n_z ħ/2)     ]

Now, we're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. 

Let me denote the eigenvector as a column vector [a; b]. So,

P * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Which gives the equations:

(n_z ħ/2) a + (n_x ħ/2) b = (ħ/2) a

and

(n_x ħ/2) a + (-n_z ħ/2) b = (ħ/2) b

Let me simplify these equations. First, multiply both sides by 2/ħ to eliminate the constants. That gives:

n_z a + n_x b = a

n_x a - n_z b = b

So, equation 1: (n_z a + n_x b) - a = 0 → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

Equation 2: n_x a - n_z b - b = 0 → n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

Now, I have two equations:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0   ...(1)

n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0    ...(2)

Let me consider these as a system of linear equations. For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Alternatively, I can solve the equations.

From equation (1):

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z - 1 )

Wait, but this is valid only if (n_z -1) is not zero. Let me think about possible cases.

Let's substitute a from equation (1) into equation (2):

n_x [ (-n_x b)/(n_z -1) ) ] - (n_z +1) b = 0

Multiply through:

[ -n_x^2 b / (n_z -1) ) ] - (n_z +1) b = 0

Factor out b:

b [ -n_x^2 / (n_z -1) - (n_z +1) ] = 0

Since we're looking for non-trivial solutions (b not zero), the term in brackets must be zero.

So:

- n_x^2 / (n_z -1) - (n_z +1) = 0

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

- n_x^2 - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = 0

Simplify the second term: (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = n_z^2 -1

So,

- n_x^2 - (n_z^2 -1) =0 → -n_x^2 -n_z^2 +1 =0 → -(n_x^2 + n_z^2) +1 =0

But wait, n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

So,

-(1) +1 =0 → 0=0

So the equations are consistent, and thus we can find non-trivial solutions.

So, from equation (1):

a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z -1 )

But let's think about the direction vector n. Since n is in the x-z plane, and it's a unit vector, let's parameterize it using an angle θ. Let me think: if the direction is in x-z plane, let me say that n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, but wait, more accurately, if the angle with the z-axis is θ, then n_x = sinθ cosφ, but wait, no, because in x-z plane, φ is zero or something else. Wait, actually, perhaps
