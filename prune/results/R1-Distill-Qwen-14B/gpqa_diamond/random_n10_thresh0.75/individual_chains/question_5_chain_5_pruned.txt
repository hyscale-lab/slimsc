Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles like a muon, the spin operator components are given by P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenvectors of these operators correspond to the spin states along that direction.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. So it's some arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, which I think means it's making an angle θ with the z-axis. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because it's in the x-z plane. Or wait, maybe it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh right, usually polar coordinates have θ from the z-axis, so the x-component would be cosθ, z would be sinθ? Or wait, no, wait: in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the positive z-axis. So the unit vector in that direction would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0. So the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ)? Or wait, no, because if φ is 0, then in x-y plane, but here it's x-z plane. Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify. The x-z plane would imply that the direction vector has y-component zero. So n would be (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ? Or n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ? Hmm, I think it's the former. Because if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then the components would be (cosθ, 0, sinθ). Wait no, wait. Wait, the unit vector in the direction (x, z) would have x as cosθ if θ is the angle from the z-axis. So (cosθ, 0, sinθ) is the direction vector. Wait, no, no, I think I'm mixing up. Let me think: for polar coordinates, the position is (r sinθ cosφ, r sinθ sinφ, r cosθ). So if φ=0, then the point is (r sinθ, 0, r cosθ). So, as a unit vector, it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the direction vector is n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, but that can't be right because sin^2θ + cos^2θ =1. Wait, no, for unit vector, the components squared should add to 1. So (sinθ)^2 + (cosθ)^2 =1, yes
