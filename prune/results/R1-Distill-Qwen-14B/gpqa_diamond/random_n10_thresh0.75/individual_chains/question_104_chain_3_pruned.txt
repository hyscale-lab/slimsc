Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little bit as the planet orbits it, and that movement causes the spectral lines to shift in wavelength.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have each been found to have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the main variables here are the shifts in their spectral lines—Planet #1's shift is 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's is 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, but we're asked about the orbital periods. How does the spectral line shift relate to the orbital period?

I think the RV method's Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (sin i) / (2π * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3)) )^(1/3) ). Wait, maybe that's too complicated. I remember that for circular orbits (e=0) and assuming M_planet << M_star, the formula simplifies. Oh right, the simplified version is K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i ) / (2π c ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(-1/3) ) ) Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to recall that the Doppler shift (or the velocity semi-amplitude K) is proportional to (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) )) ), but wait, no, I think the formula is K is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(1/3) )) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relationship between the semi-am
