Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a specific matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and determine which statement is correct among the options A to D.

Hmm. I remember that angular momentum operators have eigenvalues related to ħ, the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, in this case, the operator is given as c·S, so I need to see what S represents. Oh wait, S is a spin matrix. Since it's 2x2, it's probably the Pauli matrices, but looking at it: S has rows (0 -i) and (i 0). Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh, right, so S here is the Y Pauli matrix. So S = σy.

So, the operator Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π). Let me write that down. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

But wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues related to their properties. For a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvalues of the spin component operators are ±ħ/2. Because for example, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So let me think: since Ay is c times σy, which is the Pauli matrix for spin Y.

Wait, the standard spin operator in Y is (ħ/2)σy. So in this case, Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. Let me compute h/(4π): h is Planck's constant, which is 2π ħ. So h = 2π ħ. So substituting that into c: c = (2π ħ) / (4π) ) = ħ/(2). So c = ħ/2.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, h is Planck's constant, which is 2π times ħ. So h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). So yeah, c is ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) σy.

So the operator for Ay is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix. So to find the eigenvalues, we can look at the eigenvalues of σy multiplied by (ħ/2).

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when multiplied by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues become (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but looking at the options,
