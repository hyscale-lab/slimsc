Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal, but the angles between the axes are all the same too. In this case, the angles α, β, γ are each 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, but wait, interatomic distance in a crystal usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along a lattice point. So, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same because it's a special case of the hexagonal system or maybe the cubic? Wait no, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system when angles are 90 degrees, but here the angles are 30 each, so it's a more general rhombohedral.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance refers to the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula I remember for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ) ) ), but wait, is that correct? Or maybe another formula applies here. Let me think.

Wait, more accurately, the formula is d = (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2a² (hk cosγ_1 + hl cosγ_2 + kl cosγ_3)) )^(-1/2) ) ? No, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Let's try to recall the correct formula.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ between the axes is:

d_hkl = 1 / sqrt( (h²/l²) + (k²/m²) + (l²/n²) - 2(hk cos α)/(lm) - 2(hl cos β)/(ln) - 2(kl cos γ)/(mn) ) )

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d^2 = (a^2 (h² +k² + l²) ) / ( ... ) Hmm, perhaps another approach. Alternatively, I remember that for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But in
