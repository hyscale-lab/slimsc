Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it. The question provides a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are vectors in 3D, like r=(1,1,0), etc.

Wait, what's a density matrix again? Oh right, a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (a statistical mixture of pure states). Pure states can be written as |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but mixed states require a density matrix, which is positive semi-definite and has trace 1.

The given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). So each term is a projector. Let me write that out in matrix form. The |0⟩⟨0| matrix is a diagonal matrix with 1 in the first position and 0s elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 1 in the second position. Adding them together gives a 2x2 identity matrix, but scaled by 1/2. So ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

Density matrices for qubits can be represented in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and its representation on the Bloch sphere is a vector from the origin to the surface, with components (x,y,z) such that the vector is (x,y,z), and it has magnitude 1. The density matrix for a pure state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector.

But wait, mixed states have density matrices that can't be written that way. So for a mixed state, the Bloch vector has a length less than 1. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So each of the diagonal elements is 1/2. 

Let me think about the general form. The density matrix ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (x,y,z). So I'll expand that. The Pauli matrices σ are [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[i,0]], and [[1,0],[0,-1]] for x, y, z respectively.

So ρ = (I + xσx + yσy + zσz)/2. Let's compute each term. I is the identity matrix, so (I)/2 is [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]]. Then xσx is [[0, x],[x, 0]], so (xσx)/2 is [[0, x/2], [x/2, 0]]. Similarly for the others.

Putting it all together, ρ is [[1/2 + (z)/2, (x - iy)/2], [(x + iy)/2, 1/2 - z/2]]. Wait, but in our given ρ, the off-diagonal elements are zero. So setting the off-diagonal elements equal: (x - iy)/2 = 0. Therefore, x must be zero and y must be zero. So x=0, y=0.

Now the diagonal elements: ρ[0][0] = (1 + z)/2, and ρ[1][1] = (1 - z)/2. But in our case, both diagonal elements are 1/2. So (1 + z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + z = 1 → z=0. Similarly, (1 - z)/2 = 1/2 → same result z=0.

So the Bloch vector r is (x,y,z) = (0,0,0). So the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which means it's a completely mixed state. Because that's the case for the maximally mixed state in 2x2 systems—like the given ρ, which is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. This is equivalent to the completely mixed state, which is the maximally uncertain state, sitting at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, the only one that matches r=(0,0,0) is option C. So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be written in matrix form as 

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Density matrices for qubits can be represented on the Bloch sphere, where the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) corresponds to the components of the density matrix. For a general density matrix, it can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the off-diagonal elements of \( \rho \) are proportional to \( x \) and \( y \), while the diagonal elements are proportional to \( z \). 

For the given \( \rho \), the off-diagonal elements are zero, which implies \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \). The diagonal elements are both \( \frac{1}{2} \), which implies \( z = 0 \). Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the completely mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.

This matches option C, which states \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).

Answer: C
