Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativistic mechanics, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is achieved at the equilibrium position, and it's given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are probably different.

In relativity, the equations change because of the gamma factor. The energy isn't just kinetic but includes relativistic terms. So I need to think about the total energy of the oscillator.

In the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA² (potential energy at maximum displacement) and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is also (1/2)mv_max². Equating these gives the non-relativistic v_max as before.

But for relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². So the total energy E is gamma mc², which should equal (1/2)kA², assuming that the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA² as in the classical case. Wait, does that hold in relativity? Or does the potential energy expression change? Hmm, maybe I should model this properly.

Let me write down the energy equation. The total mechanical energy in the oscillator's case should be the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, kinetic energy is the total energy minus rest mass energy.

So E_total = K + U, but U is (1/2)k x² in the classical case. But wait, for relativistic harmonic oscillators, the potential energy might still be (1/2)k x²? Or does it change? I'm not entirely sure. I'll proceed assuming the potential is still (1/2)k x², but maybe that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy expression is modified.

Wait, another approach: in special relativity, the energy of a particle is gamma mc², and if it's oscillating, then the total energy is conserved. At maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, and the total energy E is purely potential. At x=0, the velocity is maximum, so all the energy is kinetic.

So, at x=A: E = U = (1/2)k A². At x=0: E = K = (gamma -1) m c². Wait, that can't be right because if E is the same, then (1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) m c². But wait, gamma depends on velocity, which is maximum at x=0.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, its velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, but the potential energy is (1/2)k A². Then, the total energy E is (1/2)k A². So at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic, which is (gamma -1) m c².

So setting these equal: (gamma -1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

But wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right? So rearranging this equation to solve for v might get me the maximum speed.

Let me write that down: (gamma -1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Hmm, that's interesting.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me call that term D for simplicity: D = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So gamma = 1 + D.

Then, 1/(sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))) = 1 + D.

Take reciprocal: sqrt(1
