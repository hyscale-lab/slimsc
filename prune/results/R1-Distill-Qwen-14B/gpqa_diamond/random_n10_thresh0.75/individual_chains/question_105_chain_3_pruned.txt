Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it again and try to figure it out. Hmm.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, right? The star has dark spots on one hemisphere covering 20% of that hemisphere. Oh wait, the filling factor is 20%, so that means 20% of the visible surface is spots when we look at that side. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K.

The problem says that because of these spots, when we observe the star's brightness over time, it'll show periodic changes as the star rotates. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would cause a dip in brightness. So they want to find out what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness variation as these spots do.

They're asking for the radius of the planet relative to the star, Rpl/Rstar. The options are A to D, with values like 0.39, 0.07, etc.

Wait, I remember that the dip in brightness (the transit method) depends on the area of the planet compared to the star. The formula I think is (Rp/Rstar)^2, since the area is proportional to the square of radius. So the fractional change in brightness is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. So the brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the visible side, the star's overall brightness decreases. But how does that compare to a planet blocking light?

Wait, the star isn't completely spot-free. The spots are 20% of one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view. But how does that affect the observed brightness variation compared to a planet?

Let me think. The star's total brightness without spots would be based on its entire surface. But with spots, each spot reduces the brightness. The filling factor is 20%, so when the spot hemisphere is facing us, 20% of that hemisphere is spots. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So if the star's surface is a sphere, the total area is 4πR². If the spots cover 20
