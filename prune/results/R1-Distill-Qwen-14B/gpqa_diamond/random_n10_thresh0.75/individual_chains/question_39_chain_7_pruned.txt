Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says we've got 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. We're told that when they measured the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles are between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the value of a. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function needs to be normalized. That means the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. The normalization condition is the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space equals 1.

Wait, the wave function is given as ψ(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x) - 0.5i. But wait, that can't be right. Wait, isn't the wave function supposed to be a complex function? But in this case, it's written as a sum of two terms: a real term (a / sqrt(1+x)) and an imaginary term (-0.5i). Or is it multiplication? Oh wait, the way it's written, it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So that would be a complex number with real part (a / sqrt(1+x)) and imaginary part -0.5.

Wait, but that seems a bit strange because usually the wave function would have some x dependence in the imaginary part as well. But maybe that's the case here. So when calculating the probability, I need to compute the absolute square of ψ(x), which is ψ*(x) multiplied by ψ(x).

So the absolute square is [a / sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i] multiplied by [a / sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i]. Let me compute that:

(a / sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 + (i * a / sqrt(1+x) * (-0.5i) ) + (i * -0.5i * a / sqrt(1+x)).

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute it as |ψ(x)|² = (Reψ)^2 + (Im
