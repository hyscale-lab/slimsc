Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and available to form complexes. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I've got to choose from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like Ca²+ forming a complex. The formation constant, Kf, is a measure of the stability of the complex. A high Kf means the complex is very stable, so the metal tends to stay bound.

The problem states we have a stoichiometric solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. I think stoichiometric here means that the molar ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA is exactly 1:1, so each EDTA molecule is bound to one Ca²+ ion.

Wait, the complex is given as 0.02 M. So the concentration of the complex [CaY²-] is 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

I remember the formula for the formation constant. Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait, in this case, the solution is at stoichiometric conditions. So the amount of EDTA and Ca²+ that are free would be equal, right?

Wait no, not exactly. Because the complex is formed, the free [Ca²+] and free [EDTA] would be very low because Kf is large. Wait, but in a solution where the complex is formed, the majority of the Ca²+ and EDTA are tied up in the complex.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think about the dissociation of this complex.

The complex dissociates as CaY²- ⇌ Ca²+ + Y⁴-.

The formation constant Kf is given as 5x10^10. So Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y⁴-]) = 5e10.

But for the dissociation, the reverse reaction would have a K equal to 1/Kf. So K_dissociation = 1/(5e10) ≈ 2e-11.

Wait, but in the solution, the EDTA is present in the Y^4- form because the pH is ideal. So [Y^4-] is equal to the free EDTA concentration, [Y].

So, since the solution is stoichiometric, all the Ca²+ and EDTA are in the complex form. Wait, no, maybe not. Because if the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, then the total concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA would each be 0.02 M, but the free concentrations would be much lower.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the complex dissociation. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as
