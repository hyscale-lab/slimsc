Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.

First, the question gives me data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different compounds with varying degrees of unsaturation and oxygen content. Let me break down each piece of information.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is very broad. Oh, right, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch because they can form hydrogen bonds more extensively than alcohols. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but the broadness might suggest something else. 

Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The peak at 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Now, where else could that be? Esters, ketones, maybe aldehydes? But 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Hmm. If there's another peak at 1650, that might suggest a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with conjugation or an aromatic ring. Or maybe it's an amide? But the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl means they're attached to a double bond, right? So that suggests the compound has some double bonds, maybe in an alkene or part of a ring. So the compound might have an alkene or an aromatic ring.

Then, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, m/z 45 is a common fragment. What fragments give 45? Let me think. The molecular ion might break down into smaller ions. 45 could correspond to something like (CH3)2CO (which is acetone, but that's 58. Wait, no. Wait, 45 is C3H7O? Or maybe it's a different formula. Wait, the molecular weight of 45 would be for something like CH3COOH (32) plus something. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from an ester. Let me think: if the compound is something like an ester, maybe the fragment is the acylium ion or the alkoxide part. Alternatively, if the molecule has a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH3, but that would be 31. Hmm, maybe the fragment is a ketone or an aldehyde.

Let me think about the options. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

I need to find which one fits all the data.

First, let's look at the degrees of unsaturation for each formula.

Degrees of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N, it
