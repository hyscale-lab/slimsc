Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, right, parallax is related to distance. I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So higher parallax means closer objects.

Wait, parallax formula... Oh, right, the distance r is approximately 1 over plx (in parsecs, I think). So r = 1 / plx. That makes sense because if something is closer, its parallax is larger. So plx is inversely proportional to r.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. The number varies as 1 / plx^5. Let's write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, 1/(plx) is r. So plx = 1/r. Let me substitute plx with 1/r in the equation. 

So N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that. 1 over (1/r)^5 is the same as (r)^5. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, and the reciprocal is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait a second. That would mean as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power. But that can't be right, can it? I mean, when you look further away, you should see more stars, but the rate depends on how the density changes. Or wait, maybe in this specific region, the number of stars per unit volume is constant?

Wait, no, the problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So maybe the number of stars isn't just about the volume, but something else. Let me think about the relation between distance and the number of stars.

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/r (assuming r is in parsecs, which I think is the case). So plx is proportional to 1/r.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Which is the same as (r)^5. Because plx = 1/r, so 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

But wait, that seems odd because as r increases (distance increases), the number of stars increases rapidly. But in reality, the number of stars you can see increases with the volume, which goes as r^3. So why is this different?

Ah, perhaps the way they're counting varies differently. Maybe the question is considering that more distant stars are fainter, so you need to correct for that? Or perhaps in this specific scenario, the number of stars per volume isn't constant.

Hmm. Let's think again. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5), where k is some constant.

But since plx = 1/r, substituting, N = k * r^5. So for each unit increase in r, N increases by r^5. Wait, but what's the question again? It says, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range of distance r.

Wait, the question is about the change in the number of stars per unit range of r. So the number is increasing as r^5. So the rate of change would be the derivative of N with respect to r, which would be 5r^4. But wait, the options are given in terms of the dependence on r, not derivatives. So the number of stars depends on r^5. So the correct option would be B) ~ r^5.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The question is about how the number of stars in that region changes with distance. So if the number N is proportional to r^5, then for each unit increase in r, the number increases by a factor of r^5. So the answer would be option B.

But wait, another way to think: perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr is proportional to the surface area (4πr^2 dr) multiplied by the number density. But the problem doesn't mention anything about surface area or volume; it's a specific relation to parallax.

Wait, no. The question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So the number is a function of plx, and through that, a function of r.

So plx = 1/r, so N ∝ (1/plx)^5 = r^5. So the number of stars is proportional to r^5. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me double-check the setup. The number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N = k (1/(plx))^5. Since plx =1/r, this becomes N= k r^5. So yes, the number of stars increases as r^5. So the answer is B.

But I thought the usual case is that the number of stars you can observe increases with r^3 because of the volume. But maybe this is a different scenario where the density is such that the number is varying inversely with the fifth power of parallax. So I think the correct answer is B.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} \), which simplifies to \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with distance as the fifth power of \( r \).

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \( \sim r^3 \):** This would apply if the number of stars depended on volume (\( r^3 \)), but the problem specifies a different dependence on parallax.
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \):** This matches the derived relation \( N \propto r^5 \) based on the given \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \) and \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \).
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \):** There is no justification for this dependence in the problem.
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \):** This would apply to surface area, not the given scenario.

Thus, the correct answer is \( \sim r^5 \).

Answer: B
