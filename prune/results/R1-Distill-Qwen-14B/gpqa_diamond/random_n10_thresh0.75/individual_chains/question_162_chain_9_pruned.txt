Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? But wait, I'm not entirely sure. I think I should start by recalling what a pseudosphere is. Oh right, a pseudosphere is an infinite surface of constant negative curvature. It's like the hyperbolic version of a sphere, but instead of having positive curvature, it's negative, so it looks like a horn or something.

The question gives a metric: ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, but what does the radius mean here? I think for a pseudosphere, the radius is related to the curvature. Since it's a surface of constant negative curvature, the curvature K is -1/(r²), where r is the pseudosphere radius. So if r=2, then K would be -1/4. Does that make sense? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll keep that in mind.

Now, the metric given is in terms of x and y coordinates. It's a 2D metric, so this is the metric for the surface of the pseudosphere. The general form of a metric in 2D is ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), where g(x,y) is the conformal factor. In this case, g(x,y) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the metric is conformally flat,
