Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on differential geometry, but I'll try to work through it.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. So the spacetime here is 2D, maybe like a surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space.

Wait, pseudosphere—oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Its metric is similar to hyperbolic space. But wait, the metric given here might represent the geometry of a pseudosphere.

Now, the question is about the area. So I need to compute the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but in the metric, I don't immediately see the 'r' parameter. Let me think. Oh wait, in the given metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). If I factor that, 4 is (2)^2. So maybe r is 2 here, since 4 = r².

Wait, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which can be written as (2² - (x² + y²)). So the metric resembles the form of hyperbolic space in some coordinate system. Oh, but hyperbolic coordinates can come in different forms, like Poincaré, or maybe something else.

Wait, the general form for hyperbola in
