Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to work through it. The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and asks for their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, things get a bit tricky because of length contraction, time dilation, and how velocities don't just add up normally.

So, let's break down the problem. There are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second has a mass of 3m and moves at 0.5c. Both are in the positive x-direction. We need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed. Oh right, in special relativity, velocities don't add like they do in classical mechanics. The formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, I think I might have mixed up the order. Let me think: if one object is moving at u and the other at v (both in the same direction), then from the perspective of the first, the second would be moving at (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Because when u and v are in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just their difference.

Wait, no, actually, the formula is (u' - v')/(1 - (u' v')/c²), but I need to get the correct frame. Let me think. Suppose astronaut A is moving at velocity v = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at u = 0.5c. From A's frame, what is the speed of B?

Wait, actually, no, because both are moving in the same direction. So B is moving slower than A from the perspective of someone at rest. So from A's frame, what speed would B appear to be moving at?

Alternatively, maybe relative velocity is the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. So the relative speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, that would be negative because 0.5c is less than 0.6c. So that would give a negative relative velocity, which might not make sense. Or does it
