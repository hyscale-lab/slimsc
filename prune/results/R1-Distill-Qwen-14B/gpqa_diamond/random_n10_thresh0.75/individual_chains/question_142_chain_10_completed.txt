Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubits space. Hmm.

The density matrix given is rho equals (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this rho is a density matrix, right?

I think about the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, any single qubit state can be represented on a Bloch sphere. But wait, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. So the density matrix has a vector r associated with it.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in three dimensions. Oh right, because the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

So if I expand our given rho, it's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me think about what each term is. |0><0| is a projector into the state |0>, and similarly for |1><1|. So when you add them together, it's a diagonal matrix with [1,1]/2 on the diagonal. So the density matrix looks like [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Comparing this to the general form (I + r·σ)/2. Let's compute the general form. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. The r·σ term would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. Let's compute each σ:

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when multiplied by their respective r components and added, then divided by 2?

Wait, no. The general form is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So when we add the I and the sum, then divide by 2. So in our case, rho is (|0><0| + |1><1| ) /2 = (I)/2. So that implies that the sum r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z must be zero matrix. Because (I + 0)/2 is I/2, which matches our rho.

So for the sum of the Pauli terms to be zero, each of them must be zero. So r_x must be zero, r_y must be zero, r_z must be zero. So the vector r is (0,0,0). So the density matrix is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but wait another thought. The state (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 is the completely mixed state. It's the maximally mixed state. On the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is represented by the origin because the Bloch vector has zero length. Because any pure state is on the surface of the sphere (with radius 1), but a mixed state is inside. The maximally mixed state is at the center.

So the position r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer must be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with entries \([0.5, 0.5]\) on the diagonal, which corresponds to the maximally mixed state of a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, any qubit state can be described using a Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \), where the density matrix is expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

with \( I \) being the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) being the Pauli matrices. For the given density matrix, it matches the form \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies that the term \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) must vanish. This means \( r_x = 0 \), \( r_y = 0 \), and \( r_z = 0 \), so the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).

The maximally mixed state is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere, as it is the center of the sphere. Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is:

**A) \( r = (1, 1, 0) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere.**  
**B) \( r = (0, 0, 1) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere.**  
**C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \): Correct, as this represents the origin, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.**  
**D) \( r = (1, 1, 1) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere.**

Thus, the density matrix is at the origin in the qubit space.

Answer: C
