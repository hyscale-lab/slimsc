Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, I think the first thing I need to do is normalize this state because probabilities depend on the state being normalized to 1.

Wait, proportionality means that |alpha> is equal to some constant times that vector. Oh right, so I need to find the normalization constant. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So, let's compute the inner product. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The inner product would be (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i), wait no, that's not right. Let me think: the inner product of |alpha> with itself is (1+i)*(1-i) + (2-i)*(2+i), because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. Because when you take the inner product, the cross terms (like |up><down|) would be zero.

So let's compute each part. The first term is (1+i) multiplied by its complex conjugate (1-i). So that's (1)^2 + (1)^2 because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Similarly, the second term is (2 - i) times (2 + i). So that's 2^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So adding 2 +5 gives 7. So the inner product is 7, which means the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

Next part: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A. The matrix of A is given as A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

Wait, that looks familiar. Oh, right! That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (hbar/2) * σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the spin-up and spin-down along the x-axis.

The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So, if I can express |alpha> in terms of these states, the coefficients will be the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenstates of A, then compute the inner product with |alpha> to find the probabilities.

So let me find the eigenstates of A. Since A is proportional to σ_x, its eigenstates are the same as σ_x's. Alternatively, I can diagonalize A explicitly.

The eigenvalues of A can be found by solving det(A - λI) =0. For a 2x2 matrix, that's:

| -λ      hbar/2        |
| hbar/2  -λ        | = 0.

The determinant is λ^2 - (hbar^2/4) =0 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± hbar/2. The corresponding eigenvectors... Let's find them.

For λ = hbar/2: (A - λI)|v> =0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -hbar/2 , hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]

Which simplifies to the first equation: (-hbar/2)v1 + (hbar/2)v2 =0 → -v1 +v2 =0 → v1 = v2. So the eigenvector is (1,1) up to normalization. So the eigenstate is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), which is |+x>.

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2: (A + λ I) becomes:

[ hbar/2 , hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]

Which gives hbar/2 v1 + hbar/2 v2 =0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenvector is (1, -1)/sqrt(2) → |−x>.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Now, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all multiplied by 1/sqrt(7). We can write this as (1/sqrt(7)) (a|up> + b|down> ), where a=1+i and b=2-i.

To find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, we need to compute the overlap of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

Let me compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x>.

First, compute <+x|alpha>:

= [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)*sqrt
