Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for each step. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, with a reagent A, to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, especially under certain conditions, it's probably a nucleophilic substitution or maybe an addition. Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, so maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right, cyanohydrin formation! That's when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a nitrile in the presence of an acid catalyst. So the reaction would be something like ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin.

So what's the catalyst here? NaCN is probably providing the CN- nucleophile. But for the cyanohydrin formation, I think you need an acid. Because the acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack. So reagent A is likely an acid. Looking at the options, the possible A's are H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, and NaHSO3 is a weaker acid, like sulfurous acid. So in the first reaction, A is probably H3O+.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility: sometimes, when dealing with nitriles, maybe a different catalyst is used. But I'm pretty confident for cyanohydrin, it's an acid. So A is H3O+.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B and water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen? I think nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. The standard oxidizing agents for that are things like KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or maybe other strong oxidizing agents.

Wait, but the reagent B is in the presence of water. So maybe it's a hydrolysis followed by oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis of the nitrile to a
