Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question starts by talking about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. That probably means X is a compound where one of the elements has an isotope with a higher atomic mass. For example, something like H2O would be X if the oxygen was a heavier isotope, like O-18 instead of O-16.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has molecules where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Hmm, that's interesting. So each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think about possible gases like that. 

Wait, like maybe CO2? No, wait. Oh, wait, the molecule itself must have equal protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, sum of protons equals sum of neutrons. Let's see—what gases are produced in reactions like this? Common possibilities are CO2, H2, O2, maybe NH3? Let me check which of these fit.

For example, H2: each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't fit because 2 protons don't equal 0 neutrons. O2: each O has 8 protons. So two O atoms would be 16 protons. Neutrons per O is 8 normally (for O-16), so two O would be 16 neutrons. So total protons in O2 is 16, neutrons in O2 is 16. Oh, that fits! So W could be O2. Or maybe CO2? Wait, CO2 has one C and two O. C has 6 protons, each O has 8. So total protons in CO2 would be 6 + 8*2 = 22. Each C is 6, and each O has 8 neutrons (if it's O-16), so total neutrons would be 6 (from C) + 8*2 = 22. Oh, that also fits! So CO2 could be W. Or maybe something else like CH4? No, because 1 C (6) and 4 H (1 each) would give 10 protons. Each H is 0 neutrons, and C is 6 neutrons (if it's C-12) so total neutrons would be 6 + 0 = 6. 10 protons vs 6 neutrons—doesn't match. So maybe O2 or CO2 is W.

Moving on, when X reacts with Y, a precipitate G forms. When heated, G releases B, and B's melting point is about 277 K. Let's see, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B is a solid at room temperature (as melting point is around 4°C). What substances have that melting point? Maybe something like ice? No, ice melts at 0 C. Wait, 277 K is 4°C (because 273 K is 0°C). So B is a solid that melts
