Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think it through. Alright, the setup is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

So the problem describes an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside this conductor, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is located a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. There's also an angle Î¸ between l and s. 

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors, charges reside on the surfaces, and when there's a cavity, the charges inside the cavity induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, but the conductor itself was uncharged initially. Oh right, so if the conductor is neutral, the charges induced by the inner charge must balance each other out.

Wait, so when you have a charge +q inside the cavity, it induces a charge -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge +q to balance that. Oh but wait, the conductor was uncharged. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer has +q, making the total charge zero. Right, because the conductor itself is neutral.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere. So the charges on the outer surface of the conductor would distribute themselves uniformly because of the spherical symmetry. So the outer surface has a charge +q, and that would be spherically symmetric, meaning the electric field outside the conductor would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Oh, that's right. So for points outside the conductor (like point P), the electric field is due to the charge on the outer surface, which is +q. 

Wait, but point P is outside the conductor, so the field at P would be as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. So the distance from P to the center of the conductor is L. So the electric field at P would be E = (1
