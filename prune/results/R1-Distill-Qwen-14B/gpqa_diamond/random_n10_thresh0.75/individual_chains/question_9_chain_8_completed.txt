Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because symmetry questions can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3H symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3H symmetry means it has a three-fold axis of rotation, and the molecule looks the same after a 120-degree rotation. Also, H symmetry usually refers to having a horizontal mirror plane, but wait, no—wait, actually, when they denote symmetry elements, the H in C3H might refer to the combination of a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. Or maybe it's just that the point group is C3h. Oh right, the point group for a molecule with a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane is C3h. So the molecule must have a three-fold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane.

So, the options are triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[...]trifuran-something. And the choices are A, B, C, D.

I need to figure out each molecule's symmetry.

Let me think about each molecule:

1. Triisopropyl borate: I remember that triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure around the boron. The molecule has three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Isopropyl groups are in a trigonal planar arrangement, so the molecule should have three-fold rotational symmetry. But what about the mirror planes? Wait, in a trigonal planar molecule, there are three mirror planes, each passing through a bond and the center. So the point group is D3h. But wait, D3h includes a horizontal mirror plane? Or is that the case? Hmm. Wait, the point group D3h has a horizontal mirror. So the molecule would have C3 symmetry, and also a horizontal mirror. So it has C3h symmetry. So this molecule might be a candidate.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, triisopropyl borate is known to have a trigonal planar structure with three isopropyl groups, which are all the same, so it should have a three-fold axis. So yes, that's C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I think in D3h, yes, there are multiple mirror planes, including a horizontal one. So this might have C3h symmetry.

2. Quinuclidine: Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine. Its structure is a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane with an amine group. Wait, no, quinuclidine is a norbornane derivative. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. I think. Or is that adamantane? No, adamantane is [3.3.1], but quinuclidine is [2.2.2]octane with an amine. Wait, the structure is a bridge structure with three bridges, each of two carbons. So the molecule is symmetric. Let me think about its symmetry. It has a C3 axis? Because the three bridges can be rotated 120 degrees, so yes. So it has a three-fold rotation axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Because if it's symmetric in that way, the mirror plane would pass through the middle. For instance, in quinuclidine, the molecule is symmetric with a plane that is horizontal relative to the nitrogen. So maybe it has C3h symmetry as well. Wait, but I'm not so sure. Quinuclidine is a tricyclic compound, but I think its symmetry might be higher. Wait, the point group of quinuclidine is Td, which is tetrahedral symmetry. Wait, no, that can't be right because it's a bridged structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a point group of D3h. Or perhaps C3h? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about this. Let me think again. Quinuclidine has a central nitrogen with three bridges. Each bridge is identical, so rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. So it has a C3 axis. And does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If you can imagine a plane cutting through the nitrogen and the center of the molecule, perhaps that's a horizontal mirror. So yes, it would have a horizontal mirror. So that would make its point group C3h.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky on quinuclidine's point group. Let me recall. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with an amine group. Its structure is symmetric, and I think it has a three-fold axis. But the presence of a mirror plane... I think it does have a horizontal mirror plane. So both triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine might have C3h symmetry.

3. The third molecule is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Benzo fused with three furans. Hmm. Trying to imagine the structure. It's a benzo-fused trifuran system, with ketone groups. So the molecule has three furan rings attached to a benzene ring. Wait, no, maybe the benzene is part of the fused system. Let me try to visualize. The numbering suggests it's a tricyclic structure, perhaps with a central benzene ring and three furan substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a norbornene-like structure with three furan rings. Wait, I'm not so sure. Alternatively, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran would be a system where three furans are fused to a benzene ring. So the benzene is fused to each of the three furans. That would create a molecule with three furan rings attached to the benzene, each in a way that the benzene is shared between two furans. Wait, maybe it's similar to a tricyclic system where the benzene is at the center.

But regardless of the exact structure, the symmetry would depend on how the substituents are arranged. If the three furan groups are arranged symmetrically around the benzene, then the molecule might have three-fold rotational symmetry. But wait, the substituents on the benzene would have to be equally spaced. For example, if the three furans are attached at 120-degree intervals, then the molecule might have a C3 axis. Also, if the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane, that would make it C3h.

Alternatively, the molecule might not have a mirror plane because of the arrangement of the substituents. For example, if the substituents are in a trigonal planar arrangement, then perhaps it does have a mirror plane.

Alternatively, if the molecule is more like a hexagonal system with three substituents, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

4. The fourth option is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. So this seems similar to option B but with triphenylene instead of benzene. Triphenylene is a tricyclic system where three benzene rings are fused in a way that forms a sort of triangular structure. So the triphenylene is attached to a trifuran system. So the molecule would have the trifuran rings fused to a triphenylene core. That would likely create a structure with more symmetry.

If the triphenylene is symmetric, and the trifuran groups are arranged symmetrically around it, then this molecule might have a higher symmetry, perhaps C3h. But I'm not certain.

Let me go back and think about each option's point group.

Starting with Option C: triisopropyl borate. As I thought earlier, the structure is trigonal planar around the boron atom. The three isopropyl groups are attached to boron with 120-degree angles between them. So the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. Additionally, each of the isopropyl groups has internal symmetry, but that doesn't affect the overall symmetry. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. If I imagine the molecule looking down the three-fold axis, each isopropyl group is in a plane. So if there's a plane that is perpendicular to the three-fold axis and passes through the boron, that would be a vertical plane, but for a horizontal mirror, I think this molecule doesn't have one. Wait, wait. Wait, a horizontal mirror plane would be a plane that's parallel to the base. But in the case of triisopropyl borate, if the three-fold axis is vertical, a horizontal mirror plane would need to be a plane perpendicular to the vertical axis. Wait, perhaps the mirror plane is horizontal, meaning it's parallel to the plane formed by the three substituents. So if you have a three-fold axis (let's say vertical), a horizontal mirror plane would lie perpendicular to that, perhaps cutting through the boron. Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate has a horizontal mirror plane. I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane because the molecule is trigonal planar but not symmetric in a way that allows for a horizontal reflection.

Wait, another approach: the point group of triisopropyl borate. So trigonal planar molecules typically have a point group of D3h. Because they have a C3 axis, three mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, wait, D3h has a horizontal mirror. So if that's the case, then the point group is D3h, which includes the C3h symmetry. So the molecule does have C3h symmetry, so it would satisfy the condition.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate has a higher symmetry, but I think D3h is correct.

Option D: quinuclidine. As I thought earlier, it's a bicyclic compound with a three-fold rotational axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I think quinuclidine has a C3h symmetry. Because the molecule is symmetric upon 120-degree rotation, and it has a mirror plane, making the point group C3h.

Wait, but another thought: if the molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then the point group is C3h. But if it also has vertical mirror planes, then the point group is D3h, which is higher symmetry. So I need to determine which applies.

Quinuclidine's structure: it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with an amine group. The molecule has a trigonal arrangement, with the amine in the center and three bridges. Each bridge is identical. So for each of the three bridges, rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. So that's the C3 axis.

Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let's say the C3 axis is along the line perpendicular to the amine's plane. Then a horizontal mirror plane would pass through the amine and the center. So if you look along the C3 axis, a horizontal plane could reflect the molecule. But does that plane exist?

Wait, imagine looking at the molecule along the three-fold axis. The three bridges would look identical, each in a plane. So a mirror plane that is horizontal and cuts through the amine would reflect each bridge onto itself. Because each bridge is identical, yes, that mirror plane exists.

So quinuclidine does have a horizontal mirror plane along with the C3 axis, so its point group is C3h. So both triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the question asks which of the following molecules has C3h symmetry. So if both have it, then I'm missing something.

Wait, no, perhaps one of them doesn't. Let me double-check.

Triisopropyl borate: Structure is trigonal planar around B, with three isopropyl groups. So the arrangement is trigonal, each group at 120 degrees. The point group would be D3h, which includes C3h. So it does have C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: As discussed, has C3h symmetry. So both options C and D have C3h symmetry. But that can't be right because the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer.

Wait, no. Let me recheck the options. The options are labeled A to D, each corresponding to a molecule.

The options are:

A) triphenyleno...

B) benzo...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So the options are: C and D are the first two, and the question is which of these four has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but if both C and D have C3h symmetry, then the question is wrong. Which can't be the case. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the point groups. Let's think again.

Point group C3h: a three-fold axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule looks the same after a 120-degree rotation and upon reflection in a horizontal plane.

D3h: includes a C3 axis, three vertical mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. So D3h is a higher symmetry than C3h.

So triisopropyl borate is D3h, which includes the C3h symmetry. So it does have C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: if it's D3h, then it also has C3h. But if its point group is C3h, then it only has the C3 axis and the horizontal mirror, but not the vertical mirrors.

Wait, but quinuclidine's structure has three bridges that are identical. So if you have a vertical mirror plane that bisects each bridge, then yes, it would have those as well. So the point group would be D3h.

Wait, that's conflicting. So if that's the case, then both C and D have D3h symmetry, which includes C3h, but the question is only asking for C3h. So any molecule with C3h or higher symmetry would satisfy the condition.

But the question only gives four options, and perhaps only one has C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the options has only C3 but no horizontal mirror, so it doesn't have C3h.

Wait, let me think about quinuclidine again. If the molecule has three identical bridges, then it must have three vertical mirror planes, each bisecting a bridge. So the point group would be D3h, which includes C3h.

So both triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine have D3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait, another approach: maybe triisopropyl borate doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Let me think about the structure. Triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule with three isopropyl groups attached to B. The B atom is at the center, and the substituents are arranged in a triangle. If you imagine looking down the C3 axis (the vertical axis through B), each isopropyl group is in a plane. So a horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to the C3 axis. Wait, no. A horizontal plane would be parallel to the plane formed by the substituents. So if the molecule is in the plane of the paper (the substituents are on the paper), then the horizontal mirror plane would be the same as that plane. But in reality, the molecule is planar, so any reflection in that plane would leave the molecule unchanged. So yes, it has a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but in a trigonal planar molecule, the point group is D3h, which includes the C3h symmetry. So yes, triisopropyl borate has C3h.

Similarly, quinuclidine has D3h symmetry, so it also has C3h.

But that would make both options C and D correct, which can't be the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me check the question again. It says, "which of the following molecules has C3H symmetry?" Wait, maybe the question is referring to a horizontal mirror plane. So in that case, the point group is C3h.

Wait, but if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it also has C3h. So the question is, which molecule has at least C3h symmetry. So both C and D would be correct, but that can't be.

But the options only have four, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing the symmetry of triisopropyl borate. Let me think again. Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure. The molecule is planar, so any reflection in the plane would leave it unchanged. So yes, it has a horizontal mirror plane (the same plane as the molecule lies in). So its point group is D3h, which includes C3h.

Quinuclidine, on the other hand, is a non-planar molecule. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with an amine. It's a three-dimensional structure. So it's not planar. Therefore, it might have a horizontal mirror plane, but not the same as the plane of the molecule. Wait, but if the molecule is symmetric upon reflection in a horizontal plane, then yes, it has a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the structure again. If the molecule is bridged, like a triangle, then a horizontal plane cutting through the center would reflect each bridge onto itself. So yes, a horizontal mirror plane exists.

Alternatively, perhaps only triisopropyl borate has a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the other options. Let's see, options A and B are the benzo and triphenylene derivatives.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

If the molecule has three ketone groups and three furan rings, arranged around a benzene ring, perhaps the arrangement is symmetric. If the three furans are arranged at 120-degree intervals around the benzene, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis. Also, if there's a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

But looking at the substituents, each furan ring would be attached in a way that their positions are equivalent. So perhaps it has three-fold symmetry with a horizontal mirror. So maybe this molecule also has C3h symmetry.

But I'm not sure if the benzo-fused system allows for a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule lacks a mirror plane, so it only has C3 symmetry.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Triphenylene is a fused tricyclic benzene system. When fused with trifuran, the molecule could be symmetric. If the three furan rings are attached to the triphenylene core in a symmetric fashion, then the molecule would have three-fold symmetry. Also, a horizontal mirror plane would likely exist. So this molecule could have C3h symmetry.

But I'm not certain about the exact structure. It's possible that option A has higher symmetry, but without the structure image, it's hard to tell.

So, considering all this, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps only option D has C3h.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about what each option is supposed to have.

The question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So which of these has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

If triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h, then option C is correct.

Wait, but the options are labeled A, B, C, D.

Looking back, the options:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran...

B) benzo[...]trifuran...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, if both C and D have C3h symmetry, then the question is wrong. But since it's a multiple-choice question, only one option is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing one of them.

Wait, perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Let me think again. Quinuclidine's structure is a bridge bicyclic compound. If you imagine looking along the C3 axis, each bridge is in a different orientation. So, does a horizontal mirror plane exist? Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric across a plane that is not horizontal. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Let me think of its structure. It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with an amine at the bridgehead. The molecule is chiral, isn't it? Wait, no, wait, quinuclidine is actually a chiral molecule because the nitrogen is at a bridgehead, making it impossible for the molecule to have a plane of symmetry. Wait, that's a possibility.

Wait, if the molecule is chiral, it can't have a plane of symmetry because that would make it achiral. So perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane, making its point group C3 instead of C3h.

Wait, that would make sense. Because if the molecule is chiral, it lacks any planes of symmetry. So quinuclidine's point group would be C3, without the horizontal mirror.

But earlier, I thought quinuclidine has a mirror plane, but perhaps that's incorrect. Let me think: the molecule has three identical bridge structures. If the molecule is symmetric upon a 120-degree rotation, it has a C3 axis. However, if it's chiral, it can't have a plane of symmetry. So maybe it doesn't have a mirror plane, so its point group is C3, not C3h.

In that case, triisopropyl borate would have D3h, which includes C3h, so option C would be correct.

Wait, but another thought: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral. So if quinuclidine is chiral, it can't have any mirror planes. Therefore, its point group is C3, not C3h.

So, that would leave option C, triisopropyl borate, as the correct answer, because it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

But wait, another point: triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule, so yes, it has a horizontal mirror plane. Quinuclidine is a three-dimensional, non-planar molecule, which is chiral, so it doesn't have a mirror plane. Therefore, only option C has C3h symmetry.

So the answer would be option C.


To determine which molecule has **C3h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C3h** symmetry requires the presence of a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Below is the analysis of each option:

---

### **Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule consists of a triphenylene core fused with a trifuran system. The triphenylene core is symmetric, and the trifuran substituents are arranged symmetrically around it. This arrangement suggests the presence of a three-fold rotational axis (C3). However, the exact structure does not clearly indicate the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Thus, there is insufficient evidence to confirm **C3h** symmetry for this molecule.

---

### **Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system with ketone groups. The three furan rings are arranged around the benzene core, potentially providing a three-fold rotational axis (C3). However, the fused benzo system does not clearly support a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, this molecule likely lacks **C3h** symmetry.

---

### **Option C: triisopropyl borate**
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure with three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron atom. The molecule has a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which lies in the plane of the molecule. This satisfies the criteria for **C3h** symmetry. Additionally, the point group of this molecule is **D3h**, which includes **C3h** as a subset. Thus, this molecule has **C3h** symmetry.

---

### **Option D: quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with an amine group at the bridgehead. While it has a three-fold rotational axis (C3), its non-planar, three-dimensional structure makes it chiral. Chiral molecules lack any mirror planes, including a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, quinuclidine does not have **C3h** symmetry.

---

### **Conclusion**
Among the given options, only **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) has both a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), satisfying the criteria for **C3h** symmetry.

**Answer: C**
