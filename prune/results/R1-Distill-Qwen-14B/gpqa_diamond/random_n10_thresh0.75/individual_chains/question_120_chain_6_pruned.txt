Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in all directions. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, so I need to figure out which exponent is correct.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So if a star has a parallax plx, its distance d is 1/plx parsecs. Right, the formula is d = 1/plx.

But how does this relate to the number of stars? The problem is about counting how many stars fall into a certain range of parallax. Let me think about the distribution. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a region depends on the volume of that region.

The parallax plx is a function of distance. Parallax decreases as distance increases. So a larger plx means closer stars, and smaller plx means they're farther away.

I need to express the number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd. Since d = 1/plx, a change in plx (dplx) corresponds to a change in d. Let me think: plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking the derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since I'm looking for a positive change in distance, maybe I can relate a small change in plx to a small change in d.

Alternatively, I can model it in terms of plx. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to the volume, assuming uniform density.

But how does this translate into parallax terms? Let's substitute d in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but since plx is decreasing as d increases, when d increases by dd, plx decreases. So for a thin shell in terms of plx, say between plx and plx + dplx, the corresponding distance is from d=1/plx to d=1/(plx + dplx). Hmm, maybe it's easier to express the
