Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about molecular symmetry. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3H symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that C3H symmetry refers to a molecule that has a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. Oh right, C3H is a point group. The point groups are determined based on the symmetry elements present. C3H would have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Or wait, maybe I got that mixed up. Let me think. The point group CnH has an n-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane that includes the rotation axis. So for C3H, you have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's C3v? No, wait, C3v has a vertical mirror plane. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between different point groups.

Wait, maybe I should start by recalling the common point groups. The point groups include things like C1, C2, C3, etc., and then their variants with H or V. For example, C2H has a two-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So C3H would have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

So the molecule must have a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Let me consider each option one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I think that's a structure where boron is connected to three isopropyl groups. Oh wait, triisopropyl borane would be (i-Pr)3B, but in this case, it's the borate, which is (i-Pr)3BO-. Wait, no, wait. Triisopropyl borate is probably (i-PrO)3B, right? So the structure is a central boron atom connected to three isopropyl oxygens.

In terms of symmetry, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule around boron? No, wait, borate is a trigonal planar structure. Each isopropyl group is a substituent. So the molecule would have a trigonal planar geometry, which has a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, the molecule is planar, so looking from the top (the plane of the boron and the oxygens), would there be a horizontal mirror plane? Wait, the molecule's symmetry: if all three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, then yes, it should have a C3 axis and possibly a horizontal mirror plane. Because each substituent is the same, looking at the structure, any horizontal plane that includes the central atom would reflect each substituent onto another. So triisopropyl borate might have C3H symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the other options.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure. Its structure is a norbornane-like molecule but with a bridge, making the molecule have a certain symmetry. Quinuclidine is known for
