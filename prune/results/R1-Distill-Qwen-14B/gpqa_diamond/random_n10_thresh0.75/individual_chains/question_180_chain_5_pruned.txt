Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Alright, let me read it again.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm. So, I'm thinking this has to do with calculating the electric potential energy of the system. Electric potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula for potential energy, right? The formula is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are charges, and r is the distance between them.

But wait, for multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Oh right, so for each charge, I need to calculate how much energy it contributes when placed in the field of the others.

Wait, but here, the setup is that 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th charge is at the center, and the others are arranged around it? But wait, since they're constrained to stay at 2 meters, perhaps they're all at the same distance from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P.

Wait, but then the distance between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge at P is 2 meters. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the central charge. So each pair consisting of the central charge and a surrounding charge contributes some potential energy.

Additionally, the 12 surrounding charges are all 2 meters apart from each other? Or are they all at 2 meters from P but possibly at arbitrary positions? Hmm, that's an important point
