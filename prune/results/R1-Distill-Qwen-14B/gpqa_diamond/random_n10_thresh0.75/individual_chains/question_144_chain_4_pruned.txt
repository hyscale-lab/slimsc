Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X=8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X=320 MeV. The options are A to D, with some very small distances, measured in meters, so like 10^-15 or 10^-16 m.

Alright, I remember that the mean decay distance (or mean proper decay length) is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. But wait, how exactly? Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βc) of the particle. So, the mean decay distance L = βγ c τ. But wait, sometimes I get confused between proper time and lab frame. Let me get this straight.

Wait, another approach: the mean proper lifetime τ is the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. To find the decay length, which is the distance it travels before decaying in the lab frame, I need to calculate τ multiplied by the velocity times c, all divided by the energy or something? Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the decay width and the lifetime.

Oh right! The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The formula is Γ = ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, the units here are crucial. Γ is given in Me
