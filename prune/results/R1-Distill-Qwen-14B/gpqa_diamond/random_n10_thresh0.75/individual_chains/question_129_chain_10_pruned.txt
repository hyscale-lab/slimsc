Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions starting from compound A. The reaction steps are:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

There are some hints provided, which I should definitely consider.

First, let's look at the hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Hmm. Let me think about each part.

Starting with hint a. A reaction of compound A with a phosphorous ylide gives a certain structure. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So, the starting material for the Wittig reaction would be an aldehyde or ketone.

Looking at the product of the Wittig reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The structure probably has a cyclopentane ring with substituents. Let me try to draw this.

Wait, the propan-2-ylidene group is a CH2-C(CH3)= group. So, the substituent is a methylene group attached to a cyclopentane ring at position 4, and there are methyl groups at positions 1 and 2.

So, the structure would have a five-membered ring (cyclopentane). On carbons 1 and 2, there are methyl groups. At position 4, there's a substituent which is the ylidene group from the Wittig. So, the substituent is a CH2-C(CH3) group, but attached via a double bond? Wait, no. Wait, in the Wittig reaction, the ylide has a double bond to the P. When it reacts with a carbonyl, the ylide's R group adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the O becomes part of the leaving group.

Wait, the product would be an alkene. So, the substituent on the cyclopentane is an alkene. So, the structure is 4-(propan-2-ylidene), which is a substituted cyclopentane with a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe it's adding a new substituent with a double bond. So, the product has a cyclopentane ring with methyl groups at 1 and 2, and a substituent at 4 that's a CH2-C(CH3)= group. Hmm, perhaps that's not the exact structure, but what's important is that the Wittig reaction is adding an alkene to the ring.

Wait, but the Wittig reaction is between a ylide and a carbonyl group. So, the original compound A must have a carbony
