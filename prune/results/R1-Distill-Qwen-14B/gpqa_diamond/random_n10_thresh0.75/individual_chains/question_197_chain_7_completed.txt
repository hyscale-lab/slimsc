Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what I can figure out.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different organic compounds. Hmm, right, red phosphorus with HI... Oh wait, that's the Clemmensen reduction, right? Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So if X has a ketone group, then the product would have an alkane where the carbonyl was.

Let me start by analyzing the spectral data for compound X.

First, the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which suggests maybe an O-H stretch, but wait, that region is also where alkenes or maybe alcohols show up. Oh wait, 3400-2500 is a broad range, so maybe it's an O-H from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, another peak is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl peak. So if there's a carbonyl, then maybe the 3400-2500 is an O-H group. That would make sense for a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait. Another thing: 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So compound X likely has an aromatic ring, possibly with substituents. So maybe it's a benzoic acid or something similar.

Now the NMR data. Let's look at it:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typical for a carboxylic acid -OH proton. So that suggests a COOH group.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like para-substituted aromatic protons. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets each integrating to 2H each. So for example, two substituents in para positions, maybe a methyl and something else, or two different groups.

Wait, but wait. If the aromatic region is para-substituted, then the ring is probably 1,4-disubstituted. So if there's a COOH group at position 4, and maybe another substituent at position 1 or 2. Hmm, but looking at the substituents.

Wait, the other peaks:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH adjacent to an oxygen or a CH in a branched chain.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Perhaps another CH2 group, maybe part of a branching.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): That's a triplet of three hydrogens as a doublet? Wait, no, a doublet with 3H. Ah, that's usually a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 or a CH that's branching. Like in isobutyl groups or something similar.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet from a terminal CH3 group. So maybe a ethyl chain or a longer chain attached somewhere.

Putting this together.

The carboxylic acid is at 10.5 ppm. The aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 are para-substituted, so maybe a para-substituted benzoic acid.

Looking at the substituents on the benzene: besides the COOH group, perhaps another substituent. Let's think about the other peaks.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) could be a CH(CH3)2 group, because the methyl groups attached to a CH would split into a doublet. Alternatively, maybe a branching like in iso-butyl.

Wait, looking at the other protons:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – perhaps a CH connected to other groups, maybe a branching point.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – maybe a CH2 group adjacent to branching.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a COOH group and a substituent that's a branch. Let me sketch this out.

If the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 4 and another substituent at position 1, for example. The substituent would have a branching, like perhaps a sec-butyl group: CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3? Or maybe a iso-butyl group?

Wait, another angle: The NMR also shows a triplet at 0.9 (3H), which is typical for a CH2CH2CH3 group. So perhaps an ethyl chain attached to something else.

Wait, let me think about the substituent on the benzene. So if the benzene ring is 4-(something)benzoic acid.

So the substituent is perhaps an iso-butyl group or a sec-butyl group.

Let me think about the structure of the substituent.

If I have a substituent R attached to the benzene ring, and R is a butyl group in some configuration.

Looking at the NMR again:

At 2.9 ppm, multiplet (1H) – perhaps a methylene adjacent to a branching point.

At 1.7 ppm, multiplet (2H) – perhaps another CH2 group.

So maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)2 group? Hmm, not exactly.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that seems a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let's think about the integration:

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a CH(CH3) group, where the CH is next to another CH2 or something.

Wait, let's imagine the substituent is a propyl group, but with branching. For example, the substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, in such a case, the NMR would show:

The CH(CH2CH3) group would have protons that are split into a multiplet. Let's see, the CH2 next to the benzene would have two protons, and the CH group would have two protons, but in the substituent.

Wait, maybe it's better to look at the options.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI to give a product. As I thought earlier, that's the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So compound X must have a ketone group.

Wait wait a second, but looking at the IR data, the 1720 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl. If it's a ketone, that would make sense for Clemmensen. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but maybe the O-H would be broad around 3000. Wait, but the IR also has a peak at 3400–2500 cm-¹, which could be O-H. So if compound X is a ketone, then the options with a ketone are perhaps not among the options. Wait, let me check the options.

Looking at the options, the options A, C have 'propanoic acid' and 'benzoic acid' which are carboxylic acids. But wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which is Clemmensen, which reduces ketones. So if X is a ketone, the product would be an alkane.

But looking at the options, the products are after the reaction, perhaps. Wait, the question is, identify the final product. So X reacts to form one of these.

Wait, no. No, the question says, 'Identify the final product.' So X is the starting material, and the product is one of these. Wait, no, wait, the options are the possible products. So X is the starting compound, which reacts to form one of the options.

Wait, but X is a ketone, and the product would be the corresponding alkane.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps option C is a benzoic acid. So if X is a benzophenone derivative, then after reduction, the product would have a CH2 group instead of the ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the reaction is X plus red phosphorus and HI, which is Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones (RCOR') to alkanes (RCH2R').

So X must have a ketone group. So looking at the NMR and IR data again.

Wait, if in the IR, 1720 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl (C=O), but if it's a ketone, then the O-H in the 3400–2500 cm-1 is perhaps an alcohol or something else. But if X is a ketone, then where is the O-H coming from?

Wait, in the NMR, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet for 1H. That suggests a -COOH group, but wait, if X is a ketone, why would there be a -COOH group? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, let me think again. Maybe the IR data includes both a carbonyl (like a ketone) and perhaps an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3400–2500 is an alkyne C-H stretch? No, usually alkynes have higher wavenumbers, around 3300-2200, but that's more of a C-H stretch. I'm not too sure.

Wait, maybe the 3400–2500 is an O-H stretch, but not from a carboxylic acid. Maybe an alcohol -OH. But in that case, the IR would have a broad peak. But the 1720 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl. So maybe X is an ester or a ketone with an alcohol group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet for 1H, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid's -OH. So perhaps X is a carboxylic acid, but then the reaction with Clemmensen wouldn't make sense because Clemmensen reduces ketones, not carboxylic acids. Wait, no, carboxylic acids can't undergo Clemmensen; they don't have a ketone group.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should reassess.

Let me think: The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI (Clemmensen), so X must have a ketone group. So the IR's 1720 cm⁻¹ is the ketone carbonyl. Then the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ might be an aromatic C-H stretch or maybe an alcohol, but if it's an aromatic ring, that would explain the 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C). So perhaps X is a benzaldehyde or a ketone attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) is a problem because that's a carboxylic acid's -OH. So maybe I'm wrong in thinking that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 is an aromatic proton, but that doesn't fit because aromatic protons are usually around 7 ppm. So maybe the 10.5 is an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but they're deshielded. So that could be an aldehyde proton. But in that case, the IR would show a carbonyl around 1720, which fits a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, but if it's an aldehyde, the IR would have a peak around 2800-2700 cm⁻¹ for the aldehyde C-H stretch, which I don't see here. So maybe it's not an aldehyde.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for other possibilities. Let's think about the NMR.

The 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) could be a phenol -OH. Phenol's -OH is around 5-7 ppm, but sometimes broader and could be shifted. But 10.5 is a bit high, so maybe not.

Wait another thought: Maybe the 10.5 is an acidic proton from another functional group. Like an enolic proton or something else. Hmm, perhaps it's a carbonyl alpha proton, but those are usually around 2-3 ppm.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I need to look at the options to see which one makes sense.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then upon Clemmensen reduction, it would require a ketone group. But wait, benzoic acid doesn't have a ketone. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI is used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So the starting material must have a ketone.

So perhaps X is a ketone, and the product is the corresponding alkane.

Wait, but looking at the options, none are ketones. So perhaps the product is one of these, which would have an alkane group. So perhaps X is a ketone, and upon reduction, it becomes an alkane.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone (like 4-phenylpropanone or something), but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe the structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative. But I'm not sure.

Let me go back to the NMR and see if I can piece together the structure.

The aromatic protons are in two doublets, integrating to 2H each. So the ring must be 1,4-disubstituted. So substituents at positions 1 and 4 (or 2 and 5, but para would be 1,4).

Suppose the substituents are COOH (since 10.5 ppm) and another group, say a sec-butyl group.

So the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that's option C.

But wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then it's a carboxylic acid. But as I thought earlier, Clemmensen would not reduce that because it's not a ketone.

So I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think differently.

Alternative approach: Look for the product structure in the options and see which one would result from a Clemmensen reduction.

Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes.

So, for example, if X is a ketone like (something)CO(something), then the product would have that carbonyl replaced by a CH2 group.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's a benzoic acid. So the only way to get that would be if X was a benzoyl chloride or something, but that's not likely under Clemmensen conditions.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative. Let's say X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone. Upon reduction, it would become 4-(sec-butyl)benzylbenzene, but that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps another angle: The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) which is a terminal CH3, like in an ethyl group. So perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to something.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to another CH2 or similar.

Putting it together, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, that would make it a neopentyl group or something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group.

Let me think: iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the NMR would show:

The CH2 next to the benzene would have protons around 2.9 ppm (as a multiplet for two H), perhaps. The CH(CH3)2 would have a triplet or more complex splitting, but in the NMR, we have a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which would be the two methyl groups attached to the CH.

Wait, maybe more accurately, the iso-butyl group's structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3) ?

No, wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait no, perhaps it's better to think of the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3) group, but that's a pentyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the substituent as a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but that's only two carbons.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the substituent as a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So the substituent would be attached to the benzene ring as -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So the NMR would show:

The CH2 adjacent to the benzene (let's say at 2.9 ppm, m, 1H? No, wait, the CH2 would have two H's, maybe as a triplet or quartet. But in the NMR, we have 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (1H), which is confusing.

Wait, maybe the structure is a phenyl group attached to a ketone, which upon reduction becomes a methylene group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that's longer.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, which is a iso-pentyl group? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group, but again, not matching.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring at position 4, and the ring also has a carboxylic acid group at position 1.

Wait, but if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the reaction with Clemmensen would require a ketone. But this is a carboxylic acid, so I don't think that's right.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to figure out what X is, based on its spectral data.

The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. The 10.5 ppm NMR peak suggests a carboxylic acid. So X must have both a carbonyl (like a ketone) and a carboxylic acid group. But that seems unusual. Wait, is that possible?

Wait, but wait, maybe the 1720 cm⁻¹ is an ester carbonyl, but I don't see the O-H in the ester. Or perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a cinnamic acid derivative, but the IR doesn't show the strong peaks for an unsaturated carbonyl (like around 1680 cm⁻¹ for conjugated carbonyls), but it does have a peak at 1610 and 1450, which are more like aromatic ring vibrations.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a phenyl ketone, like acetophenone but substituted.

Wait, acetophenone's NMR would have a singlet around 2.6 ppm for the CH3 group, but in the data given, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like phenylpropanone, where the ketone is closer to the ring.

Wait, another angle: The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H). That's a terminal CH3, so perhaps an ethyl group is present.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps in a branching.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group somewhere.

Putting together, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like a iso-propyl group.

Wait, but let's try to imagine the structure.

Suppose the benzene has a COOH group and a substituent R.

R is a group with a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- structure?

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, making it a iso-butyl group.

Wait, the iso-butyl group would be -CH2-CH(CH3)2.

So the NMR would have:

The CH2 next to the benzene would be around 2.9 ppm (but as a triplet?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the iso-butyl group would have the following NMR signals:

- The CH2 attached to the benzene (let's call it CH2a) would have two H's, perhaps as a triplet (if next to a CH with two H's), but in the given data, there's a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a single proton. That doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it a iso-propyl group. Then the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) would have a triplet around 1.4 ppm (if the CH3 is attached to CH, which is attached to another CH2).

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. But again, not matching the NMR.

This is getting a bit too complicated. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would have a benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-

But wait, that's a iso-pentyl group. Wait, no. Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. So the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)2

So the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is at the second carbon.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the benzene (CH2a) would be a quartet, as it's attached to a CH that's split into a quartet. But in the data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituent structure wrong.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, it's -CH2-CH(CH3)2. So the CH2 attached to the benzene (CH2a) would have two protons, the CH in the middle (CHb) would have two protons, and the two methyl groups attached to CHb (each CH3).

In NMR, CH2a would show up as a triplet (split by the adjacent CHb), and the CHb would be a septet (due to coupling with both CH2a and the two CH3 groups). But in our data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an iso-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, but that's the same as sec-butyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a neopentyl group (-CH2-C(CH3)2-), but I don't think so because that would have a central carbon attached to two methyl groups.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a tertiary butyl group, but that would have a singlet for the CH3 groups.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a single methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to other groups.

So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would be a iso-butyl group.

Wait, iso-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2.

So, for the substituent iso-butyl:

CH2-CH(CH3)2 attached to the benzene.

The CH2 (next to benzene) would have two protons, which would be a triplet if adjacent to a CH with two protons. The CH in the middle (CH(CH3)2) would have two protons, which would be a septet (coupled with the adjacent CH2 and the two methyl groups). The methyl groups (CH3) attached to the CH would each be a triplet, but because they're equivalent, they might appear as a singlet. Hmm, not sure.

But in the NMR data, we have:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That could be the CH group, but as a multiplet.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Could be the adjacent CH2.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): That would be the methyl groups attached to the CH, but if they are equivalent, they would be a singlet, not a doublet.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group. But that's a neopentyl group, which would have a central CH attached to two ethyl groups. Then the CH would be a singlet, but in the NMR it's a multiplet.

I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should think about the number of signals.

The NMR has 7 different signals.

In the case of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the structure would be:

COOH at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)2.

So the NMR would have:

- COOH -OH at ~10.5 ppm (bs, 1H).

- Aromatic protons as two doublets (8.0 and 7.2 ppm), each 2H.

- CH2 group (attached to benzene) as a triplet (if adjacent to a CH group), around 2.9 ppm (but in data, it's 2.9 as a multiplet, 1H). Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as a propyl group with a methyl branch. Like -CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, that's a iso-butyl group again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but that would have a singlet for the methyl groups, so that doesn't fit the 1.4 ppm doublet.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group, but with a different branching.

Wait, another thought: The NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is likely a -CH- group attached to something. Maybe it's a CH in a -CH(CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2- group, making it a 3-methylbutyl group or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that's a pentyl group.

Hmm, this isn't getting me anywhere. Maybe I should instead think about the IR and NMR together.

The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. The 3400–2500 cm-1 is likely O-H from a carboxylic acid. So X has both a carbonyl and an O-H group. That suggests X is a carboxylic acid with a ketone group? That doesn't make sense because a compound can't have both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group unless it's something like a diketone with a carboxylic acid, which is rare.

Wait, maybe the IR peak at 1720 is an ester or a ketone. If it's a ketone, then the O-H in the IR is from somewhere else. But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is likely a -COOH.

So perhaps X is a ketone and a carboxylic acid. Like a beta-keto carboxylic acid. For example, something like CH3-C(=O)-CH2-COOH. But would that fit the NMR?

The aromatic signals in the NMR are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which suggests an aromatic ring. So X must have a benzene ring as well.

Wait, so maybe X is a benzophenone with a carboxylic acid substituent.

Like 4-phenylpropanoic acid. Hmm, but that's option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Wait, option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Structure would be: CH2(COOH)Ph, where Ph is a 4-ethylphenyl group.

So, the benzene ring is substituted with an ethyl group at position 4 and connected to a propanoic acid group.

So, the structure would be:

Ph-(CH2)2-COOH, where Ph is 4-ethylphenyl.

Wait, no, option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, which would be Ph-CH2-COOH, with Ph being 4-ethylphenyl.

So the structure is:

The benzene ring has an ethyl group at position 4 and is attached via a CH2 group to a propanoic acid (CH2-COOH).

So the NMR would show:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets (since it's para-substituted with ethyl and the CH2-COOH group).

- The CH2 next to the COOH would show up around 2.9 ppm, perhaps as a triplet.

- The COOH proton at 10.5 ppm.

- The ethyl group on the benzene would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

But wait, let's see.

In option A, the substituent on the benzene is an ethyl group at position 4, and the propanoic acid is at position 2 (ortho to the ethyl group? Or para? Wait, no, the propanoic acid is attached via a CH2 group to the benzene, so it's at position 2 relative to the ethyl group.

Wait, actually, the numbering may not be clear. Let's think about the structure as a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4.

Wait, maybe the propanoic acid is attached at position 1, and the ethyl group at position 4.

So the substituents are at positions 1 (CH2-COOH) and 4 (ethyl).

In that case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and protons at 3 and 5 as well, leading to the two doublets in the NMR.

The NMR would show:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): protons adjacent to the substituents.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): protons opposite.

The CH2 group between the benzene and COOH would have protons around 2.9 ppm as a triplet (coupled with the COOH's adjacent CH2?), but I'm not certain.

The ethyl group on the benzene would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (the terminal CH3), a quartet around 1.3 ppm (the CH2 next to the benzene), and a triplet around 1.6 ppm (the CH2 next to the ethyl group). But in the given NMR data, the protons are at 2.9 (1H, m), 1.7 (2H, m), 1.4 (3H, d), and 0.9 (3H, t). Hmm, not matching exactly.

But wait, maybe the substituent is a different branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group attached to the benzene, and the COOH is at the other position.

In that case, the NMR would have signals for the iso-butyl group:

- The CH2 next to the benzene (around 2.9 ppm, but as a triplet or something else).

- The CH group (around 1.7 ppm, as a multiplet for two H's).

- The methyl groups attached to CH (around 1.4 ppm as a doublet).

But I'm not exactly sure.

Another angle: The product after Clemmensen reduction.

Since X is a ketone, the product would be an alkane. So among the options, which one could be the product of a ketone reduction.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. It's a benzoic acid, so it would require the reduction of a ketone benzoate, but Clemmensen doesn't produce acids.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl groups.

But how would that form from a ketone? Suppose X is a toluene derivative with a ketone group in the substituent.

Wait, maybe X is 4-(isobutyl)acetophenone. Then, upon reduction, the ketone (acetophenone part) would become a CH2 group, giving 4-isobutyltoluene, which would be option B? No, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, but that's not matching the data.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to match each option with the reaction.

Clemmensen reduces a ketone to an alkane. So, the product would have a CH2 group where the ketone was.

Looking at the options, which one could be formed from the reduction of a ketone.

Option C is a benzoic acid, which can't come from a ketone reduction.

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So, perhaps X was a 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzophenone, which upon reduction becomes this.

But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, which upon reduction becomes 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, but that's not an option.

Wait, I think I'm going around in circles. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the NMR data and the options.

The NMR data, especially the 10.5 ppm peak, suggests a carboxylic acid. So perhaps X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that's a butyl group. Then, upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI (Clemmensen), which reduces ketones, but X is a carboxylic acid. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction. Is there another reaction that uses red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for reducing carbonyl groups (like ketones and aldehydes) to methylene groups, but in that case, it's under high heat and with a strong base.

Wait, no, the Wolff-Kishner uses NH2NH2 and heat with a base. Clemmensen uses red P and HI, and it's for ketones to alkanes.

So back to the IR and NMR.

If X is a ketone with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid, then the IR would have both 1720 (ketone) and O-H (carboxylic acid) around 3400. But that's a bit unusual, but possible in beta-keto acids.

Beta-keto acids have the structure R-CO-COOH. Their IR would show two carbonyl peaks: one around 1720 (ketone) and another around 1700 (carboxylic acid). The NMR would have the -COOH proton around 10.5 ppm.

So perhaps X is a beta-keto acid.

Looking at the NMR data, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which would fit a -COOH.

The aromatic protons suggest a para-substituted ring. So the beta-keto acid would have a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4.

So perhaps X is 4-phenylpropanoic acid (but that's option A).

Wait, option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

So the structure would be:

Ph-(CH2)2-COOH, where Ph is 4-ethylphenyl.

But how does that fit the NMR data?

The CH2 group between Ph and COOH would have protons that might split into a triplet around 2.9 ppm.

The ethyl group on the benzene would have a CH2CH3 group. The ethyl's CH2 would be a quartet around 1.4 ppm, and the CH3 would be a triplet around 0.9 ppm. But in the given NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, not a CH2.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, such as iso-butyl.

So, in the substituent, the NMR would have:

- The CH2 group next to the benzene (maybe around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet).

- The CH group in the substituent (maybe around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet).

- The methyl groups attached to the CH (1.4 ppm as a doublet).

And the ethyl group (if any) would give the 0.9 ppm triplet.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, leading to 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

But then, how would that form from a ketone? I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, which upon reduction becomes 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But that would be a toluene derivative, and none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cycloketone, but I don't think so.

This is taking too long. I think I'll have to make an educated guess.

The IR suggests a carbonyl and an O-H. The NMR has a broad peak at 10.5, suggesting a -COOH. The aromatic signals suggest a para-substituted ring. The other signals suggest a substituent with branching, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

So option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If X is option C, then what would happen upon Clemmensen? But wait, Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So if X is a benzoic acid, it doesn't have a ketone. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the IR's 1720 is not a ketone but an ester or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1720 cm⁻¹ is a carboxylic acid carbonyl.

But wait, carboxylic acids typically have lower carbonyl frequencies, around 1700 cm⁻¹, and they're broad. The 1720 is more like a ketone or ester.

So perhaps the 1720 is a ketone, and the 10.5 is an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but their protons are deshielded. But then, why is the O-H missing?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options and the reaction.

The product is formed by Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So the product would have a CH2 group where the ketone was.

Looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid, which would require the reduction of a ketone benzoate, which doesn't fit.

Option B is a substituted toluene. If X was a substituted acetophenone, then the product would be a substituted toluene, which is option B or D.

Wait, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So, if X was 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzophenone, upon reduction, the ketone would become a CH2, giving 1-isobutyl-4-methyltoluene, which is option B.

But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzophenone with a substituent, leading to option B as the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but considering the NMR data, which includes a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), that's typical for an ethyl group. So if X has an ethyl substituent, perhaps the product would have that as well.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to go with option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction where compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI (Clemmensen reduction). The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of compound X to deduce its structure.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **IR Data**:
   - A strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, likely a ketone or carboxylic acid.
   - The broad peak in the range **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggests an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) proton.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH group in a branched substituent.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH₂ group in a branched substituent.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet, likely from a methyl group attached to a CH.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a terminal CH₃ group in an ethyl chain.

3. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI**:
   - Clemmensen reduction converts ketones to alkanes by reducing the carbonyl group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂).

### Structural Deduction:
- The IR and NMR data suggest that compound X is a **para-substituted benzoic acid** with a branched alkyl substituent. The substituent is identified as a **sec-butyl group** based on the NMR signals:
  - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** corresponds to the methyl group of the sec-butyl group.
  - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H) and 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** correspond to the CH and CH₂ groups in the sec-butyl chain.
  - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** corresponds to the terminal CH₃ group of the ethyl chain in the sec-butyl group.

Thus, compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction and Final Product:
- Clemmensen reduction targets ketones. However, compound X is a benzoic acid, not a ketone. This creates a contradiction because Clemmensen reduction does not act on carboxylic acids. Therefore, the reaction cannot proceed as described, and the product cannot be determined based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
Based on the spectral data and the reaction conditions, the most consistent structure for compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
