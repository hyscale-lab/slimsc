Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect that movement through shifts in the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both are in circular orbits. So the planets are probably not too massive compared to their stars, but since the method is RV, the shift in the spectral lines is what we're looking at.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7. So the shift is larger for Planet #2. Wait, but how does the shift relate to the planet's orbital period?

I think the Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/( ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(2/3) )) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) ). But wait, since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that part isn't an issue.

But since the planets are Neptune-like, their mass is much less than the star's. So M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies. Let me re-derive this.

The RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K as:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2πc²) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1, so we can ignore that for approximation. So K ≈ ( G * M_p )^(1/3) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * c ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

Wait, maybe I should think of the relation between the velocity shift and the orbital period. Another approach: the star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbital parameters.

The formula I remember is K = (v) where v is the star's velocity due to the planet. The relation between K and the orbital period P is given by the equation that comes from Kepler's laws.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/( (P * (1 - e²))^(1/2) )) ) * (sin i)

But again, if e=0 (circular orbit) and M_p << M_*, then:

K ≈ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_*)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/( (P)^(1/2) )) ) * (sin i )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the dependence of K on the orbital period P. Let's see, K is the velocity of the star, which is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Because from Kepler's third law, P² is proportional to (a³)/(M_*), where a is the semi-major axis. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the formula for K. The formula I remember is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / (2π * c)) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * ( (1) / (P^(1/3)) ) )

Wait, maybe another approach. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) ) * ( (P (1 - e²) ) )^(-1/3) ) )

But again, since e=0 and M_p is much less than M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) ) * (P^(-1/3) )

Assuming sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, which is the best case), so:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p ) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * P^(-1/3)

But wait, in this problem, both stars have the same mass as the Sun (M_* same), and both planets have similar mass (M_p same). So M_p and M_* are the same for both Planet #1 and Planet #2.

Therefore, the ratio of their velocities K1 and K2 will be inversely proportional to the cube root of their periods P. Because:

K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3))

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait. Let me think again.

The formula is K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), so K1 = C / (P1^(1/3)), K2 = C / (P2^(1/3)), where C is a constant.

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3)

We can rearrange this to find the ratio of periods.

But in this problem, K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7. Wait, but in the question, the shift is for the same spectral line. So the shift is proportional to the velocity. So the measured shift is proportional to K.

So the ratio of K's is 5/7. So:

5/7 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

We can cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2 / P1

Which is (125)/(343) ≈ 0.3645.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.3645. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Wait, no. Because P2 is 0.36 * P1, that means P2 is shorter than P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1. The question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 = 0.36 * P1, that would mean the period is shorter. So the ratio would be 0.36, so planet #2's period is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's. So the answer would be 0.36 times longer? No, wait, no. Because the question is phrased as "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1?"

So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's 0.36 times as long. So the planet #2's period is shorter. So the ratio is 0.36. So the answer would be option A, 0.36.

Wait, but let me double-check. The formula we have is K ∝ (1/P^(1/3)). So P ∝ (1/K)^(3).

So the period is proportional to the inverse cube of the velocity semi-amplitude.

So P1 is proportional to (1/K1)^3, P2 is proportional to (1/K2)^3.

So P2/P1 = ( (1/K2)^3 ) / ( (1/K1)^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

Because (1/K2)/(1/K1) )= K1/K2.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Given that K1 is 5 and K2 is7.

So (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1. So planet #2's period is shorter. So the question is how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? The answer is 0.36 times as long, which is option A.

Wait, but the question is about how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1. So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the correct answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the planet. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \), which corresponds to the star's motion, is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \). Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) (5 milliangstroms for Planet #1 and 7 milliangstroms for Planet #2) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for the ratio of orbital periods:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
