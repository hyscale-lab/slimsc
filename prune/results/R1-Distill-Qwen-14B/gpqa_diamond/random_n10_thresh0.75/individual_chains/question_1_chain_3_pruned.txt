Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A) 10^-9 eV, B) 10^-11 eV, C) 10^-4 eV, D) 10^-8 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

In this case, the lifetimes given are the uncertainty in time (Δt) for each state. Wait, but wait—each state has its own lifetime. Oh, but wait, when we're talking about the energy difference between the two states, perhaps we should consider the uncertainty in the energy of each state to determine if they can be distinguished.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference (E2 - E1) between the two states. To distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, I suppose. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty from the lifetimes might make it hard to tell them apart.

So, let me think. For each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime. So for E1 with τ1=1e-9 sec, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and similarly for ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the energy difference should be significantly larger than the uncertainties in each state so that they can be resolved.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and then ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum or something. Or maybe the maximum uncertainty in the energy measurement would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, or perhaps the larger of the two.

Wait, let me think. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, the uncertainty in energy for a state is roughly ħ divided by the lifetime of that state.

So for E1, with τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1), and similarly for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 τ2).

Wait, but let's compute these values. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, perhaps it's better to express ħ in eV·s.

I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 joules. So, let's compute ħ in eV·s.

So, 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s. So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, for E1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16) / 2e-9 = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = let's compute that.

6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV. So about 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2: τ2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 τ2) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 6.582e-8 / 2 = 3.291e-8 eV, which is 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between the two states. Let's call ΔE = |E2 - E1|. For the two states to be distinguishable, ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty in the energy measurement. But which uncertainty should we consider? Because each state has its own uncertainty.

Alternatively, perhaps the lifetime given for each state is the uncertainty in time for each state's energy. So, when measuring the energy, the uncertainty in each is ΔE1 and ΔE2, respectively.

Wait, but if we're comparing the two energies, perhaps the overall uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because if E1 is uncertain by ΔE1 and E2 is uncertain by ΔE2, then the difference E2-E1 would have an uncertainty of sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²), assuming the uncertainties are independent.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you have two quantities, the uncertainty in their difference would be the square root of the sum of squares of their uncertainties. But maybe for approximate calculations, it's acceptable to consider the larger of the two uncertainties, or perhaps the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more about the energy resolution. The energy resolution is determined by the time resolution (lifetime). So, the minimal detectable energy difference should be on the order of ħ/τ, where τ is the time. So, for the system, perhaps the relevant time is the difference in lifetimes? Or perhaps the average?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking which energy difference allows the two levels to be clearly distinguished. So, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. But perhaps the correct way is to use the sum of the uncertainties.

Wait, let me think. Suppose we have two states, each with their own lifetimes. The uncertainty in each state's energy is ΔE1 and ΔE2 as calculated before.

The difference in energies would have an uncertainty of sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²), assuming the uncertainties are uncorrelated. So, to have a clear distinction, the energy difference ΔE should be larger than this value.

So, let's compute sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (1.08
