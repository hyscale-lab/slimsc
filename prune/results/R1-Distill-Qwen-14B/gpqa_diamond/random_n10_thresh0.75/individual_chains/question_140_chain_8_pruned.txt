Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the information given.

The problem mentions Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K, which is around 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, I'm trying to think what melts near that temperature. Maybe something like ice? No, ice melts at 273 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4Â°C, so maybe it's a solid that's close to that. Alternatively, perhaps it's another compound. Let's hold that thought.

The product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So the product has O2 in it. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's similar to a close analog. The options are about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Let me think about possible candidates for Substance X. Since it's used as a reagent in organic chemistry and reacts with a liquid to produce a gas, maybe it's a strong base like sodium or potassium amide, or perhaps something like sodium metal. Wait, but sodium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas. Let me think.

Wait, when a metal reacts with water, it produces H2 gas. But in this case, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. H2 is H2, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So that doesn't fit because neutrons would be zero and protons 1. So each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, which is not equal. So H2 wouldn't work because neutrons are zero.

Wait, another possibility: what if the gas is NH3? No, ammonia has 1 N and 3 H, but the molecule isn't the same for protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like CO2? No, CO2 has 22 neutrons (C=12, O=16 each) and 22 protons? Wait, C has 6 protons, two O have 8 each, so total 20 protons. Neutrons would be 6 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 6 + 32=38. So 20 protons and 38 neutrons. That's not equal.

Wait, another thought: the gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think of a molecule where each atom contributes to that. For example, maybe D2O? No, that's a molecule but not a gas. Wait, if it's something like CH4, but that's four H's. Alternatively, maybe something like O2? O2 has 16 each, so 32 protons and 32 neutrons. Wait, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Wait, 16 each? So 16 protons and 1
