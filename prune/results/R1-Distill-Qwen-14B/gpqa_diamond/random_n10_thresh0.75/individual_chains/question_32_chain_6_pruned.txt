Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons because it's lithium-6 if I'm not mistaken. Oh wait, no, wait. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so it has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that's a total mass number of 3 + 3 = 6. So it's a Li-6 nucleus. Got it. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Now, the problem is finding the energy of the RHIC. So the ions are moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just (1/2)mv² like in classical mechanics. It's got to be the total relativistic energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes the total energy is given as gamma times the rest mass energy.

So the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 c², where m0 is the rest mass. But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider, which I think refers to the kinetic energy the ion has. Wait, no, wait. Actually, sometimes in particle physics, the energy given is the total energy, which includes the rest mass. So I need to clarify that. Let me think.

Wait, the question just says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." I think in colliders, the energy they refer to is the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm. Alternatively, sometimes they give the total energy. Wait, actually, in high-energy physics, the energy quoted is often the kinetic energy. Or wait, no, sometimes the kinetic energy might be part of the total. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

I think the correct approach is to calculate gamma times the rest energy. Because E = gamma m c² is the total energy, which includes the
