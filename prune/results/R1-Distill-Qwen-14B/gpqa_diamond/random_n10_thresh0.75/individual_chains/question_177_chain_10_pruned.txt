Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Radial velocities are zero for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate like black bodies.

Hmm, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature. So the key here is to find the temperature of each star and then compute their luminosities.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, no, wait, no. Because radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Because Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s relative to us. Hmm, so the observed wavelength would be different than the actual emitted wavelength if there's a Doppler shift.

So, the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So if Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength would be shifted. Since Star_1 has a radial velocity of zero, its observed λ_max is the actual λ_max. But Star_2's λ_max is observed with a shift.

Wait, but the problem says both have the same λ as observed. So the observed λ for both is the same. So the actual λ_max emitted by
