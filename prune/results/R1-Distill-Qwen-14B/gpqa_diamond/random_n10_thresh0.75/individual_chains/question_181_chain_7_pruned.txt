Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are still ongoing. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, with various ratios.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. There are different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves reactions that produce higher-energy neutrinos. Specifically, in the pp-III branch, there's this reaction where a boron-8 nucleus captures two protons to form something else, and that emits high-energy neutrinos.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for neutrinos? The pp-III branch is responsible for a certain type of neutrino, called the Beryllium-7 neutrino (Î½pep), which has a higher energy. Wait, no, the main high-energy neutrinos from the Sun are the ones produced in the proton-proton chain via the pep reaction, and also the CNO cycle. But wait, the CNO cycle is another fusion process, but it's more dominant in hotter stars than the Sun. The Sun's energy is mainly from the proton-proton chain, which has two main branches: the dominant pp-I and the less prominent pp-II and pp-III.

Wait, another thought: the energy of the neutrinos depends on the reaction that produces them. The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the pp-III branch leads to higher-energy ones. The main neutrinos we detect from the Sun are the ones from the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction, which is part of the pp-III branch. Oh wait, no, the pep reaction is part of the pp-III branch, and it emits 13.2 keV neutrinos, but I might be mixing up things.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The proton-proton chain has a few steps. The main pp-I branch produces a positron and two neutrinos. The pp-II branch,
