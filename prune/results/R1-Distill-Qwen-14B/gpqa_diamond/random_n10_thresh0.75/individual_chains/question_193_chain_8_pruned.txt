Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, right.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh yeah, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so distance r is 1/plx. So, if I have plx, then r is 1/plx. So, plx is inversely proportional to r.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, I think I need to express N in terms of r instead of plx.

Let me write down the given relationship: N ∝ 1/plx^5.

But since plx = 1/r, substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that.

(1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 over that would be r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Oh wait, wait. Let me be precise.

N ∝ 1/(plx^5) → plx is 1/r, so plx^5 is (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5. So 1/(plx^5) is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. That's option B.

But wait
