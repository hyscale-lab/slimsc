Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I remember that relativistic mechanics come into play here because the speed is a significant fraction of c. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out the rest mass of the nucleus in question. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li typically has 3 protons. Oh wait, let me clarify. The notation can sometimes be confusing. So, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Because 6 is the mass number (3 protons + 3 neutrons). So the nucleus is a lithium-6 ion, which is a charged particle. But for the purpose of calculating energy, I think I just need the rest mass energy.

So the rest mass of a lithium-6 nucleus. I remember that the atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6.017 g/mol. Wait, but I need it in kilograms per nucleus. So let me think: 1 mole is 6.022e23 nuclei. So 6.017 grams is 0.006017 kg. So per nucleus, the mass would be 0.006017 kg / 6.022e23 atoms. Let me compute that.

Mass m = 0.006017 kg / (6.022e23) ≈ 9.99e-27 kg. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 6 grams per mole is 6e-3 kg/mol, so per nucleus, that's 6e-3 / (6.022e23) ≈ 9.96e-27 kg. So approximately 1e-26 kg? Wait, let me recalculate. 0.006017 kg is 6.017e-3 kg. Divide by Avogadro's number: 6.017e-3 / 6.022e23 ≈ 9.99e-27 kg. So about 1e-26 kg? Wait, 1e-26 is 10^-26 kg, which is 1e
