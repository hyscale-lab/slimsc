Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance. The options are from A to D, each a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. So, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 divided by distance (d), or plx = 1/d. Wait, but wait—actually, the formula is plx (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So, d = 1/plx. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Now, the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So for a given distance, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So it's about the change in N with respect to r (distance). Hmm, maybe I need to think about the derivative.

If N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5d^4. But wait, the
