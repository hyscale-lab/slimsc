Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. I need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Hmm, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance (d) for a given plane (hkl) can be found using the formula involving the lattice parameters. But wait, rhombohedral crystals have all edges equal and all angles equal, right? So for a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a special case where a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma. That might simplify things.

Wait, but the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal depends on the type of crystal system. Since it's rhombohedral, I think the formula is similar to the cubic system but adjusted for the angles. Oh wait, in cubic systems, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But when the angles aren't 90 degrees, like in rhombohedral, the formula is a bit more complicated.

I recall the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a² - 2(hk cos gamma)/(ab) + ... Hmm, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula in terms
