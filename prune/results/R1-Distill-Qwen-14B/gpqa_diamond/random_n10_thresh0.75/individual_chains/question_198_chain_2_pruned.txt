Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, I think the blue ones are the ones with two SCN- ligands, right? So that would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. Because I remember that the different complexes have different colors, and the blue ones are the dithiocyanato ones.

So the stability constants given are for different complexes. β1 is for the first complex, which would be Co(SCN), β2 for the second (Co(SCN)2), β3 for the third, and β4 for the fourth. Or wait, maybe the numbering is different because sometimes they might be ordered by stability. Let me check the stability constants. Oh, β3 is the largest at 63. So the most stable is the third complex, which would be Co(SCN)_3^3-? Or wait, maybe it's Co(SCN)_n^(charge). Hmm, I might be getting confused here.

Wait, stability constant (β) is for the formation of the complex. For a complex like Co(SCN)_n, the β would be [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co][SCN]^n). So higher β means more stable complex. So the order is β3=63 is the largest, then β2=40, then β4=16, and β1=9 is the smallest. So the most stable is Co(SCN)_3^3−?

Wait, but the question is about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ions. So that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. So that would correspond to β2=40. Hmm, but wait, the options are about the percentage of blue complexes. I think the blue ones are either the tetracyanonickelate or another complex, but in this case, for cobalt, the blue is likely the dithiocyanato. So the percentage we're looking for is the fraction of Co(SCN)_2^2+ in the solution.

But how do I calculate that? I think I need to calculate the distribution of each complex and find out what fraction is the dithiocyanato one.

So, the total cobalt species would be the sum of all possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ions. Because Co can form Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4, etc., but given the β values, probably up to four. Wait, the β4 is given as 16, which is lower than β3 and β2. So the most prevalent would be the one with the highest β, which is β3=63. So Co(SCN)_3^3− would be
