Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember from my studies that SMEFT is a framework where you consider all possible higher-dimensional operators that could modify the Standard Model. These operators are classified based on certain symmetries.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let's think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames. In the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry, so the SMEFT should maintain that. So any operator in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant, right? So that's a must, so symmetry 1 is definitely required.

Next, Poincaré symmetry. Poincaré includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if an operator must respect Poincaré, it's implied that it respects Lorentz as well. Wait, but does SMEFT require operators to be invariant under Poincaré? Because the SMEFT is built as an effective theory, which is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all terms in the Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars, and that includes being translation-invariant, which is part of Poincaré. But wait, some people might say that Poincaré symmetry is automatically satisfied if the theory is Lorentz invariant and the operators are built as local terms. Or does SMEFT explicitly require Poincaré symmetry? I'm a bit confused here. I think in SMEFT, the operators are local and part of a Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian, so they must respect Poincaré. So symmetry 2 is also required. So both 1 and 2 are required. Wait, but wait. Wait, Lorentz symmetry is a subset of Poincaré. So if the operators respect Poincaré, they automatically respect Lorentz. But the question is phrased as which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if all operators must respect Poincaré, that would include Lorentz. But the question lists Lorentz and Poincare as separate options. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT operators are automatically Poincaré-invariant because they
