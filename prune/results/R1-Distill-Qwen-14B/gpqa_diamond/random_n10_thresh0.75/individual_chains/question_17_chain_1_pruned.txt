Alright, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Okay, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given information is that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, the temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant (K) tells us about the stability of that complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, that's the concentration of the complex itself. But I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because EDTA binds Ca²+ to form the complex, the free calcium concentration should be pretty low, right?

I think the relationship here involves the formation constant. The formation constant K is given by the formula K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, at a given pH, the concentration of EDTA^4- might not be the same as the total EDTA concentration because EDTA can have different protonation states. But the problem states that the pH is ideal, so perhaps we can assume that all the EDTA is in the form that can bind to Ca²+? Or maybe the pH is adjusted such that the concentration of EDTA^4- is known.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't give me the pH, but says the pH is ideal. Maybe that means we can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4- is equal to the concentration of free EDTA in solution. Or perhaps, given that the pH is optimal, the fraction of EDTA in the form that can bind to Ca²+ is 100%. Or maybe, since the pH is ideal, the concentration of EDTA^4- is known and we can proceed. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but another approach: considering that the Ca-EDTA complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The problem says the solution is 0.02 M
