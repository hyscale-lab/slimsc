Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a reaction involving Substance X and Liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases gas B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to make a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and we need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, I'll try to figure out what each part refers to.

Starting with the reaction: X reacts violently with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and perhaps another product. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for a molecule, each atom in it would have to have equal protons and neutrons. Or maybe the molecule overall?

Wait, the question says the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for each molecule, the sum of all protons equals the sum of all neutrons. So, for example, if it's a diatomic molecule, each atom would have (sum of protons) = (sum of neutrons). Let's think about possible gases. Could it be H2O, NH3, CH4, O2, etc.?

Wait, H2O: Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons (if considering light isotopes), O has 8 protons. So in H2O, total protons would be 2+8=10. Neutrons: each H has 0, O has 8 (since oxygen-16 has 8 neutrons). So total neutrons would be 8. But 10 !=8, so that doesn't fit.

What about CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, two O's have 8 each. So protons: 6 + 8*2=22. Neutrons: Carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, O-16 has 8 each. So 6 + 8*2 = 22. So 22 protons and
