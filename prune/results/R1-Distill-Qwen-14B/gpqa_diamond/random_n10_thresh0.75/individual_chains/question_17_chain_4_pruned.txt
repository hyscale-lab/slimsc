Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. The question says we have a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that formation constants have to do with how much a metal ion binds with a ligand. EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So Ca-EDTA complex would form when Ca²+ binds with EDTA^4-.

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in solution, the EDTA is usually in various protonated forms. Oh, but in this problem, the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is mostly in the Y^4- form, so we don't have to worry about the different protonation states. That simplifies things.

So the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Because each mole of CaEDTA^2- releases one mole of Ca²+ when it dissociates.

Wait, but the complex is dissociating to some extent. So the dissociation reaction is CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. Alternatively, the dissociation constant would be the inverse, 1/K. Because K for formation is [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]), so K_dissociation is 1/K.

So K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]) =5e10. But when it dissociates, it's [Ca][EDTA]/[CaEDTA] = 1/(5e10).

But wait, in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote x as the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. So, when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. When it dissociates, let's say x is the amount that dissociates. Then, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] =x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. But since K is very large (5e10), the dissociation is minimal. That means x will be very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the expression becomes [Ca][EDTA]/[CaEDTA] = (x)(x)/(0.02) ≈ (x²)/0.02 = 1/(5e10).

Wait, because K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]) =5e10, so 1/K is 2e-11. So,

x² / 0.02 = 2e
