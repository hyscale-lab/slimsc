Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So, wait, e is the elementary charge, right? Which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each particle has a charge of 2e, which would be about 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, the setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, in Joules.

Hmm. So I'm thinking this is an electrostatics problem, probably involving electric potential energy. Since it's an isolated system, I don't have to worry about any external fields, just the interactions between these charges.

Wait, the system's energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges, right? But since the system is isolated and these are point charges, the potential energy comes from their mutual interactions.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges at 2 meters away would have some potential energy with the 13th charge at P.

But wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So all the 12 are at the same distance from the 13th charge. So their positions are all symmetric, maybe arranged in some way that the distance from each to P is 2m.

So the total potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, since the 13th is fixed, the only interactions that contribute are between it and each of the 12, right? Because the other 12 are fixed at 2m from P, but their mutual distances aren't specified. Hmm, but wait, the problem says it's an isolated system, so I think I'm supposed to consider all pairwise interactions. But wait, but the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but they aren't necessarily
