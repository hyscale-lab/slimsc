Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about the luminosities of two stars. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but wait, the problem is about luminosities, so I'm not sure if the mass comes into play here. Maybe it's just extra info? Or perhaps it's relevant for another part, like maybe the velocity? Hmm.

The spectroscopy part says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant, approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T would be the same since T is inversely proportional to λ_max. So both stars have the same temperature.

Now, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, so it's not moving towards or away from us much. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but wait, how does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, it's about the Doppler shift. If a star is moving towards us, the light gets blueshifted (shorter wavelength), and if moving away, redshifted (longer wavelength). But in the problem, the brightest wavelengths are the same. So maybe the Doppler shift doesn't affect the peak emission? Or perhaps the question is already considering the observed wavelength, so Star_2's light has been shifted, but the peak is measured as the same as Star_1's.

Wait, but when you have a Doppler shift, the actual peak wavelength of the star's emission is different. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its emitted peak would be at a shorter wavelength. But when we observe it, the wavelength would be blueshifted. Conversely, if it's moving away, the observed wavelength would be longer. But in the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So maybe the Doppler effect is already accounted for in the observed wavelengths. So the actual emitted wavelengths of the two stars might be different, but their observed wavelengths are
