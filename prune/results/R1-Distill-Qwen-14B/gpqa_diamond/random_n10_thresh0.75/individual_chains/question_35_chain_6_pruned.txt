Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. I remember that angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are represented by matrices, and their eigenvalues correspond to the possible values of the angular momentum component.

So, the given operator Ay is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh yeah, that's the Pauli matrix for the y-component, sigma_y. I think the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and are used in spin-½ systems.

The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector. So, to find the eigenvalues, I can set up the characteristic equation by finding the determinant of (Ay - a I) where I is the identity matrix.

First, let's write out Ay. Since Ay = c * S, and S is the sigma_y matrix, which is:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

So, multiplying by c, Ay becomes:

Ay = [ [0, -i c],
        [i c, 0] ]

c is h/(4π), so substituting that:

Ay = [ [0, -(i h)/(4π)],
        [(i h)/(4π), 0] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I'll compute the determinant of (Ay - a I) which should equal zero.

So, the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ [-a, -(i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h)/(4π) ) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

Let me compute that. The first term is a². The second term is (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) )= multiply them. Let's see, i*(-i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So, (h^2)/( (4π)^2 ) multiplied by 1.

So determinant = a² - (h^2)/(16 π² ) = 0.

Setting this to zero for eigenvalues: a² = (h²)/(16 π² )

Taking square roots: a = ± h/(4 π)

Wait, that's for the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π). Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which doesn't make sense because eigenvalues for angular momentum should be real, right? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, no, no. Oh wait no, in this case, the eigenvalues are real numbers because they're the possible values of the component of angular momentum. So the eigenvalues should be real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B which talk about imaginary parts don't seem right.

Wait, but option B's eigenvalues are 1/2 and -1/2, which would be if c were 1/2, but I don't think that's the case here. Wait, what's the value of c? c is h/(4π), so when we have Ay = c S, and S has eigenvalues ±1/2. Wait, no, wait. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1, right? Because for sigma matrices, we have sigma_y acting on spin-1/2 particles, so the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, but in this case, maybe the units are adjusted.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me clarify: The intrinsic angular momentum operator for a spin-1/2 particle (like a muon) has components proportional to the Pauli matrices. The actual formula for the operator is usually (ħ/2) sigma, but here, the problem says Ay = c S, with c
