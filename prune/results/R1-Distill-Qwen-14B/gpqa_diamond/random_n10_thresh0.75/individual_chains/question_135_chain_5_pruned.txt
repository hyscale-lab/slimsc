Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it. Alright, the problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think that represents some kind of interaction term between the boson X and the fermions ψ_f.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. They're asking about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out what fermion pairs X can decay into, considering their masses.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the fermion masses must be less than half the mass of the boson. Because, in particle physics, the rest mass of the parent must be at least twice the rest mass of the child particles for the decay to be possible. Oh right, because each fermion would take away some energy, so the combined rest mass has to be less than or equal to the parent's mass.

So, X can decay into a pair of fermions ff̄ if 2m_f ≤ m_X. Since m_X is 6 GeV, each fermion must be ≤3 GeV. Let's list the fermion masses I know.

The known fermion masses (in GeV) approximately are:
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV (negligible)
- Muon (μ): ~0.1057 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up (u): ~0.0045 GeV
- Down (d): ~0.0077 GeV
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV (so way above 3 GeV)

Wait, wait. Wait, some of these might be mixed up. Let me double-check. Oh right, the up and down quarks are the lightest, then strange, then charm, bottom, and top. So, the quarks in order from lightest to heaviest:

u: ~2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
d: ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
s: ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
c: ~1.27 GeV
b: ~4.13 GeV
t: ~173 GeV

Leptons: e is about 0.5 MeV, mu ~105 MeV, tau ~1.78 GeV.

So, for X to decay into ff̄, each fermion f must satisfy m_f ≤ 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

So which fermions satisfy m_f ≤ 3 GeV?

Looking at the fermions:

- e: 0.0005 GeV → yes
- μ: 0.1057 GeV → yes
- τ: 1.777 GeV → yes
- u: 0.0022 GeV → yes
- d: 0.0047 GeV → yes
- s: 0.095 GeV → yes
- c: 1.275 GeV → yes
- b: 4.13 GeV → no, since 4.13 > 3
- t: way too big, so no.

So the fermions that can be produced are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. But wait, the interaction term given in the Lagrangian is important. The Lag
