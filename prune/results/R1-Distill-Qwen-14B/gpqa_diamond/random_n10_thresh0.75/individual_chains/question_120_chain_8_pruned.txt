Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think this through.

First, let me recall what parallax means. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star due to Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So, d = 1 / plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes (since they appear to move more as we go around the Sun).

Now, if stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars is constant in space. So, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Hmm.

Let me think about the range of parallax. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so a small range of parallax corresponds to a certain range of distances. Wait, since d = 1/plx, for a small change in plx (dplx), what's the corresponding change in distance (dd)?

Let's compute that. Take the derivative of d with respect to plx:

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

But since we're considering a small change, we can ignore the negative sign and just take absolute values. So, dd ≈ (1/plx²) dplx. So, a small change in parallax (dplx) corresponds to a change in distance of about (1/plx²) times dplx.

Now, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd would be the volume of that shell multiplied by the number density of stars. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (n) is constant.

The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars N in that shell is N = n * 4πd² dd.

But we want the number per unit parallax range, so we're looking at N per dplx. Let's express N in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, let's substitute that in.

N = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, wait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because dd is (1/plx²) dplx, right? So let's re-express this correctly.

We have dd = (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting into N:

N = n * 4π d² dd = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²)

Wait, because (1/plx) squared is (1/plx²), and then multiply by (dplx / plx^2), so that's 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So, N per dplx is (N/dplx) = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx / dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if N = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx, then per unit dplx, it's 4π n / plx^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax range (dplx) is inversely proportional to plx^4.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the substitution. Let me approach it differently.

Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance d. So, d = 1 / plx.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is N = n * 4π d² dd.

But we need to express this in terms of plx. So, since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, and dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Taking absolute values, dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

Substituting into N:

N = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ) 
= n *4π d² dd = n *4π (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²)
= n *4π (d^2) (dd)
= n *4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2)
= n *4π (d^2 dd) → but d^2 dd = (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2) = dplx/(pl x^4)

So, N = n *4π (d^2 dd) = n *4π (d^2) (dd) = n *4π (
