Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again.

The question is about a star with certain parameters. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the problem is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã… (angstroms), which is in the near ultraviolet I think. And it's assumed that the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation for this.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is probably about how the excitation of atoms depends on temperature. Since the star's temperature changes when it has spots, the ratio of the two levels should change based on the temperature. The ratio is n1/n2, where n1 is the number of atoms in level 1 and n2 in level 2.

In LTE, the ratio of populations is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). So the ratio of n1/n2 would be the inverse: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ).

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Let me rephrase: when the star is cooler (5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when it's hotter (6000 K). So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Wait, no, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when there are spots, n1/n2 is lower. So when no spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is (n1/n2 at 6000 K) divided by (n1/n2 at 5500 K). So factor = [ (n1/n2)_6000 ] / [ (n1/n2)_5500 ].

But wait, let me make sure about the ratio. The ratio n1/n2 is the number of atoms in level 1 over level 2. So when the star is hotter, does this ratio increase or decrease? Because higher temperature would mean more excitation, so more atoms in higher energy levels. So if level 2 is higher than level 1, higher temperature would lead to more n2, thus lower n1/n2.

Wait, let's think: if E2 > E1, then the energy difference is positive. So when temperature increases, the exponential term increases, because (E2-E1)/(kT) becomes a smaller positive number, so exp of that would be larger
