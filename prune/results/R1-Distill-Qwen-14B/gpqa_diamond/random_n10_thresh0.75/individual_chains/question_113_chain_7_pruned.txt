Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, let's start by looking at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Also, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 cm-1 peak might be from a conjugated carbonyl group or an aromatic ring, maybe a C=C stretching. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't think that's an option here.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. They mentioned there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has at least one double bond. Also, the presence of multiple peaks suggests a complex structure, perhaps with branching or different types of protons.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I'm not too confident about mass spec, but I remember that m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let's think about possible fragments. For example, the methyl group (CH3) is 15, but 45 is higher. Maybe a ketone fragment? Or perhaps a fragment like CH2O (which is 30, but not 45). Wait, 45 could be something like (CH2)2O or maybe a CH2CH2O group? Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde or a ketone. Wait, another thought: the molecular ion might break into smaller ions. Let's think about common ions. The tropylium ion is a benzene ring with a positive charge, but that's more for aromatic compounds. Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketone or an ester group breaking off.

Now, let's look at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. That's a molecular formula with two oxygens. Possible functional groups could be esters, ketones, maybe an alcohol and a ketone, or two ester groups. Alternatively, a cyclic ether with another group? Or maybe a diol? But the IR showed a broad peak around 3000, which could suggest an OH group. If O2 is present, perhaps a carboxylic acid? Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which is broad. Also, their carbonyl is around 1700. But in this case, our peaks are 1700 and 1650. Alternatively, maybe an ester, because esters can have two carbonyl peaks? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Option B: C6H10O. That's one oxygen. Possible functional groups: an alcohol, an aldehyde, a ketone, an ether, maybe a cyclic ether. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so perhaps an alkene is present. If we have a ketone and a double bond, but with one O, perhaps a cyclic ketone or something similar.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two oxygens. Could be esters, carboxylic acids, a ketone and an alcohol, or maybe an ether and a carbonyl group. The IR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an OH group, so if it's a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The 1700 cm-1 could be the carboxylic acid's carbonyl. If it's an ester, then the carbonyl is around 1700-1750. Wait, but the presence of a conjugated double bond (like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester) could lower the carbonyl stretch to about 1700 and another peak at 1650 for the C=C. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and something else.

Option D: C6H12O. One oxygen. So possible structures include an alcohol with an alkene, maybe a cyclic ether with a substituent, or another group.

Wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so an alkene is present. So the compound is an alkene with some oxygen-containing functional groups.

Let me think about each option's possible structure.

Option A: C6H12O
