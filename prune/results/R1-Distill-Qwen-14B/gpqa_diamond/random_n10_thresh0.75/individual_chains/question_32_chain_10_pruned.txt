Okay, I need to find the energy of the RHIC when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus X is lithium with 3 neutrons, so that's lithium-6, right? Because lithium typically has 3 protons, so 3 + 3 neutrons makes 6 nucleons. So the mass of the nucleus would be 6 atomic mass units (u).

Wait, but wait, atomic mass units. I remember that 1 u is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. And I think the mass of the nucleus is roughly 6 * 1.66e-27 kg. But wait, actually, I should check the exact mass. No, wait, the problem doesn't give a specific mass, so I have to proceed with the assumption that the nucleus has a mass of 6u.

The question is about relativistic energy. The energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy E0 is mc². So E = gamma * m0 c².

First, I need to find gamma when the speed is 0.96c. Gamma, γ, is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me check that again. Yes, because 1/0.28 is the same as 100/28, which is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy is m0 c². The mass m0 is 6u. So I need to find the energy in
