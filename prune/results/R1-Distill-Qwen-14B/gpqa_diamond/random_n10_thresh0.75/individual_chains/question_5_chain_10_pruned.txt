Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with angular momentum operators, the eigenstates are related to the direction of the operator. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle theta (θ) will be measured from the z-axis, right? And phi (φ) would be zero because it's in the x-z plane, so maybe the state doesn't depend on φ. Wait, but the options have some terms with e^{iφ}, so maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P is a vector operator, and when you have an operator along an arbitrary direction n, it's given by P · n, where n is a unit vector. Since n lies in the x-z plane, n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, in the x-z plane, phi would be 0 or 180 degrees, so maybe phi is 0? Or maybe the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because when phi is zero, cosφ is 1, so in x-z plane, n would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because for a unit vector, x = sinθ cosφ, z= cosθ. So if phi is zero, x= sinθ *1, z= cosθ. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Wait, the operator P is a vector, so P = (Px, Py, Pz). So when you're looking for the operator along n, it's P_n = (P · n) = (n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz). But wait, n is in x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

But wait, the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, so n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). And since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Alternatively, P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no. Wait the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So (P · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.
