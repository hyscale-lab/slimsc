Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers can choose to observe that one. Both planets are Earth-like and detected via the RV method, so their minimum masses are known. The question gives some orbital period and star information, so I need to relate that to the transit probability.

Hmm, transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But wait, the RV method detects planets through their Doppler shift, which depends on the planet's mass and orbital period. Since both have the same minimum mass, but different orbital periods.

Wait, the key factors for transit probability. Oh right! The transit probability (P) is approximated by the formula P ≈ (R_p / a)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis. But wait, no, that's the area ratio which affects the depth, not the probability. Oh wait, no, the probability is more about the alignment. Another approach: the geometric probability that the planet's orbit intersects our line of sight. That's P ≈ (R_star / a) * (something?), or maybe (R_star + R_planet) / a, but I might be mixing it up.

Wait, the formula for transit probability. From what I recall, the probability of a planet transiting is roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor, but I'm not exactly sure. Oh, right, the transit probability is given by P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but maybe only for edge-on orbits. Or wait, another thought: the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis because the planet has to pass directly in front of the star from our viewpoint. So, the transit probability (P) is approximately (R_star / a), but I'm not totally confident.

Wait, maybe it's (R_star / a) * (something else). Another approach: the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by the solid angle? No, I think that's more about the transit depth. Alternatively, if the orbit is randomly oriented, the probability that the inclination is such that the planet transits is (R_star / a), because the planet's orbital plane must be within an angle of R_star/a from edge-on relative to
