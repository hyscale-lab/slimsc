Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are used for spin-½ particles. So S here must be one of the Pauli matrices. Let me think: the S matrix given has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). Oh, that looks familiar. The Pauli Y matrix is exactly that. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are usually denoted as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], right? So S is σ_y.

So Ay = c * S. And c is h/(4π). Wait, but I think the usual spin matrices have factors related to ħ. Oh right, because the spin angular momentum operator is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. Wait, wait, the operator S here must be scaled. Let me think: for the spin-½ particle, the angular momentum is S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So, if Ay = c * S, and S is σ_y, then perhaps c is h/(4π). Let me compute: ħ is h/(2π), so c is h/(4π) = ħ/2 * (1/π * 2), wait, no. Let me compute c: h/(4π) is (h/(2π)) * (1/2) = (ħ) * (1/2). Because ħ = h/(2π), so 1/(4π) h = (h/(2π)) * (1/2) = (ħ) * (1/2). So c is ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) σ_y. 

Wait the question says c = h/(4π), so I think I got that part right. So the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. 

So now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eig
