Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax, and I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with the parallax value. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me try to think this through.

First, what do I remember about parallax? Parallax is a measure of how much the position of a star appears to shift in the sky as the Earth orbits the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance to a star (d) in parsecs is the inverse of the parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. That's right, because parallax plx is in arcseconds, and distance d is in parsecs.

Now the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I'm looking at N(>plx) or maybe the number density in a certain plx range. Wait, the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax." So it's like, how many stars are there when you look at a range of parallax values, say from plx to plx + dplx. Or maybe it's the differential number, like dN/dplx, the number per unit plx.

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So I think that means they are uniformly spread out in space, but I have to consider the effect of distance on the number we observe. Oh, right, because as you go further away, the density of stars you can observe decreases. But wait, if the stars are uniformly distributed, their actual spatial density is the same everywhere. So the number we observe depends on how many are within a certain distance.

So let's model this. Let's say the number density of stars is n (number per unit volume). If I consider a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume would be 4π d² dd. The number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π d² dd. Now, the parallax plx is related to d as plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. 

Wait, substituting d in terms of plx, the number of stars in a shell at a particular plx would be n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd/dplxdd? Hmm, maybe I should express the number in terms of plx.

Hold on, let's think in terms of plx. The volume element in terms of distance is 4π d² dd. But since
