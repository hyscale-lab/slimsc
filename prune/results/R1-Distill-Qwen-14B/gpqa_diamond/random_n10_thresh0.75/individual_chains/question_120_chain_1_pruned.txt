Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. I remember that parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us. The formula is p = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs, right? So if p increases, d decreases.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So, like, how does N depend on p? Let's think about the distribution. The stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means their actual distances are uniform in some way. Wait, but if they're uniformly distributed in space, then the number density is constant. Or wait, maybe they're uniformly distributed in the sky but not necessarily in distance? Hmm, the question says "uniformly distributed in the sky." Wait, does that mean uniform in solid angle?

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's say there are stars at various distances. The number of stars per unit volume is uniform, so n is constant. But when we observe them, how does that translate to the number we see for each parallax range?

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be the surface area of the shell multiplied by the number density. The surface area is 4πd², so the number is n * 4πd² * thickness. But wait, in terms of parallax, since p
