Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But each has different capabilities. The question mentions that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16. Wait, no, wait—brighter means lower magnitudes. Oh wait no, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, so that would mean it can observe stars with V magnitude less than or equal to 17? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So, ESPRESSO can detect stars up to V=17, meaning anything brighter than that (V <17). Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, which is V <16. So, for a star to be detected by both, it must have V magnitude less than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and less than 16 (so HIRES can). Wait, no—if a star is brighter than 16 (V <16), then both can see it because 16 is brighter than 17. But wait, wait, the actual numbers matter. Let me think: what's the cutoff for each?

Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, stars with V <17. Because if a star is brighter than 17, its magnitude is less than 17. Conversely, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, meaning V <16. So a star must have V <16 to be observable by both. Because if a star is V=16.5, HIRES can't see it (since it needs V <16), but ESPRESSO also can't, because 16.5 is above 17? Wait, no, ESPRESSO can handle up to 17. So, a star with V=16.5 is brighter than 17? No, wait, magnitudes work in reverse. For example, V=10 is brighter than
