Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I need to find the mean decay distance. Let me think about what I know.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. Oh wait, I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime of the particle. The mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ, right? But wait, isn't Γ the total decay width? Yeah, I think that's correct.

But wait, the decay distance is about how far the particle travels before decaying. So the mean decay distance should be the product of the particle's speed and its lifetime. Oh yeah, the formula is something like c * τ. But wait, speed is important here. How do I find the velocity of the meson X?

Hmm, I think I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The energy E is the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But E is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass is 1.2 GeV, so the kinetic energy is 8 - 1.2 = 6.8 GeV. But wait, maybe I should approach this using the relativistic expressions for momentum.

The energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Let's solve for p (momentum) first. So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)²) / c². Wait, no, let me make
