Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in moving glass. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But wait, the glass is moving too. Oh right, this is a relativity problem maybe?

Wait, the question says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam? Wait, the beam is propagating through the glass. So if the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer, or is the beam moving towards the observer while the glass is moving in the same direction?

Wait, I think the setup is the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the glass is moving towards the observer. Or does the beam's direction matter? Hmm.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But that's in the rest frame of the medium, right? But if the medium itself is moving, then from the lab frame, the speed might change. Wait, but how does motion of the medium affect the speed of light in it? Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly.

Wait, but the problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v. So from the lab frame, what is the speed of the light beam inside the glass?

Wait, wait. Normally, in a medium at rest, light's speed is c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect it? I remember that in relativity, velocities don't simply add.
