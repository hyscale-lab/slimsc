Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some very small distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I find tau? Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. Γ is the total decay width, and the relation is Γ = ħ / tau. So tau is ħ divided by Γ.

Let me jot that down. So first, tau = ħ / Γ. Then, the mean lifetime as observed (the dilated lifetime) is gamma multiplied by tau, so gamma * tau. But wait, no, I think L is gamma * beta * c * tau, which is the same as gamma * beta * c * (ħ / Γ). Because tau is the proper lifetime, which is multiplied by gamma to get the dilated lifetime.

Alternatively, I've heard that the mean decay length can be calculated using the formula L = (E * c) / (m * Γ
