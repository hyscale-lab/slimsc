Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about synthesizing a specific compound from a starting material using a series of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. I need to figure out which sequence of reagents will get me there.

Let me first try to visualize the structures. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond connected to another carbon). I think it's cyclohexane with a substituent that's a triple bond to another carbon, maybe like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no, ethynyl is probably CH2-C≡CH, attached to the cyclohexane ring.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, breaking that down, the main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1 (I think that's the same as position 1 on the ring), there's a substituent which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, and that's all attached to the cyclohexane carbaldehyde.

Wait, the name is a bit confusing. Let me parse it. The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group attached (the aldehyde). The substituent is at position 1, which is on the same carbon as the aldehyde. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So that would be a cyclohexyl group connected to a CH(OH) group, which is connected to the main cyclohexane ring.

Wait, no. Maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is then attached to the main ring's carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the synthesis steps. So the starting
