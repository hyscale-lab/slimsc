Okay, so I have this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. 

Wait, wait. I remember that the interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula involving the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos terms?) ). Or maybe it's a different formula. Oh wait, I'm confusing things.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk (cos α + cos β + cos γ terms?)) Hmm, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again.

No, wait, another approach. For a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is a special case of a hexagonal or maybe a cubic system, but with all edges equal and angles equal too. Oh right! A rhombohedral system has a = b = c, and all angles equal. So in this case, a = b = c = 10 Angstroms each, and each angle is 30 degrees.

Wait, the interplanar distance formula for a general crystal is derived from the structure factor, but perhaps I can use the formula for the inter
