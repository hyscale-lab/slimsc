Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics question about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I think this looks familiar. Oh right, this is a diagonal matrix because it's a sum of projectors onto the basis states. Each term |i><i| is a projector, so when you add them together and multiply by 1/2, the diagonal elements should be 1/2 each, and the off-diagonal elements zero.

So ρ in matrix form should be:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

But wait, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. What does that mean? Oh, I think it's referring to the Bloch sphere representation. Right, any single qubit state can be represented on a Bloch sphere. For pure states, the density matrix is a pure state, like |ψ><ψ|, which corresponds to a vector on the unit sphere. But this is a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>.

The Bloch vector for a mixed state is the expectation value of the Pauli matrices. The general form of a density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ
