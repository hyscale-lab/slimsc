Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework where you write down all possible interactions that are allowed at low energies, respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model but adding higher-dimensional operators.

The question is asking about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me think about each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? So any effective theory built from it should preserve Lorentz symmetry. That means all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is definitely correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, doesn't Poincare include Lorentz symmetry plus translations? Oh right, because Poincare symmetry includes both rotations and translations in spacetime, making it the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. Since the SMEFT is an effective theory that's valid up to some high energy scale, it should still respect the same spacetime symmetries as the Standard Model. So if Lorentz is included, Poincare would be as well. So option 2 (Poincare) is also a symmetry that must be respected. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP symmetry, option 3? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric because of things like the CKM matrix having complex phases leading to CP violation. But in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP? I think no, because the Standard Model itself doesn't. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, but wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected. So if the Standard Model doesn't respect CP, then the effective theory doesn't have to either. So operators can violate CP, meaning they don't have to respect it. So 3 is not a must-respect symmetry.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. Even if a theory violates C, P, or T individually, it must respect their combination. So since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

So looking back at the options. The question is which of these symmetries must be respected by all operators. So 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT) are correct. Wait, but wait, I thought Poincare is included when you have Lorentz and translation invariance. So if the operators are written in a way that's invariant under Poincare, then they are automatically respecting Lorentz. So in the SMEFT, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So yes, 2 is correct.

Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are written in terms of the Standard Model fields. So if the SM respects Poincare, then SMEFT does too. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1,2,4. Now looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question says "must be respected by all operators". So if an operator violates, say, CP, then it's allowed. But for CPT, any operator that violates C or P must do so in a way that CPT is still preserved. Because CPT is a must.

So yes, 1, 2, and 4 are the symmetries that must be respected.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators while respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT inherits this property. All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, this symmetry is correct.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry and is formulated in Minkowski spacetime, it must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, this symmetry is correct.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry due to CP-violating phenomena, such as the CKM matrix. Since SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model, it does not necessarily respect CP symmetry either. Operators in SMEFT can violate CP, so this symmetry is not a must-respect symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory for Lorentz-invariant theories. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, this symmetry is correct.

From the analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is:

**Answer: C**
