Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, right? So if plx increases, the distance increases. Wait, no, wait a second. Parallax (in arcseconds) is 1 over distance in parsecs. So distance r (in parsecs) is 1/plx. That makes sense because the closer the star, the larger the parallax.

So the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, I can substitute that in. Let's see, 1/(plx^5) would be (r)^5, because plx is 1/r, so plx^5 is (1/r)^5, which is 1/(r^5). So 1 over that would be r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. 

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr would be the derivative of N with respect to r, times dr. Let me think about that.

So, if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in a small range dr around r would be dN = (proportionality constant) * 5 r^4 dr. So the number per unit distance (dr) would be proportional to r^4. So the number of stars in a given distance interval increases as r^4. 

Wait, but wait, let me go through it again to make sure I'm not making a mistake. The number of stars in a region of the sky depends on the volume, right? Because more volume would mean more stars, assuming a uniform density of stars. 

Wait, but in this case, the number is varying as 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, that becomes r^5. So N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars up to a distance r is proportional to r^5. But when you consider a thin shell (a small volume between r and r+dr), the number of stars in that shell would be the derivative of N with respect to r multiplied by dr. So derivative of r^5 is 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. 

So looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the correct answer should be C.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr depends on the volume of that shell. The volume is 4πr^2 dr. If the density of stars is uniform, then the number of stars in the shell is proportional to r^2 dr. But this isn't the case here because the given relation is N ∝ r^5. So perhaps the density isn't uniform.

Wait, maybe I should model this more carefully. Let's assume that the number of stars in a region is proportional to the volume, which is (4/3)
