Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are A to D, each with different exponents of 1 over plx to some power.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is 1 over distance (d), so d = 1/plx. So higher parallax means closer stars, and lower parallax means stars are farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution in the sky... but wait, does that mean uniform in area or uniform in some other measure? Oh, wait, probably uniform in terms of density, like the same number per unit volume. Because if stars are uniformly distributed in 3D space, their density is constant.

So how does that relate to parallax? Well, if I imagine a sphere of radius r (distance d) around a star, the volume is (4/3)πr³. Since density is number per volume, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr would be density multiplied by the volume of the shell, which is 4πr² dr.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so dr = - (1/d²) dp. Hmm, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx.

Let me think. Let's say the number of stars in a range of parallaxes from plx to plx + dplx is what we're after. The volume element in terms of distance is 4πr² dr. Since r is 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, wait, because plx = 1/r, so dplx = - (1/r²) dr. So dr = - r² dplx.

Wait, perhaps I should change variables. Let me express the volume in terms of plx. So, volume element is 4π (1/plx)² * (d (1/plx))? Wait, no, the volume of a shell is 4πr² dr, and r = 1/plx. So substituting r, 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But dr in terms of dplx, since plx = 1/r, dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx. So substituting, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, but the negative just indicates the direction, but since we're dealing with magnitude, we can ignore the sign. So the volume element is 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) dplx. That's 4π (1/plx)^4 dplx.

Wait, no. Let me recheck. The shell's volume is 4π r² dr. r = 1/plx, so r² = 1/(plx^2). dr is the change in r, which is dr = (dr/dplx) dplx. dr/dplx is derivative of 1/plx with respect to plx: d(1/plx)/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dr = -(1/plx²) dplx. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx^2) * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx ), but we take the absolute value, so it's 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in a thin shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume element (since density is uniform). So number dN = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx, where n is the number density (number per unit volume).

But wait, the question is about number per unit range of parallax. So that's dN / dplx. So dN/dplx would be 4π n (1/plx^4).

Wait, but the question is phrased as
