Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when we observe the star from Earth, the brightness changes periodically as the star rotates—this is called rotational modulation. The interesting part is that this brightness variation might look similar to the dip in brightness caused by an exoplanet passing in front of the star (a transit). The question is asking: what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness change as these spots? So, we're comparing the effect of a planet transiting the star to the effect of the spots.

Hmm, I remember that the change in brightness (the amplitude of the light curve) when a planet transits a star depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula for the depth of the transit is (Rp / Rstar)^2, right? Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But in this case, the brightness variation comes from the spots being cooler. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view. Since the spots are cooler, they emit less light, causing the overall brightness of the star to dip. Alternatively, when the other hemisphere (with no spots) is facing us, the brightness is higher.

Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the star emits more light when the hotter (non-spotted) parts are visible. Since the spots are cooler, when they face us, the star appears dimmer. But the overall effect is a variation in brightness due to the rotation.

Wait, the problem states that the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. The star's Teff is 6000 K, so the spots are at 5000 K. So each spot emits less flux than the surrounding area.

The effective temperature relates to the luminosity. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the luminosity per unit area (flux) is sigma * T^4. So the flux from the spots is sigma*(5000)^4, and from the rest of the star, it's sigma*(6000)^4.

Wait, but the star's overall flux is the sum of the flux from all regions, so when the spots are on the side facing us, they contribute less flux, causing a dip in the observed brightness.

The problem is about finding the equivalent planet radius that would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots. So we need to calculate the fractional change in brightness due to the spots and set that equal to the fractional change from the planet transit.

First, let's compute the fractional change in brightness due to the spots.

The star's total area is 4πRstar², but in this problem, the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, each hemisphere is 2πRstar², so 20% of a hemisphere would be 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².
