Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out what the final product is when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's start by analyzing the given data.

First, the IR and NMR data of compound X. Let's think about what each peak might indicate.

The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹. That's a broad region which usually suggests O-H or N-H stretches. Since there are no obvious N peaks in the NMR, maybe it's an O-H group, like a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretches around 2500-3300, sometimes broader. Alternatively, maybe an alcohol or a ketone? Wait, no, the 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong carbonyl. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm⁻¹. But wait, 1720 might be more like an ester or a ketone. Hmm, let's not get stuck here yet.

Looking at the NMR: The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That sounds like a carboxylic acid proton. Because alcohols' protons are usually around 1-5 ppm, and amines around 1-3. But 10.5 is more indicative of a carboxylic acid (or maybe an aldehyde, but that's usually around 9-10). Also, the broad singlet suggests it's not split much, which makes sense for a -COOH proton because it's usually exchanging and broad.

Then, there's a peak at 8.0 ppm, which is a doublet integrating for 2H. Another at 7.2 ppm, also a doublet for 2H. So maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest that each pair of protons is next to each other. So for example, in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons on one carbon are next to substituents and are split into doublets. Alternatively, maybe a para- di-substituted benzene with two substituents.

Looking at the substituents on the aromatic ring, maybe each substituent is something that causes the protons to be in a doublet. So perhaps two substituents in the para positions, each causing the adjacent protons to be deshielded and split into doublets.

Then, the NMR continues: 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, and 0.9 ppm is a triplet for 3H. Let's see, the triplet at 0.9 ppm could be a CH2CH2CH3 group. So maybe a butyl chain? Let's think about that.

Putting it all together, the aromatic part is probably a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ which suggests a carbonyl. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and the other is an alkyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 10.5 ppm peak, which I thought was a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the substituents are a carboxylic acid group and something else on the benzene ring. But let me think again.

Wait, another angle: the NMR shows a downfield peak at 10.5, which is a broad singlet. That's typical of a carboxylic acid's -OH proton. So the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. So the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group attached. So the structure might be something like para-substituted benzoic acid.

Wait, but the IR has a 1720 cm⁻¹ peak. For benzoic acid, the carbonyl is around 1680-1700 cm⁻¹. But this is 1720, which is higher. Hmm, maybe it's an ester. Alternatively, maybe a ketone or another carbonyl group. Wait, but the NMR shows a 10.5 ppm peak, which I thought was a -COOH.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the compound is a substituted benzene with an ester group. Because esters have carbonyls around 1730-1750 cm⁻¹, which is higher than a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the peak is at 1720, which is close to an ester or maybe a ketone.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. If there's a -COOH group, then the IR would have O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which is in the given data. So that fits. The 1720 cm⁻¹ would then be the carbonyl in the carboxylic acid, which would be around 1700. Hmm, maybe it's a bit higher because of conjugation or something else.

So putting this together, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group, and another substituent which is an alkyl group. So the substituents on the benzene are a -COOH and an alkyl group in the para positions.

Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets on the aromatic protons, each integrating for 2H. That suggests that the substituents are in the para positions. So the structure is 4- something benzoic acid, with another substituent in the para position.

Wait, the substituent could be a CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something. Let's look at the NMR again.

The NMR data after the aromatic protons:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → maybe a methine (CH) group connected to something else.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) → perhaps two adjacent CH2 groups.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → a CH3 group attached to something that splits into a doublet. A doublet for CH3 suggests it's attached to a CH, which is attached to another CH2 or similar.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → a terminal CH3, like at the end of a chain.

Putting the NMR together, maybe the substituent is a branching structure. For example, the 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which is perhaps part of a butyl group.

Wait, let's think of a
