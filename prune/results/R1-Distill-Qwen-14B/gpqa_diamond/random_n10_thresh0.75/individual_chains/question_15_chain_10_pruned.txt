Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period P, Planet_1 has P/3.

Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii, but the star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. Oh wait, because both host stars have the same radii, but different masses, that must mean they have different densities or are at different evolutionary stages. But for transit probability, I think the main factors are the planet's orbital distance and the star's size.

Transit probability (P) is given by the formula P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / R_s), where R_p is the planet's radius, R_s is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis (which for circular orbits is the orbital radius). Wait, no, I think the more precise formula is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a * (1/(R_s)) )) ), wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (R_s * (1 + sqrt((M_star)/(M_planet)))))) ), but wait, no, the RV method gives the minimum mass because we don't know the inclination. But for transit probability, it's more about the alignment, which is independent of mass, perhaps.

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (R_s)) )^-1, but I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, maybe a better approach is to remember that the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star's size, and the size of the planet relative to the star.

Wait, the transit
