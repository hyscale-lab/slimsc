Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then there are several steps leading to product 3, and I need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

First, let me break down each step.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is around where an ester or maybe a ketone would absorb. The ¹H NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). 

Hmm, what reaction is happening here? KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with a base, it's often an elimination reaction. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons? Wait, no, adamantane is a diamondoid structure. Wait, 1,3 positions are not adjacent. So if it's 1 and 3 positions, perhaps the structure is such that each carbon has a bromine.

Wait, when you dehydrohalogenate a dibromide, you typically get a double bond. But with two bromines, perhaps elimination occurs, but in such a way that forms a diene? Or maybe each bromine is eliminated with a base, producing two alkenes? No, wait, more likely, each Br is on adjacent carbons. Wait, 1 and 3 in adamantane might not be adjacent. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four bridgehead carbons. So the structure is like two cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1 and 3 would be across the structure.

Wait, but if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, let me think about that structure. Each bridgehead has a Br? So when KOH is added, perhaps elimination occurs, leading to a diene? But wait, that's a big molecule. Or perhaps each Br is removed, leading to two alkenes. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 is probably an ester or a ketone. But wait, after elimination, maybe an epoxide? No, because epoxides have a carbonyl-like peak around 1250-1300 cm⁻¹, but 1720 is more like a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but then where's the -OH? Or maybe this is a diol after some reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination. 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH might undergo dehydrohalogenation, but two times, leading to a conjugated diene. But that wouldn't explain the IR peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in substitution. Wait, maybe it
