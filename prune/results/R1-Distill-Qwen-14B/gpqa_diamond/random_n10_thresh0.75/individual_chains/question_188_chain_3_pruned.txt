Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but let me think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance, d, is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Oh wait, the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α) ... wait, no, maybe it's more complicated than that. Oh right, for a cubic system, it's simple, but rhombohedral has angles, so it's not cubic.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices multiplied by the lattice parameters, but considering the angles between them. So the formula is something like d = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) )) )

Right, because in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees in this case. So, for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So the denominator inside the square root becomes (1 + 1 + 1) minus 2*(1*1 * cos 30 degrees) times each of the combinations. Wait, but since all angles are the same and the Miller indices are all 1, maybe it's symmetric.

Wait, let me write down the formula again. The formula for the interplanar distance d_{hkl} in a crystal is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

Since all angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees here, and a is given as 10 Angstrom.

So plugging the values in: h=1, k=1, l=1.

Denominator becomes sqrt( 1 + 1 +1 - 2*(1*1)*cos(30) - 2*(1*1)*cos(30) - 2*(1*1)*cos(30) )

So let me compute that. First, the sum of squares is 3.

Then, the terms with cos(30) are each -2*(1)(1) cos(30). There are three such terms because hk, hl, and kl each have a term.

So the total is 3 - 2* cos(30 degrees) * (1 + 1 +1) ?

Wait, no, each term is -2 hk cos(alpha), etc. So each term is -2*1*1* cos30.

Wait, each of the three terms is -2 * 1 * 1 * cos(30). So summing the three gives 3*(-2 cos30) = -6 cos30.

Wait, but wait, no. The formula is:

h² +k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ )

Since all angles are 30 degrees, each cosine term is cos30.

So the expression becomes 3 - 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 )

= 3 - 2*(3 cos30 )

So cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 3 cos30 is 3*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 2.598.

Multiply by 2: 5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that can't be right because you can't take the square root of a negative number. That would imply an imaginary number, which isn't possible. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, maybe I missed a negative sign somewhere. Let me rederive the formula.

The interplanar distance formula for cubic systems is easy, but for non-cubic, like rhombohedral, the formula is a bit more involved. The general formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral crystal is:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos α)/(a²) - 2(hl cos β)/(a²) - 2(kl cos γ)/(a²)

Wait, so I think I had the formula right. But when I plug in the numbers, I'm getting a negative value under the sqrt. That can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the denominator again. Let me calculate each part step by step.

Compute the sum h² +k² + l² = 1 +1 +1 =3
