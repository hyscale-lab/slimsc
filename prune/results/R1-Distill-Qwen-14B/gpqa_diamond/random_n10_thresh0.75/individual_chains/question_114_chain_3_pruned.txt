Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with H2O) to produce a butanoic acid derivative. The options are A to D, each with different combinations for A and B.

Alright, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. Adding NaCN, which is sodium cyanide, suggests a nucleophilic substitution maybe? Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, so maybe it's a ketone reacting with a nucleophile. Oh, right! Maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. In the presence of an acid, maybe it's a Michael addition or something else. Wait, another possibility: the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-), in acidic conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanide acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl group.

So, butan-2-one has a carbonyl group. When it reacts with NaCN, which provides CN-, under acidic conditions (H3O+?), it would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. The CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, then the oxygen would pick up a proton, leading to the formation of a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. So the product would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which matches the given product.

So what's reagent A here? It's the acidic condition. H3O+ is a strong acid, so option A or B for A. Alternatively, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ as well, but I don't think it's used in this context. More likely, H3O+ (option A or B) is used here.

So for the first reaction, A is probably H3O+.

Moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydro
