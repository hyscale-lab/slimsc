Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break down the target molecule. It looks like there's a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl (so that's a cyclohexylmethyl-OH group?), and the other is a carbonyl aldehyde group. Wait, or maybe the substituents are on the same carbon? Let me see: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, it's a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. And the same carbon (position 1) has a carbonyl group, making it an aldehyde.

Wait, no, that can't be right because aldehyde is RCHO. So maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, and the other is a carbonyl (CHO) group. Wait, no, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexane, and at position 1, there's a substituent. That substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl, which would be CH2-OH-Cyclohexyl. And the same position has a carbonyl group? Wait, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-OH attached to a cyclohexyl, and that substituent is at position 1. Plus, the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde suggests that there's an aldehyde group in position 1. So perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring where the carbon at position 1 has both a CH2-OH-Cyclohexyl group and a carbonyl group (CHO). That would make sense because the name combines the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO at position 1) with the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl substituent at position 1.

Wait, but that might not be possible because that would mean two substituents on the same carbon, which is possible but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group. No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the synthesis steps.

Starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's cyclohexane with a triple bond (ethynyl group) attached. The target seems to involve adding some groups to this.

Looking at the options, all involve several reagents. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Hmm.

NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. So step 1 could be alkylation, perhaps adding a methyl group. Then H2/Pd is hydrogenation, reducing a triple bond to a single bond. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. H2SO4 and HgSO4 with H2O—those are acid and mercuric sulfate in water, which is a hydration condition, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is the starting material. So after NaNH2 and methyl chloride, perhaps they're adding a methyl group? But ethynylcyclohexane has an sp-hybridized carbon. Maybe step 1 is a substitution, but ethynyl is a poor leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 and methyl chloride are for deprotonation and alkylation elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the first step is for elimination. NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps it's deprotonating something to form an alkyne. Wait, but the starting material is already an alkyne. Hmm, maybe it's for deprotonating a terminal alkyne. Alternatively, NaNH2 is used for elimination reactions. Wait, if you have a cyclohexyl group attached to a triple bond, maybe NaNH2 would deprotonate a hydrogen adjacent to the triple bond, leading to elimination and forming an alkyne, but that doesn't make much sense because ethynylcyclohexane is already a terminal alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the first step is for alkylation. So, adding a methyl group. How would that work? Maybe the triple bond is converted into a better leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is being functionalized.

Alternatively, when you have a terminal alkyne like ethynylcyclohexane, reacting with NaNH2 and methyl chloride might perform an alkylation. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a double alkylation, but that doesn't quite fit.

Let me think about the target. The molecule has a cyclohexane ring, a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl, and a formyl (aldehyde) group. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a substituent and then oxidizing.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, perhaps the triple bond will be hydrogenated. Let's think about the possible steps.

Option C's steps: NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3 with (CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

Hmm, step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Maybe that adds a methyl group. Then hydrogenation with H2 and Pd-CaCO3 (which is a catalyst for hydrogenation) would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. Next, O3 (ozone) with (CH3)2S is a reagent for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Wait, but if after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, unless there's a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again about the general approach.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's imagine the structure: cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

We need to get to a molecule that has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-OH attached to a cyclohexyl, and the main ring has a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the target has a cyclohexane ring where position 1 has a -CH2-C(OH)CH2-cyclohexane group and a formyl group. No, perhaps that's not right. Maybe the structure is a cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1: a -CH2-OH attached to a cyclohexyl group, and another substituent which is a formyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is a molecule where the cyclohexane ring has a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2- group, which then leads to the aldehyde. Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the reactions.

In any case, the starting material is an alkyne, so perhaps the first step is to functionalize the alkyne. For example, using NaNH2 and methyl chloride to add a methyl group via some kind of alkylation.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. If we have ethynylcyclohexane (which is a terminal alkyne), NaNH2 could deprotonate it to form the cyclohexenyl lithium or something else. But methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So perhaps in step 1, the alkyne is deprotonated, and then methyl chloride adds a methyl group. But where?

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is being converted into a different functional group. Let's consider the target molecule. It has a formyl group, so perhaps we need an oxidation step. Also, there's a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane.

Let me think about each option's reactions.

Option C: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is hydrogenation. Step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup (like in ozonolysis). Then step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxidation? Or maybe for forming diols.

Wait, but ozone usually cleaves double bonds. So if step 3 is ozonolysis, perhaps the molecule has a double bond after step 2. Let me think about the sequence.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

Option C's step 1: NaNH2 and CH3Cl. Maybe this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Deprotonate the triple bond to form a strong base, which then reacts with methyl chloride to add a methyl group. So perhaps the triple bond becomes -C≡C-Me. Wait, that would make it a methyl-substituted alkyne.

Then step 2: H2 with Pd-CaCO3. That would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, turning -C≡C-Me into -CH2-CH2-Me. So after step 2, the molecule is cyclohexane with a -CH2-CH2-Me group.

Wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. If step 1 adds a methyl group to the alkyne, it would become cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Then hydrogenation of the triple bond would give cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the alkylation adds a methyl group to the cyclohexane ring. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base; perhaps it deprotonates the cyclohexane's hydrogen adjacent to the triple bond, making it a better site for alkylation. So methyl chloride would methylate that position. So after step 1, the cyclohexane would have a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond.

So structure after step 1: cyclohexane with a methyl group next to the triple bond. Then step 2 is hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond, adding H2 across it. So the triple bond becomes a CH2 group. So the structure becomes cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group (no, wait, hydrogenating the triple bond (C≡C) would add two H's, making it single bond (CH2-CH2). So maybe the molecule after step 2 is cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group attached, but that doesn't make sense—probably a CH2-CH2 bridge? Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with C≡CH. Step 1 is adding a methyl group via deprotonation and alkylation, making it cyclohexane-C≡C-Me. Then hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a CH2-CH2-Me group? Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond would make it CH2-CH2-Me. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.

But how does that lead to the target molecule? The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, and a formyl group. So perhaps after adding the methyl group, hydrogenation, then some oxidation.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group, which suggests that perhaps a primary alcohol was oxidized. So maybe somewhere, there's a hydroxyl group that needs to be oxidized.

Looking at option C, after step 2, the molecule has a CH2-CH2-Me group. Then step 3 is ozonolysis with O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. But step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which hydrogenates triple bonds. So if step 1 makes a longer alkyne, step 2 would hydrogenate it to a single bond, but no double bond. So how would ozonolysis come into play?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH. Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base. It might deprotonate the ethynyl group (since it's acidic, pKa around 25), forming a lithium acetylide. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate it, giving C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2 with Pd-CaCO3. That would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so the alkyne becomes a single bond. So C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3. Now, the molecule is a cyclohexane with a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3). But that doesn't seem to help us get to the target. Because the target has a cyclohexyl substituent and an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the steps wrong. Let me think about another approach.

Alternatively, maybe the synthesis involves adding a substituent and then performing some kind of cyclopropanation or dihydroxylation, but that's not present in the options.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, which is then connected to another cyclohexane. So perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexylmethyl-OH group.

Maybe the steps involve adding a hydroxyl group and a methyl group. How?

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. For example, via oxidation. But the starting material is an alkyne, so perhaps it's oxidized to a diketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the target. It has an aldehyde group, which could come from oxidation of an alcohol. So perhaps we need to form a primary alcohol somewhere in the molecule.

Looking back at the options, option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So that's a deprotonation and then perhaps an alkylation with methanol. Wait, but methanol isn't a methylating agent; it's a source of methyl group, but perhaps it's acting as a nucleophile.

Hmm, perhaps in step 1, NaNH2 deprotonates the ethynyl group, making an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But methanol is a weak nucleophile; maybe it would undergo alkylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, methanol might act as a methylating agent. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is deprotonation, and the second step is a Grignard or organometallic reaction, but that's not in the options.

Wait, let's think about the reagents again.

Option D steps: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is treated with a strong base, forming the acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. That would give ethynylcyclohexane adding a methoxy group? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the methanol is acting as a methylating agent. So the acetylide (from NaNH2) would attack methyl chloride (option A and C) or methanol (option D). So in option D, step 1 would add a methyl group to the acetylide, making a longer alkyne.

Wait, but in option D, step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So maybe it's a deprotonation and then alkylation with methanol. Maybe it's a way to add a hydroxymethyl group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is being used in a coupling reaction. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me try to approach this differently. The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, and also an aldehyde group. So perhaps the synthesis involves introducing both substituents.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So perhaps the triple bond will be converted into a carbonyl group, which can then be oxidized to an aldehyde. But that would require some oxidation steps.

Wait, but ethynyl groups can be oxidized to ketones. Let me think: catalytic hydrogenation of an alkyne can stop at the cis-alkene, which can then be epoxidized or dihydroxylated, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH, which suggests that perhaps a Grignard reaction is involved, adding a hydroxyl group. But Grignard reagents are typically used in anhydrous conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves a ring-opening or some kind of addition.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group, then hydrogenating the alkyne to an alkane, then introducing a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups, and finally some kind of elimination or oxidation.

Looking at option C again:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation → maybe adds a methyl group to the alkyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates triple bond to single bond, making a propyl group.

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But if the molecule now has a single bond, how can ozonolysis act? Unless there's a double bond elsewhere. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, after step 2, the molecule is a cyclohexane with a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3). No double bonds. So ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Step 2 is Li and liquid NH3. That sounds like a Birch reduction condition or perhaps a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Then step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, and step 4 is NH4OH.

Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base and can induce elimination or perhaps formate. Alternatively, it's used for deprotonating to form organometallic compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 adds a hydroxyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 in option D is adding a methylene group (CH2) via alkylation. Then in step 2, Li and liquid NH3 could be for a coupling reaction.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible reagents and what they do.

Looking at the target, the aldehyde group suggests that somewhere, an alcohol has been oxidized. So perhaps one of the steps is an oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, option B includes step 3: O3 and H2O, which is a different workup than (CH3)2S. Ozone with H2O and HgSO4 is typically oxidative cleavage, which would form carbonyl groups. (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which gives aldehydes/ketones instead of carboxylic acids or ketones.

Option B's steps: 1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/H2O; 4. NH4OH.

So step 1: alkylation with ethyl chloride. So maybe the starting alkyne gets an ethyl group added. Then step 2: Li in liq NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for elimination or to form a Grignard-like reagent. Then ozonolysis, which would cleave any double bonds. Then treatment with NH4OH, which could be for workup or perhaps aminolysis.

But if after step 2, there's a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me try to outline the possible steps.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → deprotonation and ethylation. So the alkyne becomes ethyl-substituted. So structure would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li in liq NH3 → perhaps this is for deprotonation, elimination, or ring-opening. Alternatively, Li in NH3 is used for the formation of alkyl lithium reagents, which can then undergo alkylation or other reactions.

Wait, but after step 1, we have an ethyl-substituted alkyne. Step 2: Li in NH3. Maybe this deprotonates the alkyne again, but ethyl-substituted alkyne is less acidic than the parent. Alternatively, perhaps it's for elimination. Wait, but without a good leaving group, elimination might not be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation step? No, because H2/Pd is in other options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each step's function.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol could act as a methylating agent. So perhaps the triple bond is deprotonated, and then methanol adds a methyl group, making the alkyne longer. Then step 2: Li in liq NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or for forming a Grignard-like reagent. Step 3: ozonolysis, which would cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups. Step 4: NH4OH, which could be for workup or introducing an amine group.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target. Maybe I should think about what each option produces.

Wait, perhaps the target is formed via the following steps:

1. Add a methyl group via alkylation (step 1 in options A, C, D; step 1 in B is ethyl).
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene (if using H2 and Pd in step 2), but wait, some options have H2 in step 2.
3. Perform some kind of dihydroxylation or epoxidation.
4. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.
5. Perhaps an elimination or oxidation to form the aldehyde and the cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add a methyl group, hydrogenate the triple bond, then introduce a double bond, ozonolyze to form a carbonyl, and then perform some kind of elimination or oxidation.

Wait, another approach. The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH. So perhaps the molecule is cyclohexane with a substituent that is CH2-OH attached to another cyclohexane. So maybe the substituent is a cyclohexylmethyl-OH group.

How would that form? Maybe via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires a catalyst like AlCl3, which isn't in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps a Grignard reaction adds a cyclohexyl group. But Grignard reagents are typically used with ketones or esters.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol from a diene via ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.
3. Introduce a double bond elsewhere (maybe via elimination).
4. Ozonolyze the double bond to form carbonyl groups.
5. Perform acid workup to form diols or aldehydes.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Looking back at option C: Step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. That's a reductive workup, which gives aldehydes and ketones. So if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls.

Hmm, perhaps in step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond. Wait, no. H2 with Pd typically hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. Unless specific conditions are used, but I think Pd is usually for hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds.

Wait, maybe step 2 in option C is hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain. Then maybe a subsequent step forms a double bond.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each option's possible products.

Option C:
Step 1: Alkylation → longer alkyne.
Step 2: Hydrogenate alkyne → alkane.
So after step 2, the molecule is cyclohexane with a -CH2-CH2-Me group.

Step 3: Ozone and (CH3)2S. But without a double bond, nothing happens. So that can't be right.

Option D:
Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps adds a methoxy group.
Step 2: Li/liq NH3 → strong base, perhaps for elimination, making a double bond.
Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S → cleaves the double bond into carbonyls.
Step 4: NH4OH → ?

But I'm not sure about the exact transformations.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a hydroxyl group via oxidation.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has a formyl group (CHO). How can we get that from the starting material?

One way is to oxidize a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. So perhaps in the synthesis, a primary alcohol is formed, which is then oxidized.

Looking at the options, which steps could lead to a primary alcohol.

Option B: after ozonolysis and workup, perhaps a carbonyl group is formed, which could then be reduced to an alcohol.

Wait, step 3 in option B is O3/H2O, which is oxidative cleavage, perhaps forming ketones or carboxylic acids. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which could be for hydrolysis or amidation. Not sure.

Option C: step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. Or maybe for forming epoxides, but more likely elimination.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction or in epoxide ring-opening, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH. That suggests a substitution reaction, perhaps via a Grignard reagent attacking a carbonyl.

But in the options, perhaps that's not directly applicable.

Maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to add a methyl group.
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond.
3. Introduce a double bond via elimination.
4. Ozonolyze the double bond to form carbonyls.
5. Perform acid workup to form diols or aldehydes.
6. Maybe oxidation or elimination to form the final structure.

But I'm not seeing it clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D. Let me think why.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So maybe the ethynyl group is deprotonated, and methanol acts as a nucleophile, adding a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH). Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base and could induce elimination, forming a double bond.

So after step 2, the molecule would have a double bond. Then step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups. Finally, step 4 is NH4OH, which could be for workup, perhaps forming aldehydes.

But I'm not sure if this would lead to the target. Let me try to imagine the structure.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane, step 1 adds a hydroxymethyl group, making it cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2OH. Then step 2 (Li, NH3) would eliminate H2O, forming a triple bond again? Or perhaps form a double bond. Wait, maybe the Li would deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group, leading to elimination of water and forming a double bond.

So after step 2, the molecule would have a double bond adjacent to the hydroxymethyl group. Then step 3, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S would produce aldehydes or ketones. So the double bond would break into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the starting material has a triple bond. So after step 1, maybe the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2OH. Then step 2 (Li in NH3) could deprotonate the OH, leading to an elimination, perhaps forming a double bond between the cyclohexane and the CH2 group. So the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2OH, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after step 2 is cyclohexyl-CH2-CHO, but I'm not confident.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should consider which option's steps logically lead to the target.

The target requires an aldehyde group and a cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a hydroxymethyl group and then forming a double bond which is then cleaved to form the aldehyde.

Looking at option D: step 1 adds a hydroxymethyl group via methanol. Then step 2 forms a double bond. Step 3 cleaves the double bond with ozone, possibly forming an aldehyde.

Wait, let's imagine the steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → treated with NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 deprotonates the alkyne, forming a strong base. Methanol then adds a methyl group (but wait, methanol is CH3OH, which would act as a nucleophile. So the acetylide would react with CH3OH to form a CH2-O-Me group? Or perhaps a CH2-OH group? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's adding a CH2-O- group, which later gets hydrolyzed.

Alternatively, maybe the first step adds a CH2-OH group. Then step 2 is Li in NH3, which could deprotonate and eliminate, forming a double bond. Then ozonolysis would break that into carbonyls.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Another angle: the target has a formyl group, which would require an oxidation step of a primary alcohol. So perhaps one of the steps involves oxidizing an alcohol to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe that's for elimination, forming a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, but I'm not seeing it clearly. Alternatively, perhaps option C's steps are:

Step 1: Add methyl group.

Step 2: Hydrogenate alkyne to single bond.

Step 3: Ozonolysis on a double bond (but where would the double bond come from?).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe step 2 in option C is hydrogenating a different functional group, not the alkyne. Or perhaps it's a partial hydrogenation, stopping at the cis-alkene.

But in that case, the triple bond is converted to a cis-alkene, which can then undergo ozonolysis.

Wait, but under H2 and Pd, the triple bond is hydrogenated all the way to a single bond. So that would not leave a double bond.

Wait, maybe the correct option is B.

Option B: steps are NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → H2/Pd → Li/liq. NH3 → O3/ H2O → NH4OH.

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. Deprotonate and ethylate, making cyclohexyl-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Et.

Step 3: Li in liquid NH3. This is a strong base, perhaps for elimination, forming a double bond. So cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Et → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-Et? No, perhaps elimination would form a double bond.

Wait, to form a double bond, perhaps the molecule would lose EtOH or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is a Birch reduction, but I'm not certain.

Then step 3: O3 and H2O (oxidative cleavage). If there's a double bond, it would break into carbonyl groups.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Based on the target molecule, which has an aldehyde group, I think the correct sequence should involve ozonolysis followed by a reductive workup to form aldehydes. So perhaps option C or D.

Option C's step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, giving aldehydes. So if after step 2, there's a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups.

Wait, how would we get a double bond after step 2?

In option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain without a double bond. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, which includes Li in liquid NH3. Li in NH3 is a strong base and can abstract protons, leading to elimination reactions. So if after step 1, a hydroxyl group is added, step 2 could eliminate to form a double bond. Then ozonolysis would cleave that into carbonyls.

So, let's imagine:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → adds a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) to the alkyne, making cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2OH.

Step 2: Li in liq NH3 → deprotonates the OH, leading to elimination of water, forming a double bond: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2OH → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2- with a double bond between CH2 and CH2OH? No, perhaps between the cyclohexyl and the CH2.

Wait, maybe the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH=CH2-OH. But that might not be right.

Wait, perhaps the structure after step 2 is cyclohexyl-CH2-CHO. No, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C. Let's think:

Step 1: methyl chloride adds a methyl group to the alkyne → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: hydrogenation → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S → can't act on single bonds, so this doesn't make sense.

Thus, option C is unlikely.

So perhaps the correct option is D. Let me map it:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → maybe forms cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2-OH.

Step 2: Li in liq NH3 → likely deprotonates the OH, leading to elimination. So the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CHO (but I'm not sure).

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to a double bond. So structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-OH → after elimination, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-OH → cyclohexyl-CH2-CHO?

Not quite. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a triple bond again. But I'm not certain.

I'm getting stuck and might have to make a guess. Considering that the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexane, the correct sequence likely involves forming a carbonyl group via ozonolysis and adding a hydroxymethyl group via alkylation.

Looking at the options, option D's steps involve NaNH2 and methanol, which could add a hydroxymethyl group. Then Li in NH3 for elimination, forming a double bond. Ozonolysis would then break that into carbonyls, which could be aldehydes. Finally, NH4OH might hydrolyze any protecting groups or form the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct. Let me think again.

Option B's steps: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → H2/Pd → Li/liq. NH3 → O3/H2O → NH4OH.

Step 1: ethyl group added to alkyne → cyclohexyl-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: hydrogenate → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Et.

Step 3: Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination, forming a double bond.

Step 4: O3 → cleaves double bond into carbonyls. Then NH4OH → hydrolysis.

But I'm not sure if this leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a formyl group, which is a CHO group. This can be formed by oxidizing a primary alcohol (R-CH2-OH) to R-CHO.

So the synthesis must include a step where a primary alcohol is oxidized. Which options have oxidation steps?

Options A and C have H2SO4 with HgSO4 and H2O. That's a typical Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. But wait, H2SO4 and HgSO4 in aqueous conditions are used for oxidation, but if the primary alcohol is protected, perhaps it can be oxidized to an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's a partial oxidation.

Wait, looking at option A: step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's the Jones reagent, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. So if there's a primary alcohol, this would form a carboxylic acid, not an aldehyde. So the target requires an aldehyde, so option A might not be correct.

Option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2, a strong base. Perhaps that's for elimination, forming a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if an aldehyde is needed, maybe the correct step is ozonolysis with a reductive workup, as in option C or D.

Putting it all together, I think the correct sequence is option C. Let me try to think through it:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkylation to make cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But then step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Wait, without a double bond, nothing happens. So perhaps step 2 in option C isn't hydrogenating the triple bond all the way, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenating the triple bond to a double bond. Wait, but H2 and Pd typically hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → adds a CH2-OH group to the alkyne, making cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2-OH.

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3 → eliminates water, forming a triple bond again? Or forms a double bond.

Assuming it forms a double bond, structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CHO (but I might be getting this wrong).

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S → cleaves the double bond into carbonyls. So if the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target.

I'm stuck, but I think the correct answer is option C. Because the target has an aldehyde, and ozonolysis with (CH3)2S would form aldehydes. So the steps must include forming a double bond before ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond.

In option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Wait, but H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So no double bond would form.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps in option C, step 2 is not hydrogenating the alkyne but something else. But I'm not sure.

In conclusion, after much thought, I'm going to go with option C as the correct answer.


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which includes a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and an aldehyde group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Step 1 involves NaNH₂ and methyl chloride, likely alkylating the alkyne.  
   - Step 2 (H₂/Pd) hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond.  
   - Step 3 (Ba(OH)₂) is a strong base, possibly for elimination.  
   - Step 4 (H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O) is a Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids.  
   - However, the target requires an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, making this option unlikely.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Step 1 involves NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride, likely alkylating the alkyne.  
   - Step 2 (H₂/Pd) hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond.  
   - Step 3 (Li/liq. NH₃) is a strong base, possibly for elimination or forming a double bond.  
   - Step 4 (O₃/H₂O) cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups via oxidative cleavage.  
   - However, the sequence does not clearly lead to the formation of the hydroxymethyl group and aldehyde in the target molecule.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Step 1 involves NaNH₂ and methyl chloride, likely alkylating the alkyne to form a longer chain.  
   - Step 2 (H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate) hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond.  
   - Step 3 (O₃, (CH₃)₂S) is a reductive workup for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into aldehydes or ketones.  
   - However, after step 2, the molecule lacks a double bond, making ozonolysis ineffective. This raises doubts about the validity of this option.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Step 1 involves NaNH₂ and methanol, likely adding a hydroxymethyl group to the alkyne.  
   - Step 2 (Li/liq. NH₃) is a strong base, possibly for elimination, forming a double bond.  
   - Step 3 (O₃, (CH₃)₂S) cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups via reductive workup.  
   - Step 4 (NH₄OH) could hydrolyze intermediates or stabilize the product.  
   - This sequence aligns well with the formation of the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl group in the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
Option D provides the most logical sequence of steps to synthesize the target molecule, as it involves the introduction of a hydroxymethyl group, formation of a double bond, and cleavage into aldehydes via ozonolysis. These steps are consistent with the structure of the target molecule.
