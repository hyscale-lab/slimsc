Okay, so I have this question about a eukaryotic cell's mitochondria and a new anti-diabetes drug. The question is asking which experiment won't help determine the drug's effect on mitochondria. Hmm, I need to think through each option carefully.

Let me start by recalling what the options are about. The question is about experiments related to mitochondrial function, so each option should relate to some mitochondrial process, like energy production, structure, or function.

Option A: Differential centrifugation to extract mitochondria followed by a glucose uptake assay. Wait, differential centrifugation is a method used to isolate organelles. So if they extract mitochondria and then use a glucose uptake kit, perhaps theyâ€™re measuring glucose uptake specifically in the mitochondria. But wait, I think mitochondria aren't primarily responsible for glucose uptake. Glucose is usually processed in the cytoplasm, right? Mitochondria take in pyruvate, which is derived from glucose. So maybe this assay isn't measuring mitochondrial function but rather something else, like glycolysis. So this experiment might not help assess the drug's effect on mitochondria. Or is there another angle here? If the drug affects glucose uptake, perhaps it's affecting the cell's overall metabolism, but whether that's mitochondrial... I'm not so sure. Maybe I should hold that thought.

Option B: Transformation with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after adding luciferin. Hmm, luciferase is an enzyme used in reporter assays. Wait, but there's another possibility: this might be related to measuring ATP levels. Because luciferase
