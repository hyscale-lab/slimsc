Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let me think this through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when energies get high. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations, making the math messy. Regularization introduces a temporary cutoff or some other method to make the calculations finite, and then you remove it later, hopefully getting a finite result. But some theories might not need this because they're finite or have other properties that prevent such divergences.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, right? And it's a candidate for a theory that unites quantum mechanics with general relativity. I recall that string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kinds of divergences that other quantum field theories have. Because they're background-independent and incorporate gravity, maybe they don't require regularization. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Do they still use regularization for some parts?

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Quantum Yang-Mills. I remember that QCD does have things like Landau poles, which are problems at high energies if you naively extrapolate. But wait, QCD uses asymptotic freedom, which means the coupling becomes weak at high energies. But does that mean it's free from needing regularization? No, I think it still has divergences that need to be handled, like in loop calculations. So regularization is probably used here.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a U(1) gauge theory. I remember that QED is known to be a renormalizable theory. But wait, isn't it also a theory that has divergences that require renormalization? Renormalization is a form of regularization, I think. Or maybe they're related. So QED does require regularization methods like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization. Without that, the perturbative calculations blow up.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones because they don't involve the same divergences. In classical ED, even though there are things like the infinite charge density at a point charge, those aren't really physical in the same way. But wait, in reality, classical ED doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same mathematical infinities that quantum theories handle with regularization. Or do they? Wait, I'm a bit confused. For example, in classical ED, when you calculate the self-energy of an electron, you get infinities, but those are handled in QED through renormalization. In the classical theory, maybe you just accept it as a limitation and use other methods. So perhaps classical ED doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory—so regularization techniques aren't part of it.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So in quantum theories, you use regularization
