Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules consist of two atoms, right? The question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, or non-rigid rotor model. Wait, I think the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length doesn't change, but the non-rigid one does? Or maybe that's the vibration part. Anyway, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I guess is the lowest energy state. The question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

The given data includes the masses of the atoms X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, respectively. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are various momenta in Ns.

I'm a bit confused about what the "next state" refers to. Since it's a rotation-vibration model, maybe the molecule can change either its rotational state or vibrational state. Oh, right, because in the rotation-vibration model, energy levels are quantized both for rotation and vibration, and the molecule can transition between these states when it absorbs or emits a photon.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the first excited state would be the next possible energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Hmm, that probably means the transition with the least energy required. So I need to find which transition has the lower energy: increasing the vibrational state or increasing the rotational state.

I think for the vibrational energy levels, the energy is quantized in quanta of ħw. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħw, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The ground state is v=0, so the next vibrational state would be v=1, requiring a photon with energy E_photon = ħw*(1) - ħw*(0) = ħw.

For rotational energy levels, the energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. The ground state for rotation is J=0, so the next state is J=1. So the energy difference would be B*(1)(2) - B*(0)(1) = 2B. 

So I need to calculate the energy required for both a vibrational transition (v=0 → v=1) and a rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) and see which is smaller. Whichever requires less energy will be the next state.

Wait, but the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy". Oh, that probably means the transition to the next state with the lowest energy, so the one that needs the least photon energy.

So let me compute both energies.

First, calculate the vibrational photon energy. The energy of a photon is E_photon = h * f, and since w = 2πf, E = ħw. ħ is h/(2π), so E_photon_vib = ħw = (h/(2π)) * w.

Wait, but let me plug in the numbers. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

E_photon_vib = h * w/(2π) ? Wait, wait, no. E = ħw. Since ħ = h/(2π), so E = (h/(2π)) * w. So for w=4e14, E_vib = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s)/(2π). Let me compute that.

Calculating E_vib:

6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19. Divided by 2π (approx 6.283), so 2.6504e-19 /6.283 ≈ 4.214e-20 J.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-20? Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) * 1e-34+14 = 26.504 * 1e-20 → 2.6504e-19 J? Oh right, because 1e-34 *1e14 = 1e-20. So 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 26.504e-20 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Divided by 2π: 2.6504e-19 / 6.283 ≈ 4.214e-20 J.

Now, the rotational energy difference when J goes from 0 to 1.

The rotational constant B is given by (h²)/(8π² I c), but wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2 I), but I think I might have that wrong. Alternatively, B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Yes, I think the rotational constant B is h² / (8 π² I), and the moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms, and R is the bond length.

So, μ = (m_X * m_Y)/(m_X + m_Y) * u, where u is the atomic mass unit (amu). Wait, amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg.

So, let's compute μ:

m_X = 20 amu, m_Y=2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = (40)/(22) ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 *1.66e-27 ≈ approximately 3.015e-27 kg.

Wait, let me calculate that more precisely.

20 * 2 = 40, 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu. So 1.81818 * 1.66e-27 kg.

1.81818 * 1.66 is approximately 3.015, so μ ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

Moment of inertia I = μ R^2. R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 2 angstrom is 2e-10 m.

I = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Now, compute B:

B = h²/(8 π² I).

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J.s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J·s)^2.

8 pi squared is 8*(9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator: 78.9568 * I = 78.9568 *1.206e-46 ≈ 78.9568 *1.206 ≈ 95.25, so 95.25e-46 → 9.525e-45.

So B = (4.39e-67) / (9.525e-45) ≈ 4.39e-67 /9.525e-45 ≈ approximately 4.607e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute that:

4.39e-67 /9.525e-45 = 4.39 /9.525 * 1e-22 → ≈ 0.4607 * 1e-22 → 4.607e-23 J.

So B ≈ 4.607e-23 J.

The energy difference for rotational transition J=0 → J=1 is ΔE_rot = B*(1)(2) - B*(0)(1) = 2B = 9.214e-23 J.

Now, compare that to the vibrational energy difference of 4.214e-20 J.

So wait, 4.214e-20 J is much larger than 9.214e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational transition.

Wait, but wait a second. Which one is the next state? Because the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy for both rotation and vibration. So the next possible states would be either v=1 (vibrational first excited state) or J=1 (rotational first excited state). The question is asking for the photon momentum that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the one requiring the least energy.

So the rotational transition requires less energy (9.214e-23 J) compared to the vibrational (4.214e-20 J). So the molecule can absorb a photon with that lower energy and transition to a higher rotational state.

So the energy of the photon should be equal to the rotational energy difference, E_photon = 9.214e-23 J.

But wait, wait. Wait a second. Because the problem statement says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state in energy would be the one with the least energy increase. So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational, so the photon should have that rotational energy.

But wait, the problem says, "momentum should an absorbed photon have." Oh, right. The photon's momentum p is equal to E/c. Because for a
