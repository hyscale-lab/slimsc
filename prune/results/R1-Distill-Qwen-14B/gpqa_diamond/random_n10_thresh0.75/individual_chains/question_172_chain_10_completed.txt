Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Let's break it down step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2 for a specific energy level. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We're told that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I think that means the Boltzmann equation applies here.

I remember the Boltzmann distribution formula relates the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is something like n2/n1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where n1 and n2 are the populations of the two states, E2 and E1 their energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, let's say for star 1, the population of the higher energy level (n2) is twice the lower (n1). Wait, wait—no, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. I think "excited" refers to the higher energy level population. So perhaps n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 equals twice that of n_upper_2 / n_lower_2? Hmm, not quite sure. Wait, maybe it's better to consider the ratio of the populations. Let me think.

Wait, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. So maybe for each star, the ratio of the upper to lower energy level is being considered, and star_1 has a higher ratio. Or perhaps, perhaps the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation potential is higher, but no, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, perhaps the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state for each star is given. So for star_1, n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2), because star_1 is twice as excited.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited state (n2) to the ground state (n1) in star_1 is twice that of the same ratio in star_2. So (n2_1/n1_1) = 2*(n2_2/n1_2).

But wait, the problem says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. If "excited" refers to the population in the higher energy state, then perhaps for each star, the ratio n2/n1 is the measure of excitation. So for star_1, n2_1/n1_1 = 2*(n2_2/n1_2)? Or maybe it's that n2_1 = 2 * n2_2, but without knowing the total number, perhaps it's the ratio that matters.

Alternatively, maybe it's saying that the excitation is twice as much, meaning the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, (n2_1/n1_1) = 2*(n2_2/n1_2). But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps for each star, the excitation level is given by the ratio n2/n1, and star_1's ratio is twice star_2's.

Wait, the problem says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, if the energy level is higher, then more excited. So maybe the ratio (n2/n1) is twice as high for star_1 as it is for star_2.

So for star_1, (n2_1/n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2).

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, (n2/n1) = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is the energy difference (E2 - E1), which is positive. So for each star, I can write the ratio for that star.

So, for star_1: (n2_1/n1_1) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )

For star_2: (n2_2/n1_2) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

According to the problem, (n2_1/n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2). So,

exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

Let me write that equation.

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k*T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k*T2))

Rearranging,

ΔE/(k*T2) - ΔE/(k*T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2)

Wait, maybe I can factor it differently. Let's see:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, perhaps rearrange the equation:

ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2)

Alternatively, factor it as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, substituting:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but in the options, I see terms involving (T1 - T2) and (T1 T2), etc.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the sign. Let me make sure. Let me write the equation again.

Starting from:

exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

Take the natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Bring terms together:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/(k T2) ) - (1/(k T1)) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, no, wait: [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] because it's (ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)) = ln(2)

So, [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] * (ΔE/(k)) ) = ln(2)

Which is (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hm, so rearranging, we have ln(2) = (ΔE / (k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, the options don't have the ΔE term. Wait, so maybe that's not the right approach, because the options only involve T1 and T2, but the question's options involve ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2, but no ΔE.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Or maybe I should rewrite the equation to express in terms of (T1-T2) and T1 T2.

Wait, let me see: from the equation, ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

But the options don't have any ΔE terms, so perhaps the equation should be rearranged differently.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me re-examine the problem.

The question says that the energy difference is approximately 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

But in the options, all the terms involve T1 and T2, but the given ΔE is a constant. So perhaps the key is to express the ratio T1 and T2 in terms of that.

Wait, but wait, the question is asking for an equation that correctly relates T1 and T2, given that (n2_1/n1_1) is twice (n2_2/n1_2).

So, from the earlier equation:

(n2_1/n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2)

Which using Boltzmann's distribution is:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Alternatively, we could take the ratio of the two populations:

(n2_1/n1_1) / (n2_2/n1_2) ) = 2

So, [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = 2

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2

Taking the natural log:

ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

(ΔE/k) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So, solving for (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

But since ΔE is given, but the options don't have it, perhaps in the context of the problem, the equation is expressed in terms of T1 and T2 without constants because the question is about the form of the equation, not the values.

Wait, but looking at the options, they have ln(2) on the left side, and on the right side, some expression involving T1 and T2. So in our equation, we have ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Therefore, this suggests that the equation is ln(2) equals something involving T1 and T2 in the form (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), multiplied by (ΔE/k), but the options don't include ΔE/k. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the term (ΔE/k) is a constant that can be incorporated into the equation, but in the options, it's just expressed as ln(2) equals a term involving T1 and T2, perhaps with a reciprocal or something.

Wait, let's think again. The options are:

A) ln(2) = [T2 / T1]

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

C) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

In our derived equation, we have ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So the term (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) is multiplied by (ΔE/k). But in the options, each option has ln(2) equal to a combination of T1 and T2. So perhaps the equation is expressed as ln(2) = (something), but the (ΔE/k) factor is being ignored because it's a constant, but the problem is only about the functional form. Wait, but I don't think the problem is asking for the equation in terms of the constants; it's about how T1 and T2 are related. So perhaps the correct option is D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), because that's the term we have, multiplied by ΔE/k. But without the constants, perhaps the equation is considered in terms of (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) equals something, but the options don't show that.

Wait, but in our equation, ln(2) equals (ΔE/k) multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). So if the problem is giving that ΔE is a known constant, then the equation would be ln(2) equals that term. But the question is asking which equation correctly relates T1 and T2. So perhaps the equation in the options must match our form, which is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) = (k ln(2))/ΔE.

But the options do not include any of the constants. So perhaps the question is simplified, assuming that ΔE/(k) is a certain value, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the ratio (n2/n1) for each star is given by the Boltzmann factor, and the ratio between the two stars is 2:1.

So, for star_1: n2_1/n1_1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1))

For star_2: n2_2/n1_2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

The problem says that n2_1/n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2)

So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2

So,

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Take natural log:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So the equation is:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 ) * (ΔE/k)

But the options don't have the ΔE/k term. So perhaps the question is simplified in that the problem assumes that ΔE/(k) is a known constant, but the options don't include it. Therefore, the equation in the options would be the part without the constants, which is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2), but that's option D.

Wait, yes. So the correct equation would be ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by (ΔE/k). But since the options don't include the (ΔE/k) term, perhaps the problem considers the equation as ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem setup is different. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ratio. Because maybe the problem is that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, but the total number would depend on the partition function as well. Wait, but the Boltzmann distribution gives the ratio of populations. So perhaps the setup is correct as I did before.

So looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that would match our equation if (ΔE/k) is considered, but the option D doesn't include that term. So perhaps the correct option is D, because the form matches.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the option that has (T1-T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D. So the correct answer would be D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for a specific energy level. The energy difference between the levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies. The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \).

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( n_2 \) and \( n_1 \) are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{1,1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2,2}}{n_{1,2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{1,1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,2}}{n_{1,2}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Dividing both sides by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right) \):

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The problem asks for the equation relating \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \). Since the options do not include \( \Delta E / k \), the functional form of the equation must match one of the given options. The correct form is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This corresponds to **Option D**.
