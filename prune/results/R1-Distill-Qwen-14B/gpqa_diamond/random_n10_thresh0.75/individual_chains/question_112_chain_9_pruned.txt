Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, it's about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

So the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's a scalar multiple, so maybe I should normalize it first. Because to find probabilities, the state vector has to be a unit vector.

First step: Find the normalization factor. The state is (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let's compute the inner product of this with itself.

The inner product is (1+i)^* (1+i) + (2 -i)^* (2 -i), because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. So, calculate each term.

(1+i) conjugate is (1-i), so (1-i)(1+i) = 1 +1 = 2. Because (a+bi)(a-bi) = a² + b². For (1+i), a=1, b=1, so 1+1=2.

Next term: (2 -i) conjugate is (2 +i). Multiply that by (2 -i): (2 +i)(2 -i) = 4 +1=5. Because (a+bi)(a-bi)=a² + b². Here a=2, b=1, so 4+1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5=7. So the norm squared is 7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Wait, actually, the way the question is phrased is that |alpha> is proportional to that. So the actual state would be (1/sqrt(7)) multiplied by that expression. So we can write |alpha> as (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part: the operator has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So it's a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with spin up and down, so i and j can be 1 and 2 (for up and down respectively).

Let me write down the matrix. Since A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Hmm, that's interesting. So this is an off-diagonal matrix. What operator does this represent?

Wait, the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So this operator looks like (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because X has 1s where we have hbar/2.

But wait, the operator's matrix is (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], so it's (hbar/2) σ_x.

So the operator we're dealing with is (hbar/2) σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates for this operator as well, since hbar/2 is a scalar.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of σ_x. Because the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in |alpha>.

Alternatively, I can compute the expectation value using the operator's matrix.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that for an observable (operator), the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of the given operator. Since the operator is (hbar/2) σ_x, its eigenstates are the same as σ_x.

What are the eigenstates of σ_x? They are |+x> and |-x>, which are the spin-up and spin-down states along the x-axis. These can be written as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Or maybe with some phase factors, but I think those are the basic forms.

Wait, σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), or maybe with a negative, but the exact form might depend on convention.

Wait, let me think. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so its eigenvalues are +1 and -1, and the corresponding eigenvectors are [1,1] and [1,-1], normalized.

So the eigenstates for σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) / sqrt(2). Because the eigenvectors are [1,1] and [1,-1], so when normalized, they're (1/sqrt(2)) [1,1] and (1/sqrt(2)) [1,-1].

So we can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

First, let's express |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

We need to express this in terms of |+x> and |-x>, which are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So let me write |alpha> as a combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me make the substitution:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

So, substituting |+x> and |-x>,

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Combine terms:

= [ a/sqrt(2) + b/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ a/sqrt(2) - b/sqrt(2) ] |down>

Compare this with |alpha>'s components:

= (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>

So, equating the coefficients:

Coefficient of |up>:
( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)

Coefficient of |down>:
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So, we have two equations:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7) → equation 1

( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7) → equation 2

Let me solve for a
