Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are often represented as matrices, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states of the system.

So, the operator P must be the vector sum of its components, right? So P = P_x x-hat + P_y y-hat + P_z z-hat. But the direction n is in the x-z plane, so the direction can be represented as a unit vector with components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since it's in x-z plane, φ is zero or π? Wait, actually, the x-z plane implies that the angle φ is zero because the y-component is zero. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), assuming θ is measured from the z-axis. Or maybe it's (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ) in general, but when restricted to x-z plane, φ is zero, so it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Hmm, I think that's correct.

But wait, the operator P is along direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So the operator P would be P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z, since n_y is zero. Wait, or does the operator vector include all components? Wait, the question says the operator vec{P} along an arbitrary direction n. So the operator acting on the state is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So I'll need to find
