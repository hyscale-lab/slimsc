Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes from when there are no spots to when there are spots.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ionization and excitation of atoms are influenced by temperature. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is (n1/n2) = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where E2 > E1. So the ratio depends on temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the star's Teff changes when spots are present. Spots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the surface, the overall observed Teff drops. But how does that affect the photospheric conditions?

The transition considered is at 1448 Å, which I think is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. The energy difference between the two levels can be calculated using the wavelength. The energy E is hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

But wait, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so we can use the Boltzmann factor.

The key point is that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. But wait, the spots are cooler, but the rest of the surface (60%) is at higher temperature. How does this affect the average temperature in the photosphere?

Wait, no. The effective temperature is a measure of the total emitted flux. The star emits more flux when hotter. So when 40% of the surface is cooler (spots), the overall effective temperature is lower. But when looking at the photosphere, the average temperature is a mix of the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. So I think the effective temperature here
