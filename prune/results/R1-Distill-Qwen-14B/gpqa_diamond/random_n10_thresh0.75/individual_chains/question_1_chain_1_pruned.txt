Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A through D.

Hmm, okay, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be known. One of the key applications is the energy-time uncertainty relation. The formula I recall is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but I think in many contexts, people use ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, ignoring the 1/2 factor because the exact value isn't critical for order-of-magnitude estimates. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime (which is the time uncertainty). That makes sense because a shorter lifetime means a less precise measurement of energy.

So the idea here is that for each energy level, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. If the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. But if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might not be resolvable.

Let me think about each state. The first has a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds. Let's compute the uncertainty in energy for that. Similarly, the second has 10^-8 seconds.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So, we need to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the combined uncertainties of both states? Or do we compare it to each individually?

No, wait, actually, each state's energy has its own uncertainty. The energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps each state's uncertainty contributes. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again.

Suppose E1 has a lifetime τ1, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, E2 has τ2, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2. The energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1|. For them to be distinguishable, ΔE must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, I think. Or wait, maybe each state's ΔE is the uncertainty in its own energy, so the difference ΔE must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two, or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Let me approach this step by step.

First, compute the uncertainty for each energy level.

Calculating ΔE1: ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. Wait, but eV is another unit. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634 × 10^-19 J.

So to find ΔE in eV, we can compute ħ in eV·s. Let's calculate that.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
Convert to eV·s: 1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV. So,

ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s = (1.0545718e-34) / (1.602e-19) eV·s ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Wait, yes, I've heard that before. ħ is about 6.582e-16 eV·s. So, that will come in handy.

So, ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

For the first state, τ1 = 1e-9 sec.

ΔE1 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 6.582e-7 eV. So about 0.000658 eV.

Similarly, the second state has τ2 = 1e-8 sec.

ΔE2 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-8 s = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait a second, that's a smaller uncertainty than the first state. Because the lifetime is longer, the uncertainty is smaller.

So, the first state has a larger uncertainty, 6.58e-7 eV, and the second has 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, but the energy difference between the two states (E2 - E1) must be larger than the uncertainties for them to be distinguishable. Hmm, but is it the sum or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than each individual uncertainty. Because if the difference is less than either, it might not be resolvable.

Wait, let's think about it another way. If the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty of either state, then the measurements can't really tell them apart. So for the two states to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be larger than the maximum uncertainty of the two.

Wait, because if the energy difference is larger than either of their uncertainties, then even if each has a certain uncertainty, the separation is enough to distinguish them.

Wait, for example, if E2 is E1 + ΔE. E1 has an uncertainty of ΔE1, E2 has ΔE2. To clearly resolve E2 from E1, the ΔE should be larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because imagine if ΔE is just a bit larger than ΔE1 but smaller than ΔE2. Then, the uncertainty in E2 might be larger, and perhaps the energy levels could overlap in their uncertainties.

Wait
