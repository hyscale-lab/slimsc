Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The problem gives me some stability constants for different complexes, and I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Hmm, the options are A through D, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, let me start by recalling what I know about stability constants and complex formation. Stability constants (beta values) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the beta, the more the complex tends to form. So, the beta values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, that seems a bit odd because β3 is higher than β2 and β4 is lower than β2. So maybe the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or maybe another order. I think I should figure out the order of the complexes.

The problem asks specifically about the dithiocyanato complexes, which would be the [Co(SCN)_2] complex. So, the species we're interested in is the one with two SCN- ligands. So, I need to find the concentration of that species relative to all the cobalt species.

Wait, the stability constants are given in order, so β1 is for the first complex, which would be [Co(SCN)]^+ since Co^2+ has a charge of +2, and each SCN- is -, so with one SCN, the complex would have a charge of +1. Then β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2], which would be neutral because 2*(-1) + 2+ = 0. Similarly, β3 is for [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

So the four complexes are:

1. [Co(SCN)]^+ (β1 =9)
2. [Co(SCN)_2] (β2=40)
3. [Co(SCN)_3]^– (β3=63)
4. [Co(SCN)_4]^2– (β4=16)

Wait, but the beta values for the complexes can affect the distribution of each species. So, the higher the beta, the more the complex tends to form. So, the third complex has the highest beta here, but the fourth one has a lower beta than the second.

So, the goal is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] among all cobalt species. That means I need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] compared to all possible Co species.

The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. But wait, in solution, the Co^2+ can form various complexes with SCN-, so the total concentration is the sum of all the complexes. So, [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-} ] = 1e-2 M.

But wait, the problem says "the total cobalt
