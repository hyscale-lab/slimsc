Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, stability constants are something I remember from coordination chemistry. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. And the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN ligands, right? So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+ or something like that. But wait, I think the different complexes are with varying numbers of SCN^- ions. So the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^(2−n), where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. Since the stability constants are β1, β2, β3, β4, each corresponding to n=1 to 4.

But wait, the formation of complexes is a stepwise process. So the first step is Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)^2+ with β1=9. Then, the second step is Co(SCN)^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)₂^3+ with β2=40. Similarly, β3=63 for the third SCN addition, making [Co(SCN)₃]^4+, and β4=16 for the fourth, making [Co(SCN)₄]^4−?

Wait, maybe I should get the general picture. The overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise β's. So for each complex, the formation constant K_n is β1 * β2 * ... * βn, but wait, that's only if βs are stepwise. So for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, K1=β1=9. For the second complex, [Co(SCN)₂]^3+, K2=β1*β2=9*40=360. Similarly, K3=β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22
