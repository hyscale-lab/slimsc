Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what it says. Hmm, the question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. There are four steps, and some hints provided. 

Let me start by breaking down the reaction steps. 

First, compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B. Then, compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C. Next, compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and finally, D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

The hints given are a and b. Hint a says that when compound A is reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, which form alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. So, this suggests that compound A has a carbonyl group because Wittig reagents react with those.

Looking at the product of the Wittig reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The "propan-2-ylidene" group is a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH2)=, but maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's the ylid part. Wait, the ylid is typically something like Ph3P=CHR, right. So when it reacts with a carbonyl, it forms an alkene. 

The product structure given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1,2 (methyl groups), and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=, but perhaps I'm not visualizing it correctly. Alternatively, maybe the structure is cyclopentane with methyl groups at 1 and 2, and a substituent at 4 that is a propenyl group, perhaps like CH2CH(CH3) connected via a double bond.

Wait, but the product is from a Wittig reaction. So the starting material A is reacted with a ylide, which replaces an O with an alkene. So, if A is, say, a ketone, then the Wittig would add an alkene. Alternatively, maybe A is an aldehyde.

But wait, if A is a cyclic ketone, then the Wittig would form an alkene in the ring. Let me think about the product structure.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, no, perhaps it's an exocyclic double bond. So maybe the cyclopentane has a substituent that's a propenyl group attached at position 4, and that substituent is the result of the Wittig reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. Let me imagine the cyclopentane ring. Positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups. At position 4, there's a group that is propan-2-ylidene, which is a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 group? Or maybe it's a substituent that's a propenyl group attached via the double bond.

Wait, but the product is from a Wittig reaction. So the starting material A would have a carbonyl group, and the Wittig replaces the O with a CH2-CH2 group, but with a double bond. Wait, the Wittig reaction typically forms an alkene by replacing the carbonyl oxygen with a R group. So if A is a ketone, the ylide would attack the carbonyl, and the result would be the formation of an alkene.

Wait, maybe A is a cyclopentanone with certain substituents. Let me think. Let's consider that A is a cyclic ketone. So, when the Wittig reagent attacks, it would form a
