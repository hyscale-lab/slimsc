Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see. The question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects its brightness variations, which could be mistaken for an exoplanet. Hmm.

Alright, let me read the question again. So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So, the spots are at 5000K, right?

The problem says that when you observe this star, the brightness variations (due to spots rotating in and out of view) look similar to an exoplanet transiting the star. They're asking what the radius of such a planet would need to be so that the brightness dip is the same as the spot-induced variation. 

Wait, but the star isn't covered by spots, so in the hypothetical scenario, it's as if the exoplanet is causing the dip. We need to find Rpl/Rstar.

I remember that when a planet transits a star, the brightness dip is proportional to the area blocked by the planet. The area is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 because the area is proportional to the square of the radius. So the depth of the transit is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. 

But in the case of the star with spots, the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. But wait, how does that work? The spots are cooler, so when they face us, the total brightness decreases. The star's total brightness is a combination of the unspotted and spotted areas.

Wait, but in this setup, only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view. The hemisphere with spots has a certain area covered by spots. So the maximum variation would depend on the area of the spots relative to the star's surface.

Let me think about the brightness variation due to spots. The star's total brightness without any spots would be L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But with spots, when the spot side is facing us, part of the star's surface is cooler, so the observed brightness decreases.

The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere that is covered by spots. So each hemisphere has 20% coverage. But wait, the star is a sphere, so when viewed from Earth, only one hemisphere is visible at a time. If the spots are on one hemisphere, their effect depends on how much of that hemisphere is covered.

Wait, no. The star's surface area is 4πR². When one hemisphere is spotty, the area of the hemisphere is 2πR². The filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere, so the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². 

The unspotted part of the hemisphere (the other 80%) is 0.8 * 2πR² = 1.6πR². But wait, when the star is viewed, the hemisphere facing us is
