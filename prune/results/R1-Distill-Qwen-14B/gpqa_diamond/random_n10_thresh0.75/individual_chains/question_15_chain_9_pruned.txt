Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. I'm a bit rusty on my exoplanet detection methods, but let's try to work through this.

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one that's more likely to transit because they have limited time. Both are detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

So, both have the same mass. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Hmm, so Planet_1 is orbiting faster, I think. Wait, orbital period is the time it takes to go around the star once. So if Planet_1's period is shorter, it's closer to the star.

The host stars have different masses but the same radius. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. That's interesting because more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe Planet_1's star hasn't expanded yet because it's not evolved. Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so it's probably a subgiant or something, which might have expanded a bit but not enough to change the radius from the other star.

The question is about the probability of a transit. The transit method relies on the planet passing in front of the star from our point of view, blocking some light. The probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. But also, the size of the planet and the star matters. Oh wait, but since both planets are Earth-like, their radii are similar, so maybe the star's radius is the main factor here.

The probability of a transit is given by the formula: P = (R_s / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - eÂ²))) ), but wait, but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So it simplifies to (R_s / a), where R_s is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, no, I think I might have the formula wrong. Let me think again. The transit probability is actually the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit's projected on the sky. So the probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (something about the orbital inclination). Wait, more accurately, the probability
