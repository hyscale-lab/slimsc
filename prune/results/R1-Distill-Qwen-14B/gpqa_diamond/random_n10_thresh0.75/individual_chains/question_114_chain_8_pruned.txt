Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and uses reagent B (along with water) to form the corresponding butanoic acid.

Wait, what's happening in these reactions? I remember that when ketones react with CN- (like in the presence of NaCN), it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh right, the cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and adds to the carbonyl group.

So for the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but wait—after the nucleophilic addition, what happens? I think that usually, after adding CN- to a ketone, you get a cyanohydrin. The general reaction for ketones with CN- is R2CO + CN- → R2C(OH)CN, right? So the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group.

But the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product has another methyl group. Let me count: butanenitrile would be four carbons, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is CH2(COH)(CN)CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, butane is four carbons. So butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN but that's not right. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2CHCN, but that's pentanenitrile.
