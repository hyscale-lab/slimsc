Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. ESPRESSO is on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at Paranal, and HIRES is on the Keck Telescope in Hawaii. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17th magnitude in V, while HIRES can go down to 16th magnitude. Oh wait, no, wait—that's the apparent magnitude. So, a star that's brighter than 17 mag in V can be seen by ESPRESSO, meaning apparent magnitude ≤17. And HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitude ≤16. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if it's brighter than 16, ESPRESSO can see it (since 16 is less than 17), but if it's fainter than 16, HIRES can't detect it.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The problem states: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." So, the apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. So the star must have apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detected by both. Because if it's just 16, then both can see it. If it's 17, only ESPRESSO can see it (since HIRES can't go to 17). So the star's apparent magnitude needs to be ≤16.

Wait, but wait another thing. Apparent magnitude is the brightness as seen from Earth. So higher magnitude means fainter. So, a star with V=16 is brighter (more easily seen) than V=17. So for both instruments, the star must be at most 16th magnitude in apparent V. Because HIRES can't go beyond 16, so anything fainter than 16 (like 17) can't be seen by
