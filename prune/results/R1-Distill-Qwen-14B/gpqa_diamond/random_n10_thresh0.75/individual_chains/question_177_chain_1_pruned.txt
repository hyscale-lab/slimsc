Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the formulas, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let's list out the given information:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.
- Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 M2.
- The wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, I remember that the peak wavelength a star emits is related to its temperature. The formula is Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.
- The radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Do I need that for calculating luminosity? Because luminosity is an intrinsic property, but maybe the observed flux does. Wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosities assuming black body radiation. So perhaps the observed flux is adjusted for Doppler shift.

Wait, the problem says that the stars' wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So that's the observed wavelength, right? So if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength changes due to Doppler effect. But since both have the same observed lambda_max, maybe that gives us a clue about their actual temperatures or their Doppler shifts.

But I'm not sure. Let me think. Let's suppose that the observed lambda_max is the same. So using Wien's Law, the observed temperature would be different if they're moving. But wait, no. Because the star's actual temperature is T, and if it's moving, the observed temperature would be different. Hmm, perhaps I should calculate their actual temperatures based on their observed wavelengths.

Wait, wait. Or maybe the problem is telling me that the stars' intrinsic peak wavelengths are the same, but I don't think so. Because the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So that's the observed wavelength. So
