Okay, so I have this astronomy question about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? The formula I think is parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1 / r, where r is in parsecs. 

The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Wait, so N is proportional to 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in would help. Let me think: if plx = 1/r, then 1/plx would be r. So 1/plx^5 is r^5. Oh wait, because if plx is 1/r, then plx^5 is (1/r)^5, which is 1/r^5. So 1 over that would be r^5. 

So N is proportional to r^5. But wait, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance. Wait, but does it mean the number per unit distance? Oh, right, because if you have more stars in a larger volume, but the question is about per unit range of distance. Oh, I might be getting confused.

Wait, the number of stars is given as varying with 1/plx^5, which is r^5. But that's the total number up to a certain distance. But the question is about how the number changes per unit distance. So perhaps I should think in terms of differential number, like dN/dr.
