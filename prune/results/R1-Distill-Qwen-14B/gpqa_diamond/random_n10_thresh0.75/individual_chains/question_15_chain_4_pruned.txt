Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit, given certain parameters. Hmm, let me think through this.

Alright, the setup: two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have Earth-like masses, so same minimum mass. Both have circular orbits, so that's good—elliptical might complicate things, but circular might make probabilities easier.

The orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, 100 days, Planet_1's would be about 33 days. That means Planet_1 is closer to its star since it orbits faster. Wait, but the star's mass matters too. Oh right, Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. So Planet_1's star is more massive, but their host stars have the same radius. Interesting.

The question is about the probability of transiting. So the probability of a planet transiting depends on the alignment of its orbit with our line of sight. But since both planets have already been detected via the RV method, that suggests their orbits are edge-on enough that they cause a significant Doppler shift. But transit probability is a different thing—transit depends on the orbital inclination relative to us.

Wait, but the RV method requires a high enough inclination to cause the Doppler shift. So if a planet has been detected via RV, the inclination is at least enough for the Doppler effect. However, the actual probability of transit would depend on the chance that the inclination is exactly edge-on enough that the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view.

Wait, no. The probability of a planet transiting is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the distance from the star to the planet, times some function. Oh right, the formula I'm thinking of is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, and that term becomes 1. So P = R_star / a.

But wait, R_star is the radius of the star, and a is the semi-major axis, which for a circular orbit is the same as the orbital radius. So for each planet, the probability of transiting is (R_star / a). But wait, in our case, do we have
