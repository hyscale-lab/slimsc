Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question gives me five stars, each with different parameters. I need to figure out which ones are observable by both spectrographs based on their apparent magnitudes.

Wait, right. The key here is apparent V magnitude because both instruments have different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17 mag, meaning apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. HIRES can go down to 16 mag, so apparent V needs to be ≤16. So a star has to be bright enough for both; that is, its apparent magnitude has to be ≤16 because that's the stricter condition.

But wait, some of the stars have given their absolute magnitudes. I remember that absolute magnitude is what the star would look like at 10 parsecs away. So to get the apparent magnitude, I need to calculate that using the distance modulus formula. Oh right, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.

Also, some stars have extinction (E(B-V)), which affects their apparent magnitude. Because interstellar extinction makes stars appear dimmer and redder. The formula for extinction in V band is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So the apparent magnitude with extinction would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, extinction is an extinction, so it makes the star appear fainter. So if the star's light is dimmed, the apparent magnitude would be higher (since lower magnitudes are brighter). So the formula is m_observed = m_true + Av.

Wait, let me clarify. Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude a star would have at 10 pc, without extinction. But when it's actually further away and/or has extinction, the apparent magnitude increases (since it's dimmer). So for a star with extinction, its apparent magnitude is higher than if there were no extinction.

So let's go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, at 10 pc. Since distance is 10 pc, the distance modulus is 5 log(10/10) = 5*(0) = 0. So m = M + 0 = 15.5. But what about extinction? E(B-V) isn't given for Star1, so I assume no extinction. So apparent V mag is 15.5. 

ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so 15.5 is fine. HIRES can see up to 16, which is also fine since 15.5 <16. So Star1 is observable by both.

Wait no, wait. Wait, wait, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 mag with HIRES."

Wait, magnitude scale: lower numbers are brighter. So 16 is brighter than 17. So a star that's 16 mag is brighter than 1
