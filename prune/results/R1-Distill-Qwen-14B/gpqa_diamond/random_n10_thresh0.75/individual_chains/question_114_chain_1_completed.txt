Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. So, the question is about identifying the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me read the problem again.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, which gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, treated with reagent B (and H2O), to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. I remember that ketones can react with nitriles under certain conditions. Let me think about the first reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So when a ketone reacts with NaCN, is that a nucleophilic addition? Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution? Wait, ketones don't typically undergo nucleophilic substitution. Oh wait, perhaps it's a condensation reaction. Or maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin.

Oh right! Cyanohydrin formation. When a ketone reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) under acidic conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. The mechanism involves the attack of the nucleophile (CN-) on the carbonyl carbon. But for that, the carbonyl has to be activated, which usually requires an acid catalyst. So the reagent A here would be an acid, like H3O+.

So looking at the options, A is H3O+ in options A and B, and NaHSO3 in options C and D. So for the first part, reagent A should be H3O+ because that's the acid catalyst needed for cyanohydrin formation. So options C and D are probably out unless I'm missing something.

Wait, but could NaHSO3 act as a source of H+? Like, if it's a sulfuric acid source, maybe. But in the first reaction, I think the main catalyst is H3O+ (acid) to protonate the carbonyl. So reagent A is H3O+.

So that means the correct options are either A or B for the first part.

Now, looking at the second reaction. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile with a benzyl group (the full name is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile). They treat this with reagent B and water to get the corresponding butanoic acid. So what's happening here?

The nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen? Typically, nitriles are hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. But wait, in this case, the molecule already has a hydroxyl group (from the first reaction), and adding water with a reagent is converting the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

So for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, the usual conditions are strong acid (like HCl) with heat, or using a strong base followed by acid work-up. Alternatively, using a catalyst like H2SO4 or another acid.

Wait, but in the presence of a hydroxyl group, how does the hydrolysis proceed? Well, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids generally goes through an intermediate called an aminol, which then gets oxidized, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the conditions are aqueous acid.

So in the second reaction, the reagent B is either HCl or acetic acid. Let me think. If reagent B is HCl, then the conditions are acidic. If it's CH3COOH, that's a weaker acid, maybe not strong enough for the hydrolysis.

Wait, the reaction is in water. So if B is HCl, then it's an acidic aqueous solution. For the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, you typically need either strong acid (like HCl) and heat, or a strong base followed by acid. Another possibility is using a Lewis acid catalyst like H2SO4, but in this case, the options are between HCl and acetic acid.

So which reagent would facilitate the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid? HCl (a strong acid) would probably work. Acetic acid is a weaker acid, so maybe it's not strong enough. So reagent B is HCl.

Looking at the options, option A's B is HCl. Option B's B is CH3COOH. So the correct reagent for the second step is HCl, making option A the one with both A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

Wait, but another thought: the first reaction uses H3O+ as a catalyst, which is a strong acid. The second reaction, using HCl as a reagent in water, would provide the necessary acidic conditions.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl group, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the appropriate acid catalyst, ruling out NaHSO₃ as a viable reagent for this step.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in the presence of water and reagent B. The conversion of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. Since the options provided include HCl (a strong acid) and CH₃COOH (a weak acid), HCl is the more suitable reagent for facilitating this hydrolysis.

Combining these observations, the correct reagents for the two reactions are H₃O⁺ for the first step and HCl for the second step. This corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
