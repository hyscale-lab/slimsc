Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try my best.

Alright, the problem says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium isn't just c divided by the refractive index. Oh wait, actually, yes, that's right! The speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. So in this case, the speed of light within the glass is c divided by n. But wait, the glass is moving. Does that affect the speed of light as observed in the lab frame?

Hmm, so I think about frames of reference here. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is moving at speed c/n in the glass. But does the velocity of the glass add to the light's velocity? Or is it more complicated?

Wait, no. Because when you have moving media, the situation is a bit more complex than just adding velocities. I remember that in classical mechanics, velocities add linearly, but for light, which is an electromagnetic wave, things are different because the speed of light in a vacuum is constant, according to Einstein's postulate.

Wait, but
