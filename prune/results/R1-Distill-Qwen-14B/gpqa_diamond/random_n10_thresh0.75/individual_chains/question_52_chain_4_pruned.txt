Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem involves a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, their overall brightness and temperature can change, but how does that affect the ionization states or energy levels of elements in their photosphere?

Alright, let's break down the given information. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the presence of spots makes the star cooler on average.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, why would the ratio change? Oh, right! This is related to the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where:
- n is the number of particles in each level,
- g is the statistical weight (degeneracy),
- E is the energy,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

So, the ratio depends on temperature. When the star's temperature changes, this ratio changes. The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Lower Teff means lower temperature in the photosphere. Since the ratio (n2/n1) is inversely proportional to temperature, a lower T would make this ratio smaller, which fits with the observation that the ratio decreases.

Wait, but wait. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…. That's in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. So, it's probably a specific spectral line that's being observed.

The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, when the star is spotless, the temperature is 6000 K, and when it has spots, the overall T drops to 5500 K. So, we need to compute the ratio (n2/n1) at 6000 K and 5500 K and find the factor.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because 40% of the surface is covered by spots, does that affect how we calculate the overall temperature? Or is the given Teff already the average? The problem says when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, I think we can treat the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when the spots are present, for the purpose of this calculation.

But wait, no. Wait, the photosphere is a mix of spotted and unspotted regions. Oh, but the question says "in the stellar photosphere", so maybe the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So, perhaps we model the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when not.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So, I think the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K in that case. So, the photosphere as a whole is modeled as being at 5500 K when spots are present.

So, the ratio of n2/n1 is computed using Teff. So, when the star is spotless, Teff is 6000 K, and when spotted, Teff is 55
