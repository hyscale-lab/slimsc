Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, first I should remember what regularization means. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite quantities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make these infinities manageable so that you can calculate physical quantities that are finite.

So, each option is a different theory. Let me think about each one.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). I know that QED is a quantum field theory that deals with electrons and photons. It's a renormalizable theory. Renormalization is a process that comes after regularization. So QED does have divergences, and thus requires regularization. So it's not the answer they're looking for.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interaction. QCD also has issues with divergences, especially at high energies. But wait, I remember that QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak. So maybe the behavior is better, but does it still require regularization? Well, I think QCD calculations still need regularization because of loop divergences. So B probably isn't the correct answer.

Option A is Superstring Theory. String theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining gravity with quantum mechanics. I've heard that string theories are finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences that occur in quantum field theories. Wait, because in string theory, particles are extended objects, and the interactions are different. So maybe string theory doesn't require regularization because the divergences are absent. But wait, superstring theory might still have some issues at high energies? Or is it that it's free from certain types of divergences? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think that in string theory, the perturbative expansions don't produce the same divergences as in QED or QCD, so maybe they don't require regularization. Or perhaps they use a different approach since they don't use the same Feynman diagram approach as QFTs.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the non-quantum version
