Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star move. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the planet's presence.

The problem says that there are two stars with exactly the same masses, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, which probably means their velocities are more straightforward to calculate without worrying about eccentricity.

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times the orbital period of Planet #2 is longer than that of Planet #1.

Wait, so the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula for radial velocity semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v*sin i) where v is the star's velocity due to the planet. But more accurately, I think the formula for K involves the planet's mass, the orbital period, the inclination angle, and the mass of the star.

Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is: 

K = [ (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / sin i) ) * (1 / (2π * (P/(2π))^(1/3))) )

Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period.

Wait, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is related to the velocity of the star, which depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the mass of the star. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses to Neptune, maybe their masses are similar enough that M_p is much smaller than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So I can ignore the planet's mass in this approximation.

Another approach: the RV method's semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = (2π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*)^(2/3) )

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = [ ( (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (T * sin i)) )

But since M_* >> M_p, the denominator (M_* + M_p)^2 ≈ M_*^2. Also, for circular orbits, e is zero, so (1-e^2) is 1. Also, sin i is approximately 1 because we're assuming edge-on orbits (which is the case for maximum Doppler shift). So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( ( G * M_p^3 ) / M_*^2 )^(1/3) / T )

Wait, let me check the units. G has units of m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. M_p is in kg, M_* in kg, T in seconds.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is: 

K = [ ( (27 * π) / (2 c^3) ) * ( (M_p^3) / (M_*^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P sin i) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Maybe I can think about the relationship between K and the orbital period.

Since the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the dominant factors here are the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P.

I remember that for a given planet mass and star mass, a longer orbital period (larger P) would lead to a smaller semi-amplitude K. Because the planet is farther away (since P is longer), the star doesn't move as quickly in its orbit—so the Dop
