Okay, so I've got this problem about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let's try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's see what I remember.

So the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe which one has a higher probability of transiting. They have limited time, so they need to choose the one more likely to transit.

Both planets were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2's is P2=3P1.

Both orbits are circular. The host stars have different masses but the same radii. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Oh, and the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, but that doesn't matter for the transit probability, I think.

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But I remember that the probability isn't just a yes or no; it's a function of the orbital parameters.

Wait, the formula for the transit probability is something like (R_s / a) where R_s is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. But wait, I think the probability is proportional to (R_s)/(a) divided by something else... maybe (1 + (R_p)/(R_s)) where R_p is the planet's radius. But since both are Earth-like, R_p is similar, so maybe we can ignore that for this approximation.

Oh right, the probability of a transit is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, but I think for Earth-like planets, the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, so R_planet is negligible. So the probability is approximately (R_star) / (a). But wait, actually, the probability is higher when the semi-major axis is smaller because the transit is more likely when the orbit is edge-on, but the probability is also a geometric probability.

Wait, let me think more carefully. The formula for the probability P of a transit is:

P = (R_s + R_p) / a

But since R_p << R_s, it's approximated as R_s / a. However, another factor is the star's
