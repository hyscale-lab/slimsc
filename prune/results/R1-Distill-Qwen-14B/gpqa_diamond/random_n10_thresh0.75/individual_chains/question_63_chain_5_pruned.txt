Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and photons. Hmm, I need to find out the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest energy. The question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor model. Right, I remember that in such models, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration.

So the molecule is currently in its fundamental state. The fundamental state... wait, in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in the ground state, and when it absorbs a photon, it should transition to the next possible lowest energy state. But wait, what's the next state? It could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, but I think the question is about the lowest possible energy increase. Or maybe it's a combination of both.

Wait, the question is about the photon causing the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule transitions from the ground state to the first excited state, which could involve either a change in vibrational or rotational energy or both.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. Oh, but wait, maybe the question is considering both rotational and vibrational transitions. Or perhaps each transition (rotational or vibrational) has its own set of energy levels.

Let me think. The molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental vibrational state is n=0 for vibration, and for rotation, the ground state is typically the lowest
