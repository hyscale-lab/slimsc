Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles equal, which is why here all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the lattice parameter 'a', right? So a = 10 Angstroms.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. That's the d-spacing, calculated using the formula d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ). Wait, but wait, for a rhombohedral system, since all angles are equal, maybe the formula simplifies a bit?

Wait, in a cubic system, which is a special case of rhombohedral where angles are 90 degrees, the formula simplifies to d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But here the angles are 30 degrees, so I can't use that. I need to stick with the general formula.

The plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1. All the cos terms will involve cos(30°), which is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.866. Let me plug the numbers into the formula.

So, let's compute the denominator first. The expression inside the square root is:

h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosα - 2hl cosβ - 2kl cosγ.

Since all angles are 30°, cosα = cosβ = cosγ = cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So substituting:

1² + 1² + 1² - 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) - 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) - 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, let's compute each term:

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Now the other terms:

-2hk cosα = -2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) = -sqrt(3).

Same for the others:

-2hl cosβ
