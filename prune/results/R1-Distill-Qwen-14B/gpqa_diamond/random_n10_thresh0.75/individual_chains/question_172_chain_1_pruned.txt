Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere relates to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the more excited the atoms are because thermal energy excites their energy levels.

Wait, so when they say "twice as excited," I think that refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to the lower one. Oh wait, actually, I'm a little confused. Oh wait, no, the ratio might be about the excitation levels. Oh wait, actually, maybe it's the ratio of populations in a specific energy level compared to another. Oh, right, in the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann distribution tells us about the population of different energy states in thermal equilibrium. The formula is (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. If the energy difference is ΔE = E_i - E_j, then the ratio depends exponentially on ΔE and T.

In this problem, the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, isn't that a familiar number? Let me think, Boltzmann's constant is k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, so the energy difference ΔE is equal to k*T. Wait, because ΔE = k*T, which would mean T = ΔE /k. But wait, that can't be right because that would give T in Kelvin, but only if ΔE is equal to k*T. Hmm, but in this case, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K) multiplied by 1 K. So ΔE = k*T, so T would be 1 K? That seems low, but maybe it's just a setup.

Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So the excitation level ratio is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2. Wait, no, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So n1_high / n1_low = 2*(n2_high /n2_low). Or perhaps, wait, maybe n1_high / n1_low is twice as much as n2_high/n2_low. Or maybe the excitation is twice as high, so the ratio is 2 times higher. Hmm.

Wait, let me clarify. The question states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for each atom, the excitation energy is higher? Or perhaps the number of atoms in a higher energy level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, no, excitation in a specific energy level could mean the number in that level. Wait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous
