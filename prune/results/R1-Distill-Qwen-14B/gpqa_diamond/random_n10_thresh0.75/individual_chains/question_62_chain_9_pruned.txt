Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The formula part might help. The name suggests there's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent attached. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So, that would be a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexane ring and an OH group. So maybe it's like a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2-OH and another CH2 to the main cyclohexane ring. Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a side chain that has a cyclohexyl, a hydroxymethyl, and another part. Hmm, maybe I should draw this out.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The substituent is at position 1. So the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at one carbon. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So that substituent is a CH2 group, where one of the H's is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and another by a hydroxyl group. Wait, no, perhaps it's a CH group: cyclohexyl, hydroxy, and methyl? Or perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, the substituent is a methyl group (CH2) attached to a cyclohexane, and that same methyl has a hydroxyl group. Or, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is then attached to the main ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group where one of the carbons is attached to a cyclohexyl and an OH. So the substituent would look like a CH(OH) connected to a cyclo
