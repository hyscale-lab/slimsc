Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativity and particle physics. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, its isotope must be Li-6, right? Because Li normally has 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

The options given are A to D, all in GeV. So I need to find the total energy the ion has when its speed is 0.96 times the speed of light.

I remember from my studies that in relativity, when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy increases due to relativistic effects. The total energy of a moving particle isn't just its rest mass energy; it's higher because of gamma, the Lorentz factor.

The total energy E is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, E = γmc². Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Let me compute gamma. So v = 0.96c. Plugging into the equation:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²).

0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Taking the square root of that, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, right? Because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Hmm, 1 divided by 0.28... that's approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1, yes. So gamma is roughly 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be found by adding the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. But wait, actually, the atomic mass includes electrons too, but since it's a nucleus, maybe I should just consider the mass of the nucleons.

Wait, no. The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and the electrons are separate. But in the context of ion energy, I think the question is assuming the nucleus is a bare nucleus, but sometimes ions have specific charges. Lithium typically has 3 electrons, so as a Li+ ion, it would have lost those 3 electrons. But wait, the problem just says nucleus X, so maybe it's a bare nucleus, which would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, the mass of a Li-6 atom is about... I think the atomic mass can be found using the periodic table. Let me think. Li has an atomic number of 3, and Li-6 has mass number 6, so 3 protons, 3 neutrons. The exact mass can be found using the mass of a proton, neutron, and the binding energy, but perhaps I can approximate it using known values.

The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, the mass would be 3*(proton mass) + 3*(neutron mass). Let me compute that.

3 * 938 = 2814 MeV, and 3 * 939.565 = approximately 2818.695 MeV. Adding them together, 2814 + 2818.695 = 5632.695 MeV. Wait, but wait a minute—that's just adding the masses of the protons and neutrons. But in reality, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum because of the binding energy (mass defect). Oh, right! So I can't just add the individual masses. Hmm, this complicates things.

But maybe the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus as a given value, perhaps calculated using the appropriate atomic mass. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mass of the ion, which is the same as the nucleus since it's a bare nucleus.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I can find the mass of Li-6 in atomic mass units (AMU) and then convert that to GeV.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01514 atomic mass units. Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact value, but let's say it's about 6.01514 u. I might need to check that. Alternatively, I can use the mass of a proton and neutron and account for the binding energy, but that might be more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can find the rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus in GeV. Let me think.

1 atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 0.9315 GeV/c². So 6.01514 u would be 6.01514 * 0.9315 GeV/c². Let me compute that.

6.01514 * 0.9315 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589. Then 0.01514 * 0.9315 is approximately 0.01406. Adding them together gives about 5.603 GeV/c².

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate that more accurately. 6.01514 * 0.9315.

6 * 0.9315 is 5.589.

0.01514 * 0.9315 = let's compute that. 0.01 * 0.9315 is 0.009315. 0.00514 * 0.9315 is approximately 0.004782. So total is 0.009315 + 0.004782 = 0.014097.

Adding to the 5.589 gives 5.603097 GeV/c². So approximately 5.6031 GeV/c².

But I'm not certain about the exact value of the Li-6 mass. Maybe I should double-check this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon multiplied by 6, but that would neglect binding energy, which is incorrect.

Wait another approach: for heavy ions, sometimes the mass is approximated by the number of nucleons multiplied by the average mass of a nucleon. But that's not precise. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is about 6.01514 u. So 6.01514 u * 0.9315 GeV/u.

Wait, let me compute 6.01514 * 0.9315 more accurately.

Let me calculate 6.01514 * 0.9315:

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589

0.01514 * 0.9315 = Let's compute 0.01 * 0.9315 = 0.009315 and 0.00514 * 0.9315.

0.005 * 0.9315 = 0.0046575. 0.00014 * 0.9315 = 0.00013041. So 0.0046575 + 0.00013041 = 0.00478791.

So total for 0.01514 is 0.009315 + 0.00478791 = 0.01410291.

Adding to 5.589: 5.589 + 0.01410291 = 5.60310291 GeV/c².

So approximately 5.6031 GeV/c² for the rest mass energy.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. No, the rest mass energy is mc². So if m is 5.6031 GeV/c², then the rest energy is just 5.6031 GeV.

So, the total energy E = γ * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.6031 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.6031.

Hmm, 3 * 5.6031 is 16.8093. 0.5714 * 5.6031.

0.5 * 5.6031 = 2.80155. 0.0714 * 5.6031 ≈ 0.4018.

So 2.80155 + 0.4018 ≈ 3.20335.

Adding to 16.8093: 16.8093 + 3.20335 ≈ 20.0126 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20.01 GeV. But let me do a more accurate multiplication.

3.5714 * 5.6031.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.6031.

We can compute it as:

5.6031 * 3 = 16.8093

5.6031 * 0.5714 = ?

0.5 *5.6031 = 2.80155

0.07 *5.6031 = 0.392217

0.0014 *5.6031≈ 0.007844.

Adding those: 2.80155 + 0.392217 = 3.193767 + 0.007844 = 3.201611.

So total is 16.8093 + 3.201611 = 20.010911 GeV.

So approximately 20.01 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher. Option B is 23.069, and option A is 18.475.

Wait, but wait—maybe I made a mistake in calculating the gamma.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2).

v is 0.96c. So v^2/c^2 is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. That looks correct.

Wait, but perhaps I used the wrong mass for the nucleus. Maybe the mass is higher. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the rest energy.

Wait, the mass of Li-6 is 6.01514 u. Converting that to GeV/c²: 6.01514 * 0.931494 GeV/c². Wait, maybe the exact conversion factor is 0.931494 GeV/u. So let's compute that.

6.01514 * 0.931494.

Let me compute this step by step.

Compute 6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964 GeV/c².

0.01514 * 0.931494 = let's compute 0.01 * 0.931494 = 0.00931494.

0.00514 * 0.931494 = compute 0.005 * 0.931494 = 0.00465747, and 0.00014 *0.931494 ≈ 0.00013041.

Adding 0.00465747 and 0.00013041 gives ~0.00478788.

So 0.00931494 + 0.00478788 = 0.01410282 GeV/c².

Adding to 5.588964 gives 5.588964 + 0.01410282 = 5.60306682 GeV/c².

So rest energy is about 5.6031 GeV.

So E = gamma * rest energy = 3.5714 * 5.6031 ≈ 20.01 GeV.

Looking back at the options, the closest one is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma when v=0.96c.

v^2/c^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So 3.57142857 * 5.60306682 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 5.60306682.

I'll do this step by step.

3 *5.60306682 = 16.80920046.

0.57142857 *5.60306682.

Let me compute 0.5 *5.60306682 = 2.80153341.

0.07142857 *5.60306682: Let's compute 0.07 *5.60306682 = 0.3922146774. 0.00142857 *5.60306682 ≈ 0.007997. So total is approximately 0.3922146774 + 0.007997 ≈ 0.40021168.

So 0.5 *5.60306682 is 2.80153341, and 0.07142857 *5.60306682 ≈ 0.40021168.

Adding those: 2.80153341 + 0.40021168 = 3.20174509.

So total E is 16.80920046 +3.20174509 = 20.01094555 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's a bit higher than my calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Maybe the rest mass is higher than 5.6031 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is a charged ion. Wait, the problem says it's a nucleus, so perhaps it's a bare nucleus, meaning no electrons. So the mass would just be the nuclear mass.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01514 u, but perhaps I should use a more precise value for the conversion factor. Let me see: 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c², which is 0.931494 GeV/c².

Wait, perhaps I should carry out more precise calculation steps.

Let me recalculate the mass in GeV/c².

m = 6.01514 u * 0.931494 GeV/u.

6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964 GeV.

0.01514 * 0.931494 = let's calculate that.

0.01 *0.931494 = 0.00931494.

0.00514 *0.931494 = (0.005 *0.931494) + (0.00014 *0.931494).

0.005 * 0.931494 = 0.00465747.

0.00014 *0.931494 = 0.00013040916.

Adding those gives 0.00465747 + 0.00013040916 = 0.00478787916.

Adding 0.00931494 (from the 0.01 part) and 0.00478787916 gives 0.01410281916 GeV.

Adding to the 5.588964 GeV gives 5.588964 + 0.01410281916 = 5.603066819 GeV/c².

So, the rest mass energy is 5.603066819 GeV.

Gamma is approximately 3.57142857.

So, E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.603066819 GeV.

Let me compute this multiplication precisely.

3.57142857 * 5.603066819.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.603066819 = 16.809200457.

0.57142857 *5.603066819.

Compute 0.5 *5.603066819 = 2.8015334095.

0.07142857 *5.603066819.

Compute 0.07 *5.603066819 = 0.39221467733.

0.00142857 *5.603066819 ≈ 0.007997.

Adding these gives 0.39221467733 + 0.007997 = 0.4002116773.

Adding the 0.5 part: 2.8015334095 + 0.4002116773 = 3.2017450868.

So total is 16.809200457 +3.2017450868 = 20.01094554 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV. But wait, that's higher. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the mass calculation. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula for the total energy of a relativistic particle.

Wait, another approach: the total energy E is gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which for v=0.96c is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 ≈3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 * m c².

If m is 5.6030668 GeV/c², then E = 3.57142857 *5.6030668.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise multiplication.

Let me perform 3.57142857 *5.6030668.

Let me write it as:

3.57142857 * 5.6030668.

We can compute this as (3 + 0.57142857) *5.6030668.

Which is 3*5.6030668 + 0.57142857 *5.6030668.

3 *5.6030668 = 16.8092004.

0.57142857 *5.6030668.

Let me compute 5.6030668 * 0.57142857.

I can compute 5.6030668 * (4/7) since 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7 (4/7≈0.57142857).

But perhaps it's better to compute it directly.

0.5 *5.6030668 = 2.8015334.

0.07 *5.6030668 = 0.392214676.

0.00142857 *5.6030668 ≈ 0.007997.

Adding those: 2.8015334 + 0.392214676 = 3.193748076 + 0.007997 ≈3.201745076.

So total E = 16.8092004 +3.201745076 = 20.010945476 GeV.

That's about 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So 20.01 GeV isn't among the options, but option C is 20.132, which is close. Hmmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is a Li-7? Because Li typically has 3 neutrons as an isotope. Or maybe I messed up the isotope.

Wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, which makes it Li-6.

Wait, but maybe the rest mass is higher than I thought. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact mass in MeV.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me check some sources. Oh wait, I can't actually look it up right now, but perhaps I can estimate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) as about 938 MeV and multiply by 6. That would give 6 * 0.938 GeV = 5.628 GeV. But that ignores binding energy, which is about a few MeV per nucleon. For 6 nucleons, perhaps the binding energy is around 6 * 1 MeV = 6 MeV, which is 0.006 GeV. So 5.628 - 0.006 = 5.622 GeV. So perhaps the rest mass is closer to 5.622 GeV.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 5.6031 GeV. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation and see which option is the closest.

Wait, if the rest mass is 5.622 GeV, then E =3.5714 *5.622 ≈ 3.5714 *5.622.

3 *5.622 = 16.866.

0.5714 *5.622 ≈ 0.5 *5.622 =2.811, 0.0714*5.622≈0.403. Total ≈3.214.

So total E≈16.866 +3.214=20.08 GeV.

Still close to 20 GeV, so options C is 20.132, which is perhaps the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma more precisely. Let me check.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the value more accurately.

Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216, so 1-0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So, it's precise.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic energy formula, including the rest mass and kinetic energy. Wait, but no, E here is the total energy, which is what the question asks for.

Alternatively, perhaps the nucleus is moving with speed v, so its kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m c². But the question asks for the total energy, which is gamma m c².

So, perhaps the correct answer should be approximately 20 GeV, but none of the options is exactly 20.01. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps my calculation of the rest mass is a bit off. Let me see—maybe the actual rest mass is 5.615 GeV. Let's compute E as 3.5714 *5.615 = ?

3.5714 *5.615.

Let me compute 3*5.615=16.845.

0.5714 *5.615.

0.5 *5.615=2.8075.

0.0714 *5.615 ≈0.40203.

Adding 2.8075 and 0.40203 gives 3.20953.

Total E=16.845+3.20953=20.0545 GeV.

Still, the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is 5.64 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Another way to approach this is to use the exact formula for the energy.

E = gamma * m c².

But perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. So, let's compute gamma= 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) precisely.

v=0.96c.

v^2=0.9216 c².

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 -0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714... exactly.

So exactly, gamma is 35/10 = 3.5. Wait, no. 35/10 is 3.5. No, 1/0.28 is 3.57142857.

So, perhaps the problem is expecting a more precise calculation of the rest mass. Let me think about the exact mass of Li-6.

Upon checking (or recalling from memory), the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.01514 u. So converting that to GeV/c²:

6.01514 u * 0.931494 GeV/u = ?

6 * 0.931494 =5.588964 GeV.

0.01514 *0.931494 = let's compute that.

0.01514 *0.931494.

0.01 *0.931494 =0.00931494.

0.00514 *0.931494.

Compute 0.005 *0.931494 =0.00465747.

0.00014 *0.931494=0.00013040916.

Adding those gives 0.00465747 +0.00013040916=0.00478787916.

So, 0.01514 *0.931494 =0.00931494 +0.00478787916=0.01410281916 GeV.

Adding to 5.588964 gives 5.603066819 GeV/c².

So, the exact rest energy is 5.603066819 GeV.

So, E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.603066819 GeV.

Let me compute this product precisely.

3.57142857 *5.603066819.

We can compute this as:

3.57142857 ×5.603066819 = ?

Let me use a calculator-like approach.

3.57142857 ×5.603066819.

Breaking it down:

3 ×5.603066819 =16.809200457.

0.57142857×5.603066819.

0.5 ×5.603066819=2.8015334095.

0.07142857×5.603066819.

Compute 0.07×5.603066819=0.39221467733.

0.00142857×5.603066819≈0.007997.

Adding these gives 0.39221467733 +0.007997=0.40021167733.

So, 0.57142857×5.603066819=2.8015334095+0.40021167733=3.20174508683.

Total E=16.809200457 +3.20174508683=20.0109455438 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher than my calculation. So perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait a second, perhaps the problem is considering the charge and therefore uses the charge state. Wait, Li typically has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so neutral. But if it's an ion, perhaps it's a Li^3+ ion, meaning it has lost all three electrons, so the charge is +3. But since the nucleus is neutral in charge, maybe it doesn't affect the mass. Or does it?

Wait, the mass of the ion includes the electrons. No, wait, in a nucleus, the electrons are separate. So the mass of the ion would be the mass of the nucleus plus the electrons' mass, but since it's a bare nucleus, perhaps the electrons are not included. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the nucleus itself is Li-6, so the bare nucleus would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so the mass is as calculated before.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the atomic mass of Li-6, which includes electrons. No, because the nucleus doesn't include the electrons. The atomic mass is the mass of the atom, which includes electrons. But for a bare nucleus, the mass is just the sum of protons and neutrons' masses, minus binding energy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. Maybe the correct rest energy is about 5.615 GeV. Let me compute E with that.

E=3.57142857 ×5.615 = ?

3 ×5.615=16.845.

0.57142857 ×5.615.

0.5 ×5.615=2.8075.

0.07142857 ×5.615≈0.40203.

Adding: 2.8075 +0.40203=3.20953.

Total E=16.845 +3.20953=20.0545 GeV.

Still, the closest option is C) 20.132.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 23.069 GeV or D)21.419 GeV. Wait, that's higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me recalculate gamma.

Wait, for v=0.96c:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Another thought: perhaps the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, and the energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. But the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed ... is 0.96c." So it's the total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic. So no, that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the mass I'm using is wrong. Let me see. The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01514 u. 1u is 931.494 MeV/c², which is 0.931494 GeV/c². So 6.01514 × 0.931494 GeV/c².

Let me compute this precisely.

6.01514 ×0.931494.

Compute 6 ×0.931494 =5.588964 GeV.

0.01514 ×0.931494: let's compute this as (0.01 +0.005 +0.00014) ×0.931494.

0.01 ×0.931494 =0.00931494.

0.005 ×0.931494=0.00465747.

0.00014 ×0.931494≈0.00013040916.

Adding those: 0.00931494 +0.00465747=0.01397241 +0.00013040916=0.01410281916 GeV.

Total mass energy:5.588964 +0.01410281916=5.603066819 GeV.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the options are using a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the kinetic energy and then add the rest mass energy. Wait, but the question asks for the total energy, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is not 0.96c, but gamma is 0.96? No, that's not possible. Gamma must be at least 1.

Wait, no, gamma is 3.57 as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the unit conversion. Did I mix MeV and GeV? Let me check.

Wait, 1 u is 931.494 MeV/c², which is 0.931494 GeV/c². So yes, that's correct.

Hmm, I'm not sure where the discrepancy is. According to my calculations, the correct energy is approximately 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps my calculation was slightly off, and the actual value is 20.132 GeV. Let me check the exact multiplication.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.603066819.

Using a more precise method:

3.57142857 ×5.603066819.

Let's write it as:

5.603066819 ×3 =16.809200457.

5.603066819 ×0.57142857.

Compute 5.603066819 ×0.5 =2.8015334095.

5.603066819 ×0.07142857.

Compute 5.603066819 ×0.07 =0.39221467733.

5.603066819 ×0.00142857≈0.007997.

So adding up, 0.39221467733 +0.007997=0.40021167733.

So, 5.603066819 ×0.57142857=2.8015334095 +0.40021167733=3.20174508683.

Total E=16.809200457 +3.20174508683=20.0109455438 GeV.

So, approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Hmm. So none of the options exactly match this. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV. But that's about 0.12 GeV higher than my calculation. Could there be an error in my approach?

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is moving with a speed such that its velocity is 0.96c, but the question is about the kinetic energy, not the total energy. But that's not what the question states. The question asks for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c, which I think refers to the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the energy is given per nucleon. Wait, no, the question states the energy for the nucleus X, which is a Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass. Let me think again.

Wait, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01514 u. So the exact rest energy is 6.01514 ×0.931494 GeV.

Let me compute 6.01514 ×0.931494.

Compute 6 ×0.931494 =5.588964.

0.01514 ×0.931494.

As before, 0.01514 ×0.931494 =0.01410281916.

So total is 5.588964 +0.01410281916 =5.603066819 GeV.

So, that's correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. All my calculations point to approximately 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, another check: gamma for v=0.96c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is higher. Let me see: if the rest mass is 5.64 GeV, then E=3.57142857 *5.64=20.12 GeV, which is very close to option C.

So perhaps the mass is 5.64 GeV/c².

But why would the mass be 5.64? Earlier calculation with Li-6 gives 5.603 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore binding energy and use 6 * 0.938 GeV.

6 *0.938=5.628 GeV.

So E=3.5714 *5.628 = ?

3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.628.

Compute 3.5714 ×0.6 =2.14284.

3.5714 ×0.028=0.100.

So total 2.14284 +0.100=2.24284.

Adding to 17.857: 17.857 +2.24284=20.09984 GeV, approximately 20.10 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV).

Ah, now that's closer! So perhaps the problem expects us to use the mass of a nucleon as 0.938 GeV and multiply by the number of nucleons (6), giving 5.628 GeV.

Then, E=3.5714 *5.628 ≈20.10 GeV.

Which is close to option C:20.132 GeV.

So, perhaps that's the approach the problem expects. So the correct answer would be option C) 20.132 GeV.


To calculate the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy \( E \) of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the particle, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The Li-6 nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so its atomic mass is approximately \( 6.01514 \, \text{u} \). Converting this to energy using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 0.931494 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \):

\[
m c^2 = 6.01514 \times 0.931494 \, \text{GeV} \approx 5.6031 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Using \( E = \gamma m c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.6031 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.01 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.01 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**. Minor discrepancies may arise due to rounding or approximations in the rest mass or \( \gamma \) calculation.
