Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the problem again carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So first, it's heated with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, which gives product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

The options for coupling patterns are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

Hmm. Let me break this down reaction by reaction.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when dibromides react with a strong base like KOH, especially under heating, it's likely an elimination reaction. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is quite rigid. The dibromide in 1,3 positions would lead to a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene, perhaps? Or more correctly, the base would abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4, but wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond. Wait, actually, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br's on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. When KOH is used, each Br leaves, but since it's a dihalide, perhaps a double elimination occurs, leading to an allene or a diene.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-diene. Alternatively, maybe it's 1,2-diene? I'm a bit unsure, but let's think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid, which is a bicyclic structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the Br's on two opposite positions. Heating with KOH would likely lead to elimination, forming an alkene. Since each Br is on adjacent carbons (but wait, in adamantane, the carbons 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. Wait, perhaps they are on the same face? Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a cyclohexene or something similar. Wait, no, adamantane is a rigid structure. When 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, I think it undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form a diene. But considering the structure, perhaps each Br is on adjacent carbons in a way that elimination can form a conjugated diene.

Wait, another approach: looking at the 1H NMR of product 1. The data is given as 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests an ester or ketone or maybe an aldehyde. But then, in the first reaction, the product is a solid formed from elimination, like an alkene. However, an IR peak at 1720 is more likely a carbonyl group. But wait, if it's KOH and elimination, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, because epoxides typically show peaks around 1200-1300 cm-1. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone or ester.

Wait, maybe the initial product is not an alkene but an epoxide. But how? 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH... Oh, wait, if two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form an epoxide. Because when you have vicinal dihalides (adjacent dihalides) reacting with a base, they can form epoxides. So if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons (like 1 and 2), then KOH would form an epoxide. But the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so maybe the Brs are on carbons that are not adjacent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is an ester or a ketone. But how? That would require something like a substitution reaction. But KOH is a base, so maybe it's elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enolate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indicator. That's a carbonyl group, probably an ester or ketone. So maybe the product is a ketone.

Wait, but dibromides reacting with a base usually form alkenes via elimination. So how does that lead to a ketone? Maybe it's a double elimination. Wait, perhaps each Br is on a secondary carbon, and elimination leads to forming a carbonyl. For instance, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a tertiary carbon, like in a vicinal dihalide, then elimination with two H's would form a carbonyl.

Wait, that's possible. So for example, if you have a dihalide where each X is on a CH2 group next to a CH2 group, elimination of HX twice would form a carbonyl. So for example, if you have CH2BrCH2Br, elimination would give O=C=O, but that's O2. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a CH2 adjacent to a CH group, and elimination forms a ketone.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that each Br is on a CH2 group next to a CH group. So when KOH abstracts a beta hydrogen, each Br leaves, and the two adjacent CH2 groups lose H and Br, forming a double bond between the two CH groups, which would then form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone? Or maybe a single ketone. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diepoxide, but that would require an epoxide, but the IR doesn't fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alcohol, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should examine the NMR of product 1. The NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet perhaps. Then 2.41-2.23 (10H), probably a multiplet for the adamantane structure. And 1.94 (2H). So, the 4.79 ppm is likely an -OCH2- group, but wait, that's more like an ether or ester. Or perhaps an -OCH2CH2- group. Alternatively, if it's a carbonyl, perhaps the 4.79 is adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, another idea: maybe the product is an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a strong peak at 1720. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. For example, if the two Brs are eliminated, each leaving a carbonyl group. But that would require each Br to be on a carbon that can form a carbonyl upon elimination.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group adjacent to a CH2Br group, leading to elimination to form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's an alkylation. Wait, no, KOH is a base, so elimination is more likely.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably an -OCH2- group because that's a common region for such protons. The 10H between 2.41 and 2.23 ppm are probably the adamantane's CH groups. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be some other CH2 group. So perhaps the product is a diether or an ester.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is more likely an ester or a ketone. So perhaps the product is a ketone. But how?

Wait, another possibility: the product could be a diol. If two eliminations occur, but that would require two H2O molecules, but the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination to form a ketone. Let me think: each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another carbon. When KOH is added, each Br leaves, and the adjacent C-H bonds break, leading to the formation of a double bond between two carbons, each of which has a lone pair. So, perhaps each elimination forms a double bond, but how does that form a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the structure is such that elimination leads to the formation of a ketone. For example, consider 2-bromobutane. If you have two Brs on adjacent carbons, like 1,2-dibromobutane, and eliminate, you could form butadiene. But that doesn't form a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which upon elimination forms 1,3-adamantadiene. But that's an alkene, so the IR would show a peak around 1600 cm-1, not 1720. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the IR peak. 1720 is a strong carbonyl, so probably an ester. So what reaction of a dibromide would form an ester? Maybe a nucleophilic substitution with an alcohol, but KOH is a strong base, not a nucleophile in substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination to form an ester, but I don't recall that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the KOH is in alcoholic solution, and the reaction is a Williamson ether synthesis. But that would require an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. Wait, but in this case, we're dealing with a dihalide. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a geminal diol, but that would require water, and the product would be a diol, not a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a ketone. Okay, let's imagine that. Each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a carbon that can form a double bond. So, for example, if you have (CH2Br)2CH2, elimination would give (CH2)2C=CH2, but that's not a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a secondary carbon, and elimination forms a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group next to a CH group. So, each elimination would form a carbonyl. So, for each Br, we lose HBr and form a double bond, but in this structure, perhaps the two eliminations lead to a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, I'm not quite getting it. Maybe I should think about the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH2- group, which is part of an ether or ester. The 10H in the 2.4-2.23 range are likely the adamantane's CH groups. The two H's at 1.94 might be part of a CH2 adjacent to something deshielded, like an oxygen or carbonyl.

In the IR, a peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests an ester (about 1730-1750 for esters, but maybe this is a ketone which is around 1700-1750). Wait, maybe it's a ketone. So perhaps the product is a ketone. So the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane? Or maybe a single ketone.

Wait, but how does that happen from a dibromide? Maybe each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. Wait, no. If the dibromide has Br's on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond, but how does that create a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, each Br leaving and forming a carbonyl. So, each Br is on a CH2 group, and elimination forms a C=O.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each Br is on a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. So, when KOH removes HBr, each elimination forms a double bond, but perhaps the two eliminations result in a ring contraction or expansion, forming a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone. If the two Brs are on adjacent carbons of a cyclopropane, elimination would form a cyclopropane ring with a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look for another angle. Product 1's NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H). Singlet suggests no neighboring hydrogens. So perhaps it's an OCH2O group, but the integration is 2H. Alternatively, it's an OCH2 group attached to something else, like a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's an epoxide. The OCH2 would make sense. But an epoxide's NMR would have protons around 3-4 ppm as a singlet or something else. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. For example, in an ester, the OCH2 would be around 4-5 ppm. So maybe product 1 is an ester.

But how would a dihalide form an ester with KOH? That doesn't seem straightforward. Wait, maybe it's a Williamson ether synthesis. But that requires an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. If product 1 is an ether, then its NMR would show a singlet for the OCH2 group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone with adjacent CH2 groups. For example, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 next to a carbonyl, which is deshielded. That makes sense because CH2 groups next to carbonyls are usually around 2.3-3 ppm, but I'm not sure about 4.79.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is typically a Lewis acid catalyst, used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So maybe product 1 is an acylium ion or an acyl chloride, but product 1 is formed from KOH, which is a base.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Then, treating it with aluminum isopropoxide would facilitate Friedel-Crafts acylation if there's an aromatic ring. But adamantane isn't aromatic; it's a diamondoid, so Friedel-Crafts doesn't apply. That's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Then, perhaps product 2 is formed by some kind of acylation. Or maybe product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is a dienol ether or something else.

Wait, another thought: product 1 could be an epoxide. Then, when treated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it's undergoing some ring-opening reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is a dienol, but I'm not certain.

Wait, going back to the first reaction. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings in a diamondoid structure. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons, perhaps? So when KOH is added, elimination occurs, forming a double bond. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene, which is a diene.

But then, the NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 (2H), which doesn't fit with a diene. Because a diene would have protons in the 5-6 ppm region typically. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cycloalkene. Let's say elimination forms a cyclohexene ring. Then, the NMR would show a doublet or something for the protons on the double bond. But again, the 4.79 (2H) is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let me think of 1,3-diketone adamantane. The IR would show a peak around 1720 for the ketone carbonyl. The NMR would have the ketone's neighboring CH2 groups. For example, in acetone, the CH3 groups are around 2.1 ppm, but in a more deshielded environment, maybe higher. But product 1's NMR shows 1.94 (2H), which could be a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, but that's a diol, which would have OH protons, but those would exchange and not appear in the NMR. But the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl then.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a dione, a cyclohexanedione or something similar. Then, the NMR would show the CH2 groups adjacent to the ketones. So for example, if it's a 1,3-cyclohexanedione, the protons adjacent to the ketones (like the CH2 groups) would be around 2.2-2.4 ppm, which matches the 2.41-2.23 region in the NMR. The 1.94 (2H) could be another set of protons, perhaps in a bridge position.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the IR. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 is a good indication of a carbonyl, so probably a ketone. So product 1 is likely a ketone.

So, if product 1 is a ketone, then when it's treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, what reaction occurs? Aluminum isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but adamantane is not aromatic. Alternatively, maybe it's used in some other acylation or alkylation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is a dienone or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring expansion. If product 1 is a ketone in a ring structure, then heating with a Lewis acid could cause a ring expansion via a carbocation rearrangement. For example, a six-membered ring could expand to a seven-membered ring.

But I'm not certain. Let me think. If product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione, then product 2 could be something else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is a dienol ether after some reaction with aluminum isopropoxide.

Wait, perhaps the second step involves some kind of enol formation. Aluminum isopropoxide can sometimes deprotonate compounds to form enolates. If product 1 is a ketone, then treating it with a Lewis acid could facilitate enol formation, leading to an enol ether. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is the result of acid-catalyzed ring opening. For example, the epoxide could undergo ring-opening with a nucleophile, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's proceed to the third step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, forming product 3. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So ozonolysis of a diene would break the double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would be a dicarbonyl compound.

Now, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR. The most deshielded proton is probably adjacent to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So, in product 3, which is formed by ozonolysis, the structure would have carbonyl groups, and the adjacent protons would be deshielded.

Looking at the options, the coupling patterns are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet. So, how many neighboring protons would each deshielded proton have?

In ozonolysis, each double bond is cleaved. Suppose product 2 is a diene, like a 1,3-diene. Ozonolysis would break the double bonds into two carbonyl groups. For a 1,3-diene, ozonolysis would give two carbonyls, each with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, let's imagine product 2 is 1,3-diene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyl groups. But for a 1,3-diene, which is conjugated, ozonolysis would typically give two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyls.

Wait, but product 2 is formed from product 1, which is the result of KOH reaction. So if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 may be an enol ether or something else with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Then, product 2 would be the result of acid-catalyzed opening of the epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let me think of the initial reaction again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. If the product is an epoxide, then maybe the structure is such that two Brs are on adjacent carbons, leading to an epoxide formation. So product 1 is an epoxide.

Then, product 1 (an epoxide) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. Maybe the epoxide undergoes ring-opening. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, and could protonate the epoxide oxygen, making the ring more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. But without a solvent, like in a Friedel-Crafts scenario, perhaps the epoxide opens to form a carbocation, which could rearrange.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is a dienol ether. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bonds.

Wait, going back to the product 1's NMR. If product 1 is a diene, the NMR would show protons on the double bond as a triplet or something else. But the given NMR shows 4.79 (2H), which doesn't match a diene's typical shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a gem-dihydroxy compound, but that would require two OH groups, which would exchange and not appear in the NMR. But product 1 is a solid, so maybe not.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent CH2 group. So, for example, if the structure is something like (CH2)2CO, then the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be around 2.2 ppm, which matches the 2.41-2.23 region. The 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or ester.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone. For example, a cyclohexanone derivative. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Let me try to think about the overall process.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH → product 1 (with IR 1720, likely a ketone). Then product 1 → Al isopropoxide → product 2 (maybe an enol or enol ether with a double bond). Then product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3 (with carbonyl groups).

Ozonolysis of product 2 (which has a double bond) would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups, and the adjacent hydrogens would be deshielded.

In product 3's NMR, the most deshielded proton would be next to a carbonyl. Let's consider the structure. Suppose product 3 is a diketone, like two carbonyl groups with adjacent CH2 groups.

For example, if product 3 is something like O=C-(CH2)n-C=O, then the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would be deshielded. Each CH2 would have two neighboring protons (the other CH2), leading to a triplet coupling pattern if each CH2 is split by the adjacent CH2's protons.

Wait, but let's imagine product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, each CH2 group is between two carbonyls. Each CH2 would have two neighboring protons (from the adjacent CH2), so each would be a triplet.

Wait, but wait. If each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, each CH2 group would be split by the neighboring CH2's protons. So, each proton on a CH2 next to a carbonyl would see two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So the most deshielded protons would be triplets. Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, another possibility: the deshielded proton is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the CH2 groups would each have two neighboring H's, leading to triplet.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that each CH2 is next to a CH group. Let me think. Suppose product 3 is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-C=O. Then, the CH2 would be next to a CH, which has two H's, leading to a triplet for the CH2. Alternatively, the CH group would be a doublet.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the structure. Let me think about the ozonolysis. If product 2 has a double bond, say between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4, then ozonolysis would cleave each double bond, forming two carbonyl groups.

But wait, ozonolysis of a diene (like 1,3-pentadiene) gives two carbonyl groups. For example, ozonolysis of 1,3-pentadiene would give two aldehydes (if it's a terminal diene) or ketones.

Wait, but in adamantane derivatives, the diene might be conjugated, so ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each from the cleavage of the double bonds in product 2.

But I'm not entirely sure how the structure would look.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a monoene. Then, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 2 has a single double bond. Then, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl would have adjacent CH2 groups.

So, for example, if product 2 is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would form two aldehydes: O=CH-CH2-CHO.

But in that case, the CH2 next to the aldehyde would have two neighboring protons from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded proton (on the CH2 next to the carbonyl) would be a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: if the structure is such that each CH2 is next to a CH group, then the coupling could be more complex. For example, if each CH2 is adjacent to a CH with two protons, that could lead to a triplet of triplets or another pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is part of a CH group that's next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH. For example, in a structure like O=C-CH(CH3)-C=O, the CH would have two neighboring H's from the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in that case, how many couplings would each H have? Let's say it's a CH group with two H's. Each H would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet. So the most deshielded H (on the CH) would be a triplet.

So, in that case, the answer would be triplet (option A).

But wait, another possibility: maybe the structure has more complex coupling. For example, if the deshielded H is coupled to two sets of neighboring H's, each with different J values. That could lead to a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me think of a specific structure. Suppose product 3 is a diketone with a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. Each H on a CH2 would be split by the two H's on the neighboring CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

Another possibility: if the structure is O=C-CH(CH2CH3)-C=O. Then, the CH would have two H's and would be adjacent to the CH2CH3 group. The CH's H's would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is next to a CH group, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, but I think the simplest case is a CH2 group next to another CH2, leading to a triplet. So the most deshielded H would be a triplet, option A.

Wait, but the options include B) triplet of triplets, which suggests more splitting. How could that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded H is part of a CH group that is adjacent to two different sets of H's. For example, if the CH is next to another CH and a CH2, each with different coupling constants. Then, the H would split into a triplet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. But based on the given NMR data and the reactions, I think the most plausible coupling is a triplet, so option A.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon heating with KOH, the product (product 1) is likely a ketone, as indicated by the IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR data for product 1 (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests the presence of a deshielded CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl and adamantane-like CH groups.

When product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, it likely forms product 2, which contains a double bond. This is inferred because the subsequent ozonolysis step requires a double bond to cleave. Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide, results in product 3, which is a diketone or a compound with carbonyl groups.

In product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group next to another CH₂ group. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens of the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern. This matches the description of the most deshielded hydrogen in the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 3.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.

Answer: A
