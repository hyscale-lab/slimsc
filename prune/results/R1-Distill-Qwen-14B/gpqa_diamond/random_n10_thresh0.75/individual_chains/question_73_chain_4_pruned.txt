Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use special relativity, right? So the question is about finding the relative speed and the total energy of the system.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So both are moving in the same direction. I think the first part is about finding the relative speed between them, and the second part is about the total energy.

Wait, for the relative speed, I can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics because they're moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed of the second from the first's perspective would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²) if v2 is higher. Or wait, no. Wait, the formula is for when you have two velocities u and v, and want to find the speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, the speed of B would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that denominator first. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 -0.3 = 0.7.

The numerator is 0.5c -0.6c = -0.1c. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ -0.1428c. Since speed can't be negative, the magnitude is about 0.14c. Oh wait, the negative just indicates direction, but since both are moving in the same direction, the second is slower. So the relative speed is 0.14c. That would be one of the options, looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel=0.14c.

Now for the total energy of the system. The total energy is the sum of the energies of each astronaut. Each of their energies would be their relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc². Wait, but their masses are 2m and 3m, so their energies would be gamma1 * 2m c² and gamma2 * 3m c². So I need to compute each gamma.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For astronaut A, v=0.6c. So v²=0.36 c². So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy of A is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B,
