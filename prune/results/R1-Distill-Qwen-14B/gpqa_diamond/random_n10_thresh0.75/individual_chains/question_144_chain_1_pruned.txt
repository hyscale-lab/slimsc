Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance and decay distance. Hmm, mesons are subatomic particles, right? I remember they're made of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about the mean decay distance. How do I approach this?

The problem gives me production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. And I have to choose between four options. So I need to find the mean decay distance of this meson.

Wait, I think the decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Because the mean distance is how far it travels before decaying. So the formula must involve the lifetime (tau), multiplied by the velocity (v), times the speed of light (c) to get meters.

But wait, the mean lifetime is related to the width via the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that Γ (width) is related to the lifetime τ. The formula I remember is Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ is ħ / Γ.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me get the exact relation. Γ is the total decay width, and it's connected to the mean lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. Because the width is the inverse of the lifetime in natural units.

But wait, natural units have ħ = c = 1. So when we work in those units, the calculations are easier. But when converting to regular units, we need to bring in ħ and c.

So the steps I think are:

1. Calculate
