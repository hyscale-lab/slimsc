Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. It says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = aφ. The matrix operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0 -i) and the second row (i 0).

The question is asking which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm. Let's break this down. I think the first thing I should do is write down the matrix for Ay. Since Ay = c*S, with c = h/(4π), then Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by the matrix S. So S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So Ay would be:

[ 0    -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))  0 ]

Wait, no, because when you multiply a matrix by a scalar, each element is multiplied. So each element of S is multiplied by c. So, each entry in S is either 0, i, or -i. So the matrix Ay is:

Row 1: 0 * c = 0, (-i) * c = -i*(h/(4π))
Row 2: i * c = i*(h/(4π)), 0.

So Ay is a 2x2 matrix with these entries.

Now, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, I should solve the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues a satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -a       (-i h/(4π)) ]
[ i h/(4π)  -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ]

Let me compute that. The determinant is a² minus [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ].

Wait, (-i)(i) is equal to (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So the product is (h/(4π))² * 1 = (h²)/(16 π²).

So the determinant equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0. So a² = (h²)/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, wait a second. Let me check that. Because (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So yes, the determinant equation is a² - (h^2)/(16 π²) = 0, so a is ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalues are a = ± (h/(4π)).

So the eigenvalues are real numbers, right? Because the determinant calculation leads to real results. So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh or ±h/4π. Wait, no, looking again, option A says the imaginary part are +2πh or –2πh, and real parts +h/(4π) or –h/(4π). That can't be right because the eigenvalues I found are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option A doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real. So that's not correct.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That seems off because our c is h/(4π), which is a real number, so the eigenvalues should be real. So this option is also incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A squared, but not of the Z-component, Az. Hmm. I'm not sure about this yet. Let me think. The intrinsic angular momentum operator A has components Ax, Ay, Az. The square of the total angular momentum is A² = Ax² + Ay² + Az². For a spin-½ particle, like a muon, which has spin ½, the eigenvalues of A² are (½)(½+1)ħ², but wait, in this case, the units might be different because the operator is expressed in terms of h. But regardless, the eigenfunctions of A² are the same as the eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum, which are spherical harmonics or something similar. So the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² because Ay and A² commute. Because [Ay, A²] = 0. Because A² is the sum of squares of the components, and each component commutes with the sum. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it should also be an eigenstate of A², but not necessarily of Az, because [Ay, Az] = iħ Ax, which is non-zero. So eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm. I'm not sure. The matrix operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so its eigenvectors would form a basis for the vector space. But the statement is a bit ambiguous. Option D might be correct, but I'm not sure. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors would form a basis, so the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. But I'm not entirely certain. Let's think again.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So looking at the options.

Wait, the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are wrong because their eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which they don't. So only options C and D remain.

C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Well, the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the space. Since Ay is 2x2, each eigenfunction is a 2-component vector, so they form a basis. So D is correct in that the eigenvectors are the basis functions for Ay. But I'm not sure if that's what the option is saying. Wait, the option says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Hmm, that might be a bit of a wording issue. The eigenvectors (eigenfunctions, which are vectors in this case) form a basis for the vector space, which is indeed the case. So D could be correct.

But wait, the original problem is about which statement is correct. So both C and D could be correct, but which one?

Wait, the question is about the process of calculation. So when calculating the eigenvalues, which statements are correct during that process.

Wait, no. The options are statements that you would consider correct during the calculation. So when finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Option C is about the relationship between the eigenfunctions of Ay and other operators. So during the calculation, would I consider whether the eigenvectors can also be eigenfunctions of A² or Az?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct statement is D, because the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors of the operator, but I'm not confident.

Wait, let me think again. The operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so it has two eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) which are orthogonal. These two eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space. Therefore, the statement in D that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator is correct. So D is correct.

Alternatively, option C is also making a statement about the possibility of being eigenfunctions of other operators.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me double-check the eigenvalues.

Wait, the determinant was a² - (h/(4π))² = 0 => a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real. So when I look at the options, options A and B are about imaginary parts, so they're incorrect. So the only possible correct options are C and D.

Now, let's think about option C: the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So C is correct.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the eigenvectors are the basis for the space, so they are the basis functions for the operator. But I'm not sure if this is the correct way to phrase it. Alternatively, the matrix Ay has its own basis, which are its eigenvectors. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps D is correct in that the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm. The matrix operator is 2x2, so its eigenvectors are two-dimensional vectors. So the eigenfunctions (which are vectors) are the basis functions for the operator. So D is correct.

But wait, the operator Ay is expressed in the S basis. Wait, no, the matrix S is given, and Ay is c multiplied by S. So when you represent the operator in a particular basis, the eigenfunctions are expressed in that same basis. So the eigenfunctions are in the same basis as the matrix, which is the basis of the operator. So D is correct.

But then both C and D could be correct, but looking back, the available options are A, B, C, D, and only one can be correct.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az. So yes, that's correct because [Ay, Az]=iħ Ax, which is non-zero, so they don't share eigenfunctions. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. So in this case, the matrix is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure if D is correct. Because the matrix operator Ay is represented in a certain basis. The eigenvectors are in that basis, so they are the basis functions for that operator's representation. So D is correct.

Wait, but which of these is correct during the calculation? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is incorrect because the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay are the eigenfunctions, but maybe the statement is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to reevaluate.

The eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real. So the eigenfunctions are real or complex? Let's see.

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me write it as:

0   -i
i    0

We can find the eigenvectors by solving (Ay - a I) v = 0.

For a = h/(4π), the matrix becomes:

[ -h/(4π)   -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   -h/(4π) ]

So the equations are:

- h/(4π) v1 - i h/(4π) v2 = 0
i h/(4π) v1 - h/(4π) v2 = 0

Multiply both equations by 4π/h:

- v1 -i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

Similarly, the second equation: i v1 - v2 = 0 → i v1 = v2.

Substituting v1 = -i v2 into the second equation: i*(-i v2) = v2 → (i*(-i)) v2 = v2 → (1) v2 = v2. So it's consistent.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i v2, v2 ]^T. Let's set v2 = 1, then v1 = -i. So the first eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ]^T. Alternatively, we can factor out e^{iθ} if needed. But I think this is a complex vector.

Wait, but the eigenfunctions of spin operators for spin-½ systems are the Pauli matrices' eigenvectors, which are typically complex. So the eigenfunctions are complex vectors.

Now, looking at option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

So the correct statements are C and D? But that's not possible because the options are mutually exclusive.

Wait, what's the question again? It says, during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is C, because D is more about the basis, which is generally true, but perhaps the wording is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Wait, considering that A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². But for Az, since Ay and Az do not commute, they don't share eigenfunctions. So option C is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves determining the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component angular momentum operator \( A_y \), represented as a 2×2 matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( A_y \) is explicitly:
     \[
     A_y = \begin{bmatrix} 
     0 & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ 
     i \frac{h}{4\pi} & 0 
     \end{bmatrix}.
     \]
   - To find the eigenvalues \( a \), solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \):
     \[
     \det \begin{bmatrix} 
     -a & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ 
     i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -a 
     \end{bmatrix} = a^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0.
     \]
   - This gives \( a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). The eigenvalues are real, with no imaginary components.

2. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real, as shown above.
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the total angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component angular momentum operator). This is correct because \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \) commute (\( [A_y, A^2] = 0 \)), so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute (\( [A_y, A_z] = i\hbar A_x \)), so they do not share eigenfunctions.
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2D vector space, the phrasing of this option is ambiguous. The eigenfunctions are not inherently the "basis functions" of the operator but rather the basis vectors for the space in which \( A_y \) operates.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Options A and B are incorrect due to incorrect eigenvalue statements.
   - Option D is less precise in its phrasing compared to Option C.
   - Option C is the most accurate and directly relevant statement during the calculation.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
