Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says: Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, so I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. And for the total energy, I think I need to calculate the energy of each astronaut separately using the relativistic energy formula and then add them up.

Let me break it down. First, the relative speed. So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both in the same direction. Wait, but who's moving relative to whom? Because in relativity, the relative velocity depends on the frame of reference. Oh wait, the question is asking for the relative speed between them, so perhaps we need to compute the speed of one as observed from the other's frame.

Wait, no, the relative speed as in the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the same direction as astronaut B's frame, which is moving at 0.5c, then I need to find the speed of A relative to B.

So the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:

v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²))

Wait, wait, I think that's correct. Let me double-check. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)), where v1 is the velocity of the first object in the second's frame. Or wait, no—v1 and v2 are the velocities in the original frame, and you're finding the relative velocity. Let me think.

Let me clarify: Let's say the two astronauts are moving in the same direction. Let me call their velocities u and v in the lab frame (or any common frame). The problem says astronaut 1 has u = 0.6c and astronaut 2 has v = 0.5c. So, in astronaut 2's frame, what is astronaut 1's speed?

Wait, no. Wait, astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the lab frame. So from astronaut 2's perspective, he is at rest, and the lab is moving at -0.5c. Similarly, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame. So from astronaut 2's frame, what is the speed of astronaut 1?

Yes, so the formula is (u - v2) / (1 - (u v2)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of object A in the lab frame, and v2 is the velocity of the frame (a2's velocity in lab). Wait, no, I think I have to arrange the velocities correctly.

Wait, the formula for the relative velocity when moving from frame S to frame S' (which is moving at velocity v relative to S) is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²))

So in this case, frame S' is the frame of astronaut 2, which is moving at v = 0.5c relative to the lab frame S. So astronaut 1, in the lab frame, is moving at u = 0.6c. So from astronaut 2's perspective, his speed would be u' = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² )

Calculating that:

Numerator: 0.1c

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²) / c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0
