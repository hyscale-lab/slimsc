Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound. 

First, I should look at the spectral data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR data should give me clues about the structure of X. Once I figure out what X is, I can determine what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI, which I think is a type of substitution reaction, maybe a hydrolysis or something else.

Let's start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-¹, which is a broad region, probably O-H stretches. But wait, that's a big range. Wait, I remember that O-H in carboxylic acids is usually around 2500-3300 cm-¹, but if it's a broad peak around there, that would suggest maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an ester or something else with an O-H group.

Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-¹. That's a strong peak, which usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Let me think. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-¹, maybe a bit higher. An ester's carbonyl is around 1740-1720, so that fits. A ketone is around 1700-1750 as well. Hmm.

Another peak at 1610 cm-¹ and 1450 cm-¹. Those are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound likely has an aromatic ring, possibly with substituents.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down.

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but sometimes a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have protons around 10-12 as broad singlets. But wait, an aldehyde is also possible. Hmm. But if it's a carboxylic acid, that peak would be a broad singlet. Let me think about the possible structures.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet. That suggests two protons in an aromatic ring, perhaps para-substituted. Like if there's a substituent on the benzene ring, the protons ortho and para to it would be split. Alternatively, maybe a di-substituted ring. Wait, the integration is 2H, so maybe two protons in a pair, like para to each other. So, perhaps two substituents on the benzene ring.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet. Also, 2H, so same as before. Maybe these are the two protons adjacent to substituents. So, perhaps the benzene ring is para-substituted with two groups. Wait, but wait—no, maybe it's a mono-substituted benzene, with two substituents at the meta position? Or perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene, like two groups in the para positions, with each of the two protons being in a doublet.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. Let's think: in a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to be as doublets. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is such that the protons are in a certain coupling pattern.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, making the ring de-shield the protons. Let's think about the substituents.

The next peak is at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a multiplet. That could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen or something. Or perhaps a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet, 2H. Maybe a CH2 group next to a carbonyl or something else.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): Doublet, 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something that splits into a doublet. Maybe a CH(CH3) group, so like a isopropyl group or something. Or maybe a methyl attached to a CH2, but I'm not sure.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a methyl group attached to a CH2, like an ethyl chain. So maybe something like CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, I think
