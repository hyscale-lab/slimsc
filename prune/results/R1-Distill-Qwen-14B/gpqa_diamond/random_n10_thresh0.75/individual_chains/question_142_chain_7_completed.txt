Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubits space. The matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). The options are four vectors in 3D space, which probably correspond to the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical ensemble. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation where each point corresponds to a quantum state.

So the state given is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me write out what that looks like as a matrix. The |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 in the top-left and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 1 in the bottom-right. Adding them together gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal. So, when multiplied by 1/2, the diagonal becomes 0.5 each, and the off-diagonals are zero. So the density matrix is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. 

Wait, that's the maximally mixed state. Because for a qubit, the maximally mixed state is the completely depolarized state, which has equal probabilities for |0⟩ and |1⟩, and no coherence. So the density matrix looks like diagonal entries 0.5 each, zeros elsewhere.

Now, how does this translate to the Bloch sphere? The Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z). For a general single qubit state, the density matrix can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix.

Let's see. Our given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute this using the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], and the density matrix we're given is I/2 = [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]]. So comparing to the general form (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, in our case, the terms involving the Pauli matrices must sum to zero.

Because (I + 0)/2 is our ρ. So that means r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin. That makes sense because the maximally mixed state is in the center of the Bloch sphere, not on the surface.

Wait, but the options are given as r=(1,1,0), etc. So option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right),
\]

which simplifies to the matrix 

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where there is no coherence and equal probability of the qubit being in the states \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit can be described by a vector \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\), where the components are related to the density matrix through the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

with \(I\) being the identity matrix and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), the off-diagonal terms are zero, and the diagonal terms correspond to equal probabilities for \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). This implies that the components of \(\mathbf{r}\) (i.e., \(r_x\), \(r_y\), and \(r_z\)) are all zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector is at the origin, \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the maximally mixed state being at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Among the provided options, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the maximally mixed state is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
