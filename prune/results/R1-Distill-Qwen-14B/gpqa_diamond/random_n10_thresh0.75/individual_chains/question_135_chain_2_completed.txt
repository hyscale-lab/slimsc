Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but maybe I don't need to delve into that too much right now.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So that looks like a Yukawa interaction term. The boson X is interacting with some fermions. The fermion fields are ψ_f, and f is probably the fermion type, like electron, muon, etc.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermions it can decay into. Since the boson is X, and it's decaying to fermion-antifermion pairs, the mass of X has to be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because each pair must have enough energy to create the fermion and its antiparticle.

So first, let's list all possible fermions that X can decay into based on mass. The mass of X is 6 GeV. Now, I should remember the approximate masses of the known fermions.

Electron is way too light, about 0.0005 GeV. Same with muon (about 0.1 GeV), tau is around 1.77 GeV. Quarks: up and down are light, like a few MeV. Strange quark is about 100 MeV, charm is around 1.5 GeV, bottom is around 4.5 GeV, top is way heavier, about 172 GeV. So top quarks are out of the question because 2*172 GeV is way more than 6 GeV.

So possible fermions would have mass m where 2m ≤ 6 GeV. So m ≤ 3 GeV.

Let's see each fermion:

- Electron: 0.0005 GeV. 2m is 0.001, which is way less than 6. So X can decay into e+ e-.

- Muon: ~0.1 GeV. 2m is 0.2, so yes.

- Tau: ~1.77 GeV. 2m is ~3.54 GeV. Oh wait, wait. 1.77 * 2 = 3.54, which is less than 6. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

What about quarks? Let me think. The up and down are negligible in mass, so their antipairs are allowed. But wait, in reality, quarks are confined. So X can't decay into quark-antiquark pairs because those can't exist freely. So the decay into uū, dd, s s̄, etc., would require X to decay into hadrons, but without strong force mediating, unless X couples to hadrons. But wait, the Lagrangian only couples X to the fermions ψ_f. So perhaps, in this model, X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it couples to, provided the mass condition is met.

Wait, but the problem says the interaction is given by the Lagrangian, so X couples to the fermions ψ_f. So if ψ_f is, say, a quark, then X can decay into quark-antiquark. But wait, in reality, quarks are confined. Hence, perhaps in this problem, we're assuming that X can decay into any fermion pair as long as the mass allows it, regardless of confinement. Maybe the problem is considering that X can decay into any allowed fermion, including quarks, but perhaps the options don't include all quarks.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A includes b, s, u, d, tau, e. Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. Option D includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So let's see which fermions can be produced.

Charm quark: mass ~1.5 GeV. 2m is 3 GeV, which is less than 6, so allowed. So c c̄ is possible.

Bottom quark: mass ~4.5 GeV. 2m is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So b b̄ is not allowed because 2*4.5 =9>6. So X cannot decay into b b̄. So any option that includes b is incorrect.

Top quark is way too heavy, so no.

Tau is allowed because as I said, 2*1.77 is about 3.54, which is less than 6.

So looking at the options again:

Option A: includes b, which isn't allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all allowed. Because c's 2m is 3 GeV, which is under 6. So B is possible.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy, so C is wrong.

Option D: includes b, which is wrong. So D is out.

So the correct allowed decays would be to c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, and e+ e-.

Looking at the options, that's option B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but the Lagrangian given in the question is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). That seems like a Yukawa coupling. So the fermions ψ_f are the ones that X couples to. So perhaps the fermions involved must be those that are charged under the weak force?

Wait, but I'm not sure. The problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, so X can decay into any of these fermions that it couples to, as long as the mass allows. The problem doesn't specify which fermions are in ψ_f, but the options include various possibilities. So perhaps the issue is whether the fermion's mass is below 3 GeV.

So yeah, the only fermions with mass below 3 GeV are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. Because t is too heavy, b is 4.5 GeV, which when doubled is 9, so 4.5 is above 3 GeV, so 2m=9>6, so b is out.

So in the options, the correct one is B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as 

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
\]

indicating that \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \). The decays of \( X \) are governed by the requirement that the total mass of the fermion-antifermion pair must not exceed the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Electron (\( e \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
2. **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
3. **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.54 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
4. **Up Quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
5. **Down Quark (\( d \))**: \( m_d \approx 5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
6. **Strange Quark (\( s \))**: \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
7. **Charm Quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
8. **Bottom Quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Not Allowed.
9. **Top Quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 172 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Not Allowed.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
