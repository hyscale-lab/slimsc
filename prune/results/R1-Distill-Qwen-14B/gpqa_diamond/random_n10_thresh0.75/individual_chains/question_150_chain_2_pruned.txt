Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it's reacted with a series of reagents, and I need to find the final product from the options provided.

First, I should figure out the structure of the starting compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe one ring and two double bonds, or a couple of rings and a double bond, etc.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), that's a triplet. A triplet around 9-10 ppm usually suggests an aldehyde proton. Wait, or could it be a ketone? No, aldehyde protons are around 9-10 and are typically a singlet or maybe a triplet if coupled with adjacent protons. Wait, the triplet here could be from coupling with two neighboring protons. Like maybe in an enal situation, where the aldehyde is conjugated with a double bond. So, perhaps an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H)—those look like aromatic protons. The 6.98 is a doublet, 2H; 6.51 is another doublet, 2H. This could be a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest coupling with two neighboring H's, so maybe two para-substituted rings, each with two substituents? Or perhaps a di-substituted ring in a para arrangement.

Then, 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, possibly due to being in a conjugated system or perhaps being near an electronegative group. Maybe these are vinyl protons adjacent to the aldehyde, in the enal structure. The broadness could be due to hydrogen bonding or being in a conjugated system.

The last peak is 3.66 (d, 2H). A doublet, probably adjacent to an oxygen. Maybe a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like an ether or an alcohol. Wait, but the molecular formula has an O. Wait, the O is in the compound. So perhaps it's an alcohol, but considering the reaction steps, maybe it's an ether?

Wait, the starting compound has an O: so molecular formula is C8H9NO. So the O could be in an aldehyde group (CHO), an alcohol (OH), an amide, or maybe an ether. Let me think—since the aldehyde is present as per the NMR, the O might be part of that. Alternatively, maybe the O is in the
