Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state rather than a pure state.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, I think this is the density matrix for a completely mixed state. A mixed state means the qubit is in a statistical mixture of states, right? So, in this case, it's equally likely to be in state |0⟩ or |1⟩. Because the coefficients are both 1/2.

Density matrices have some properties. They should be Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and have a trace of 1. Let me check that. Each term |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| is a projection operator. Each is Hermitian because ⟨0|0⟩ is 1 and the same for ⟨1|1⟩. So their sum should also be Hermitian, and when multiplied by 1/2, it's still Hermitian. The trace would be (1/2)(1 + 1) = 1, which fits. Positive semi-definite because all eigenvalues are non-negative—here they are 1/2 and 1/2. So yeah, this is a valid density matrix.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position. I'm not exactly sure, but I recall that in the Bloch sphere representation, any qubit state can be represented as a point on a unit sphere. For pure states, the state |ψ⟩ is represented as a vector in this sphere. But for mixed states, like this one, how does that work?

Wait, the Bloch sphere is typically for pure states. For mixed states, perhaps the density matrix is represented as a point in a higher-dimensional space, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Oh wait, I think that any single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in three-dimensional space with magnitude less than or equal to 1.

Let me write that out. The Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the general form would be:
ρ = (1/2) * I + (r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2.

Wait, no—actually, the general form is ρ = (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2. Because I is 2x2 identity matrix, and each Pauli matrix is multiplied by their respective components of r.

So in this problem, the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) / 2. Let me compute what that is. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So ρ = (I)/2. So in the general form, which is (I + r·σ)/2, if our ρ is (I)/2, then the term r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2 = ρ.

So r·σ = 0 implies that each component of r is zero? Because if r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz = 0, the only solution is r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. Because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent; you can't get zero by a non-trivial combination of them.

So that would mean the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which would correspond to the origin in the Bloch sphere. So the density matrix represents the completely mixed state, which is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), so that should be the correct answer.

Wait a second, let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. The density matrix for a completely mixed state is indeed (I)/2. Because if you have a state that's a 50% mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, the density matrix is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is the same as I/2. So the Bloch vector is zero. So option C is the right choice.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit, where the qubit is equally likely to be in the state \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). The density matrix is valid because it is Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and has a trace of 1, as required for a density matrix.

In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\vec{r}\) is a vector in three-dimensional space with magnitude \(|\vec{r}| \leq 1\). For the given density matrix, \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies that the term \(\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}\) must be zero. Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this can only happen if \(\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

Thus, the density matrix \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\) corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere. Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
