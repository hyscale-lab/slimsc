Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some spots and how that affects the brightness variations we observe. Then, it's comparing that to the signal we get from an exoplanet. The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same light curve amplitude as the star's spots.

So the star has a radius equal to the Sun, Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, no, filling factor is the fraction of the surface area covered by spots. Oh wait, the star's one hemisphere is covered, but wait, no, the filling factor is 20% for the spots. Oh, maybe the spots cover 20% of the entire star's surface? Or is it 20% of a hemisphere? Hmm, I'm a bit confused on that.

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Oh, so the spots are on one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere's area. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (2πR²/2) → wait, no, a hemisphere is half the surface area of a sphere, which is (4π R²)/2 = 2π R². So 20% of that would be 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the spots cover an area of 0.4 π R².

The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K. When the star rotates, the spots come into view and then disappear, causing brightness variations. So during the rotation, when the spots are facing us, they block some of the light. But wait, wait, no. The spots are dark, so when they're facing us, the brightness is less. But the problem says that the situation resembles an exoplanet causing the same amplitude in brightness variations.

So the question is, what's the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same change in brightness as the spots. Because when a planet transits the star,
