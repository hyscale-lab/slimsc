Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's try to think through this step by step.

The question states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We're assuming the photospheres are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I think that means we can use the Boltzmann equation for the population of energy levels.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation... right. The population ratio between two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2 for the same energy levels. So if I consider the ratio n_upper/n_lower for each star, for star_1 it's 2 times that of star_2.

Wait no, actually, wait. The problem says the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited. So for a specific transition, the number in the upper level (excited state) is twice as much as in star_2's. So the ratio for star_1 would be twice that of star_2's ratio.

Wait, maybe more accurately: let's say in star_1, n1_upper/n1_lower = 2*(n2_upper/n2_lower). Or wait, perhaps the excitation is twice as much. Maybe it's that the ratio of excited atoms to unexcited is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. So the ratio (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

But according to the Boltzmann equation, each ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), assuming the same g factors for both stars, which I think is a fair assumption unless stated otherwise.

So, for star_1, n1_upper/n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * (g1/g2), but if g factors are same, then it's just the exponential term.

Same for star_2: (n
