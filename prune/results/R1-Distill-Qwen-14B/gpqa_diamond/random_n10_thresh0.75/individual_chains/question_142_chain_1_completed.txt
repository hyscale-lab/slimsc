Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are described by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), but mixed states are statistical ensembles, so their density matrices are convex combinations of projectors.

So in this case, ρ is an equal mixture of |0> and |1>, each with probability 1/2. That makes sense for a qubit in a completely mixed state. Because for a qubit, the most mixed state would be when it's equally likely to be in 0 or 1, regardless of the basis.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubits space. I think this relates to how density matrices are represented geometrically. Oh right, for a single qubit, the set of density matrices can be visualized in a space called the Bloch sphere. Wait, no, the Bloch sphere is for pure states, right? But I also remember that mixed states can be represented inside the Bloch sphere.

The Bloch sphere has a radius of 1/2, I think. Because any state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if r has a magnitude of 1, the state is a pure state on the surface. If |r| is less than 1, it's a mixed state inside.

So let's see. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute this. |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with [1, 0; 0, 0], and |1><1| is [0,0;0,1]. Adding them gives [1,0;0,1], the identity matrix. Then multiply by 1/2, so ρ is (I)/2.

Wait, the identity matrix. So ρ = I/2. Now, how does that translate to the Bloch sphere? Because the general form for a density matrix in the Bloch representation is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

So if I have ρ = I/2, that would mean that the coefficients for σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are all zero. Because I is (I + 0 + 0 + 0)/2. So that would imply that the vector r is (0,0,0). Because r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero.

So the point in the Bloch sphere would be at the origin, which is the completely mixed state. That makes sense because when the state is completely mixed, it's as if there's no information about the qubit's state—it's maximally uncertain.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but just to be thorough. Let me double-check. The identity matrix is the maximally mixed state. In the Bloch ball, it's represented by the origin. So yes, the vector r is zero. So the position is (0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the qubit is equally likely to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, density matrices are expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector that determines the position of the state in the Bloch sphere. For a maximally mixed state, all the components of \(\mathbf{r}\) are zero, which corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere. This is consistent with the fact that the given density matrix simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), meaning there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this would correspond to a pure state on the surface of the Bloch sphere, not a mixed state.  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different mixed state, not the maximally mixed state.  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0):** Correct, as this represents the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1):** Incorrect, as this would correspond to a pure state outside the Bloch sphere, which is not physically valid.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
