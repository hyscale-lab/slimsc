Okay, let me try to work through this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and we need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem statement says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, when you mix them, the total volume becomes 40 mL. I think the first thing I should do is calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid.

Wait, dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 mL. V2 is 40 mL. So M2 would be (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.0125 M. Oh wait, no, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M? Wait, let me calculate that again. 20 mL of 0.05 M is 1 mmol (since 0.05 M is 5 mM, 20 mL *5 mM = 100 mmol? Wait, no, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L, which is 50 mmol per liter. So 20 mL is 0.02 liters, so 0.05 *0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then when you add 20 mL (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 mL (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, right, so 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. Titration usually involves neutralization. At 25% titration, I need to figure out how much NaOH has been added.

Wait, what's the equivalence point? The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equals moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate
