Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me remember what each of these symmetries entails.

First, SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries, but with higher dimension terms. So the operators must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model itself.

Wait, what are the symmetries of the Standard Model? Well, the Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Poincaré symmetry is a bit broader—it includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory respects Poincaré, it should also respect Lorentz. But I think in SMEFT, the operators are constructed in such a way that they only have Lorentz symmetry because the higher-dimension terms might not preserve translations (like in a theory without a preferred frame). Or wait, no, I think SMEFT is still based on Poincaré symmetry because it's a low-energy effective theory, so the Poincaré symmetry should still hold. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused between Lorentz and Poincare here.

Alternatively, Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So, if a theory respects Poincaré, it must respect Lorentz. But can operators in SMEFT violate Lorentz? Probably not because SMEFT is supposed to be a valid low-energy theory, so all the operators should respect the underlying symmetries of the SM, which include Poincare.

Wait no, wait. SMEFT operators are built from SM fields, so they should naturally respect the SM gauge symmetries, Lorentz symmetry, and perhaps others. But wait, the SM itself has Poincaré symmetry because it's our spacetime symmetry. So the operators in SMEFT should respect Poincaré, which implies Lorentz as well.

But wait, the question lists options where Lorentz and Poincare are separate. So the question is, which must be respected by all operators. So if the operators respect Poincare, they must automatically respect Lorentz and translation symmetry. But is it necessary that
