Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem states that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator, and it's given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, right. So first, I think I should find the matrix representation of Ay. Since c is h/(4π), Ay = c * S. So let's compute that.

c = h/(4π), so multiplying each element of S by c:

Ay = [ 0*(h/(4π))   -i*(h/(4π)) ]
      [ i*(h/(4π))    0*(h/(4π)) ]

So, Ay matrix is:

[ 0        -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   0       ]

But wait, maybe it's easier to factor out h/(4π) and think of Ay as (h/(4π)) multiplied by S. So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue, and I is the identity matrix.

So, let's write down Ay - a I:

[ -a       (-i h/(4π)) ]
[ (i h/(4π))   -a     ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating that: a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = +1. So, the second term becomes (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

Setting that
