Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about calculating the eigenvector for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P is a vector operator, so I think it's the sum of its components in the x, y, and z directions, each multiplied by the unit vector in that direction. But wait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. Hmm, so maybe the operator we're considering is the projection of P along the direction n.

Wait, no, the question says the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh wait, no, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. So P is the vector operator, but the problem is about the operator along direction n, which would be P · n̂, right?

So the operator along direction n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if θ is the angle from the z-axis, right? Because in the x-z plane, θ would typically be the polar angle.

So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because n_y is zero.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

But wait, the given options involve expressions with cosθ, sinθ, etc., so perhaps I need to express the eigenvector in terms of the direction n.

But first, let me write down the given components of the operator P. Each component is multiplied by ħ/2.

Px is given as (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the matrix for Px is [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by ħ/2.

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]].

Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the matrices for each component are:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Now, the operator P_n is n_x Px + n_z Pz. Since n is in x-z plane, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So P_n = sinθ * Px + cosθ * Pz.

Substituting the matrices:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute this matrix:

First, the Px part: sinθ * [ [0,1],[1
