Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's movement towards and away from us.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, which probably means the math is simpler without any eccentricity factors.

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does the shift relate to the orbital period of the planet?

I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think the Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The RV method formula involves the velocity semi-amplitude, K. K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula I remember is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(something) ) ... Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: the Doppler shift (which is what the method measures) is proportional to the velocity of the star. So the shift given (in milliangstroms) is directly related to that velocity.

But wait, how does the velocity relate to the orbital period? Oh right, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The orbital period is related to the star's mass and the planet's orbit.

Wait, but the RV method gives us the velocity of the star in the direction of Earth, which is related to the mass of the planet and the size of the orbit. So the formula for K (velocity semi-amplitude) is K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since the planets are similar to Neptune, and the stars are similar to the Sun, M_planet is much less than M_star. So M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, the problem says both planets have similar masses to Neptune, but the question is about the orbital periods, so perhaps the masses of the planets might not be the same? Wait, no, the question says both have masses similar to Neptune. So their masses are approximately the same.

Wait, but the problem states both have masses similar to Neptune. So M_planet is same for both. Similarly, the stars have the same mass as the Sun, so M_star is same for both stars.

So, the formula simplifies. Let's write K for each planet.

K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, but sin i is 1 because the orbits are
