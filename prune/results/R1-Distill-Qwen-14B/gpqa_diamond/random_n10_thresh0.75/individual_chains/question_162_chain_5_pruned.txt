Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

Wait, the metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So, I need to figure out the geometry described by this metric and then compute the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2.

Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape. But in this context, maybe it's related to the metric given.

I remember that in two dimensions, the area element is computed using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. So for a metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy², the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant.

Wait, in this case, the metric is diagonal because there are no cross terms (g_{xy}=0). So the determinant g is just (g_xx)(g_yy) - 0. From the given metric, g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²) and the same for g_yy because it's symmetric in x and y. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Wait, no. Because the metric is ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² +
