Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to select the correct reagent A and catalyst B from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine, right? It's a five-membered ring with one nitrogen and a methyl group on the third carbon. The product is some kind of ring expansion maybe, or perhaps a substitution or addition reaction.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me visualize that. The pyrrolidine ring is still there with a methyl group on carbon 3. On carbon 1, there's a substituent: a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. That sounds like a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group. So the structure would be the pyrrolidine with a new group attached to position 1 that's a methylene connected to a cyclohexene ring.

So the reaction must have added something that forms a new ring or a substituent with a double bond. Since it's acid-catalyzed, I'm thinking about possible acid-catalyzed reactions involving amines.

Wait, when amines react under acidic conditions, they can form carbocations, perhaps. Or maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but that usually involves aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or ring-forming reaction.

Another thought: maybe the reaction is a ring expansion via some kind of cyclization. Or perhaps it's an alkylation. Wait, what's the starting material and the product again.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine has five members. The product has a substituent that's a cyclohexylidene group attached via a methyl. So, maybe the reaction is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement? Or perhaps a hydride shift?

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition. Or perhaps it's a conjugate acid-base reaction.

Wait, the product has a new ring, perhaps. Wait, 3-methyl
