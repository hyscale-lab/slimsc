Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Let me try to understand what's being asked and figure it out step by step.

Alright, the setup is that there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Since e is the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, each of these charges would be 2 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-19 coulombs. But wait, the problem says they're identical, so all 13 have the same charge.

Now, the 13th charge is fixed at a point P, and the other 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is related to the work done in assembling them, considering their mutual electric potentials.

Wait, but when we're calculating the potential energy of a system of charges, it's the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their positions, considering the potential due to all the previous charges. However, for a system of identical charges, the formula for potential energy comes into play.

So, the potential energy U of a system of point charges is given by U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) * Σ q_i q_j / r_ij, where the sum is over all pairs i < j. But wait, in this case, all the charges are the same, and they are either at point P or at a radius of 2m from P.

Wait, no, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at 2m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from P, but what's the distance between each of the 12 charges? Are they all at the same point 2m from P, or arranged in a sphere? Because if they're all at the same point, they'd be on top of each other, but the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m. So maybe they're placed on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m around P.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, just that each is at 2m from P
