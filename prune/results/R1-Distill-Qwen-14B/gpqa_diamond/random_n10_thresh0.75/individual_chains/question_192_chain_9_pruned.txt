Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around conductors. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The setup is a bit complicated. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity has radius r, and they mention that r is less than R, so the cavity doesn't reach the outer surface of the conductor. 

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields. For one, the charges in a conductor redistribute themselves. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must induce an equal and opposite charge to cancel the field inside the conductor. Wait, no, actually, the inner cavity is inside the conductor, so the conductor's inner surface would have a charge of -q. Because the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must then have a charge +q to balance it.

So, the conductor itself ends up with a net charge of zero, but the inner surface has -q and the outer surface has +q. Wait, no, because the conductor was initially uncharged. So when +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q, and since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The total charge of the conductor is zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q. That way, the total is (-q) + (+q) = 0.

Now, I'm trying to find the electric field at a point outside the conductor. I remember that the electric field outside a conductor is determined by the charges on the outer surface. Because the conductor shields the interior, the field inside the conductor (but outside the cavity) is zero. So for points outside, the field should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait, that's the concept of a Gaussian surface. So for a point outside, the electric field is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor. But wait, in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the field outside should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but what about the placement of the charge in the cavity? Oh, but because the conductor shields the cavity's charge, the field outside is only due to the induced charges on the outer surface. So the placement of the +q within the cavity doesn't affect the external field directly. The external field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q.

Let me think about other possibilities. Suppose the cavity wasn't there. Then the conductor would just have zero charge, and no field outside. But since we have a charge in the cavity, the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces create a field outside.

So, for any point outside the conductor (so outside radius R), the field is as if all the charge on the outer surface is at the center. So E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the conductor's center to P.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me check the other options. Option D says E is proportional to 1/l², where l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. But since the conductor's outer surface is at radius R, and P is outside, the distance from P to the conductor's center is L, which is larger than
