Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me go through each clue one by one and see what they tell me.

First, the FTIR spectrum. The question says there's a very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹. Oh wait, I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Because O-H in alcohols is broad, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the peak is usually even broader and maybe around that area. Hmm, but wait, sometimes aldehydes can have strong absorption too, but I think that's more around 2800 or so. So maybe this is an O-H group.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl, like a ketone or an aldehyde or maybe an ester. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl. Wait, maybe a conjugated ketone or an aromatic ring with a carbonyl? Or maybe an amide? But the options don't have N, so probably not an amide.

Wait, so two carbonyl peaks. That's interesting. Could it be something like a conjugated system, like a carbonyl adjacent to another group? Or maybe one is an ester and the other something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl and another functional group. Hmm.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, so the compound probably has a double bond, like an alkene. So structures with double bonds would have protons that show up downfield, around 4.5-7 ppm or so, depending on substitution.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Let me think about what fragments give m/z 45. 45 is a common mass. Let's calculate possible fragments. 45 is 9+36? Or maybe CH3CO+ (43?), no, wait. Oh, wait, 45 could be (CH3)2CO+ (
