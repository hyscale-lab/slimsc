Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, parallax... right, that's the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that the distance to a star is related to its parallax. Oh wait, the formula is distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, d = 1 / plx.

The question mentions that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed... does that mean their distances are spread out in a specific way? I'm thinking it's about how the number of stars depends on distance. Because in reality, the number of stars you can see depends on how many are within a certain distance range. But here, the question is about the number per unit parallax.

Wait, the problem is asking how the number of stars per unit parallax range changes with plx. So, like, if I have a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how does the number of stars in that range (dN) relate to plx?

I think I need to consider the relationship between the number of stars and the volume of space they occupy. Because if stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume is proportional to that volume. So the number density is uniform. But how does volume relate to parallax?

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. So as d increases, plx decreases. Volume depends on the cube of the radius, right? The volume up to distance d is (4/3)πd³. But wait, when considering a thin shell between d and d + dd, the volume is approximately 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a shell is surface area times thickness. Surface area is 4πd².

So, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the volume of that shell. But since the star distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a volume dV is proportional to dV. So N = n * dV, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

Wait, but the question is about number per unit parallax. So I need to relate dN to a change in parallax, dplx.
