Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Let me read the question again. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The options give possible relative speeds and total energies. I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, relative speed. I remember that when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativistic addition formula. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Because both are moving in the same direction, I guess u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So let me plug those in.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let's compute that: 0.3c²/c² = 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, that's either C or D for the relative speed part.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc². So I need to calculate gamma for each and sum their energies.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For the first astronaut (2m) moving at 0.6c: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So the energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut (3m) at 0.5c: v=0.5c. v²/c²=0.25. 1 -0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.866, so gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. So energy is 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and D says E=5 mc². So the total energy is about 5.96 mc².

Looking back, the relative speed is about 0.14c and the energy is about 5.96 mc². So option C matches both: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Wait, let me double-check the relative velocity calculation. Oh yeah, because both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c*0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1/0.7 c ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So yeah, that's correct.

And for the energy, 2.5 + 3.464 is indeed approximately 5.964, so 5.96 mc². So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

---

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96mc^2 \)**
