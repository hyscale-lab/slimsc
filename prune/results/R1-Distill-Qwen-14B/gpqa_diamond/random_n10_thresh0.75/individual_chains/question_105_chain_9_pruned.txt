Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the question is about photometric variations in a star's brightness caused by spots and comparing it to the effect of an exoplanet. The goal is to find the ratio of the exoplanet's radius to the star's radius such that the brightness variation is the same as the spot-induced variation.

First, I need to understand what's happening in the scenario. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, which have a filling factor of 20%. So, the spots take up 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K.

When the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into and out of view. From our perspective, this causes the observed brightness to vary because the spots are darker. The same effect can be caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, blocking some of the light.

The problem wants to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (Rpl) that would cause the same brightness variation as the spots. So, I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) caused by the spots and then find the exoplanet radius that would cause the same ΔF.

Let me break it down.

First, the star's total flux without any spots is F0. When spots are present, they decrease the flux because they're cooler. The change in brightness will depend on how much area is covered by spots and the temperature difference.

Wait, the flux from a star is proportional to the surface area and the fourth power of the temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the power emitted per unit area is σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, the total flux without spots is F0 = σ * Teff^4 * (4πRstar²) / (4πD²), where D is the distance. But since we're dealing with relative changes, the distance and other constants will cancel out. So, F0 is proportional to Rstar² * Teff^4.

Now, when there are spots, the total flux F is F0 minus the flux lost due to the spots. The spots are cooler, so each spot contributes less flux.

But wait, the spots are on one hemisphere. So, the total area of the star's surface is 4πR^2. Each hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But wait, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So, the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². Alternatively, sometimes filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered, but here it's specified that one hemisphere is spotty, so perhaps the 20% is only for that hemisphere. So, the total area of spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR².

The flux from the spots when they are facing us would be F_spots = σ * (Teff - ΔT)^4 * (filling factor) * (area of hemisphere) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the total flux variation. When the spots are on the side facing us, they contribute less. So, the variation in flux from the spots' rotation is the maximum when the spot area is fully visible, and the minimum when it's not.

But wait, the problem says that the star is being observed in time-series, and the brightness variations are periodic due to rotation. So, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower. The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and the minimum flux.

Wait, no. When the star rotates, the spots come into view and go out of view. So, each spot contributes to the flux depending on their position.

Alternatively, perhaps the star is being viewed such that one hemisphere is spotty, and as it rotates, the spots come into view and then go away. So, the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible (i.e., the unspotted hemisphere is facing us), and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, no. Because the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into and out of the observed hemisphere. So, when the spots are on the far side, the star's brightness is higher because we see more of the hotter regions. When the spots rotate into view, the brightness drops.

Wait, no. Wait, the star only has one hemisphere with spots. So, when the star rotates such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots, and the flux decreases. When the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, the flux is higher.

The star is rotating, so the spots will come into view and go out of view, causing a dip in brightness each time.

So, the variation in flux is the difference between the maximum (no spots visible) and the minimum (spots visible). The amplitude of this variation is what we're after.

Wait, but the star's spots are on one hemisphere. So, when the star rotates, the spots come into view, but the other hemisphere is unspotted. So, the brightness variation would depend on how much of the spotted area is visible.

Let me think about the total flux when the star is viewed with the spotted hemisphere facing us.

The star's surface is divided into two hemispheres: one with spots, the other without.

The unspotted hemisphere has a temperature of Teff (6000 K), and the spotted hemisphere has a temperature of Teff - 10
