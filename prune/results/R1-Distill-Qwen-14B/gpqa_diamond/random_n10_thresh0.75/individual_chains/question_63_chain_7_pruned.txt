Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, first, I should recall what the fundamental state means in this context. Oh wait, I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the ground state. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it'll transition to the next higher energy state, which I guess is the first excited state.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Well, the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the two states. So I'll need to find the energy difference between the fundamental and the next state, then relate that to the photon's momentum.

Wait, the molecule is treated as a non-rigid rotor, right? So I think this model includes both rotational and vibrational energy levels. But wait, the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model. Oh, perhaps it's the rigid rotor combined with a harmonic oscillator? Or is it the non-rigid rotor, which would allow bond length changes, hence affecting vibrational energy?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the models. The rigid rotor model treats the bond length as fixed, whereas the non-rigid rotor (also called the rotation-vibration model) allows the bond length to change, which affects rotational energy as well because the moment of inertia changes when the bond stretches or compresses. Oh right, because the moment of inertia I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length. So in the rigid rotor, r is constant, but in the non-rigid model, r can vary, hence coupling rotational and vibrational energy levels.

But wait, the problem says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which probably combines both rotational and vibrational aspects. So the energy levels would be a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental vibrational state is the ground state of the vibration, which is n_vib = 0. And rotationally, the ground state is the lowest rotational state, which is J = 0 for a diatomic. So the fundamental state is J=0
