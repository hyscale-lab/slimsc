Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The problem states that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the solution's metal ion concentration is related to the formation constant (Kf) of the complex. The formula I think is Kf = [Complex]/([Metal][Ligand]).

Wait, right. The formation constant Kf is equal to the concentration of the complex divided by the product of the concentrations of the metal ion and the ligand. So Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, that's the concentration of the complex. Let me denote that as [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M.

Assuming that the complex is completely dissociated, but wait, no, wait. Actually, the complex can dissociate to some extent. But because the formation constant Kf is very large (5e10), which is a big number, that suggests that the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be very small.

I think I can model this using the Kf expression. Let me set up an ICE table. Wait, but since the complex is in solution and dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be zero, and the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, no, that's not correct because when the complex is formed, the ligand and metal are in solution. Wait, no, in this problem, we are given that the complex is already formed, so perhaps it's more like:

The complex dissociates as: Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

But the K for this reaction is 1/Kf, since Kf is the formation constant. Wait, right! Because Kf is for the
