Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K.

Astronomers are looking at the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. So I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the number of particles in two energy levels relates to temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is usually written as:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the populations of the two energy levels.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) for each level.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the two levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

In this problem, the ratio we're interested in is n1/n2 or n2/n1. I need to figure out which one it is. The question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when spots are present, the ratio (n1/n2 or n2/n1) is lower than when there are no spots.

Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Let's think. The ratio is either n1/n2 or the other way around. Let's say the ratio is n1/n2. When the star has spots, the temperature is lower. Let's see how that affects the ratio.

If the ratio is n1/n2, then according to the Boltzmann equation:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait no, wait. Let's clarify: Let me define the ratio as R = n1 / n2. Then using the Boltzmann equation, R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2) / (k T) ). Because E2 = E1 + delta, so E2-E1 is positive if E2 is higher.

Wait, I think I might be making this more complicated. Let me re-state it. The Boltzmann factor for the ratio is:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, if the temperature T changes, this ratio changes. Let's say when the star has spots, the temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it's spotless (6000 K). The problem states that the ratio R (n1/n2 or n2/n1) decreases when the star has spots. So let's find out which ratio that is.

Wait, in the problem, when there are spots, the ratio decreases. So let's say that R is the ratio when the star is spotless, and R' is when it has spots. So R' < R.

So, R = n1/n2 when spotless, R' = n1'/n2' when has spots. Or maybe the ratio is n2/n1, let me think.

Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So let's clarify which ratio it is. Let me think
