Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product of a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I'll look at the given data. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates the presence of hydroxyl (-OH) or maybe an amide group, but more likely an -OH because the other peaks are more about carbonyl and alkenes. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl stretch, so that suggests either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acid O-H stretches are usually around 2500-3300, which is covered in the first peak. But wait, the first peak is 3400–2500, which is a broad range. So maybe it's an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid. Also, the 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ peaks might be from aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, perhaps a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: There's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is very high. That's typically a carboxylic acid proton, right? So that might confirm the presence of a COOH group. Then there's 8.0 ppm as a doublet for 2H and 7.2 ppm as another doublet for 2H. That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring; the two doublets indicate coupling between adjacent protons in the aromatic ring. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

The protons at 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H) could be from a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like maybe a carbonyl. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be adjacent to that, perhaps part of a chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) could be a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH₂ group. And the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, a CH₂-CH₂-CH3 chain, and a methyl group somewhere. Let's think. If the aromatic ring is para-substituted, perhaps with a carbonyl group and another substituent. Wait, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, but in the NMR data, it's a broad singlet for 1H. So maybe it's a -COOH group attached to the ring. So the benzene is para-substituted with a COOH group and another substituent.

Wait, but wait: the 8.0
