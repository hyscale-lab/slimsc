Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully.

So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The distance from the conductor's center to P is L, and from the cavity's center to P is l. Both L and l are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A, B, C, D, each showing a different formula for E.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some properties regarding electric fields and charges. Let me think. When a conductor is uncharged, placing a charge inside a cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Right, the inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to the placed charge, and the outer surface will have an induced charge equal to the inner surface's charge but positive, since the conductor was initially neutral.

Wait, wait. Wait, the conductor is uncharged. When I place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must induce a charge of -q. Because the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. So the conductor's total charge is zero because inner is -q and outer is +q.

But wait, the conductor was uncharged initially. So when we add +q inside the cavity, the conductor's total charge remains zero. So yes, inner surface is -q, outer +q.

Now, what about the electric field outside the conductor? For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed. But in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, so the field outside should be as if the charge +q is at the center.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere. So the outer shell's charge +q would distribute uniformly on the outer surface, and the electric field outside would be the same as that of a point charge +q at the center. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because P is a distance L from the center of the conductor
