Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. Hmm, let me think. I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Oh wait, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So like, plx = 1/distance. Or was it the other way around? Wait, I think the formula is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So plx = 1/d, meaning d = 1/plx.

The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But I need to find how N changes with distance. Since plx is 1/d, maybe I can express N in terms of d. Let me substitute plx into the equation. So 1/(plx)^5 becomes (1/(1/d))^5. Wait, 1/(1/d) is d. So (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5?

Wait, no wait, let me double-check. If N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/(plx^5) is (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. So when d increases, N increases as the fifth power of d.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I think they're asking for dN/dr. Because dN/dr would tell how many more stars you get per additional unit distance.

So N is proportional to d^5. So dN/dr = 5 d^4. Wait, so the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to d^4. Wait, but wait, the question says "how does the number of stars change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The number of stars observed in a region varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N = k / (plx)^5, where k is a constant. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, plx = 1/d.

So substituting, N = k / ( (1/d) )^5 ) = k * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how N changes with distance. So when you move to a larger distance, how does N change? But it's the number of stars in the region. Wait, but the number of stars would actually decrease with distance, because stars are fainter and fewer at larger distances. Wait, but according to the given relation, N is proportional to d^5. So as distance increases, N increases? That seems counterintuitive. Hmm, maybe I'm misapplying something.

Wait, maybe I should think about the density. Because when you look at a region of the sky, the number of stars you see depends on how many are in that direction, which depends on the depth you can see. So if N varies as 1/plx^5 = d^5, then for a given solid angle, the number of stars increases with distance? That doesn't make sense. Because as you go further, each star is dimmer, so you can't see as many
