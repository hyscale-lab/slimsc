Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound X has some IR and NMR data, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the product. Hmm. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used together in a reaction called the hydrohalogenation, but wait, isn't that for alkenes? Oh right, it's hydroboration maybe? Or wait, hydrohalogenation is when HI adds to alkenes, but red phosphorus might be part of a different reaction. Oh wait! Oh yeah, the reaction where an alkene reacts with HI in the presence of red phosphorus is called the oxymercuration-demercuration, but wait, no, that uses mercuric acetate. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus might be used in the formation of the phosphorane intermediate for hydroboration. Or wait, maybe it's the hydrohalogenation via the phosphorus-hydrogen pathway. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think: red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, particularly for anti-Markovnikov addition. Oh wait, no, Markovnikov addition is typically with HX and peroxides for anti. Wait, no, without peroxides, HX adds in a Markovnikov fashion. But I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, red phosphorus might be used in the formation of the ylide, which is used in the hydroboration reaction. Oh wait, no, the ylide is made with a different reagent like borane and a base. Hmm.

But maybe the reaction in question is the hydroboration-oxidation, which adds boron and then replaces it with -OH in a specific fashion. Wait, but the question mentions HI, not BH3. So perhaps it's adding HI across the double bond.

Wait, I think I should first figure out what compound X is based on the IR and NMR data, and then determine how it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the IR data: 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That's a broad peak, probably an -OH stretch. Then 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or carboxylic acid. Then 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone or ester.

Now the NMR data: let's go through each peak. 

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's probably an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols have lower ppm, around 1-5, but a carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12. The broad signal suggests it's not split, maybe because it's exchanging or in a symmetric environment.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two pro
