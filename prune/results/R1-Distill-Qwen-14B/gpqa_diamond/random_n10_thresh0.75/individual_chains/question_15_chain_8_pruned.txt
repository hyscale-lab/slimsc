Okay, so I've got this question here about transit probabilities for two Earth-like planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of that happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the planet's orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if Planet_2's period is, say, P, then Planet_1's is P/3. That means Planet_1 is closer to its star since it orbits faster.

Wait, also, the host stars' masses are different. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Oh, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So, same radius but different masses. Since more massive stars are usually bigger, but in this case, same radius, so maybe they're similar in size but different in mass. Maybe the Planet_1's star is more massive but same radius as Planet_2's, which is slightly evolved.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I think the transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Or wait, no—the formula for transit probability is (R_p / a) * (1/(1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3)))) or something like that. Wait, perhaps I should recall
