Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame. The options are A to D, including 1 and others.

Wait, speed of light in vacuum is c=1, but here the light is in glass. Normally, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. So if the medium isn't moving, the speed would be 1/n. But wait, no, the question is about the speed as measured by the observer. So I guess the glass is moving, so maybe there's a relativistic effect here.

Wait, but I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The velocity addition formula comes into play. The formula for adding velocities in relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, wait, when you have a frame moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and in that frame, the light is moving at u, then the speed in the lab is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²).

In this case, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So from the lab's perspective, the glass's frame is moving at +v. The light is moving through the glass. So in the glass's rest frame, what is the speed of the light? Well, the light is moving through the glass, which has index n, so in that frame, the speed should be c/n. Wait, but c is 1, so 1/n.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving towards the observer. So from the lab's frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at 1/n in the same direction as the glass in the glass's frame.

So using the velocity addition formula for relativity, the lab frame would measure the speed as (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² ), where u' is the speed of light in the glass's frame.

Wait, u' is 1/n, because in the glass's frame, the light moves at speed c/n. So substituting, u' = 1/n.

So the formula becomes ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / c² ). But since c=1, it simplifies to ( (1 + n v) / n ) / ( 1 + (v)/(n) )

Wait, let me compute that.

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1/n + v) = (1 + n v) / n.

Denominator: 1 + (v * (1/n)) ) = (n + v)/n.

So overall, it's [ (1 + n v)/n ] divided by [ (n + v)/n ].

Which is (1 + n v)/n multiplied by n/(n + v). The n's cancel out, so it's (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (
