Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. They gave me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in terms of meters, so I think I need to calculate the average distance the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, I remember that the decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. But how do I find τ from the given parameters?

Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the total decay width Γ. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ. But I need to make sure about the units here. Let me jot down the steps.

First, I should probably calculate the decay width Γ. Wait, no, Γ is already given as 320 MeV. So I can proceed.

Wait, but wait. The decay width Γ is related to the uncertainty principle. The lifetime is Γ^{-1} multiplied by some constants. Oh right, yes, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So the uncertainty in energy (which is Γ/2) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (which is τ) gives ħ/2. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, maybe I should be precise here.

Wait, the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense. So I need to compute τ = ħ / Γ.

But I also need the velocity of the meson. To find velocity, I can use relativistic mechanics. The meson's energy E is given as 8 GeV, and its rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So I can find the Lorentz factor gamma and then the velocity beta (v/c).

The formula for energy in relativity is E = γ m c². So gamma is E / (m c²). Let me compute gamma.

Wait, the units here are in GeV and GeV/c²? Oh, right, because when you have E in GeV and m in GeV/c² (since E = mc²), so E = gamma m c². So yeah, gamma is E / m.

Wait, but E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately. Hmm, 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666..., which is 20/3. So gamma is 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

Then, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta can be found from gamma. Let's solve for beta.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Wait, let me think again. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), so 1/gamma² = 1 - beta². So beta squared is 1 - 1/gamma squared.

So beta squared = 1 - (3^2)/(20^2) = 1 - 9/400 = (400 - 9)/400 = 391/400. So beta = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Hmm, so the velocity v is approximately 0.9887c.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let me compute 1/gamma²: 1/( (20/3)^2 ) = 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of that is sqrt(0.9775). Let me approximate that. The square root of 0.98 is about 0.99, but let me calculate it more precisely.

Wait, 0.9887 squared is (approx): 0.9887 * 0.9887. Let's compute: 0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2. Expanding: 0.98^2 is 0.9604, 2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 is about 0.0172, and (0.0087)^2 is about 0.000075. So sum is 0.9604 + 0.0172 = 0.9776, plus 0.000075 gives 0.977675, which is very close to 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887c.

Now, the mean lifetime tau is ħ / Γ. Let me compute that. But I need to make sure about the units. ħ is Planck's constant over 2π, approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, units are important here. Let me check:

Yes, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. And Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert Γ into GeV to have consistent units.

Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau would be ħ / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that again: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. 6.582 / 0.32 is approx 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 → which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. So tau is about 2.0569e-24 seconds.

Then, the decay length L is v * tau. So L = 0.9887c * tau.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s = let's compute that.

2.9661e8 * 2.0569e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.0569) * 1e-16.

Calculate 2.9661 * 2.0569: let's see, 3 * 2 is 6, but more precisely:

2.9661 * 2.0569 ≈ 2.966 * 2.057. Let me compute this.

2 * 2.057 = 4.114.

0.966 * 2.057: 0.966 * 2 is 1.932, 0.966 * 0.057 is about 0.055. So total ≈ 1.932 + 0.055 ≈ 1.987.

So total is 4.114 + 1.987 = 6.101. So approx 6.10 * 1e-16 m. So L ≈ 6.10e-16 meters.

Wait, but none of the options are around 6e-16. The options are A)5.02e-16, B)4.06e-15, C)5.02e-15, D)4.06e-16.

Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a miscalculation? Let me check each step.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me recheck.

E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E/(m c²) but since E and m c² are in GeV and GeV respectively, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... correct.

Beta squared is 1 - (1/gamma squared) → 1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) → Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recompute 1/gamma².

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So (gamma)^2 is (6.666...)^2 = 44.444... So 1/gamma squared is 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225.

So beta squared is 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up with the calculation of v * tau.

Wait, let me recalculate tau more accurately. ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s)/(0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) e-25 s → 20.56875e-25 s → which is 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

v is 0.9887c, c = 3e8 m/s → 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s → correct.

L = v * tau = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s → let me compute that.

Multiplying 2.9661e8 by 2.056875e-24 → 2.9661 * 2.056875 = approx 6.102.

So 6.102e-16 m. Hmm, but the options don't include that. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the decay width is given as the total width, but perhaps I should use the natural line width formula, considering the mean lifetime as τ = ħ/(Γ). Oh wait, that's what I did. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the velocity in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mean decay length using the formula L = (cτ) * beta gamma.

Wait, another approach: The mean lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. The velocity v = beta c.

The decay length L is v * τ = beta c * (ħ / Γ).

Let me plug in the numbers again.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ) → (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^0.5 / E. Wait, perhaps I can compute beta as sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2). Since E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so (m/E) is unitless.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Which matches what I did earlier.

So, L = beta c tau.

Compute tau again: ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

v = beta c → 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

L = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.9661 * 2.056875 * 1e-16 m.

2.9661 * 2.056875 → Let me compute this more accurately.

2.9661 * 2.056875:

Break it down:

2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322
2.9661 * 0.05 = 0.148305
2.9661 * 0.006875 ≈ 2.9661 * 0.006875 → let's compute: 2.9661 * 6875e-5 = ?

0.006875 is 22.5e-4. So 2.9661 * 0.006875 ≈ 0.02034.

Wait, maybe a better approach:

2.056875 = 2 + 0.056875.

So 2.9661 * 2 =5.9322,

2.9661 * 0.05 = 0.148305,

2.9661 * 0.006875 = let's compute 2.9661 * 0.006 = 0.0177966, 2.9661 * 0.000875 = approx 0.002592. Sum: 0.0177966 + 0.002592 = 0.0203886.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.148305 + 0.0203886 ≈ 6.0999 (about 6.0999).

So 6.0999e-16 meters. Approximately 6.1e-16 m.

But the options are A)5.0223e-16, B)4.0655e-15, C)5.0223e-15, D)4.0655e-16.

Hmm, none of these match 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for lifetime. Oh, wait, no, because tau is the proper lifetime, and the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times tau. But wait, no, because tau is the proper lifetime, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau. But then, when calculating the mean decay length, it's gamma tau multiplied by beta c.

Wait, maybe I confused the equations. Let me think again. The proper lifetime is tau, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. But wait, tau is the mean proper lifetime, so the observed lifetime is longer by gamma. So the decay length L = v * gamma tau. Wait, no, that can't be right because v is already beta c, so L = beta c * gamma tau?

Wait, no. Let's correct this. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So the mean decay length is L = v * gamma tau.

Wait, but wait: tau is the proper lifetime (rest frame). In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the distance is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime.

So L = beta c * gamma tau.

But then, the expression would be L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, but earlier I used L = beta c * tau, which is incorrect because I used the proper tau. The correct formula should include gamma.

So, I think I made a mistake earlier by not including the gamma factor.

So let's recalculate with that in mind.

L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, and the velocity is beta c, so L = beta c * gamma tau.

So, let me compute this.

We have beta = 0.9887, gamma =6.6667.

So beta gamma is 0.9887 *6.6667 ≈ let's compute that.

0.9887 *6 =5.9322,

0.9887 *0.6667≈0.9887 * 2/3 ≈0.6591.

So sum is 5.9322 + 0.6591≈6.5913.

So beta gamma ≈6.5913.

Then, c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = (beta gamma) * c * tau.

So 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute this:

6.5913 * 3e8 = 1.97739e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

1.97739e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.97739 * 2.056875 * 1e-15.

1.97739 * 2.056875 → let's compute:

Approximately 2 * 2=4, but more precisely:

1.97739 * 2.056875.

Compute 2 * 2.056875 =4.11375.

Subtract (0.02261 * 2.056875). Wait, perhaps a better approach.

Alternatively, compute 1.97739 * 2 =3.95478.

1.97739 * 0.056875 = approx 0.1118.

So total is 3.95478 + 0.1118 ≈4.06658.

So L ≈4.06658e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, and option B is 4.0655e-15 m. The calculation here gives approximately 4.0666e-15 m, which matches option B) 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Earlier I thought that L was v * gamma tau, but I should verify the formula.

The mean decay length L is the velocity multiplied by the lifetime in the lab frame. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. So L = v * gamma tau.

v is beta c, so L = beta c * gamma tau.

But tau is ħ / Γ, so L = beta gamma c * ħ / Γ.

So let me recompute using this formula.

Plugging in the numbers:

beta ≈0.9887,

gamma ≈6.6667,

c =3e8 m/s,

ħ =6.582e-25 GeV·s,

Γ =0.32 GeV.

So L = (0.9887 *6.6667) *3e8 m/s * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV).

Let me compute each part.

Compute (0.9887 *6.6667) → which is approximately 6.5913.

So,

6.5913 * 3e8 = 1.97739e9 m/s.

Multiply by 6.582e-25 GeV·s: 1.97739e9 *6.582e-25 = (1.97739 *6.582) e(9-25) = (13.011) e-16 = 1.3011e-15.

Then divide by 0.32 GeV: 1.3011e-15 / 0.32 ≈4.066e-15 m.

Yes, that matches the previous calculation. So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper mean lifetime, and
- \( \Gamma \) is the total decay width.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Using the relativistic energy relation \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \), we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relation between \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (0.9887)(6.6667)(3 \times 10^8)(2.0569 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5913
\]

Then, calculate \( \beta \gamma c \tau \):

\[
L = 6.5913 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.0569 \times 10^{-24})
\]

\[
L = (6.5913 \times 3 \times 2.0569) \times 10^{-16}
\]

\[
L \approx 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches option **B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
