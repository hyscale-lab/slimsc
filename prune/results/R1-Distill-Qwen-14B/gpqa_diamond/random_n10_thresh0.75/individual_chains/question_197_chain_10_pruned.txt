Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out what the product is based on the given spectral data and the reaction conditions.

First, let's look at the spectral data. The IR and NMR are provided, so I should analyze them to determine the structure of Compound X. Then, I'll consider what reaction occurs when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI. 

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹. The broad peak between 3400–2500 suggests an -OH group, probably in a carboxylic acid because those show up as broad O-H stretches. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which would fit a carboxylic acid. The peaks around 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ could be aromatic C=C stretches. So, I'm thinking this compound has a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now. The signals are:
- 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H): That's a strong indicator of an -OH proton, probably from a carboxylic acid. Broad because it's exchanging with water.
- 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H): These are typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets suggest two sets of protons, each integrating to 2. So, perhaps a substituent on the benzene ring in the para position, with two H's next to each substituent.
- 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H): This looks like a methine (CH) group attached to something else. Maybe a CH connected to an electronegative atom or part of a CH2-CH-O structure?
- 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H): Possibly a CH2 adjacent to something else, maybe another CH or a carbonyl.
- 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H): A methyl group adjacent to a CH or perhaps part of an ethyl chain.
- 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H): A terminal methyl group, as in a CH2CH3.

Putting the NMR together: The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. Looking at the non-aromatic signals, I see a CH group (2.9 ppm, 1H), then a CH2 (1.7, 2H), a CH2 (maybe from the triplet and doublet?), and a terminal methyl (0.9, triplet). Wait, the triplet at 0.9 with 3H is likely a CH2CH3 group. So, perhaps there's a chain like -CH2-C(CH2CH3)-COOH? Hmm, but wait, the 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H could be a methyl adjacent to a CH. So maybe it's a structure like CH2-C(CH2CH3)(COOH) attached to the benzene.

Wait, another possibility: Let's think about the substituents on the benzene. If the substituent is a -COOH group and another group. Wait, but the NMR shows an -OH (carboxylic) and other protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's an ester or a ketone, but the IR has the 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more in line with a carboxylic acid or an ester. However, the broad peak at 10.5 ppm would suggest a carboxylic acid, not an ester. So, probably a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but looking at the substituents: so the benzene has a para-substituted group that's a carboxylic acid. Then perhaps another substituent. Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets. That suggests a substituent in the para position, but let me think: if the substituent is in the para, then the protons adjacent would be as two doublets. So, maybe the benzene has two substituents, each in the para positions? No, because in the NMR, it's two doublets each integrating to 2H. So, maybe one substituent is in the para position, making the adjacent protons each as a pair. Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent somewhere else. Or maybe the substituent is itself a group that causes the splitting.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -COOH and a -OCH2CH(CH2CH3) or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -COOH and a branched alkyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, let me think about the non-aromatic protons. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to an oxygen, like in an ester group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be adjacent CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a methyl attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is likely a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, putting this together: perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group and a -CH2-C(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene in the para position. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait,
