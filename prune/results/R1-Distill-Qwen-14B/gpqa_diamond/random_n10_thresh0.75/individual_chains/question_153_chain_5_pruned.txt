Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different starting materials and conditions, and I need to find out what the products are. There are four options to choose from, each giving different products for A, B, and C.

First, let's tackle part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). NaOEt is a strong base, so I think this is a Michael addition reaction. The Michael reaction involves a nucleophile (enolate) attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

Wait, so dimethyl malonate is a good enolate precursor. When deprotonated, it forms an enolate ion. The enolate then acts as a nucleophile. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group on the beta carbon (the CH2 is connected to the carbonyl, then the double bond, then p-tolyl). So the structure is CH2=CH-(C6H4-para-Me)-COOCH3.

In the Michael reaction, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. Wait, the acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, so the enolate will attack the beta carbon, which is the CH2 group next to the double bond. So the attack would add a malonate group to that position.

Wait, let me draw this out mentally. The acrylate has the structure: CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. The enolate from dimethyl malonate is a strong nucleophile. So the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. After the attack, the double bond would shift to the other position, and the oxygen would have a negative charge, which would pick up a proton.

Wait, so the product would have the structure where the malonate is added to the acrylate. Alternatively, perhaps the acrylate is the Michael acceptor, and the malonate enolate is the nucleophile.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is CH3COCH2COOCH3. When deprotonated at the alpha position, the enolate is CH2- (but I'm not sure exactly how it's structured). So when the enolate attacks the beta position of the acrylate, I think the product would be a conjugate addition, adding the malonate group to the acrylate.

So the acrylate has a structure like CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)COOCH3. After the Michael addition, the enolate would attack the beta carbon (the CH2) of the acrylate, so the product would have the structure CH2(COOCH3)2 attached to the same position where the CH2 was. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the enolate from dimethyl malonate is CH2CO2CH3, but as an enolate, it's more like CH-CO₂Me with a negative charge on the CH part.

So the enolate would attack the beta carbon (the CH2 group) of the acrylate. So the reaction would form a new carbon-carbon bond there. The acrylate's structure is CH₂=CH–(p-tolyl)–COOCH3. When the enolate attacks, the CH₂ becomes CH–(something), and the double bond shifts.

Wait, perhaps the product would be something like CH₂(CO₂Me)₂–CH–(p-tolyl)–COOCH3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a substituted malonate.

Wait, another approach: when the enolate attacks the acrylate, the new bond forms between the enolate's alpha carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the acrylate's structure is CH₂=CH–R (where R is p-tolyl-COOCH3), and the enolate is CH₂–COOCH3–, but more accurately, the enolate would be the conjugate base of dimethyl malonate, which is a dienolate? No, wait, dimethyl malonate is CH3COCH2COOCH3. Deprotonating the alpha position (the central CH2) gives a resonance-stabilized enolate.

So, when the enolate attacks the acrylate, the acrylate's beta carbon (the CH2 in CH2=CH–R) would be attacked. So
