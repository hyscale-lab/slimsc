Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. Right, in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed determined by its amplitude and the spring constant. But since this is relativistic, I guess I'll need to consider how relativistic effects change things.

So the setup: 1-dimensional, obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. Mass is m, maximum amplitude A. And we need to find v_max. Oh, and the speed of light is c, so relativity definitely comes into play here.

From what I remember, in the classical case, the maximum speed v_max is given by (kA)/m, but that's non-relativistic. But wait, that might not be exactly right. Let me think. Oh right, the maximum kinetic energy in SHM is (1/2)kA², and then using (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA², which simplifies to v = sqrt(kA²/m), so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, that's the classical case. Since this is relativistic, the speed can't exceed c, so option C might not be the correct answer here.

But wait, in relativity, the energy considerations change. The total energy includes rest mass energy. So for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy E would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the oscillation energy.

Wait, but actually, the relativistic harmonic oscillator is a bit different. The equation of motion might be modified. I think the relativistic equation for a harmonic oscillator is something like d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, sqrt(1 - v²/c²)^-1.

But solving that differential equation might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of energy.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is different. The total energy is gamma m c², which includes rest energy plus kinetic.

But wait, the potential energy in a relativistic oscillator might not just be (1/2)k x². I'm
