Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, let me try to think through this. The question is about a diatomic molecule switching states when it absorbs a photon. 

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on what exactly that implies for the rotational and vibrational states. I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, each state is described by two quantum numbers: the vibrational state ν and the rotational state J.

The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, which I think is when both ν and J are at their lowest values. So for the vibrational state, the lowest is ν=0. And for rotation, the lowest is J=0. But wait, sometimes the ground state is considered with J=0, but for molecules, maybe J can't be zero? Or is it allowed? I think J can be zero, so the ground state is J=0 and ν=0.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, so that's ν=0 and J=0. Now, when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would have the least possible energy increase, right? So I think that the photon would cause either a vibrational or rotational transition. But which is lower in energy?

Wait, the options given are all about momentum p, so the photon's momentum. So I need to figure out what the energy of the photon should be and then find the momentum from that.

Wait, photons have energy E = hν, and momentum p = E/c, since E = pc for photons. So if I can find the required energy, I can find p.

But what energy transition are we looking at here? The molecule is in the fundamental state (ν=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would probably be the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. Which has lower energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels have a much higher spacing than rotational. Because vibrational energy is (hω)(ν + 1/2), so the spacing between ν=0 and ν=1 is hω. For rotational, the energy levels are (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1), so the spacing between J=0 and J=1 is (ħ² / (2I)) * 2 =
