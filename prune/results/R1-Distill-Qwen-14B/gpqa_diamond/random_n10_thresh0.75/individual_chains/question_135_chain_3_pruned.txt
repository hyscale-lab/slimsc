Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, the question gives me the Lagrangian and some details about the mass of X and asks about the kinematically allowed decay channels at the lowest order. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, so I'll need to think this through carefully.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf (y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that again. Oh right, it's probably more like L = -λ ψ_f^\dagger (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but I'm not 100% sure. The important part is that X is interacting with fermions, right? So the boson X is a scalar because it's a bosonic field, I think. The interaction term suggests that X is coupling to fermions, so it's a Yukawa-like interaction.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to figure out what particles it can decay into. Kinematically allowed means that the decay products' combined mass must be less than the mass of X. So X can decay into two identical fermions (like a quark-antiquark pair or lepton-antilepton pair), provided that their rest mass is less than 6 GeV each.

Wait, no. Because when a boson decays into two particles, each of them must have rest mass less than the boson's mass. So for each fermion f, the condition is m_f * 2 <= m_X. Because each would have mass m_f, and the sum must be less than m_X. Wait, no, wait: when the boson decays into a pair, each particle has energy and momentum, but the rest mass of each must be less than the mass of the boson. Because if either fermion's rest mass were more than m_X/2, the decay wouldn't be possible. So the condition is 2 m_f <= m_X.

So m_X is 6 GeV. So 2m_f ≤ 6 → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So I need to find all fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let me list the known fermion masses.
