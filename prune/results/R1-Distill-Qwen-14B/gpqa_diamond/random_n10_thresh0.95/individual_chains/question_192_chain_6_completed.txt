Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to visualize the setup. There's a spherical conductor, uncharged at first, with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So imagine a bigger sphere with a smaller cavity shifted a bit.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, but then a charge is placed inside the cavity, I think the conductor's charges will redistribute. Oh right, in electrostatics, the charges in a conductor will arrange themselves in such a way that the electric field inside the conductor material is zero.

Wait, so when you have a conductor with a cavity, and you place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will develop an induced charge. Because the conductor was initially neutral, the inner surface must have a charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge inside. So if +q is inside, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q. But since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance.

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, wait. The conductor was initially uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. When +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, right? Because the conductor was neutral, and the charge inside the cavity is +q, so the inner surface must have -q, leaving the conductor's material to have a charge of +q on the outer surface.

But wait, that would make the total charge of the conductor +q, but the conductor was uncharged. Oh wait no, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. So when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q, which would make the conductor's material have a charge of +q, but then the outer surface would have +q, making the total conductor charge +q. That can't be right because the conductor was uncharged. Hmm, maybe I got this wrong.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor's material is neutral. So when the external charge is +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q (induced), and the outer surface must have +q to make the total charge of the conductor zero (since the conductor was initially neutral). Because the conductor's initial charge is zero, the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero. So inner is -q, outer must be +q. So the outer surface has +q.

Now, for a point outside the conductor, the electric field should be the same as if all the charge on the conductor were concentrated at its center. But wait, the conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field outside would be as if there's a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the setup also has the cavity with its center shifted by s from the conductor's center. So the point P is outside, but the charge distributions might affect the field.

Wait, but according to Gauss's Law, the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. So in this case, the Gaussian surface would enclose the entire conductor. The charge inside this surface is +q (from the outer surface). So the field at point P would be the same as that due to a point charge +q at the center of the conductor, regardless of where the charge is placed inside, as long as it's enclosed within the conductor.

Wait, but wait, the +q in the cavity isn't on the conductor's surface. The conductor's outer surface has +q. So the field outside should be due to that +q as if it's a point charge at the center. So the direction would be radially outward, and the magnitude would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², since L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Option D is using l instead of L. But wait, no, because point P is at distance L from the conductor's center, so the field should depend on L squared.

Wait a second, but what about the arrangement of the cavity and the charge? The charge is placed inside the cavity, but since the conductor's outer surface has +q, the field outside is the same as if the charge is at the center of the conductor. So the position of the cavity's center (distance s from the conductor's center) and the l and theta might affect the inner fields, but for points outside the conductor, those factors don't matter.

So the electric field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the charge inside the cavity is +q, which would induce a -q on the inner surface, and the conductor's outer surface is +q. So when considering the field outside, it's only the outer charge that matters, which is +q. So the field at P is same as a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. So the distance from P to the center is L, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). So option B.

Looking back at the options: option B is exactly that.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) develops an induced charge $-q$ due to electrostatic induction. To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For points outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. Here, the Gaussian surface encloses the entire conductor, and the total charge enclosed is $+q$ (from the outer surface). The field outside the conductor is therefore the same as if the charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor, due to the shielding effect of the conductor.

3. **Magnitude of the Electric Field**: The distance from the center of the conductor to the point $P$ is $L$. Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Irrelevance of Internal Geometry**: The position of the cavity's center (distance $s$ from the conductor's center), the distance $l$ from $P$ to the cavity's center, and the angle $\theta$ between $l$ and $s$ do not affect the electric field at $P$, as the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface.

5. **Correct Option**: Among the given options, the correct expression for the electric field is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
