Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me try to break this down.

First, I need to understand the question correctly. The question is asking which stars can be detected by both spectrographs. The key here is the apparent magnitude each spectrograph can observe. The ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17 mag in V, while HIRES can see brighter than 16 mag. So any star that's 17 mag or fainter can't be seen by HIRES. Wait, no—wait, it's the opposite. The question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16 mag" for HIRES. Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So when a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means it's magnitude is less than 17. Because like, magnitude 1 is brighter than magnitude 6.

So, for ESPRESSO, the star's V magnitude must be less than 17. For HIRES, less than 16. So a star can be detected by both if its apparent V magnitude is less than 16, because that way both can see it. Because HIRES can't see stars fainter than 16, so if a star is brighter than 16, it can be seen by both. Let's make sure that's right.

Wait, wait, the question says, with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So m_v <17. HIRES: m_v <16. So the overlapping stars must have m_v <16. Because if a star's m_v is 15, then both can observe. If it's 16, ESPRESSO can, but HIRES can't because it's brighter than 16? Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the limit is apparent V magnitude. So for a star to be detected, it has to be brighter than the limit. So ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So any star with V mag less than 17 is visible. Similarly, HIRES can observe brighter than 16, so V mag <16.

So a star that's V mag less than 16 is visible by both. If a star is between 16 and 17 mag, it's visible by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. If it's brighter than 16, but less than 17, then HIRES can't see it. Wait, no, because if the magnitude is 16.5, it's fainter than 16 (since higher magnitude is fainter). Wait, no, wait! Let me be precise.

Wait, the magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So, a star with V mag 15 is brighter than a star with V mag 17. So, for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 are observable. So V mag less than 17.

HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, so V mag less than 16.

So the stars that can be seen by both are those with V mag less than 16. Because if a star's V is, say, 15, then both can see it. If it's 16.5, then ESPRESSO can but HIRES cannot. If it's 17.5, neither can see it.

So, our task is to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star, taking into account any extinction (E(B-V)), and see which ones have m_v <16.

Wait, so the question gives some stars with absolute magnitudes, and others with apparent. Let's look at each star.

Let's list each star and compute their apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction.

Star1: V absolute mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. Since it's at 10 pc, which is the same as the parsec scale, so apparent V mag is same as absolute V mag. So m_v = 15.5. That's less than 16. So both can see it.

Wait, but wait, is there any extinction? Star1's data: no mention of E(B-V). So we can assume E(B-V)=0, so no extinction.

Star2: apparent V mag 16.5. So m_v =16.5. So for ESPRESSO, 16.5 <17 → yes. For HIRES, 16.5 >16 → no. So HIRES can't see it. So Star2 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Star3: apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. Total absorption in V: related to E(B-V) with coefficient 3.1. So extinction A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed m_v is the apparent magnitude plus extinction. Because extinction makes it appear fainter (higher mag). So m_observed = m_apparent + A_v. Wait, wait, no. The apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction? No, E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the difference between the observed B-V and the intrinsic B-V. The extinction A_v is the amount by which the star is dimmed in the V band. So the apparent magnitude is the star's intrinsic magnitude plus the extinction.

Wait, the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude without extinction would be m0, but the observed m is m0 + A_v. So if the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but it's extincted by A_v=1.86, then the observed m_v is 15.5 +1.86=17.36. So that's higher than 17, so ESPRESSO can't observe it. Because ESPRESSO can only see stars with m_v <17. So Star3's observed m_v is 17.36, which is brighter than 17? No, wait, higher magnitude is fainter. So 17.36 is fainter than 17, meaning it's beyond ESPRESSO's limit. So Star3 can't be detected by ESPRESSO. What about HIRES? Since 17.36 is much higher (fainter) than 16, HIRES can't see it either.

Wait, wait, no: Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but after adding extinction, it's 17.36. So m_v=17.36. So for ESPRESSO, the limit is m_v <17. So 17.36 is above the limit, so ESPRESSO can't see it. Similarly, HIRES requires m_v <16, which it's way above. So Star3 can't be seen by either.

Star4: absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc. So the absolute magnitude is the apparent mag at 10 pc. But wait, the star is at 10 pc, so apparent mag would be same as absolute. But what about extinction? So m_v = M_v + A_v. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the formula is: m = M + 5 log10(d / 10) + A_v. Oh wait no, because M is the absolute magnitude, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So for distance d (in parsecs), m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_v. Wait, but in this case, M is 15.5, d=10pc. So log10(10/10)=0. So m = M + A_v. Wait, no: A_v is the extinction (dimming) caused by dust. So when you calculate the apparent magnitude, you have to add the extinction. Because the extinction makes the star appear fainter, so higher m.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) if the star were at 10 pc, with no extinction. So when it's actually at d pc, the apparent magnitude without extinction is m0 = M +5 log10(d/10). Then, with extinction, m = m0 + A_v.

So for Star4:

M =15.5

d=10 pc.

m0 = M +5 log10(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 =15.5.

A_v =3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So m =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So m_v=16.74.

That's above 16. So HIRES can't see it (needs m_v <16). ESPRESSO can (needs m_v <17). So Star4 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Star5: absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Compute m without extinction: m0 = M +5 log10(d/10).

d=5, so log10(5/10)=log10(0.5)= -0.3010.

So m0=16.5 +5*(-0.3010) =16.5 - 1.505=14.995 ≈15.0.

Assuming E(B-V)=0? Because Star5's data doesn't mention it. So A_v=0.

So m_v=15.0.

Which is less than 16. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it.

Wait, let me double-check:

M=16.5, d=5.

m0 = M +5 log10(5/10) = 16.5 +5*(-0.3010) =16.5 -1.505 =14.995. Yes, so m0=15.0.

No extinction, so m=15.0. So m=15.0, which is less than 16. So both can detect.

So summary:

Star1: m_v=15.5 → both can see.

Star2: m_v=16.5 → ESPRESSO yes, HIRES no.

Star3: m_v=17.36 → neither can see.

Star4: m_v=16.74 → ESPRESSO yes, HIRES no.

Star5: m_v=15.0 → both can see.

So which stars can be detected by both? Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options: let's see.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't be seen by either.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 only seen by ESPRESSO; Star3 not seen by either.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can be seen by both. Star4 can only be seen by ESPRESSO.

Wait wait, no, wait: Star5 can be seen by both, and Star1 can also be seen by both. So what's the options? Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, none of them include Star1 and Star5. Wait, the options are:

A) 4 and5 → 4's m is 16.74, so HIRES can't. So A would have only Star5 detectable by both.

B) 3 and5 → 3 can't be detected, so only 5.

C) 2 and3 → both can't be detected by both.

D) 1 and4 → 1 can be detected by both, but 4 can't be detected by HIRES.

Wait, I must have made a mistake. Because according to my calculations, Star1 and Star5 are the two stars that can be detected by both. But looking at the options, none of them have both 1 and5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star1. Let me recheck Star1.

Star1: absolute magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent magnitude without extinction is same as absolute, since it's at 10 pc. So m0=15.5. But is there any extinction? The question says Star1 doesn't have any E(B-V) mentioned, so A_v=0. So m_v=15.5. So both can see.

Star5: m_v=15 → both can see.

So which options have both? Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) 4 and 5 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

B) 3 and5 → Star3 can't be seen by either.

C) 2 and3 → 2 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES; 3 can't be seen by either.

D) 1 and4 → Star1 can be seen by both, Star4 can only be seen by ESPRESSO.

Wait, so none of the options have Star1 and Star5. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me check Star5 again. Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, distance 5 pc.

So m0 = M + 5 log10(5/10)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995.

So m0 is 15.0. No extinction, so m_v=15.0. So both can see.

So the two stars are Star1 and Star5.

But looking at the options, none of them have both. Let me check what the options are.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → So Star5 can be detected by both, and Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't be detected by either.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Neither can be detected by both.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can be detected by both, Star4 only by ESPRESSO.

So the only option where both stars can be detected by both is when the option includes Star1 and Star5. But in the options, that's not present.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star5. Let me think again. Star5: absolute V is 16.5, distance 5 pc.

So m0 = M +5 * log10(5/10) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) =16.5 -1.505=14.995. So m0=15.0.

So m_v=15.0. So both can observe. So Star5 is a candidate.

Now, looking back, which options include Star5 and another star that can be seen by both?

Option B is Star3 and Star5. But Star3 can't be seen by either.

Option A includes Star5, but Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

So the only stars that can be seen by both are Star1 and Star5.

But wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Only Star5 can be seen by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Only Star5 can be seen.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Neither can be seen by both.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can be seen by both, Star4 can be seen only by ESPRESSO.

So the correct answer would have to be Star1 and Star5. But that's not an option. Hmm. Or wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I have to look at the question again. The question is: which can be detected with both spectrographs.

So which stars are visible by both?

So let me list each star's visibility:

Star1: m_v=15.5 → yes for both.

Star2: m_v=16.5 → HIRES can't, ESPRESSO can.

Star3: m_v=17.36 → neither.

Star4: m_v=16.74 → ESPRESSO can, HIRES can't.

Star5: m_v=15 → yes for both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options, no option has both. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for Star5.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the apparent magnitude for each star using the distance modulus, and any extinction.

Wait, let's make a table.

Star | Mv | d (pc) | E(B-V) | A_v=3.1*E | m_v (apparent) | m_observed = m + A_v?

Wait, no, I think the confusion comes from whether the given apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction or not. For Star3 and Star4, the given apparent magnitude is observed, so we have to add the extinction? Or is the given apparent magnitude the intrinsic, and we have to calculate observed.

Wait, the problem states for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So the apparent magnitude is the observed one, which already includes the extinction. Or is it the intrinsic? No, in astronomy, apparent magnitude is the observed value, which already factors in extinction. So if the given apparent magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6, then the extinction A_v=3.1*0.6=1.86. But wait, in that case, you subtract A_v from the apparent magnitude to get the intrinsic. Because extinction makes it dimmer, so the star's true brightness is brighter.

Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think. Suppose a star has an intrinsic V magnitude of m0. Due to extinction (dimming), the observed m_v is m0 + A_v.

So if the observed m_v is given, and E(B-V) is known, then the intrinsic m0 = m_v - A_v.

But in the case of Star3, the problem says apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So that would imply that the intrinsic m0 is 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that's not relevant here because we're interested in the observed m_v, which is 15.5. So if the observed m_v is 15.5, then without any extinction, the star would appear brighter.

But wait, no. If the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, that already includes the extinction. So in that case, m_v=15.5. So no need to adjust it further because the problem states that Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed value. So perhaps earlier calculations for Star3 were wrong.

Wait, this is an important point. Let me clarify.

In the problem statement:

Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V) =0.6.

So does the apparent magnitude already include extinction? Or is the 15.5 the intrinsic, and we have to calculate the observed?

In astronomy, when someone says 'apparent magnitude', it refers to the observed magnitude, which includes any extinction (dust dimming). So for Star3, m_v=15.5 includes the effect of extinction. So I don't need to adjust it further. That would change my earlier calculation.

Wait, that would mean that for Star3, m_v=15.5, which is less than 16. So both spectrographs can see it.

Wait, but that can't be right because Star3's E(B-V) is 0.6, which would make it appear dimmer. Wait, no, because the apparent magnitude is the observed one. So, if a star has an E(B-V) of 0.6, the extinction A_v is 3.1 *0.6=1.86. So the observed m_v is (intrinsic m0) + A_v. So if the observed m_v is 15.5, then the intrinsic m0 is 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But for our purposes, the observed m_v is 15.5, which is what matters for detection. So Star3's m_v is 15.5, which is less than 16. So both spectrographs can see it.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So this is a critical point.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem again, taking into account whether the given apparent magnitude is intrinsic or observed.

Let me approach each star correctly.

For each star:

If the star has an apparent magnitude (m_v) given, that's the observed magnitude, already including any extinction. So no need to adjust it. So for Star3, since m_v is 15.5, that's the observed value. Similarly, Star5's m_v is 15.0 (calculated) because it has no extinction.

But wait, Star1: absolute magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc, no extinction. So m_v=15.5.

Star2: m_v=16.5, which includes any extinction.

Star3: m_v=15.5 (already observed), so no need to adjust.

Star4: absolute mag 15.5, distance 10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4. So we need to calculate m_v.

Star5: absolute mag 16.5, distance 5 pc, E(B-V)=0? Because it's not mentioned.

Wait, for Star4:

M_v=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4.

So m0 (apparent without extinction) = M_v +5 log10(d/10) =15.5 +0=15.5.

Then, m_observed = m0 + A_v =15.5 + (3.1 *0.4)=15.5+1.24=16.74.

So Star4's observed m_v=16.74.

So for Star4, m_v=16.74, which is above 16, so HIRES can't see it.

Star5: M_v=16.5, d=5 pc, E(B-V)=0.

m0= M_v +5 log10(5/10)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5-1.505=14.995≈15.0.

So m_observed=15.0, since no extinction.

So Star5's m_v=15.0.

So now, reviewing each star:

Star1: m_v=15.5 → both can see.

Star2: m_v=16.5 → HIRES can't.

Star3: m_v=15.5 → both can see.

Star4: m_v=16.74 → ESPRESSO can, HIRES can't.

Star5: m_v=15.0 → both can see.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, so which options include any two of these.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4 and5 → only Star5 is good.

Option B:3 and5 → both can be seen by both.

Option C:2 and3 → Star2 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, Star3 can be seen by both.

Option D:1 and4 → Star1 can be seen by both, Star4 can only be seen by ESPRESSO.

So the correct pairs are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Looking at the options, only option B includes both Star3 and Star5, which can be seen by both.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3 had m_v=17.36, but that was under the incorrect assumption that I had to add A_v to the apparent magnitude, which is already observed.

Ah, so the confusion was whether the given apparent magnitude includes extinction or not. If the problem states that the apparent magnitude is 15.5, that's the observed value, so any extinction is already accounted for. So in that case, Star3's m_v=15.5, so both can see.

So the correct stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But the options are looking for which pair? So the options that have both stars that can be detected by both.

Looking again at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5. Both can be detected by both. So option B is correct.

Wait, but I thought Star3's given m_v is 15.5, so both can detect. Star5's m_v is 15.0, so both can detect.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but let me check again:

Star3's m_v is 15.5 → both can see.

Star5's m_v is 15.0 → both can see.

So that makes option B correct.

But wait, the options in the problem statement:

Option B: Star3 and Star5.

Yes, that fits.

So the answer should be option B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering the detection limits of the spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m_v < 17$), while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m_v < 16$). A star must satisfy both conditions to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M_v = 15.5$  
   - Distance: $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$  
   - Since the star is at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude is the same as its absolute magnitude: $m_v = 15.5$.  
   - No extinction is mentioned, so $E(B-V) = 0$.  
   - **Conclusion**: $m_v = 15.5 < 16$ and $m_v < 17$, so Star1 can be detected by both spectrographs.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m_v = 16.5$  
   - Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0$ (not mentioned, so assumed).  
   - **Conclusion**: $m_v = 16.5 > 16$, so Star2 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m_v = 15.5$  
   - Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.6$  
   - The problem specifies that the apparent magnitude already includes extinction, so no further adjustment is needed.  
   - **Conclusion**: $m_v = 15.5 < 16$ and $m_v < 17$, so Star3 can be detected by both spectrographs.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M_v = 15.5$  
   - Distance: $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$  
   - Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.4$  
   - The apparent magnitude without extinction is $m_0 = M_v = 15.5$ (since $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$).  
   - Extinction in the V band: $A_v = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24$.  
   - Observed apparent magnitude: $m_v = m_0 + A_v = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74$.  
   - **Conclusion**: $m_v = 16.74 > 16$, so Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M_v = 16.5$  
   - Distance: $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$  
   - Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0$ (not mentioned, so assumed).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_v = M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5 / 10) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - **Conclusion**: $m_v = 15.0 < 16$ and $m_v < 17$, so Star5 can be detected by both spectrographs.

### Final Results:
- **Star1**: Detectable by both spectrographs.  
- **Star2**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.  
- **Star3**: Detectable by both spectrographs.  
- **Star4**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.  
- **Star5**: Detectable by both spectrographs.  

### Correct Option:
The stars that can be detected by both spectrographs are **Star3 and Star5**. This corresponds to **Option B**.

ANSWER: B
