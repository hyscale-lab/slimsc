Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for the spin component along a direction n (which is a unit vector) is given by the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices. So, P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z), multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, no—the operator is actually (n · σ) multiplied by ħ/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So each component of P is (n · σ) * ħ/2.

Wait, but the problem gives each component P_x, P_y, P_z as (ħ/2) times a matrix. So let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the general operator for the spin along an arbitrary direction n is:

P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z

But wait, since the direction n is in the x-z plane, that means the y-component of n is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So substituting into P, we get:

P = n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + 0 + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So combining these, P becomes:

(ħ/2) [ n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Which simplifies to:

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Wait, let me check that. The first term is n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]], so it's [[0*n_x, 1*n_x], [1*n_x, 0*n_x]] = [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]. The second term is n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]. Adding these together:

Top-left: 0 + n_z = n_z
Top-right: n_x +0 = n_x
Bottom-left: n_x + 0 = n_x
Bottom-right: 0 + (-n_z) = -n_z

So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]], multiplied by ħ/2.

Now, the operator P has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 because for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvalues of the spin component along any direction are ±ħ/2. So the eigenvalue given here is +ħ/2.

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Let's write the matrix for P:

P = (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can ignore the (ħ/2) factor on both sides, so we get:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Which becomes the system of equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Wait, no: the equation is:

(n_z a + n_x b) = a
(n_x a - n_z b) = b

So rearranging the first equation:

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 → equation (1)

Second equation:

n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0 → equation (2)

So we have two equations:

(1) (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

(2) n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

We can treat this as a homogeneous system. For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Alternatively, since it's a 2x2 system, we can write it as:

[ (n_z - 1)   n_x       ] [a]   = 0
[ n_x       ( - (n_z +1) ) ] [b]

The determinant is (n_z -1)(- (n_z +1)) - (n_x)^2 = 0

So:

- (n_z² -1) - n_x² =0

But since n is a unit vector in x-z plane: n_x² + n_z² =1

So substituting n_x² =1 -n_z² into the determinant equation:

- (n_z² -1) - (1 - n_z²) =0

Expanding:

- n_z² +1 -1 +n_z² =0 → 0=0.

So the equations are consistent, and we can proceed.

Let me take equation (1):

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 → Let's express a in terms of b.

(n_z -1) a = - n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] * b

Wait, but if (n_z -1) is zero, that is, if n_z=1, this would be a problem. Let's think about whether n_z can be 1.

If n_z=1, then n_x=0, because n_x² +n_z² =1 → n_x=0. So in that case, the direction is along +z.

But in this problem, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so we'll proceed under the assumption that n_z ≠1 and n_x is not zero. So, for the general case, a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] * b.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the ratio a/b as a variable.

Let me let b =1, then a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ]

But perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvector by another approach. Another way is to note that for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates of S·n are the states with spin up and down along n.

The eigenstates can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere. The general form is:

|ψ> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓>

But since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal angle) is zero. Because in the x-z plane, the angle around the y-axis is zero. So φ=0, and the state becomes:

|ψ> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>

Wait, but wait. Let me think: the direction n is in the x-z plane, which implies that it's in the equatorial plane of the z-axis, so φ is either 0 or π, depending on the x component's sign. But since we don't know the direction, perhaps the general form is cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓> multiplied by some phase. Alternatively, another approach is to parametrize the eigenvector in terms of spherical coordinates.

Alternatively, let's think about the components. Let's suppose that the eigenvector is [a; b], so:

a = cos(θ/2)
b = sin(θ/2)

But wait, that's one possibility, but perhaps in the x-z plane, the angle is measured differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the direction of the vector. For a direction in x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So, for example, if n is along +z, θ=0, and the state is [1; 0]. If it's along +x, θ=90 degrees, so the state is (|↑> + |↓>)/√2, which becomes [1;1]/√2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to approach it systematically.

The operator P is (n · σ) * ħ/2. The eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down along the direction n. The eigenstates can be written as:

|+n> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓>
|−n> = sin(θ/2) |↑> - e^{iφ} cos(θ/2) |↓>

Wait, I think that's correct. The angles θ and φ are the spherical coordinates of the direction n. Since n lies in the x-z plane, the angle φ is zero. So, φ=0, and the states become:

|+n> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>
|−n> = sin(θ/2) |↑> - cos(θ/2) |↓>

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait. The eigenvalues of P should be ±ħ/2, right? So when we have P |+n> = (ħ/2) |+n>, this is correct.

So the eigenvector components are a= cos(θ/2), b= sin(θ/2). But we also need to normalize this vector. Let's check:

The norm is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cos²(θ/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1. So it's already normalized.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I just found. But wait, looking at the options, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Hmm, but wait, in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane. So the state becomes [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C says that. So the answer should be C.

But wait, let me look at all the options again.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar) — Hmm, but these have hbar in them. Wait, but the eigenvector is a state vector, so the components should be dimensionless. So that can't be correct.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) — Wait, that's a possibility, but in our case, phi is zero, so it would be (cos(theta), sin(theta)), which doesn't match our (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) — yes, this matches.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)) — Again, including hbar, which shouldn't be there. Also, the sqrt factors don't match what we have, which is normalized.

Wait, but wait another thing. The operator in the problem is for spin 1/2, so the eigenstates are correctly expressed as I said. So the correct option is C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is constructed from its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the y-component of $\vec{n}$ is zero, and $\vec{n}$ can be represented as $(n_x, 0, n_z)$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.

The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is expressed as:

\[
P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
P | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]

where $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $P$ into the eigenvalue equation and solving the resulting system of equations yields the eigenvector components:

\[
a = \cos(\theta/2), \quad b = \sin(\theta/2),
\]

where $\theta$ is the polar angle of the direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The eigenvector is already normalized, as $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = \cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Contains $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Represents a general spherical coordinate form but includes $\phi$, which is zero for directions in the x-z plane. This does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector components $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
- **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ and incorrect normalization factors, making it invalid.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
