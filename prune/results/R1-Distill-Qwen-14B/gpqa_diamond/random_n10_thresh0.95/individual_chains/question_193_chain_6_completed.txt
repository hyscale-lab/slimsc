Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over the parallax to the fifth power. So mathematically, I think that means the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Parallax usually is measured in parsecs, and I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Or wait, no, plx is in arcseconds, and the distance in parsecs is the reciprocal. So plx (in arcsec) = 1/d (in parsecs). So d = 1/plx.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So they're probably asking about the number of stars per unit volume or something like that. But wait, the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, perhaps I can express everything in terms of distance.

Let me try to substitute plx in terms of distance. So plx = 1/d, right? So 1/plx would be d. So, 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. That would make the number of stars proportional to d^5. But wait, that seems a bit odd because usually, the number of stars in a region might depend on the volume, which is d^3.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The number of stars per unit volume would be related to the density. But the question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So if parallax is inversely proportional to distance, then plx = 1/d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, if N is the number in a region, perhaps it's the number per unit distance? Or per some volume.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about how the number of stars relates to distance when you're considering a volume. Because when you look at a region of the sky, the number of stars you see at a certain distance depends on how many there are along that line of sight. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

So let's recap. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But plx is 1/d, so 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So it's the number per unit distance. Let me think about that. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance would be d^5 per d, which would be d^4. Because if you have d^5 stars up to distance d, then the number from d to d+Δd would be roughly 5d^4 * Δd. So the number per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but let me think about it more carefully. If N is the number of stars in a shell between d and d+Δd, then the total number would be the integral from 0 to d of N(d') dd', but maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to N(d) * 4π d² dr. But wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, the given relation is N varies as 1/plx^5. So N = k / plx^5, where k is a constant. And since plx = 1/d, then N = k d^5. So the number of stars is proportional to d^5.

But the question is asking how the number changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So perhaps they are asking for dN/dr, the derivative. Since N = k d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the number of stars in a region that is at a specific distance (like a thin shell) is what we're considering. Because the total number would integrate all stars up to that distance, but this question might be about the number at a specific distance.

Wait, no, the problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So that's a direct proportionality. So when plx increases (i.e., when the stars are farther away), the number of stars N decreases as plx^5. But plx is inversely proportional to distance, so when d increases, plx decreases, so 1/plx^5 increases, so N increases as d^5.

So for a given region, like a small slice of the sky, the number of stars at a distance d would be proportional to d^5. Therefore, the number per unit distance would be d^5 per distance unit. Wait, but maybe it's d^5 per unit distance? Or is it per unit volume?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up between number per unit volume and number per unit distance. Let's think about it. If you're looking at a region of the sky, and you consider a thin shell at distance d with a thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell would depend on the area of the shell's surface and the volume. Wait, no, the number of stars in the shell would be the number density multiplied by the volume of the shell. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach because the problem gives a relation in terms of parallax without considering the volume.

Alternatively, perhaps the relation N ∝ 1/plx^5 implies that for each unit of parallax, the number of stars changes in a certain way. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, higher parallax means closer stars, lower parallax means farther stars.

Wait, let me approach this differently. Let's consider the number of stars as a function of distance. Given that N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and since plx is 1/d, then N = k * d^5.

So N(d) = k d^5. Now, the change in the number of stars with distance would be the derivative dN/dr, which is 5k d^4. So the number of stars increases with the fourth power of distance per unit distance. So per unit distance, the number of stars increases as d^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4, which would match this. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the number of stars in a volume would go as r^3, but perhaps that's a different scenario. Maybe in this question, the number of stars isn't dependent on the volume but just on the distance in a different way.

So to sum up, N is proportional to d^5, so the rate of change of N with respect to d is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (or the change in N per unit distance) is proportional to r^4. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we can express \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto d^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance. Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto d^4 \). This indicates that the number of stars per unit distance increases as the fourth power of distance.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
