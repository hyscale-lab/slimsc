Okay, let's see. I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. So the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So, the operator P is probably the vector operator, meaning P = P_x i + P_y j + P_z k, right? And when it's along direction n, the operator would be P · n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. 

Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane implies that the angle φ is zero, so the direction is along θ from the z-axis. Wait, no, maybe. Wait, the x-z plane is the plane where y=0. So, when you represent a direction in the x-z plane, its components in spherical coordinates would have zero y-component. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ * cosφ, 0, sinθ * sinφ)? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. 

No, wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction vector is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But if the direction is in the x-z plane, then φ must be zero or 180 degrees, right? Because in the x-z plane, the angle around the y-axis (φ) is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because when φ=0, cosφ=1, sinφ=0. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Or wait, no, if the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle φ is 0 or π, but the general case for an arbitrary direction in x-z would have φ=0. So, n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because θ is measured from the z-axis, I think.

But wait, the question says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so n could be any direction in that plane, which would have components (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² = 1, and n_x and n_z real.

So, the operator P is along direction n, so P = n · σ, where σ is the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2, perhaps? Wait, but each component is given as (ħ/2) times a matrix. So P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix, and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator for P along n would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So substituting the given matrices:

P = n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which combines to:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, let me compute that:

P = (ħ/2) [n_z * I_x + n_x * I_y + n_z * I_z? No, wait, no, I_x is the Pauli X matrix. So when you have n_x and n_z, the matrix becomes:

(n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]) for P_z part, plus (n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]]) for P_x part. So the combined matrix is:

[[n_z*(1) + 0, n_x*(1) + 0],
 [n_x*(1) + 0, n_z*(-1) + 0]]

Wait, no. Let me write it properly. The P_z matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]], multiplied by n_z and ħ/2. The P_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], multiplied by n_x and ħ/2. So adding them together gives:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because:

For the (1,1) element: n_z*(1) + n_x*(0) = n_z.
(1,2): n_z*(0) + n_x*(1) = n_x.
(2,1): same as (1,2) because the matrices are symmetric, so n_x.
(2,2): n_z*(-1) + n_x*(0) = -n_z.

So P is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

Now, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we need to find the eigenvector |v> such that P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So we can write the eigenvalue equation:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Dividing both sides by (ħ/2), we get:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * |v> = |v>

So the matrix equation is:

| [n_z*v1 + n_x*v2, n_x*v1 - n_z*v2 ] |   = |v1|
| [v1, v2] |                            |v2|

Which leads to two equations:

n_z v1 + n_x v2 = v1   --> (n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0

n_x v1 - n_z v2 = v2   --> n_x v1 + ( -n_z -1 ) v2 = 0

So the system is:

( (n_z - 1) ) v1 + n_x v2 = 0
n_x v1 + ( -n_z - 1 ) v2 = 0

This is a homogeneous system, so we can write the determinant condition for non-trivial solutions.

But wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are the trace over 2 and determinant, etc. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvectors.

Alternatively, since the eigenvalue is +1 (after dividing by ħ/2), the matrix [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] has eigenvalue 1. So let's find the eigenvectors for this matrix.

The matrix is:

A = [ [n_z, n_x],
       [n_x, -n_z] ]

We can write the eigenvalue equation (A - λ I) |v> = 0.

So (A - I) |v> = 0, since λ=1.

A - I = [ [n_z - 1, n_x],
          [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

The determinant should be zero for non-trivial solutions.

The determinant of (A - I) is (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2.

Which is (-n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1) ) - n_x^2.

Wait, expanding: (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = -(n_z)(n_z +1) + 1*(n_z +1) = -n_z² -n_z + n_z +1 = -n_z² + 1.

So determinant is (-n_z² +1) -n_x^2 = (1 - n_z^2 -n_x^2 )

But n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 because n is a unit vector. So 1 - n_z^2 -n_x^2 = 0. So the determinant is zero, as expected for an eigenvector.

So the equations are:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 =0
n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 =0

Let's take the first equation: (n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 =0.

We can express v2 in terms of v1.

v2 = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] v1.

But wait, n_x is sqrt(1 -n_z^2)? Because n_x² +n_z²=1, so n_x = sqrt(1 -n_z²). But n_x can be positive or negative, but direction is in x-z, so perhaps we can take it as positive for simplicity. Or maybe the sign doesn't matter.

So, let me set v1 = something, say, v1 = a. Then v2 = [ (1 -n_z)/n_x ] a.

But perhaps it's easier to parameterize the eigenvector. Let's let v1 =1 for simplicity, then v2 = (1 -n_z)/n_x.

Wait no, because when n_x is zero, that would be a problem, but in our case, n is in x-z, so n_x can't be zero unless it's along z. Hmm, but we'll have to consider that.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to represent the eigenvector in terms of angles. Since n is in the x-z plane, n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting into the equation for v2: v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1.

So the eigenvector is [v1, v2] = [v1, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ * v1 ].

We can factor out v1 and write the vector as:

v1 * [1, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ]

Simplify (1 - cosθ)/sinθ: using the identity (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = tan(θ/2).

So the vector becomes [1, tan(θ/2)].

To make it a unit vector, we need to normalize.

The components are [1, tan(θ/2)], so the magnitude squared is 1 + tan²(θ/2) = sec²(θ/2). So the magnitude is sec(θ/2), and the normalized vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, because 1/sqrt(1 + tan² x ) is cos x. Let me see: 1 + tan²x = sec²x, so sqrt(1 + tan²x) = sec x. So 1/[sqrt(1 + tan²x)] = cos x. So the normalized vector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait, the components are in terms of θ, which is the angle of the direction vector from the z-axis. So in terms of the direction n, which is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly this. So option C is a possibility.

But wait, the question says "the normalized eigenvector". So option C is just that.

But wait, are there any phases involved? Because eigenvectors can have a phase factor. The options include things like e^{i phi}.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Hmm, but in our derivation, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But wait, let's think about the matrix again. Let me recast the problem.

Wait, I'm considering P along direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The operator P is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier when considering the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0 1],[1 0]], σ_y = [[0 -i],[i 0]], σ_z = [[1 0],[0 -1]]. So P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, P_y (ħ/2)σ_y, P_z (ħ/2)σ_z.

So the operator P along n is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z).

But since n is in x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

So the matrix becomes (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

So the eigenvalue equation is (P) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So, when I set up the equation, I considered (A - I) |v> =0, where A is the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

Wait, but no, if the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, then (P - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0.

So, the matrix would be (ħ/2)(n_z σ_z + n_x σ_x) - (ħ/2) I.

Which is (ħ/2) (n_z σ_z + n_x σ_x - I).

So the
