Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that look like those caused by an exoplanet transit. The question is asking, to produce the same amplitude in the light curve, what would be the radius of a planet relative to the star?

Hmm. I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets measures the dip in brightness as the planet passes in front of the star. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So, the formula I think is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because area scales with the square of radius.

But wait, the problem says that the star actually has these spots, so the observed brightness variation is different. Let me think again. The spots are darker, so when they're facing us (like during transit), the star appears dimmer than when they're not. But in reality, the spots are part of the star's surface, so how does that affect the overall brightness variation?

Let me outline what I know:

- Star's Teff: 6000 K.
- Spots are cooler: Teff of spots is 5000 K (since 6000 - 1000 = 5000).
- Filling factor for spots: 20% of one hemisphere.
- So, the spots cover 0.2 * (surface area of a hemisphere) of the star.

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR², so 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But if the spots are on one hemisphere only, does their visibility change with rotation?

When the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. So when the spots are facing us, their cooler temperature contributes less to the total light, causing a dip. But the amplitude of this dip is what's observed, and we're to compare it to the dip caused by a planet transit.

Wait, but the star's brightness without spots would be as a uniform sphere at 6000 K. When spots are present, the observed flux when the spots are visible is less than when they're not. So the variation in brightness (the amplitude) is due to the spots covering a certain fraction of the star's surface as seen from Earth.

But wait, because the spots are cooler, when they are in view, the total light we receive is less than when they're not. So the brightness variation is not just about the area but also the temperature difference.

So to model this, perhaps the flux from the star with spots is F_total = F_star + F_spots. But wait, actually, the spots are part of the star's surface. So when the spots are facing us, their contribution to the total flux is less because they're cooler.

The flux from the star without spots is F0 = 4πR² * sigma * Teff^4. But when spots are present, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - f) * (Teff^4 / T_spot^4) + F0 * f * (T_spot^4 / T_spot^4) )? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the flux when the spots are visible and when they aren't.

The total flux when the spots are visible would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the flux from the spotted regions.

Let me think again. The star's surface without spots emits at Teff = 6000 K. The spots have a temperature of 5000 K. The filling factor is f = 0.2, but only on one hemisphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the area of spots is f * (area of hemisphere) = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². The rest of the hemisphere (80% of it) is normal, and the other hemisphere is all normal.

Wait, so when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux from that side is (1 - f) * (Teff^4) * area + f * (T_spot^4) * area. The other hemisphere contributes (Teff^4) * its area.

Wait, but the area of the hemisphere is 2πR². So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the total flux would be:

Flux = [ (1 - f) * (Teff^4) + f * (T_spot^4) ] * 2πR² / 4πR² + [ (Teff^4) * 2πR² ] / (4πR² )

Wait, wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the average flux.

Wait, the star's total flux without spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (4πR²) / (4πD²) ), but perhaps the D (distance) cancels out when considering relative changes, so maybe I can ignore it for the purpose of calculating the amplitude.

When the star is fully unspotted, the flux is F0 = 4πR² σ Teff^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F = (flux from unspotted parts of the spotty hemisphere) + (flux from the other hemisphere, which is entirely unspotted) + (flux from the spotted parts of the spotty hemisphere).

Wait, no—when the spotty hemisphere is facing us (so the other hemisphere is not visible), the flux is:

Flux = [ (1 - f) * (Teff^4) + f * (T_spot^4) ] * (area of one hemisphere) / (4πR²) * 4πR² σ.

Because the area of the hemisphere is 2πR².

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the difference in flux between when the spotty hemisphere is visible and when it's not.

So, the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum flux is when the spotty hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, no. When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is less than when the other (unspotted) hemisphere is visible.

So, the variation in flux is (F_max - F_min)/F_max, which is the relative change in brightness.

Wait, but in the case of a planet transit, the flux drops because the planet blocks some light. The amplitude is (F0 - F_transit)/F0 = (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the planet blocks a fraction (Rp/Rstar)^2 of the star's light.

In this problem, when the star's spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotty = (unspotted part of hemisphere * Teff^4 + spotted part * T_spot^4) / (total area).

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the average flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible versus when it's not.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible:

The area of the spotty hemisphere is 2πR². Of that, f (20%) is covered by spots, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR² is spots, and 1.6πR² is unspotted.

The other hemisphere (2πR²) is completely unspotted, so emits at Teff.

So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us:

F1 = (flux from spotty hemisphere) + (flux from the other hemisphere).

Flux from spotty hemisphere: (1.6πR²) * sigma Teff^4 + (0.4πR²) * sigma (T_spot)^4.

Flux from other hemisphere: 2πR² * sigma Teff^4.

Total F1 = [1.6π R² sigma Teff^4 + 0.4π R² sigma (5000)^4 ] + [ 2π R² sigma Teff^4 ]

= (1.6 + 2) π R² sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma (5000)^4

= 3.6 π R² sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma (5000)^4

When the spotty hemisphere is not visible (the other hemisphere is facing us), flux is F0, which is:

F0 = 4π R² sigma Teff^4.

So the variation in flux when the spots are visible is F1 - F0.

Wait, no: when the star is rotating, during the time when the spotty hemisphere is visible (assuming the other hemisphere is the non-spotty one), the flux is F1. When the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F0. So the change in flux is F1 - F0, and the amplitude would be (F0 - F1) / F0, which is the fractional dip.

Wait, but let me compute F1:

F1 = (1.6 + 2) * π R² sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma (5000)^4.

= 3.6 π R² sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma (5e3)^4.

F0 = 4 π R² sigma Teff^4.

So the difference F0 - F1 is:

4π R² sigma Teff^4 - [3.6 π R² sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma (5e3)^4 ]

= (4π - 3.6π) sigma Teff^4 R² - 0.4 π sigma (5e3)^4 R²

= 0.4 π sigma Teff^4 R² - 0.4 π sigma (5e3)^4 R²

= 0.4 pi sigma R² [ Teff^4 - (5e3)^4 ]

So the fractional change is (F0 - F1)/F0 = [0.4 pi sigma R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / (4 pi sigma R^2 Teff^4 )

Simplify: 0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / (4 Teff^4 )

= (0.4/4) * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 )

= 0.1 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

So (5/6)^4 is (625/1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.051775, or about 5.1775% dip.

Wait, but this is the maximum dip. Because when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F1, which is less than F0. So the dip is (F0 - F1)/F0 ≈ 5.18%.

Wait, but wait, in reality, when the star is rotating, the dip would vary as the spots come into view and go out of view. The amplitude of this dip would be the maximum variation. But when the star isn't spotted, the same amplitude would be caused by a planet transit, which blocks a certain area.

So the dip due to the planet would be (Rp/Rstar)^2.

We have the dip due to the spots as approximately 5.18%. So to get the same dip, the planet's area would be 5.18% of the star's area.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the dip due to the spots is the difference between F0 and F1, which we've computed as approximately 5.18% of F0. So if a planet causes the same dip, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518.

Taking square root: Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276, which is around 0.228. But looking at the options, the closest is option A: ~0.39, D: ~0.32, etc. Wait, none of the options are close to 0.23. That suggests I might have made an error in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back step by step.

Wait, let's recalculate the fractional dip more accurately.

F0 is when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible: the entire star emits as if all areas are at Teff. So F0 = 4π R² sigma Teff^4.

F1 is when the spotty hemisphere is visible. So the flux is:

F1 = (unspotted part of spotty hemisphere) * sigma Teff^4 + (spotted part) * sigma T_spot^4 + (other hemisphere) * sigma Teff^4.

Wait, no. When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the part we see is the spotty hemisphere and the opposite hemisphere is not visible. Wait, no. Wait, no. The star is a sphere, so when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, that's the part we see. The other hemisphere is on the back side and not visible. So how is the other hemisphere's contribution?

Wait, perhaps I got it wrong earlier. If the spotty hemisphere is the one facing us, then the other hemisphere is not visible. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is from that hemisphere only. But that can't be, because the star is a sphere, and only one hemisphere is visible at any time.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. When the star is viewed from Earth, we can see only one hemisphere at a time. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux comes from that hemisphere. The other hemisphere is on the far side and not visible.

So when the star's spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F1 = [ (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * T_spot^4 ] * (area of hemisphere) / (area of star) * total flux.

Wait, the area of the hemisphere is 2πR², and the total area is 4πR², so the fraction is 1/2. But the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F1 = [ (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * T_spot^4 ] * (2πR²) * sigma.

The flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible (i.e., the other side is facing us) is:

F0 = [ Teff^4 ] * (2πR²) * sigma.

So the variation is (F0 - F1) / F0.

Compute F0 and F1:

F0 = 2π R² sigma Teff^4.

F1 = ( (1-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) * 2π R² sigma.

So the change in flux is F0 - F1 = 2π R² sigma [ Teff^4 - ( (1-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) ].

Factor out Teff^4:

= 2π R² sigma Teff^4 [ 1 - (1 - f) - f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ].

Simplify inside the brackets:

= 1 - (1-f) = f.

So,

= 2π R² sigma Teff^4 [ f - f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

= 2π R² sigma Teff^4 f [ 1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ]

So the fractional change is (F0 - F1) / F0 = [ 2π R² sigma Teff^4 f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) ] / [ 2π R² sigma Teff^4 ]

Simplify: f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

So the fractional dip is f * [1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) ]

Plugging in the numbers:

f = 0.2.

T_spot = 5000 K.

Teff = 6000 K.

Compute T_spot^4 / Teff^4 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4.

Let me compute 0.8333^4:

0.8333^2 ≈ 0.6944.

Then, 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by f=0.2: 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.10354, or about 10.35%.

Wait, that's a bigger dip than before. So the amplitude is approx 10.35% of the star's flux.

But wait, earlier I thought it was about 5%, but this approach gives about 10%.

Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier in considering the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible. So the correct fractional dip is 10.35%?

Wait, but let me make sure. So the dip is 10.35% of the star's flux.

So if the planet were to cause the same dip, (Rp/Rstar)^2 would be 0.1035. Taking square root gives Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because in the problem statement, the star has spots on one hemisphere, and the other is clean. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F1. When the clean hemisphere is visible, the flux is F0.

So the dip is (F0 - F1)/F0 = 0.1035, or 10.35%.

So the planet would need to block an area such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035, giving Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.32.

Looking at the options, D is 0.32, which matches this.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

The star has an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and the spots have a temperature \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \). The filling factor of the spots is \( f = 0.2 \), meaning 20% of one hemisphere is covered by spots. The brightness variation arises due to the temperature difference between the spotted and unspotted regions.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the total flux is reduced compared to when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The flux from the spotty hemisphere is calculated as:

\[
F_1 = \left[ (1 - f) T_{\text{eff}}^4 + f T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right] \cdot \frac{\text{Area of hemisphere}}{\text{Total area of star}} \cdot 4 \pi R^2 \sigma
\]

The flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is:

\[
F_0 = T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot \frac{\text{Area of hemisphere}}{\text{Total area of star}} \cdot 4 \pi R^2 \sigma
\]

The fractional dip in brightness when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

\[
\frac{F_0 - F_1}{F_0} = f \cdot \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right]
\]

Substituting the values \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823
\]

\[
\frac{F_0 - F_1}{F_0} = 0.2 \cdot \left[ 1 - 0.4823 \right] = 0.2 \cdot 0.5177 \approx 0.1035
\]

This corresponds to a fractional dip of approximately \( 10.35\% \). For a planet to produce the same dip, the area blocked by the planet must satisfy:

\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.32
\]

Thus, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \). Comparing this to the options provided, the closest match is:
