Okay, so I've got this question about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of a mass m attached to a spring with maximum amplitude A. The system is relativistic, so I guess I can't use the classical equations directly.

Wait, in the classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(k A²/m). But since it's relativistic, I remember that when velocities approach the speed of light c, the relativistic effects become significant. So the classical formula might not hold anymore.

I think in the relativistic case, the energy can't exceed the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. The total energy E for the oscillator is the sum of the rest mass energy and the oscillatory energy. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA²? Wait, no, wait. Oh, right, in classical mechanics, the potential energy is (1/2)kx² and the kinetic is (1/2)mv². But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. It's more complicated because of the gamma factor.

Oh wait, the relativistic energy for a particle is given by E = gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if the oscillator is moving, its energy isn't just classical. But in this case, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Or is that the case in the relativistic scenario as well?

Wait, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement. So the total energy would be E = (1/2)kA² in the classical case. But in relativity, the energy is higher because of the gamma factor. So E_total = gamma mc², and at the maximum amplitude, the energy is (1/2)kA². So perhaps the maximum kinetic energy plus rest mass energy equals the total energy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. For a relativistic oscillator, when the mass is at the maximum displacement (x=A), all energy is potential. When it passes through the equilibrium point, all energy is kinetic. So the maximum kinetic energy should equal the potential energy at x=A. So maybe (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc². Because the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc², since the total energy is gamma mc², and the rest is rest energy.

So set (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc². Then, the maximum speed would be when kinetic energy is maximum, so gamma would be a function of v.

Let me write that equation: (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Rearranging, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, say, let's call it beta for a moment. Wait, maybe not. Let me see:

Let me let (k A²)/(2 m c²) = alpha. Then gamma = 1 + alpha.

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Then v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2].

So v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2).

Substituting alpha back:

alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²), so v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² ).

Hmm, that expression. Let me look at the options.

Option D is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²))² ), which matches what I derived.

Wait, no. Wait, looking at the options:

Option D: v_max = c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²))² )

Yes, that's exactly the same as what I have.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Another approach: in the non-relativistic limit, when kA²/(2 m c²) is much less than 1, then alpha is small, so (1 + alpha)^2 ≈ 1 + 2 alpha. Then, 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 alpha. So 1 - 1/(1+alpha)^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - 2 alpha) = 2 alpha.

So v ≈ c * sqrt(2 alpha) = c * sqrt(2 (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ) = c * sqrt( (k A²) / (m c²) ) ) = sqrt( k A²/(m) ) * (c) / c )? Wait, that doesn't seem to make sense. Wait, let's compute it correctly:

sqrt( (k A²)/(2 m c²) * 2 )) ?

Wait, perhaps I should do the expansion properly. Let me expand 1/(1 + alpha)^2 using a Taylor series for small alpha. 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 alpha + 3 alpha² - ... So:

v²/c² = 1 - [1 - 2 alpha + 3 alpha² - ... ] = 2 alpha - 3 alpha² + ... 

Which for small alpha is approximately 2 alpha. So v ≈ sqrt(2 alpha) c.

Substituting alpha: (k A²)/(2 m c²) * 2 is (k A²)/(m c²) * 1/2 * 2 = (k A²)/(m c²) * 1. So 2 alpha is (k A²)/(m c²) * 2 * (1/(2 m c²)) )?

Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Let me compute 2 alpha: alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so 2 alpha is (k A²)/(m c²). Then, v ≈ c * sqrt( (k A²)/(m c²) ) ) = sqrt( (k A²)/(m) ) * c/c = sqrt( k A² / m ). So in the non-relativistic limit, it reduces to the classical result, which is option C. So that would make sense. So option D would give the correct non-relativistic limit.

Looking back at the options, option C is sqrt(k A²/m), which is correct for non-relativistic, but option D seems to be the correct relativistic formula.

Let me check the other options just in case.

Option A: It's c multiplied by sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m))^2 ). Wait, the denominator looks off. The denominator inside the square root is 1 - (k A²)/(2 m), but in our derivation, it's 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²), so that's different.

Option B: The denominator is (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)), but inside the square root, it's 1 + 1/(denominator). Hmm, not similar to our result.

Option D matches our derivation, so I think D is the correct answer.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we must account for relativistic effects. In the relativistic regime, the total energy of the oscillator is given by the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy. At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), all energy is potential energy, and at the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic energy.

The potential energy at maximum amplitude is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the potential energy to the kinetic energy:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. To confirm, we check the non-relativistic limit (\( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \ll 1 \)). Expanding \( \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2} \) using a Taylor series for small \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find that \( v_{\text{max}} \) reduces to the classical result \( \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \), which is consistent with option C. However, the full relativistic expression is given by option D.

Analyzing the other options:

- **Option A**: The denominator inside the square root is \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m} \), which is dimensionally inconsistent and does not match the correct relativistic derivation.
- **Option B**: The denominator inside the square root is \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), which is incorrect as it does not match the derived expression.
- **Option C**: This is the classical result, valid only in the non-relativistic limit.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
