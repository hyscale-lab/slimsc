Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. 

Wait, wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. So it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution, right? Because the complex is Ca-EDTA, which is Ca combined with EDTA.

So, the formation constant, K, is for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the complex. The K value is very large (5e10), which means the reaction strongly favors the formation of the complex. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be very low because most of the Ca is tied up in the complex.

The solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me think about how to model this. The complex is CaY^2- if I'm not mistaken, where Y is the EDTA. Because EDTA has a charge of -4, and Ca²+ combines with it to make a complex with charge 0 or maybe -2? Wait, the formula for the complex would be Ca(EDTA)^2-. So the formula is CaY^2−.

So, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in solution. But because K is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ is going to be very small compared to the concentration of the complex.

Let me write the equilibrium equation. The formation of the complex is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA^2−

The formation constant K = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M of the complex. So, initially, I can assume that the concentration of CaEDTA^2− is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are both x. Because the stoichiometry is 1:1.

So, the expression becomes K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

Wait, no. Wait, the reaction is 1:1, so the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. So, each mole of complex dissociates into one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−. So, the concentrations are:

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x
[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x

But since K is so large, the dissociation x will be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, substituting into K:

K ≈ (0.02) / (x^2) = 5e10.

Solving for x:

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10)
x^2 = 2e-3 /5e10 → wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

x^2 = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/(5e12)) ) → because 2e-2 is 2 *1e-2, and 5e10 is 5*1e10. So, 2/(5e12) = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me compute that.

Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, because (1e-6.5)^2 is 1e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. Which is 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 1e-6 * 1e-0.5. 1e-0.5 is approximately 0.316. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the math.

x^2 = (0.02) / (5e10) = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Taking the square root of 4e-13 gives x= 2e-6.5, which is 6.32e-7 M. Rounded to one decimal, 6.3e-7, which matches option C.

So the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer is C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\), and assuming that the dissociation is minimal (due to the large \(K\)), we approximate \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Let \(x\) represent the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \approx \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
