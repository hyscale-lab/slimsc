Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant, which I think is the stability constant, tells us how stable the complex is. A high K value means it's very stable.

Wait, the formation constant (Kf) is given as 5x10^10. I think Kf is for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA form the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- with Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But in this problem, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M. So, initially, I think the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. However, I also need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in the solution.

Oh right, because EDTA forms a complex with Ca²+, but not all of the EDTA is necessarily bound. Wait, no, wait. Actually, if the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, then the total concentration of Ca²+ ions would be much lower because most of the Ca is tied up in the complex.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem states it's 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I think that the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M. But we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+.

So, the formation constant equation is Kf = [complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in a solution, the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA bound to Ca²+. If the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Let's call this 'C'.

So, assuming that the initial concentration of EDTA is high enough, the free EDTA (Y^4-) is much less than the complex concentration. But wait, I'm not sure. Another approach is to write the expression in terms of the formation constant.

So, Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But I don't know either [Ca²+] or [EDTA^4-]. Hmm. But maybe we can make some assumptions here. Since Kf is very large (5e10), the reaction favors the formation of the complex. That would mean that most of the Ca²+ is in the complex form, and the free [Ca²+] is very low.

So, assuming that the concentration of free Ca²+ is much less than the concentration of the complex. Let me think about the total concentration. The total calcium comes from the complex and the free ions. But since Kf is so large, [Ca²+] is much smaller than [CaEDTA^2-], so we can approximate [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.

Wait, but that's just the concentration of the complex. So, I think the initial assumption is that [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

Then, we can rearrange the formation constant expression:

[Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-] / (Kf * [EDTA^4-] )

But wait, I don't know [EDTA^4-]. Hmm. Is there another way?

Wait, another approach. The total concentration of EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = some value. But I don't know the initial concentration of EDTA added. Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, so does that mean that all the EDTA is in the complex form, or that the solution was made by adding the complex? Hmm. I think the problem states that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

But in that case, the EDTA is mostly bound to Ca²+ because Kf is so large. So, the free EDTA concentration would be very small. Hmm, but I still don't have enough info. Wait, perhaps I can make an assumption that [Ca²+] is negligible compared to [CaEDTA^2-], so [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.

Then, considering that the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. Wait, perhaps the total EDTA is approximately the same as the complex concentration because the [Ca²+] is so low.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think about the EDTA. If the complex is 0.02 M, then the amount of EDTA in the complex is 0.02 M. But what about the free EDTA? If the Kf is very large, the free EDTA is negligible compared to the EDTA in the complex. So, approximately, [EDTA^4-] is much smaller than [CaEDTA^2-], so [EDTA^4-] ≈ 0.02 M? No, wait, that's not right. Because if all EDTA is in the complex, then [EDTA^4-] would be zero. But that's not the case, because some dissociates.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again.

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) 

We can rearrange this to [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-] / (Kf * [EDTA^4-])

But [EDTA^4-] is another variable here. How can I find [EDTA^4-]?

Wait, the total concentration of EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = C. But I don't know C. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention adding EDTA separately. It just says the solution has 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So perhaps the only EDTA present is in the complex and the free EDTA. So, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and [EDTA^4-] is what?

Wait, that's the problem. Without knowing the total EDTA concentration, I can't compute [EDTA^4-]. Because [EDTA^4-] could be anything, depending on how much EDTA was added.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the solution is such that all the EDTA is in the complex or in the free form. So, the total EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = T. But without knowing T, I can't find [EDTA^4-].

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex, and that the complex is the only source of EDTA and Ca²+.

So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the total Ca is [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, because each complex has one Ca²+.

Similarly, the total EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, since each complex has one EDTA.

But wait, that's assuming that the initial solution is made by dissolving 0.02 M of the complex, and there's no additional EDTA or Ca²+ added. So total Ca comes from the complex, and total EDTA comes from the complex.

So, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

But we can write the expression for Kf as:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

We can express [Ca²+] as (total Ca) - [CaEDTA^2-], but wait, no, because total Ca is [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

Wait, no. Because the complex is 0.02 M, so the total Ca is 0.02 M, and the same total EDTA is 0.02 M.

So, [Ca²+] = 0.02 M - [CaEDTA^2-], but that's confusing because [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. That can't be right because that would make [Ca²+] negative, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait. No, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. The total Ca is [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. So [Ca²+] is 0.02 - 0.02 = 0 M. That can't be right because that would suggest no Ca²+ is free, which isn't the case. So I must have made a wrong assumption here.

Ah, perhaps the solution isn't just the complex, but maybe the initial solution had some EDTA and Ca²+ that formed the complex. Wait, but the problem states the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So perhaps, the initial solution was made by dissolving the complex, but some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

In that case, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but some of it dissociates. So:

Total Ca: [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

Total EDTA: [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

But because Kf is very large, the dissociation is minimal, so [Ca²+] is much smaller than 0.02. So, we can approximate:

[Ca²+] << 0.02, so [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02.

Similarly, [EDTA^4-] = ( [CaEDTA^2-] ) / (Kf * [Ca²+] )

Wait, substituting [Ca²+] from Kf into this.

Wait, Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

So, [EDTA^4-] = [CaEDTA^2-]/( Kf [Ca²+] )

But [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.

So,

[EDTA^4-] ≈ 0.02 / (5e10 * [Ca²+] )

But [EDTA^4-] is also part of the total EDTA, which is 0.02 M. Wait, no, the total EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

Wait, no, because the complex is 0.02 M. So, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. So EDTA comes from the complex and any free EDTA. But if the complex dissociates, the [EDTA^4-] would be the same as [Ca²+], because each dissociation gives one EDTA^4- and one Ca²+.

Wait, if the complex dissociates as CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-, then for every x moles of complex that dissociate, you get x moles of Ca²+ and x moles of EDTA^4-.

So, [Ca²+] = x.

[EDTA^4-] = x.

And [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x.

But because Kf is large, x is very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, Kf ≈ (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So,

(0.02)/(x²) = 5e10.

Solving for x:

x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-12.

x = sqrt(2e-12) ≈ 4.47e-6.

Wait, but x is [Ca²+], so that's approximately 4.47e-6 M. But looking at the options, the closest is C) 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, my calculation doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check. Let me compute 0.02 divided by (5e10):

0.02 /5e10 = 0.02 / 5e10 = 4e-13.

Wait, no, 0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² =4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5 ≈ 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, wait. Let me compute sqrt(4e-13) again.

4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13.

sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. So 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Ah, that's 6.3e-7 M. Which matches option C.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer is C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

### Key Assumptions:
1. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M, so \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\).
2. The formation constant \(K_f = 5 \times 10^{10}\) is very large, indicating that the complex is highly stable, and the dissociation is minimal. Thus, \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] \ll [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\), and we approximate \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\).
3. For every \(x\) moles of the complex that dissociate, \(x\) moles of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(x\) moles of \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) are produced. Thus, \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\).

### Simplified Expression:
Substituting into the formation constant equation:
\[
K_f \approx \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{x^2}
\]
\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

### Solving for \(x\):
\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is:

**C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**
