Okay, so I have this problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The question is multiple-choice, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let's start by breaking down what the question says.

The operator A_y is given as A = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I remember that for angular momentum operators, especially spin, they often involve Pauli matrices or similar structures.

So, first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Since A is a 2x2 matrix, finding its eigenvalues shouldn't be too hard. The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix can be found using the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

Wait, but let me think about the matrix S. Let me write it out. S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π), so A = c * S. So A would be:

[ 0   -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

So the matrix A looks like:

[[ 0, -i c ],
 [ i c, 0 ]]

With c = h/(4π).

To find the eigenvalues, I'll compute the determinant of (A - λ I) = 0.

The matrix A - λ I is:

[ -λ    -i c ]
[ i c   -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - ( -i c )(i c ) = λ² - ( (-i c) * i c )

Wait, let's compute that. The term is (-i c) * (i c). Let's compute it:

(-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = ( (-i)(i) ) c². What's (-i)(i)? i times i is -1, so (-i)(i) is -(-1) = 1. So that term is c² * 1.

So the determinant equation is λ² - c² = 0 → λ² = c² → λ = ±c. So the eigenvalues are ±c.

Wait, but c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). Hmm, looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: Im eigenvalues are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, that can't be right because the eigenvalues we're getting are real? Wait, no. Wait, wait: the matrix A is actually a Hermitian matrix? Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Let me think.

Wait, S is the matrix:

[ 0   -i ]

[ i    0 ]

Is S Hermitian? The conjugate transpose of S would be:

[ 0   i ]

[ -i  0 ]

Which is not the same as S. Oh wait, no, wait: the transpose of S is:

[ 0   i ]

[ -i  0 ]

Which is the complex conjugate of S. So S is anti-Hermitian? Because S† = -S.

Because S† would be:

[ 0   i ]

[ -i  0 ]

Which is equal to -S. Because S is:

[ 0   -i ]

[ i    0 ]

So S† = -S → S is anti-Hermitian. Then when you multiply by a real constant c, A = c S is anti-Hermitian as well. Because (c S)† = c S† = c (-S) = - c S, so it's anti-Hermitian.

Wait, but anti-Hermitian matrices have eigenvalues with imaginary eigenvalues. Hmm. So that contradicts my earlier calculation where I found real eigenvalues. Wait, that must mean I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's re-express S. Another approach: since S is a 2x2 matrix, perhaps it's proportional to the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli Y matrix is:

[ 0   -i ]

[ i    0 ]

So S is indeed the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, but wait, wait! The standard Pauli Y matrix is actually:

Y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly what S is. And Y is Hermitian. Because Y† is equal to Y. Let me check:

Y† would be:

[0  i]

[-i 0]

Which is the same as Y, so Y is Hermitian. So S is Hermitian, so A is c times a Hermitian matrix, which makes A Hermitian too. So its eigenvalues should be real.

Wait, but earlier I thought the determinant equation was λ² = c², leading to real eigenvalues ±c. But that would mean the eigenvalues are real, which makes sense.

But wait, the determinant calculation: A - λ I is:

[ -λ   -i c ]

[ i c  -λ ]

The determinant is (λ^2) - [ (-i c)(i c) ) ].

Compute the product (-i c)(i c): (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So 1 * c².

So determinant is λ² - c² =0 → λ² = c² → λ= ±c. So eigenvalues are real: ±h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which option matches.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). So that's incorrect because eigenvalues are real, not complex.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Doesn't fit.

Option C: Eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm, because A is a component of angular momentum, and in quantum mechanics, different components don't commute. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it can't be an eigenstate of Az or Ax (unless they commute, which they don't). But A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with all components. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay should also be eigenfunctions of A². So option C says that it can be eigenfunction of A², but not Az. So that seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, the basis functions would be the eigenvectors. So yes, the eigenfunctions would form the basis. But I'm not sure if this statement is correct or not. It probably depends on context, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct statement is C.

Wait, but let's think about the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). Looking at the options again.

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh, which can't be because our eigenvalues are real. So option A is wrong.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±½, real ±1. Doesn't match.

So the only options that make sense are C and D.

Looking at option C: eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which is S·S, and in this case, A is proportional to S_y. So A² is (c S_y)^2. Since [A, A²] = 0, any eigenfunction of A is also an eigenfunction of A². So that part is correct. But the second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since A and Az (the Z-component) don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different. So yes, eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So statement C is correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions. But in quantum mechanics, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenfunctions will form an orthonormal basis for the space. So yes, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) would serve as a basis. So D seems correct as well. But wait, the statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Hmm, perhaps that's a bit ambiguous. Because the basis functions are the eigenvectors, which are the eigenfunctions, so D is correct. But I'm not sure. So perhaps both C and D are correct statements?

Wait, the question is which statement is correct. But looking at the options, each is a separate choice.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's think about each option.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az.

As I said, A^2 commutes with Ay, so eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A^2. So first part correct. The second part, since [Ay, Az] = iħ something. So eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the basis functions of Ay would probably refer to the eigenvectors, which are the eigenfunctions. So if you express Ay in its eigenbasis, it would be diagonal. So yes, the eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis. So statement D is correct.

Wait, but the options are separate, and the question asks which statement is correct.

Wait, but let me reconsider whether any of the options are definitely incorrect.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix. So the matrix is 2x2, so there are two eigenfunctions which are orthogonal. So the eigenfunctions form a basis. So statement D is correct.

So options C and D seem both correct. But the options in the question are presented as four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm. So both statements could be correct, but looking again, perhaps I made a mistake earlier about the eigenvalues. Wait, earlier I concluded λ = ±c, which are real. So the eigenvalues have zero imaginary parts, so none of the options A or B are correct. So the correct statements must be either C or D.

Wait, but I'm supposed to think about which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, let's check the properties. So since A is a Hermitian operator, its eigenvalues are real, as we've found. The eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis, so statement D is correct.

But what about statement C? Since A² is (Ay)^2, which would be proportional to S_y^2. Since S_y is a Pauli matrix, S_y^2 is identity matrix scaled by (ħ/2)^2 or something. Wait, let's compute S^2.

Wait, S is the Pauli Y matrix. So S^2 is identity matrix times (½)(something?), wait, Pauli matrices square to identity.

Wait, the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz each square to the identity matrix. So S is σy, so S² = I, where I is 2x2 identity matrix.

So A = c S. So A² = c² S² = c² I.

So the operator A² is c² times the identity matrix. So any vector is an eigenfunction of A² with eigenvalue c².

So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it's also an eigenfunction of A² with eigenvalue c². So the first part of option C is correct.

The second part of C says that φ is not an eigenfunction of Az. Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different. So yes, that's correct.

So statement C is correct.

But statement D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions form a basis (they're orthogonal and complete), so D is correct.

Wait, but the question is to choose the correct statement. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, which one is presented correctly.

Wait, the question says, which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps during calculation, when you compute the eigenvalues, you find that they're real, so any option that suggests complex eigenvalues is incorrect. So options A and B are out. Then, the correct statements are C and D.

But since only one option is correct, perhaps only statement C is correct.

Alternatively, let's think what statement D says. It says the eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the matrix Ay is expressed in the basis of its own eigenfunctions. In that case, the matrix would be diagonal. So if the question is about whether the eigenfunctions form a basis, yes, because in a 2D space, two orthogonal eigenvectors would form a basis.

So statement D is also correct.

Wait, but the options may have only one correct answer. So perhaps I need to see which of the options present a correct statement.

Alternatively, perhaps statement D isn't correct. Because the basis functions are the eigenfunctions, so perhaps the statement is correct. So maybe both C and D are correct. But the options are given as four choices, and the question requires selecting the correct option.

Wait, perhaps the only correct statement is C. Because statement D could be a trick. Because the matrix operator is given, and the eigenfunctions are not necessarily the same as the basis in which the matrix is given. Wait, the question says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix. So the eigenfunctions form the basis, so perhaps statement D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about whether the statement in D is correct. The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the operator Ay. So if the operator is represented in its eigenbasis, then the matrix would be diagonal. But the given matrix for S is not diagonal. So the basis in which S is given is not its eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions of S are not the same as the basis in which S is represented. So statement D is incorrect.

Wait, the operator is given in the standard basis, not its own eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions are different from the basis in which the matrix is presented. Therefore, statement D is incorrect. Because the eigenfunctions are a different basis, not the same as the one in which the matrix is given. So the matrix is given in the standard basis, and the eigenfunctions form another basis.

So statement D is incorrect.

So the correct statements are C.

So the correct answer is C.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) corresponds to the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix, which is Hermitian. Thus, \( A_y \) is also Hermitian, meaning its eigenvalues are real.
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are found by solving \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the characteristic equation becomes:
     \[
     \det \begin{bmatrix} -\lambda & -ic \\ ic & -\lambda \end{bmatrix} = \lambda^2 - c^2 = 0.
     \]
     Solving this gives the eigenvalues \( \lambda = \pm c \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \). Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real.

2. **Eigenfunctions of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form an orthonormal basis for the 2D space. These eigenfunctions are distinct from the basis in which \( A_y \) is represented (the standard basis), as the given matrix \( S \) is not diagonal in its own eigenbasis.

3. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).
   - **Option B:** Claims that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect, as the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is incorrect because the eigenfunctions form a different basis (the eigenbasis of \( A_y \)), not the standard basis in which \( A_y \) is represented.

### Conclusion

The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

**Answer: C**
