Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember some things about enols and reactions with bromine.

First, what's the structure of the starting material? 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So cyclopentene has five-membered ring with an double bond. The 'enol' part means it's a cycloalkenol. The numbering... so the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, I think. And the hydroxyl group (OH) would be on carbon 1 because it's an enol. Wait, no, wait. Enol structure is where the double bond is between the carbons adjacent to the hydroxyl group. So in cyclopentenol, the OH is on one of the carbons that's part of the double bond. Wait, no, the enol form is when the hydroxyl is on a carbon adjacent to a double bond. So, for cyclopent-1-enol, the structure would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the OH on carbon 2. But wait, wait. Let me think again. The enol form is where the double bond is between the alpha and beta carbons relative to the carbonyl group. Wait, no, in this case, the compound is not a ketone but an enol. So, perhaps the structure is that the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C1. So, cyclopent-1-enol would have the OH on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2?

Alternatively, maybe the enol form is when the OH is on a carbon adjacent to a double bond. So, the structure is a cyclopentane ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. Hmm, I might be getting confused here. Let me try to draw it mentally. The molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So cyclopentane ring. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The enol group is OH on C1, because that's the position indicated by the 'enol' suffix. Or wait, the numbering might be such that the substituents get the lowest numbers. Hmm. Alternatively, the enol has the OH on a carbon adjacent to the double bond. So, perhaps the structure is a cyclopentane with a double bond between C1 and C2 and an OH on C2. Because in enols, the structure is R2C=CR-OH? Or is it R2C-O-C=CR? Wait, no, enol is an alcohol with adjacent double bond. So, the structure is a conjugated system where the hydroxyl is on a carbon adjacent to the double bond. So, for cyclopent-1-enol, the OH is on C2, and the double bond is C1-C2. So when you have 4,4-dimethyl, that's on the ring. So in the cyclopentane ring, at position 4, there are two methyl groups attached.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the cyclopentane ring with C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 in order. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C2. And at C4, there are two methyl groups.

So, the structure is:

C1 (double bond to C2) with C2-OH, C4 with two methyl substituents.

Now, the reaction is with bromine. Bromine, in what form? Usually, bromine in a dibromination or addition reaction. But wait, in the presence of an enol, what happens when you add bromine?

Wait, I'm thinking about the addition of bromine to enols. Oh wait, maybe this is a case of the Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition. Alternatively, maybe the enol is acting as a nucleophile, attacking the bromine.

Wait, but more likely, bromine (Br2) would add across the double bond in an addition reaction. So, the cyclopentenol would react with Br2, which is a dihalogen, leading to the addition of two bromine atoms across the double bond.

Wait, but wait. The enol's double bond is conjugated with the hydroxyl group. So, the molecule is in the enol form, which is a resonance structure of a ketone. But in any case, when you have an enol and you add Br2, maybe it's a conjugate addition, but wait, no, perhaps it's a diaddition across the double bond.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the presence of an enol might lead to a dihydroxylation or some other reaction, but I think in this case, it's more about adding bromine to the double bond.

So, let's think about the addition of Br2 to an alkene. The general process is that the double bond opens up, with Br adding to each end. So, the alkene becomes a di bromide.

But wait, in the presence of a hydroxyl group adjacent to the double bond (as in an enol), maybe the addition would be different. Wait, could there be a possibility of a conjugate addition? Alternatively, maybe the enol could react with Br2 in a way that the hydroxyl group is involved.

Wait, perhaps the bromine could add to the double bond, but the hydroxyl group could influence the regiochemistry or the stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol is more reactive than a regular alkene because the negative charge on the oxygen could make the enol more electron-rich, leading to faster addition.

Wait, but when you add Br2 to a double bond, it's an electrophilic addition. The bromine (Br2) acts as an electrophile, and the alkene's electrons attack it, leading to the formation of a bromonium ion intermediate, which then opens up with Br- attack from the opposite side.

But in this case, the enol's hydroxyl group is adjacent. So, perhaps the addition is similar. The double bond is between C1 and C2, OH is on C2. So, adding Br2 would add Br to C1 and C2, making 1,2-dibromide.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options given.

The options are:

A) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

B) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

C) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

Wait, so all the options are either di-substituted with Br or mono. Options B and C are mono-substituted, while A and D are di-substituted.

If the reaction is adding Br across the double bond, then we'd get a di-substituted product. So, options A or D.

But wait, could the reaction be something else? For instance, if the enol undergoes oxidation or some other reaction.

Wait, wait, the starting material is an enol, which is a dihydroxy compound. Alternatively, perhaps the enol could tautomerize to the ketone form. Oh, wait, enols can tautomerize to ketones. So, the starting material is an enol, but under certain conditions, it could form the ketone.

Hmm, but bromine is a dienophile? Or, perhaps, the reaction is different. Alternatively, maybe the enol could undergo some kind of bromination via a different mechanism.

Wait, another thought: when you have an enol, it's a good nucleophile. So, perhaps the OH is deprotonated, making an enolate, which can attack Br2. But wait, adding Br2 to an enolate would typically result in the substitution of the alpha position. Wait, but bromine is a dihalogen, so maybe it adds across the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the basic concepts. The reaction of an enol with bromine (Br2) should lead to the addition of Br across the double bond. So, the double bond C1-C2 would become C1-Br and C2-Br.

So, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, with the stereochemistry depending on the addition.

Looking at the options, A and D are dibromides. A is (1R,2S), D is (1R,2R). So, the question is, what would the stereochemistry be?

Wait, when Br2 adds to a double bond, the addition is anti. Because the bromonium ion forms, and the bromide ion attacks from the opposite side, leading to an anti addition.

In the starting enol, the substituents would determine the stereochemistry. The enol has a cyclopentane ring, and the substituents are on C4 (two methyl groups). The double bond is between C1 and C2, with OH on C2.

Wait, but in the enol form, the hydroxyl is on C2, and the double bond is C1-C2. So, when Br2 adds, the Brs would add across the double bond. The geometry would be trans addition (anti).

So, the cyclopentane ring would have Br on C1 and C2. Now, the configuration would depend on the starting structure.

Wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, on the cyclopentane ring, the substituents are at C4: two methyl groups. The double bond is C1-C2, and the OH is on C2.

So, the structure would have the double bond between C1 and C2, with the OH on C2, and two methyl groups on C4.

When Br2 adds across the double bond, the Brs would add to C1 and C2. Since the addition is anti, the Brs would be on opposite sides.

But wait, the ring structure is a five-membered ring, so the substituents would have to accommodate the ring's geometry.

Wait, perhaps the ring is in a chair-like or boat-like conformation, but since it's a five-membered ring, it's more likely to be a boat or similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the addition of Br2 to the double bond, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Looking at the options, options A and D are that. Now, the question is about the stereochemistry.

The starting material's double bond is between C1 and C2. Let me think about the substituents around the double bond. The C2 has the OH group and is connected to C1 and C3. C1 is connected to C5 and C2. C4 has two methyl groups, and C3 is connected to C2 and C4.

Wait, actually, perhaps I should draw the structure more clearly. Let me imagine the cyclopentane ring: the five carbons are C1, C2, C3, C4, C5. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C2. The two methyl groups are on C4.

So, when the double bond opens, Br adds to C1 and C2. Since the addition is anti, the Brs will be trans to each other.

In the ring structure, the substituents (Br on C1 and C2) would have their configurations depending on how the ring is arranged.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact stereochemistry. Let me think about the possible diastereomers.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is a cyclopentenol. When adding Br2, the result is a 1,2-dibromide. So, the product would have Br on C1 and C2, in anti configuration.

Now, looking at the options A and D: both are 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Option A: (1R,2S)

Option D: (1R,2R)

So, the question is whether the Brs are on the same face (cis) or opposite (trans).

Wait, in Br2 addition, the bromine adds across the double bond in a trans fashion because of the bromonium ion intermediate. So, in the cyclopentane ring, the Brs would be on opposite faces.

But wait, since the ring is rigid, the substituents might end up in a particular configuration.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to consider the chair or ring flip. Alternatively, perhaps the major product is determined by the chair conformation leading to the most stable product, but for a five-membered ring, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: when the double bond is in the ring, the addition of Br2 would lead to the bromines being on adjacent carbons, but their configuration depends on the diastereomer.

Wait, but without knowing the exact starting stereochemistry, it's hard to determine. However, the options A and D have different configurations.

Wait, perhaps the starting cyclopentenol is not in a particular stereochemistry because it's a trans or cis enol? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via addition but via some other mechanism.

Wait, another thought: the enol might have a ketone tautomer. So, 4,4-dimethylcyclopentenol could tautomerize to 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, perhaps the reaction with bromine is different.

Wait, if the enol tautomerizes to a ketone, then the reaction with bromine would involve the carbonyl group. But bromine doesn't typically react with ketones in the same way as with alkenes. Wait, unless it's a nucleophilic attack, but that's not common.

Wait, another possibility: the enol might be more reactive towards bromine because of its conjugation with the hydroxyl group, making the double bond more electron-rich, leading to faster addition.

But I think the main reaction is the addition of Br2 to the double bond, making a vicinal dibromide.

So, the product should be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, with the stereochemistry determined by the anti addition.

So, looking at the options, that's either A or D.

Now, the question is: what's the configuration?

The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, the ring has substituents at C4 (two methyl groups) and the double bond between C1 and C2 with OH on C2.

Assuming the starting structure has a certain configuration. Let me imagine the ring in such a way that the double bond is in a certain position.

Wait, perhaps the enol is in a chair-like structure where the substituents are in a certain arrangement. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the major product is a trans-diepoxide, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the enol is in a certain configuration that would lead to the bromines adding on opposite sides, leading to either R and S configurations or both R or both S.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is a racemic mixture, but the options don't indicate that.

Wait, but without knowing the exact starting configuration, maybe the question assumes that the product is a vicinal dibromide without specific stereoisomerism, but the options specify.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via simple addition but via some other pathway, such as substitution.

Wait, another angle: the enol could lose a water molecule to form a carbonyl group. But in that case, the product would be a ketone, and then perhaps undergo bromination.

Wait, but that would be a different reaction. Let me think: if the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, then the reaction with bromine would be different.

Wait, cyclopentanone with substituents. But bromine reacting with a ketone—what's that?

Well, ketones can undergo halogenation, but I think that typically requires an acid catalyst, like HBr, and forms a bromide via the formation of a bromohydrin. Wait, that's the Michael reaction? Or the addition of HBr to a carbonyl.

Wait, no, the bromohydrin formation involves the addition of Br and OH across the carbonyl group. So, if the enol tautomerizes to ketone, and then reacts with Br2 in a bromohydrin-like reaction, the product would have Br and OH on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is already an enol, so maybe the reaction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol doesn't tautomerize, and the reaction is simply the addition of Br across the double bond.

Assuming that, the product would be a vicinal dibromide. So, the correct options are A or D.

Wait, perhaps the addition is syn or anti. I thought Br2 addition is anti.

So, in the ring, the two Brs would be on opposite faces. So, if the starting double bond is in a certain configuration, the Brs would be trans.

But without knowing the exact starting configuration, it's hard to predict the stereochemistry.

Wait, the options A and D have different configurations. A is 1R,2S; D is 1R,2R.

Wait, perhaps the major product is a trans addition, so the Brs are opposite each other.

In a five-membered ring, the anti addition would lead to a certain configuration.

Wait, perhaps the major product would have the Brs on adjacent carbons in a trans arrangement, leading to a particular diastereomer.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a racemic mixture, but the options don't reflect that.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option B or C, which are mono-brominated. How could that happen?

Ah, wait another thought: if the enol is an aromatic compound, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination via a different mechanism, such as radical substitution. But I don't think so; Br2 in such reactions usually adds across double bonds.

Wait, another possibility: the enol could undergo bromination at the alpha position. But that would require a different mechanism, like enolate formation.

Wait, when you have an enol, it can deprotonate to form an enolate. Then, the enolate could attack Br2, leading to bromination at the alpha position.

But wait, the reaction conditions matter. If the reaction is in a protic solvent, the enol might not form the enolate. But if it's in a basic condition, perhaps the enolate is formed.

But the question says reaction with bromine, so perhaps it's a bromonium ion formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not addition but substitution.

Wait, perhaps the enol isn't reacting with Br2 as an electrophile but as an oxidizing agent. For example, the OH group could get brominated. But that would require a different setup.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think about each option.

Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So, the product is a ketone with a Br on C2. How would that form? If the enol tautomerizes to a ketone and then undergoes bromination at the alpha position. But how?

Wait, perhaps the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, then the alpha carbon (C2) undergoes bromination. But alpha bromination typically requires a base to deprotonate and form an enolate, which then reacts with Br2.

But in the absence of a base, would that happen? I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the enol is in an acidic solution, perhaps the enolate is formed, leading to bromination.

But I think the more straightforward reaction is the addition of Br2 to the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide.

So, if that's the case, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, either as A or D.

Wait, perhaps the addition leads to both Brs being on the same side, making the configuration cis, but wait, Br2 addition is trans.

No, wait: when Br2 adds to a double bond, the Brs add on opposite sides. So, if the starting double bond is in a certain conformation, the Brs would end up in a trans configuration.

But again, without knowing the exact starting structure, it's hard to say, but the options have A as (1R,2S), which would be trans, and D as (1R,2R), which is cis.

Wait, but if the addition is trans, then the configuration would be opposite. So, if C1 is R, C2 would be S, which is option A. Alternatively, if C1 is R and C2 is R, that's option D.

But wait, in a five-membered ring, the substituents (Br) may be in a certain configuration due to the ring's constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a meso compound, but the options don't reflect that.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: considering the ring's structure and the possible diastereomers.

If the double bond is in the ring, and Br adds across it, the product would have Br on adjacent carbons, and because it's an addition, the configuration is determined by the ring's geometry.

Wait, perhaps the product ends up as a trans-dibromide, leading to the (1R,2S) configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a racemic mixture, but since the options don't offer that, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is a trans double bond, the addition of Br would maintain the trans configuration. But if the starting double bond is cis, the addition would be trans, leading to a different configuration.

But without knowing the starting structure, I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the major product is the vicinal dibromide with both Brs on the same face, leading to option D (1R,2R). But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more likely to form a trans-dibromide, so option A.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about the possible options again.

If the reaction is a simple addition, then the product is a vicinal dibromide, so options A or D.

But the question is about the major outcome. Which is more likely?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as an addition but as a substitution.

Wait, another possibility: the enol could act as a nucleophile, and the bromine could act as an electrophile. But in that case, the OH group might attack Br2, leading to substitution.

But I don't think that's the case here. Bromine is more likely to add to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an example of allylic bromination. Hmm, no, that requires a different setup, like NBS and light.

Wait, another thought: the enol could be reacting via a radical mechanism, but I don't think that's the case with Br2.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is a mono-brominated ketone. How would that happen?

If the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, then perhaps the carbonyl group reacts with bromine in a different way. But typically, ketones don't react with Br2 without a catalyst. Alternatively, if the enolate is formed and then reacts with Br2.

So, enol → tautomer → ketone → enolate formation, then bromination at the alpha position.

Wait, so for that to happen, the enol would first tautomerize to the ketone. Then, under basic conditions, the ketone would form an enolate. The enolate would attack Br2, leading to bromination at the alpha position.

But the question doesn't specify the reaction conditions, so I'm not sure. However, the presence of Br2 in a solution without a base would more likely result in addition to the double bond rather than enolate formation.

So, perhaps the major product is the dibromide, either A or D.

Hmm, this is getting quite tricky. Let me try to think of an example.

Wait, I recall that when an enol reacts with HBr, it can lead to the formation of a bromide at the alpha position. But that's under acidic conditions, typically.

But in the case of Br2, which is a dihalogen, perhaps the addition to the double bond is the main reaction.

So, the product is a vicinal dibromide, either A or D.

Now, considering the stereochemistry, because the addition is anti, the Brs would be opposite each other.

In the ring structure, if the starting double bond is in a certain configuration, the Brs would end up in a trans arrangement.

But the options A and D have different configurations.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Wait, why? Because in the ring, the Brs are adjacent and on the same face, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option A: (1R,2S).

But without knowing the exact starting configuration, it's hard to determine.

Wait, another approach: the enol structure is such that the OH is on the same face as the two methyl groups. So, when Br adds across the double bond, the Brs would end up on opposite faces, leading to a certain configuration.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't an addition but a substitution, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any other possible reactions.

Wait, another possibility: the enol could undergo oxidation with bromine. But I don't think bromine acts as an oxidizing agent in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol could undergo an elimination reaction, but with Br2, that's less likely.

Hmm.

Given all this, I think the major reaction is the addition of Br2 to the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide. So, the options are A and D.

Since Br2 addition is anti, the product would have the Brs on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration. So, option A is (1R,2S), which is trans, while option D is (1R,2R), which is cis.

Wait, but in a five-membered ring, the substituents can't be too far apart because of the ring's rigidity. So, perhaps the trans addition leads to a particular diastereomer.

But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: the initial enol has a certain stereochemistry. For example, the OH is on the same face as the methyl groups. When Br adds across the double bond, the Brs would end up on opposite faces, leading to a particular configuration.

In the case where the OH is on C2, and the methyl groups are on C4, the addition of Br to C1 and C2 in an anti fashion would result in the Brs being on opposite sides relative to the ring.

But without knowing the exact starting arrangement, it's hard to determine.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but the options don't reflect that.

Wait, but in the options, only A and D are possible, and I have to choose between them.

I think I've spent enough time thinking, and perhaps I should go with the anti addition leading to option A: (1R,2S).

No, wait. Wait, when adding Br2 across a double bond, the bromines add in a trans fashion. So, in a cyclopentane ring, if the starting double bond is in a certain configuration, the Brs would be trans.

But how does that translate to the R/S configuration?

Wait, perhaps the product is a meso compound, which would mean that the configuration is the same on both carbons, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: (1R,2R), because when adding Br2 in a ring, the ring's structure forces the substituents to be on the same face, leading to cis addition. But I thought Br2 addition is anti.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the ring's structure. Let me imagine a cyclopentane ring with the double bond between C1 and C2. The OH is on C2. When Br adds to C1 and C2, the Brs are on opposite faces, leading to a trans configuration across the ring.

But in the ring, the substituents are on adjacent carbons, so the Brs are trans, which would make the configuration R and S.

So, perhaps the correct answer is A: (1R,2S).

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the major product is the dibromide without any specific stereoisomerism, but the options don't present that.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. How would that form? It would require the OH to be oxidized to a ketone and then bromination at C2.

But under what conditions would that happen? If the reaction is with Br2, perhaps in the presence of an oxidizing agent, but the question doesn't specify.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH is oxidized to a ketone, then bromine adds to the alpha position.

But without specific conditions, it's hard to say. However, the question is about the reaction between the enol and bromine, so I think the main reaction is addition to the double bond.

So, the product would be a vicinal dibromide, options A or D.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Wait, but why? Let me think again: bromine adds in a trans fashion, leading to the Brs on opposite sides.

In the ring, if the starting double bond is such that the OH is on the same face as the methyl groups, then the Brs would be on opposite faces, leading to a configuration where C1 is R and C2 is S.

So, that would be option A.

But I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should conclude that the major product is option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Wait, how? If the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, then bromine might add to the alpha position. Wait, but would that happen without a base?

Alternatively, perhaps the OH group is replaced by Br. But that would require a substitution reaction, which I don't think is the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol undergoes an oxidation to form a ketone, and then bromine adds to the alpha position.

But I'm not sure. I think I'm overcomplicating it.

Finally, I'll go with the initial thought that the reaction is the addition of Br2 to the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide. So, the product is either A or D. Since the addition is anti, the product should have Brs on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration, which would correspond to option A: (1R,2S).

Wait, but the options for A are (1R,2S), which is a trans arrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D. I'm not confident, but I'll go with option D.


The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine (Br₂). The starting material is an enol, which has a hydroxyl group (OH) on C2 and a double bond between C1 and C2 in a cyclopentane ring. Additionally, there are two methyl groups attached to C4. Bromine typically reacts with alkenes through electrophilic addition, where Br₂ adds across the double bond in a trans (anti) fashion due to the formation of a bromonium ion intermediate.

When Br₂ adds to the double bond between C1 and C2, the product is a vicinal dibromide. The stereochemistry of the addition is trans, meaning the bromine atoms add to opposite sides of the plane of the double bond. This results in a product where the bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons (C1 and C2) in a trans configuration.

The options provided include two dibrominated products (A and D) and two mono-brominated products (B and C). The mono-brominated products (B and C) would require a different reaction mechanism, such as tautomerization to a ketone followed by bromination at the alpha position, which is less likely under the given conditions. Therefore, the major reaction is the addition of Br₂ to the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide.

Between the dibrominated products (A and D), the stereochemistry depends on the trans addition of Br₂. Option A corresponds to the (1R,2S) configuration, which is consistent with the anti addition mechanism. Option D corresponds to the (1R,2R) configuration, which would imply a syn addition, inconsistent with the typical anti addition of Br₂. Thus, the correct product is the (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.
