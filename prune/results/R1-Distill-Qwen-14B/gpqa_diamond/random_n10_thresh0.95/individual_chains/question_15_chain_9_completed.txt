Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact probabilities involved here.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which was found using the RV method. So their minimum masses are the same. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

The stars are interesting. The host of Planet_1 has a mass twice that of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so maybe it's a subgiant or something, but same radius as Planet_1's star.

Wait, how does the transit probability depend on these factors? I think the transit probability depends on the orbital distance and the star's size. The key thing is the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to edge-on, right?

The formula for the probability of a transit is R_star (the star's radius) over a (the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit). But wait, I think it's more precise to say that the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by something else? Or is it just (R_star / a) squared? No, wait, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth compared to the area of the planet's orbit. So the probability is (R_star / a) * (R_planet / R_star), but no, wait, the planet's size doesn't directly affect the probability of transit, just whether the dip is detected. The probability is about whether the orbital plane is aligned edge-on enough for the planet to pass in front.

Wait, maybe the probability is (R_star / a) * (something else), but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is approximately (R* / a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it might be (R_star / a)^2, but I think it's more linear.

Wait, another approach: The transit probability depends on the alignment. The probability is given by (R* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R*, it's roughly R* / a. But wait, I think more accurately, the probability is (R* / a) multiplied by (1 + (R_p / R*)), but since R_p is much smaller, it's approximated as R*/a. So the probability is proportional to R* / a.

But wait, another possibility: The transit occurs when the planet's orbit is such that its line of sight is within a certain angle relative to the star's equator. The probability is (R*/a) * sin i, but wait, no, because the RV method already gives some constraints on the inclination. Oh wait, no, the RV method determines the minimum mass because it's based on the Doppler shift, which depends on sin i; i is 90 degrees for a transiting orbit.

But in this question, the RV method has already detected both planets, so we already know their minimum masses. But for the transit probability, it's about the prior probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that a transit is observed.

So the probability of transit is higher when (R* / a) is larger. So for each planet, the transit probability is proportional to (R* / a), where a is their orbital distance.

But how do we find 'a' for each planet? Well, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period (P) to the semi-major axis (a), the mass of the star (M*), and the mass of the planet (m_p). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate it as a^3 = G*M* * P^2/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M* * P²)^(1/3).

But wait, planet_1's period is P1 = P2 /3. Because Planet_1 has a shorter period. So P1 = P2 /3.

So let's compute a1 and a2 in terms of M* and P.

For Planet_1: a1^3 = (G*(2M*) * (P1)^2 )/(4π²) = (G*2M* * (P2/3)^2 )/(4π²) = (2 G M* P2² )/(9 *4 π² )

For Planet_2: a2^3 = (G*M* * P2^2 )/(4 π² )

So the ratio a1/a2 is cube root [ (2/(9)) ) ].

Wait, let's compute a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2 M* (P/3)^2 ) ] / [ M* P^2 ] ) = (2 (P^2/9 )) / (P^2) ) = 2/(9) = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * (0.222)^(1/3). Let's compute 0.222^(1/3). 0.222 is approx (0.6)^3 is 0.216, so 0.6^3 ≈ 0.216. So 0.222 is a bit higher, so a1 ≈ a2 * 0.6 * (1 + (0.006)/(3*0.6^2)) ), but maybe it's approximately about 0.63 or something. But for precise calculation, perhaps 2/9 is 0.2222… so cube root is about 0.604.

So a1 ≈ 0.604 * a2.

Now, the transit probability for each planet is (R* / a). Since both stars have the same radius (R* is same for both planets), the probability for each is P1 = R*/a1 and P2 = R*/a2.

So the ratio P1/P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2 /a1 = 1/(0.604) ≈ 1.653.

So Planet_1's transit probability is higher than Planet_2's by a factor of about 1.65.

Wait wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me compute the a1 and a2 again.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G M*) a³.

So a³ = (G M* P²) / (4 π² )

So for Planet_1:

M1* = 2 M2*.

P1 = P2 /3.

So a1³ = (G * 2 M2* * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π² )

a2³ = (G M2* P2² )/(4 π² )

So a1³ / a2³ = [ (2 * (P2²/9) ) ] / ( P2² ) ) = (2/9) → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

So (2/9) is approximately 0.2222. So (0.2222)^(1/3) is approx 0.604.

So a1 = 0.604 * a2.

So for transit probability: P1 = R*/a1, P2 = R*/a2.

Therefore, P1/P2 = (R*/a1)/(R*/a2) )= a2/a1 = 1/0.604 ≈ 1.653.

So Planet_1 has about 1.65 times higher probability than Planet_2.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1, because it has a higher probability to transit.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher. Hmm, but did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. Because in reality, the RV method gives the minimum mass, but if the RV method can determine the inclination, maybe the prior probability is adjusted?

Wait, no, the question says the researchers are attempting to detect transits. So the transit probability is the prior probability based on the orbital parameters. So the RV method has already found the planets with their minimum masses, but that's based on sin i, so it doesn't affect the prior probability of transit, which depends on the orbital inclination.

So the assumption is that all inclinations are equally likely, so the probability is given by the formula. So I think the initial calculation holds.

So the correct conclusion is that Planet_1 has a higher transit probability by a factor of approximately 1.65.

Looking back at the options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. The transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbital plane with our line of sight, and for this calculation, we assume all inclinations are equally likely.

### Key Information:
1. **Planetary Orbits**:
   - Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), meaning its orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's.
   - Both planets have the same mass.

2. **Host Stars**:
   - The host star of Planet_1 has a mass \( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \), twice the mass of Planet_2's host star.
   - Both stars have the same radius \( R_* \), as Planet_2's host is slightly evolved.

3. **Semi-Major Axis**:
   Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:
   \[
   \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_{*,1} P_1^2}{M_{*,2} P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{1 \cdot P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.604.
   \]
   Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.604 \cdot a_2 \).

4. **Transit Probability**:
   The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius \( R_* \), the ratio of the transit probabilities is:
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.604} \approx 1.65.
   \]
   Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Conclusion:
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher transit probability. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
