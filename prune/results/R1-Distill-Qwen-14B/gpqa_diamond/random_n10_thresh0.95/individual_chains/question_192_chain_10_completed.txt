Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem and trying to figure out the electric field outside a charged spherical conductor with a cavity. Let me see if I can break this down.

Alright, the setup: There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. I need to find the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the conductor's center, and a distance l from the cavity's center. Also, l and L are both bigger than R, and the angle between l and s is θ.

Wait, so the point P is outside the conductor, right? So I'm thinking about how charges distribute in such a system.

Hmm, I remember that when you have a conductor, the charges reside on the outer surface. But wait, in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when we place a charge +q inside the cavity, what happens? Oh right, the charges inside the conductor would rearrange. But wait, the conductor was neutral, so I think the inner cavity would have an induced charge.

Wait, no, the conductor is neutral, so the charges inside it would redistribute. The +q inside the cavity would cause the inner surface of the conductor to have an induced -q charge, right? Because the charge +q attracts negative charges on the conductor's inner surface. Then, since the conductor was neutral overall, the outer surface must have a +q charge to balance it out.

So, from the outside, the conductor behaves as if all the charge is on the outer surface. So, for any point outside the conductor, the electric field should be the same as if the charge were concentrated at the center. Wait, that's the shell theorem thing, right? Conductors in electrostatic equilibrium behave like that.

Wait, but the conductor has a cavity that's offset. So, the point P is outside the conductor. But the charge distribution inside the conductor would be such that the electric field outside is as if all the charge were at the center of the conductor. Because the conductor is a sphere, the external field depends only on the total enclosed charge.

Wait, wait, the conductor's total charge is zero initially, but after placing +q inside the cavity, the inner surface has -q and the outer surface +q. So the total charge on the conductor is +q. So, the conductor as a whole has a net charge of +q. So when we're outside the conductor, the electric field should be as if that +q were at the center of the conductor.

But wait, in this setup, the cavity isn't at the center. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the charge +q is inside the cavity, but the conductor's inner surface responds by having -q, and the outer surface +q. But from the outside, the conductor has a +q charge, so the field outside should be the same as a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. Because the conductor's shape doesn't matter for the external field; it's as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, but in the problem, point P's position is given relative to both the conductor's center and the cavity's center. The distance from the conductor's center is L, and from the cavity's center is l. Hmm, but if the conductor is a sphere, the external field only depends on the total charge and the distance from the conductor's center.

Wait, but if the point P is outside the conductor, then the field is determined by the total charge on the conductor (which is +q) and the distance from the center of the conductor. So the electric field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor. So looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

But wait, what about the position of the cavity's center and the point P's orientation? The problem gives l, the distance from the cavity's center to P, and the angle θ between l and s. But in the external region, shouldn't the field be symmetric as if all the charge were at the center of the conductor?

Wait, perhaps because the conductor is a sphere, any external point's field only depends on the distance from the conductor's center and the total charge. So the answer would be option B.

Alternatively, maybe there's a trick here. If the cavity's center is offset, the induced charges might create some dipole or something else. But wait, the conductor as a whole has a net charge, so the external field is as if it's a point charge at the center.

Wait, let me think again. The conductor is uncharged initially. When +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (inside the cavity) must have -q induced, and the outer surface has +q. So the total charge on the conductor is +q, but the charge is distributed on the outer surface. So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, it's as if the charge is at the center of the conductor, because the conductor is spherical. So the field at point P is k q / L².

So the correct option is B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (inside the cavity) induces a charge of $-q$ due to electrostatic induction. Since the conductor was initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality.

2. **Charge Distribution and External Field**: The conductor is a sphere, and in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges on the outer surface redistribute themselves uniformly. The total charge on the conductor is therefore $+q$, and the electric field outside the conductor is determined as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. This is a consequence of the shell theorem, which states that the electric field outside a spherical charge distribution depends only on the total enclosed charge and the distance from the center.

3. **Electric Field at Point $P$**: Point $P$ is located outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field at $P$ is given by the formula for the electric field due to a point charge:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]
   The distances $l$ and $s$, as well as the angle $\theta$, do not affect the electric field outside the conductor because the field depends only on the total charge of the conductor and the distance $L$ from its center.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is irrelevant for the external field.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The electric field at $P$ is indeed $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the external field.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the electric field depends on $l$, this option does not account for the correct distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
