Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on several factors.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period. Oh, right, so Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. That probably means Planet_1 is closer to its star because shorter orbital period implies closer orbit, right?

Also, both have circular orbits, which simplifies things a bit. The host stars are interesting. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, why would that be? Oh, maybe because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, but same size. So, same size but different masses.

I think the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the orbital distance. The formula I remember is something like the probability P is proportional to R_p / a, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis. Oh wait, actually, more accurately, the probability is roughly (R_p / R_star)² * (1 / a), but maybe it's different. Wait, no, I think the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_star) multiplied by ( (R_star + R_p) / a ). But when the planet is much smaller than the star, R_p << R_star, so it's approximately (R_p / R_star) * (1 / a). Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_p/R_star)^2 * ( (R_star)/(a) ) ), but I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the size of the planet's disk to the size of the star's disk, adjusted by the orbital distance. The formula I recall is P ≈ (R_p / R_*)² * ( (R_* + R_p) / a ), but when R_p << R_*, it simplifies to (R_p / R_*)^2 * (1/a) * (something... Or maybe it's (R_p)/(R_*) multiplied by the impact parameter. Hmm, getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, the transit probability is the area of the planet's disk over the area of the star's disk, but considering the orbital distance. Wait, no, because the planet's path across the sky must align. So the probability is the ratio of the area the planet covers relative to the star's disk, but scaled by the orbital distance. Something like (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by the chance that the orbital plane is edge-on enough.

Wait, I think the actual formula for the probability that a planet transits is P = (R_p / R_*)^2 * ( (R_* + R_p) / a ), but in most cases where R_p << R_*, it's approximately (R_p^2)/(R_*^2 a) ), but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, another source says the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / (R_* + R_p)) * (1/a). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the main factors influencing transit probability. The probability increases when the planet is larger, the star is smaller, and the planet is closer to the star (smaller a). Because a smaller a means a higher chance the planet's orbital plane will cross our line of sight.

So, in this problem, we need to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2.

But wait, the question doesn't give the planet radii. Oh, wait no, the question says both planets have Earth-like masses, but I'm not sure if that's relevant because mass isn't directly the same as radius. Oh wait, but the question doesn't provide their radii, so maybe we can assume other things. Or perhaps the question is only considering the host star's radius and the planet's orbital period.

Wait, but the question says both planets have the same mass. But mass and radius aren't directly proportional. Earth-like mass but maybe not Earth-like radius? Hmm. Or maybe the transit probability depends on the planet's size, but since both have the same mass, perhaps their radii are similar. But since the question doesn't give their radii, perhaps the planet radii are the same? Or maybe the problem is designed in a way that their radii don't matter because they're the same, so it's about other factors.

Wait, but the options only talk about the probability based on other factors, so maybe the planet's radius isn't a variable here. So perhaps the problem is considering that the transit probability is higher for a planet that is closer to its star, which means a shorter period. Because the transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis a. So if Planet_1 has a shorter period, it's closer, so a is smaller, which increases the transit probability.

But wait, the host stars' properties also matter because the star's radius is in the denominator. The transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_*)^2 * (1 / a). So, if the star is larger (R_* bigger), the probability goes down. If a is smaller, the probability goes up.

In the problem, both host stars have the same radius. So R_* is the same for both.

So, the main factors are a (semi-major axis) and R_p (planet radius). But if R_p is same for both (since they have same mass, but mass doesn't directly give radius), but the question doesn't specify. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_*)² * (1 / a). So given that R_* is same for both planets, we can ignore that part. So P is proportional to (R_p)^2 / a.

But since we don't know R_p, perhaps the problem is only comparing based on a and other factors? Or maybe the question is considering that the planet's orbital period affects a, and the star's mass affects a as well.

Wait, Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(T^2) = G(M_* + M_p)/(4π²). Since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate a^3 = (G M_*) T^2 / (4π²). So a is proportional to (M_* )^(1/3) * T^(2/3).

So for Planet_1, T1 = T2 / 3 (since its period is three times shorter). M1 = 2 M2.

So a1 proportional to ( (2 M2) )^(1/3) * ( T2/3 )^(2/3 )

a2 proportional to ( M2 )^(1/3) * ( T2 )^(2/3 )

So the ratio a1 / a2 = [ (2)^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) ) ] / 1.

Simplify:

2^(1/3) is approximately 1.26, (1/3)^(2/3) is (3^(-2/3)) which is approximately 0.48. So 1.26 * 0.48 ≈ 0.605.

So a1 is about 0.605 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2. So a1 = 0.605 a2.

Since in transit probability P, a is in the denominator, P1 is proportional to 1/a1 = 1/(0.605 a2) ≈ 1.65/a2.

P2 is proportional to 1/a2.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

Wait, so Planet_1 has a higher probability because it's closer (smaller a), so the transit probability is higher.

But looking back, the question says the researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability. So which one is higher?

If Planet_1's a is smaller, then P1 is higher. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1, as it has a higher probability.

But wait, let me recheck the numbers.

a1 / a2 = ( (2)^(1/3) ) * ( (1/3) )^(2/3 )

= 2^(1/3) * 3^(-2/3)

= (2 / 3² )^(1/3) 

= (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.605.

So a1 is about 0.605 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. So 1/a1 is larger than 1/a2. So P1 is higher.

So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1.

Wait, but the options are A and B say Planet_2 is preferred, C and D say Planet_1 is preferred.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred with ~1.65 times higher probability. That matches our calculation.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, a1 is smaller than a2, so 1/a1 is higher. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher by a factor of (1/0.605) ≈ 1.65.

So the correct option is C, which says Planet_1 is preferred due to 1.65 times higher probability.

But wait, the options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but the other factors, like star radius. The stars have same R, so that cancels out. So yes, the calculation holds.


To determine which planet has the higher transit probability, we analyze the factors influencing transit probability, which is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{R_*^2 a}
\]

Here, \(R_p\) is the planet's radius, \(R_*\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets have the same mass but their radii are not explicitly provided, we assume \(R_p\) is similar for both. The stars have the same radius (\(R_*\)), so this factor cancels out. The key variable is \(a\), the semi-major axis, which depends on the orbital period \(T\) and the host star's mass \(M_*\).

### Step 1: Relating \(a\) to \(T\) and \(M_*\)
From Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M_* T^2
\]

Thus, \(a \propto M_*^{1/3} T^{2/3}\). For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1: \(M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2}\), \(T_1 = \frac{T_2}{3}\)
- Planet_2: \(M_{*,2}\), \(T_2\)

The ratio of their semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{(M_{*,1})^{1/3} (T_1)^{2/3}}{(M_{*,2})^{1/3} (T_2)^{2/3}}
\]

Substituting \(M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2}\) and \(T_1 = \frac{T_2}{3}\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{(2)^{1/3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{2/3}}{1} = 2^{1/3} \cdot 3^{-2/3}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
2^{1/3} \approx 1.26, \quad 3^{-2/3} \approx 0.48 \implies \frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 1.26 \cdot 0.48 \approx 0.605
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.605a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Comparing Transit Probabilities
Since transit probability is inversely proportional to \(a\), the ratio of their probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1/a_1}{1/a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher transit probability (~1.65 times) compared to Planet_2.
