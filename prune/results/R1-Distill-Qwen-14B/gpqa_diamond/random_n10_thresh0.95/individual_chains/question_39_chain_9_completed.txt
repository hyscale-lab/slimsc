Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the value of 'a' in the given wave function. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wave functions in quantum mechanics are usually complex, so that makes sense because of the 'i' term. Oh, right, 'i' is the imaginary unit, sqrt(-1).

But wait, the problem says that when they measured the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function must be zero outside this interval. So, the wave function must only be non-zero between x=1 and x=3. Hmm, but how does that relate to the given wave function?

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So, the probability density is |ψ(x)|². And the particle is found between x=1 and x=3, which implies that the wave function is zero outside this region. But our wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, when x is less than 1 or greater than 3, the wave function must be zero, right?

Wait, no. Because the wave function given here is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be zero except for specific x values. Oh wait, maybe the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and is zero elsewhere? But the problem says that the wave function is described as that in the part of space where the particle can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3.

So, the region where the wave function is non-zero is between x=1 and x=3. So, for x <1 and x>3, the wave function is zero. So, the given expression is valid only in that region.

But wait, the question is about finding 'a' such that the wave function is normalized. Because when you have a wave function, you must normalize it so that the total probability is 1.

So, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should be equal to 1.

Let me write down ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.

So, the absolute square is |ψ|^2 = [ (a / sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

Because when you take the absolute value squared of a complex number a + ib, it's a² + b².

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25.

The integral from x=1 to x=3 of this should be 1.

So, the integral ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Let me compute this integral. Let's separate it into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 + integral of 0.25 dx from1 to3.

The first integral: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So overall, a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, solving for a²:

a² ln(2) = 0.5

a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute this numerically. Ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to 0.849. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but did I miss any steps? Let me double-check.

The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), the imaginary part is -0.5.

So, when taking the absolute square, it's (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. Yes.

The integral from 1 to3 is correct. So, the calculation seems right. So, the value of a is approximately 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the given wave function, we start by noting that the wave function is described as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). This implies that the wave function is zero outside this region, and the probability density \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) must be integrated over \( x \in [1, 3] \) to ensure normalization, i.e., the total probability is 1.

The probability density is given by:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left( \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two parts:

1. \( a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1 + x} \, dx \),
2. \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx \).

For the first integral, \( \int \frac{1}{1 + x} \, dx = \ln(1 + x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the first term becomes \( a^2 \ln(2) \).

For the second integral:

\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
