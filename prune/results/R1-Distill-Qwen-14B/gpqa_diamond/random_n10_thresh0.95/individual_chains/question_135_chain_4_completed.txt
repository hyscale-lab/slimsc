Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I'm not entirely sure what all the symbols mean, but I think λ is the coupling constant, f represents a fermion field, and X(y) is the boson field. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find which decay channels are allowed kinetically at the lowest order.

Wait, so the Lagrangian term probably describes how the boson X interacts with fermions. The structure looks like a Yukawa interaction, which is a common type of interaction between bosons and fermions. In Yukawa theory, the interaction is between a scalar boson and fermions. The term ψ̄ (something) ψ would be a Dirac term, so X is probably a scalar here.

The mass term for the fermion would usually come from the ψ̄ ψ term multiplied by some parameter. In this case, the interaction includes (υ + X), where υ might be a vacuum expectation value or just a constant. Oh wait, perhaps υ is the mass parameter for the fermion. So the mass would be m_f = λ υ, right? Or maybe the fermion mass comes from that term. So this interaction would lead to the fermion acquiring a mass when X is replaced by its vacuum expectation value, but that's probably not directly relevant here.

Wait, but the problem is about the decay of X. So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The question is, which fermions can it decay into? The options list various possibilities.

Kinematically allowed decays—so that depends on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions it's decaying into. At the lowest order, the decay would be via the tree-level Feynman diagram where X splits into two fermions.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. For X to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of their masses must be less than 6 GeV because in particle physics, the rest mass of the parent must be greater than the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. Otherwise, the decay is not kinematically allowed.

So I need to find all fermions where 2m_f < 6 GeV, because each fermion has mass m_f, and you need two of them. So m_f < 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second, actually, the mass of the fermion is m_f, so for pair production, you need X's mass M_X >= 2 m_f. So m_f <= M_X / 2. Here, M_X is 6 GeV, so m_f <= 3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product of X.

What's the mass of each fermion?

Let me list the known fermion masses:

- Up quark (u): approximately 2-5 MeV (so way less than 3 GeV)
- Down quark (d): about 3-6 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): around 1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: much lighter, but I think the problem is considering charged leptons here, but not sure.

Wait, but the options don't have neutrinos, so perhaps we only consider charged fermions.

So for each fermion, check if m_f <= 3 GeV.

- u: ~2.2 MeV < 3 GeV → allowed
- d: ~3.5 MeV < 3 GeV? Wait, no. Wait, 3.5 MeV is 0.0035 GeV, which is way less than 3 GeV. So yes, allowed.

Wait, wait, I think I confused the units earlier. Let me correct that.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 3 GeV is 3000 MeV.

So m_f <= 3000 MeV.

So for each fermion:

- u: 2.2 MeV → allowed
- d: ~3.5 MeV → allowed (since 3.5 < 3000)
- s: ~95 MeV → allowed
- c: ~1.2 GeV → 1200 MeV < 3000 → allowed
- b: ~4.7 GeV → 4700 MeV > 3000 → Not allowed
- t: 173 GeV → way too heavy → no
- e: 0.5 MeV → allowed
- μ: ~105 MeV → allowed
- τ: ~1.78 GeV → 1780 MeV < 3000 → allowed

So the fermions that can be produced in pairs are u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

But wait, the problem is about decay into a pair, like X → f f̄. So in the Lagrangian, which fermions are involved?

Wait, the Lagrangian term is -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So ψ_f is the fermion field. So X couples to ψ_f, implying that X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f̄.

So which fermions does X interact with? It depends on λ, but the question doesn't specify any restrictions on that. So the interaction is with whatever fermions are present in the model. So assuming the model includes all the standard model fermions, X can decay into any of the above fermion pairs, as long as their mass allows it.

So the possible decay products are:

u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e+ e−, μ+ μ−, τ+ τ−.

But wait, what about the bottom quark? Its mass is about 4.7 GeV, which is above 3 GeV (3000 MeV), so X can't decay into b b̄.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−. Wait, but b is too heavy, so this option is wrong.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−. So includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. These all have masses under 3 GeV (well, c is 1.5 GeV, tau is 1.78 GeV, mu is 0.1 GeV). So this option could be correct, but wait, let me check the masses.

Wait, tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV, so allowed. The muon is 0.1 GeV, way below. The electron is negligible. So this option includes c, but wait, does the Lagrangian allow X to couple to c quarks?

Wait, the problem says that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So X couples to the fermion f. So which fermions are included? The Lagrangian uses ψ_f, so presumably all the fermions in the theory. So for the Standard Model, that would be all quarks and leptons.

So if X can decay into any of these fermions, then the possible decays are the ones where fermion mass is less than 3 GeV.

So B includes c, which is 1.5 GeV, so allowed. So in option B, the decay to c c̄ is allowed. So why is option B the way it is.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A includes b, which is too heavy. So A is wrong.

Option B includes c, and other light fermions.

Option C includes c, and also t, which is way too heavy. So option C is wrong because t can't be a decay product.

Option D includes b, which is too heavy, so D is wrong.

So the correct options are those that include only fermions with m_f ≤ 3 GeV. So looking again:

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All allowed.

Wait, but let me check the masses again. Let me list each fermion in the options:

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

- c: 1.5 GeV → allowed
- s: 0.1 GeV → allowed
- u: 0.002 GeV → allowed
- d: ~0.0035 GeV → allowed
- tau: 1.78 GeV → allowed
- mu: 0.1 GeV → allowed
- e: 0.0005 GeV → allowed

Yes, all meet m_f < 3 GeV.

So option B includes all these fermions. So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is:

X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Which is exactly what I concluded.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but let me make sure about the interaction. The Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So X couples to the fermion f, which suggests that ψ_f could be any fermion, but in reality, each fermion type has its own coupling. So for each fermion species, there's a term like this. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided the mass allows it.

So yes, the decay products are all the allowed fermions with m_f <3 GeV, which are the ones in option B.

Wait, but wait a second, the problem says "lowest order." So in lowest order, the decay is via s-channel, or maybe t-channel. Wait, no, for a scalar boson decaying into fermions, the decay would be via a tree-level Feynman diagram with X splitting into two fermions. So the decay is allowed if the mass is sufficient.

So the allowed decays are those where X → f f̄ is possible. So the allowed fermions are those with mass less than 3 GeV.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction given by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y).
\]

This Lagrangian describes a Yukawa-like interaction between the boson \( X \) and fermions \( \psi_f \). The boson \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs \( f \bar{f} \), provided the mass of \( X \) is sufficient to allow the decay kinematically. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be allowed, the mass of \( X \) must satisfy:

\[
M_X \geq 2m_f,
\]

where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \). Given \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), this implies:

\[
m_f \leq \frac{M_X}{2} = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The masses of the known fermions in the Standard Model are approximately:

- \( m_u \approx 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \),
- \( m_d \approx 3.5 \, \text{MeV} \),
- \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \),
- \( m_c \approx 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_e \approx 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \),
- \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \),
- \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \).

From these, the fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are:

- \( u \), \( d \), \( s \), \( c \), \( e \), \( \mu \), and \( \tau \).

The \( b \)-quark (\( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)) and \( t \)-quark (\( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) are too heavy to be decay products of \( X \), as their masses exceed \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The interaction term in the Lagrangian implies that \( X \) couples to all Standard Model fermions. Therefore, \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair \( f \bar{f} \), provided the mass condition \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) is satisfied.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), all of which satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
