Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that cyclopentenols are cyclic compounds with an alcohol group and a double bond. Enol structures have the double bond between the carbons adjacent to the oxygen. So in 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, right? And there are two methyl groups on C4.

Now, bromine (Br2) is a dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions, but wait, that's when it's reacting with dienes. Alternatively, bromine can undergo addition reactions with alkenes. Oh right! Alkenes react with bromine in a process called bromination, adding across the double bond. But wait, this molecule is an enol, which is an alcohol adjacent to a double bond. So, the enol has a conjugated system, maybe.

Wait, the enol form is more reactive because the lone pair on the oxygen can conjugate with the double bond. So when bromine is added, it'll likely add across the double bond. But wait, this is a conjugated dienol? Or is it a simple enol? Let me think.

In the molecule 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, the structure is a five-membered ring with the double bond between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1, and the two methyl groups are on C4. So the structure is cyclopentene with the OH on C1 and substituents on C4.

When bromine (Br2) reacts with an alkene, it does an addition reaction. The mechanism typically involves the formation of a bromonium ion intermediate. So the Br2 would add across the double bond, making a dibromide. But wait, wait. Alternatively, sometimes, especially with conjugated systems, other reactions can occur, like maybe some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, but in this case, the enol has a conjugated double bond with the hydroxyl group. So when adding bromine, maybe the double bond becomes a diol with bromines attached? No, wait, more accurately, the alkene will react with Br2, adding Br across the double bond.

Let me think about the structure. The starting material is cyclopent-1-enol. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1. So when Br2 adds to that double bond, the Brs will add to C1 and C2. But wait, wait, because the ring is small, maybe some ring-opening or other changes could happen.

Wait, another possibility: Since the molecule is an enol, which is a conjugate base of a ketone, perhaps the reaction isn't a simple addition. Maybe the enol would undergo some kind of acid-base reaction with bromine? No, wait, bromine is more of an electrophilic reagent. So perhaps in this case, the reaction is a dihydroxylation? Or an addition.

Wait, no, when you add bromine to an alkene, you get vicinal dibromide. So in this case, adding Br across the double bond would give 1,2-dibromo-cyclopentanol derivative. But wait, the substituents matter.

Wait, the starting molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the ring has five members, with substituents as follows: OH on C1, methyl groups on C4. So when Br adds across C1 and C2, each of those carbons will get a Br.

Wait, but the question is whether the reaction stops at the addition of Br2 across the double bond or whether some other reaction occurs, like a ring-opening or rearrangement.

Another thought: in some cases, especially with cyclic enols, adding bromine can lead to a bromohydrin formation. But wait, bromohydrin would be when Br and OH add across the double bond in an anti addition. But in this case, the OH is already adjacent, so perhaps the addition would be different.

Wait, no, wait. The enol itself is a conjugated dienol? Or is it a simple enol with a single double bond. So, the molecule is cyclopent-1-enol, which is a five-membered ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH on C1.

So, the reaction with Br2 would proceed as an addition across the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide. So the product would have Brs on C1 and C2, and the OH remains on C1.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. So, after adding Br2, the double bond becomes a single bond with Br on each adjacent carbon. So the OH is on C1, and each of C1 and C2 now have a Br.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So after adding Br, the structure would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol? Because the OH is on C1, and Brs are on C1 and C2.

But wait, wait, that would imply that C1 has two substituents: OH and Br, but that's not possible because each carbon in the cyclopentane ring can only have four bonds. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine. The starting compound is cyclopent-1-enol, which is a five-membered ring with a double bond between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1. So when Br2 adds across the double bond, each Br adds to each of the two carbons (C1 and C2). So each of those carbons gains a Br.

But wait, the OH is already on C1. So after addition, C1 will have a Br and the OH. But that would lead to having two substituents on that carbon. Wait, but in a cyclopentane ring, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons and two substituents. So if C1 already has an OH and a CH2 (from the ring), adding Br would make three substituents. That doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the ring is five-membered, so each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons, and two other substituents. So in the starting molecule, C1 is connected to C5 and C2 (ring bonds) and has an OH and possibly another substituent? Wait, no. Wait, in cyclopent-1-enol, the structure is a ring where C1 is double-bonded to C2, and C1 has an OH group. So the structure is:

      O
      |
C5 - C1 - C2
      |
      CH2?

Wait, no, maybe better to draw it as a chair. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclopentane ring where C1 is connected to C2 (double bond), C5, and an OH group. So for C1, it's bonded to C2 (double bond), C5, and OH. So, three substituents in total, but wait, that leaves one more bond. Oh wait, that's the ring itself. So in reality, each ring carbon has two ring bonds (to adjacent carbons) and two substituents. So C1 would have a double bond to C2, and an OH group. So C1 has three bonds: double bond (counts as one), OH, and two ring bonds. Wait, no. Wait, in an alkene, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons (in the ring) and has a double bond. So for C1, in the enol, the structure is:

C5 - C1 = C2
         |
         OH

So C1 is double-bonded to C2, single-bonded to C5, and has an OH group. That's three bonds, but each carbon in the ring has four bonds. So, what's the fourth bond? Maybe a hydrogen? Because in the starting compound, it's 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So C4 has two methyl groups.

Wait, the starting molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So C4 has two methyl groups attached. So the structure of the ring:

C1 (double bond to C2, OH group, and connected to C5)
C2 (double bond to C1, connected to C3)
C3 (connected to C2 and C4)
C4 (connected to C3 and C5, with two methyl groups)
C5 (connected to C1 and C4)

So when Br2 adds across the double bond between C1 and C2, each of those carbons (C1 and C2) will get a bromine atom.

So the product would be 1-bromo-2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Wait, but the numbering would be such that the OH is on C1, and Br on C1 and C2. Wait, wait, no. Because when you add Br2 to a double bond, the addition is typically anti and across the two carbons.

Wait, but in this case, adding Br to each of the two carbons. So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

But looking at the options, options A and D are about 1,2-dibromo derivatives. The other options are about bromo-ketones.

Wait, but wait a moment. The starting material is an enol. Enols can tautomerize to ketones. So, perhaps the reaction is not just a simple addition but involves a tautomerization first.

If the enol (which is more reactive) tautomerizes to a ketone, then the double bond would be in a different position. Wait, no, the enol and keto forms have the same double bond position, but the position of the OH changes. Wait, in the enol form, the OH is on C1, and in the keto form, the carbonyl is on C1 and the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, no. Wait, in a carbonyl group, the double bond is between C1 and C2, with an O attached to C2. In the enol form, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C1.

So in the enol form, the molecule is more reactive towards electrophilic additions because the lone pair on the OH can conjugate with the double bond, making the double bond more electron-rich and susceptible to bromine addition.

Hmm, so without considering tautomerization, adding Br2 would just add Br across the double bond. But if the enol is under acidic conditions, perhaps it would tautomerize to a ketone, making the reaction different.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify any conditions, so I'm assuming it's a standard reaction. So perhaps the enol doesn't tautomerize, and the Br adds directly.

Wait, but the product options don't involve an enol. The options are either alcohols with dibromo or ketones with a single Br.

So, if the reaction is a simple addition of Br2, the product would be a vicinal dibromide, so 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Now, looking at the options, options A and D are such products.

Options A and D: A is (1R,2S) configuration, D is (1R,2R). So need to determine the configuration.

Wait, the starting material's configuration: the enol form. Let me imagine the structure of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at C1 (OH) and C4 (two methyl groups).

When Br2 adds across the double bond, the addition is anti, so the Br atoms add from opposite sides, leading to a trans orientation.

Wait, but the stereochemistry depends on the starting structure. Let me think about the geometry of the starting enol. Since the molecule is in an enol form, the double bond is between C1 and C2, with OH on C1. The substituents on C4 are two methyl groups, which are bulky.

When Br2 adds, the mechanism is that Br adds to C1 and C2, each with anti addition. So the diastereomer formed would have the Brs on opposite faces. But wait, the starting molecule is a cyclopentene ring, so the substituents around the ring may influence the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a trans arrangement of the Brs. But the options A and D have different configurations.

Option A is (1R,2S), and option D is (1R,2R). So the question is whether the Brs are on the same face or opposite faces.

Wait, when adding Br2 to a double bond, the addition is typically anti, leading to a trans diastereomer. So the Brs would be on opposite sides of the ring.

But in a cyclic structure, the positions can get a bit tricky. Let me try to imagine the transition state.

The starting molecule, cyclopent-1-enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, with OH on C1. The ring is in a chair-like or boat-like conformation for cyclopentane.

Wait, when adding Br2, the mechanism is that one Br attacks one end of the double bond, and the other Br comes from the other end. Because the addition is anti, the Brs will end up on opposite faces.

But since the ring is small (five-membered), the spatial arrangement may lead to a certain diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring would adopt a certain conformation that leads to a particular configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting molecule is in a certain stereochemistry, but I don't think the question specifies any stereochemistry in the starting material. So perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, the question is more about regiochemistry than stereochemistry.

Wait, but the options A and D have different configurations, but the same regiochemistry.

Wait, but maybe the reaction is not an addition. Wait, if the enol is under certain conditions, maybe it undergoes oxidation or some other reaction.

Wait, another possibility: when enols react with Br2, they can undergo a bromination at the alpha position. But in this case, the enol's double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C1. Br adding to C1 and C2 would make a vicinal dibromide.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol can attack Br2 in a different way, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: since the enol is adjacent to the hydroxyl group, perhaps it's a conjugated dienol, which might undergo a Diels-Alder reaction with Br2 as a dienophile. But Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. Here, the molecule is a dienol, but would it form a diene?

Wait, perhaps not. The enol is a single double bond, so it's a dienophile? Or diene? Wait, a diene has two double bonds. So no, this is a single enol, so it's a dienophile? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation, but no, the reagent is Br2, not an peracid.

So, back to addition. So the product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Now, looking at the options, A and D are such products.

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

Option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

The question is whether the Brs are on the same or opposite sides.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a trans-dibromide, with Brs on opposite faces.

Wait, but the starting molecule's configuration isn't specified, so perhaps the reaction leads to a racemic mixture, but the options don't reflect that.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol's geometry is such that the addition leads to a particular configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting molecule is in a certain chair conformation where the OH is axial or equatorial. But without specific details, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a trans configuration, so the Brs are on opposite faces.

Wait, but in a five-membered ring, the transition state for Br addition would lead to the Brs being on adjacent carbons but in a trans configuration.

So, perhaps the product is a trans-dibromide, which in terms of configuration would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R), depending on the starting structure.

Wait, but the starting molecule's stereochemistry isn't given. So, perhaps the question is more concerned with the regiochemistry than the stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but the options provide specific configurations.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a simple addition but something else.

Wait, another possibility: the enol could react with Br2 in an electrophilic substitution, but I'm not sure about that. Enols are more commonly involved in addition reactions.

Wait, another thought: when the enol reacts, maybe the Br adds to the carbonyl carbon if the enol tautomerizes to the ketone. But without acid or base, would that happen?

Wait, the enol form is more reactive, but without any catalyst, perhaps the tautomerization is not favored. So the reaction is more likely to proceed via the enol.

Wait, so the product after addition would be a vicinal dibromide, making options A and D the possible answers.

Now, the options are about the configuration. So, in the starting material, the enol's OH is on C1, with the double bond between C1 and C2.

When Br adds across the double bond, each Br adds to each carbon, so Br on C1 and Br on C2.

In terms of stereochemistry, the addition of Br2 is anti, leading to a trans configuration between the Brs.

So, in the product, the two Brs are on opposite sides of the ring. Now, the question is what the configuration would be.

Wait, perhaps the starting molecule is such that the OH on C1 is in a specific position, leading to a specific configuration upon addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting molecule is a cis or trans enol. But since it's a cyclopentene, I think the ring is in a certain conformation that leads to a particular stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a diastereomer with Brs on opposite carbons, leading to (1R,2S) configuration.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the product is a trans-dibromide, leading to (1R,2S) configuration.

But without knowing the exact starting configuration, it's challenging. Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to focus on the regiochemistry, not the stereochemistry, making the correct answer either A or D, but which one?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via addition but undergoes some kind of substitution or other reaction.

Wait, another possibility: bromine could abstract a proton, leading to a ring-opening. But that seems less likely in this scenario.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a bromohydrin, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Structure: C1 has OH, double bond to C2, connected to C5. C4 has two methyl groups.

When bromine adds, it adds across C1 and C2, leading to Br on each.

The product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So which option is that? Options A and D.

But the options have different configurations.

Wait, perhaps the diastereomer formed is such that the Brs are on the same face, leading to a cis-dibromide, but I thought the addition was anti.

Wait, no, the addition of bromine is an anti addition, so the Brs are on opposite faces, leading to a trans-dibromide.

But in a ring, trans can be a bit ambiguous. So, for a five-membered ring, the diastereomer would have the Brs on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps the product is a trans dibromide, which would correspond to either (1R,2S) or (1S,2R) configurations. Looking at options A and D: option A is (1R,2S), option D is (1R,2R).

So, (1R,2S) would imply that the Brs are on opposite sides, making a trans configuration. So option A would be correct.

But I'm not entirely certain about the stereochemistry without drawing the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is determined by the starting material's arrangement.

Wait, since the starting material is an enol, perhaps the OH is in a certain position that leads to a specific configuration. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

But among the options, A and D are possible. Let's think about what the major product would be.

Wait, another angle: the enol is more reactive than the ketone, so the reaction occurs as an addition to the enol. So the product is a diol with vicinal dibromide.

But considering that bromine is a good electrophile, the reaction would proceed with anti addition, leading to the trans product.

So, the product would have Brs on opposite faces, making (1R,2S) and (1S,2R) configurations, which are enantiomers. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer or a racemic mixture, the product would have both.

But the options don't have either. So perhaps the question is only concerned with the regiochemistry, not the stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but the options don't reflect that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that the correct answer is option B or C, which are ketone derivatives.

Wait, but earlier I thought the reaction is addition of Br2 across the double bond, leading to an alcohol with Brs. But perhaps the enol is oxidizing to a ketone, and then the Br adds.

Wait, wait, another possibility: if the enol is in a solution where it tautomerizes to the ketone, then the reaction would be different. So, when the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, the double bond is now between C1 and C2 as in the ketone form.

But then, adding Br2 wouldn't add across the double bond in the ketone. Because the ketone is a carbonyl, which is less reactive towards bromine than an enol.

Wait, but in the presence of acid or base, the enol can tautomerize. But without such conditions, perhaps the enol remains as the more reactive form, leading to addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the enol acting as a nucleophile, but I don't think so.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is a ring-opening via electrophilic attack. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol reacts with Br2 to form a bromoketone, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the products.

Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Option C: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

So, these are ketones with a single Br.

So, if the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, perhaps the Br adds to the carbonyl carbon.

But adding Br to a carbonyl would usually require something like a brominating agent, but not Br2. Alternatively, perhaps the enol is oxidized to a ketone first, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another reaction: epoxidation uses peracids, but bromine isn't an oxidizing agent for that.

Wait, perhaps the enol undergoes an acid-catalyzed tautomerization to form the ketone, and then undergoes a bromination at the alpha position.

Wait, but Br2 addition to a ketone's alpha position would require a different mechanism. Maybe via enolate formation, but that typically requires a base.

Alternatively, maybe the enol is brominated at the alpha position, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. For instance, the hydroxyl group is replaced by Br, but that's not likely without a good leaving group and perhaps in an acidic condition.

Wait, another thought: the enol could undergo a bromination at the alpha position, which is adjacent to the carbonyl. But again, without the enol tautomerizing, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol's double bond is more reactive and adds Br, leading to a diol with Brs. So, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, as in options A and D.

So, perhaps the correct answer is A or D.

But focusing on the options, the only way to decide is to figure out the stereochemistry.

Wait, if the addition is anti, then the Brs are on opposite faces. So, looking at the cyclopentanol structure, if the OH is on C1, and Br adds to C1 and C2 in anti fashion, the configuration would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R).

But without the starting configuration, it's hard to say. So perhaps the question expects us to choose based on regiochemistry, making options A and D the possible answers.

Looking back, the question is about the major outcome. So, perhaps the addition is the correct path, making options A and D.

Now, looking at the options, options A and D have different configurations. So, which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is such that the OH is on a specific face, leading to a specific configuration upon addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but the options don't reflect that.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the product structures again.

Option A: (1R,2S)
Option D: (1R,2R)

If the addition leads to the Brs being on the same face, that would be (1R,2R) or (1S,2S). But I thought the addition was anti, leading to trans, which is (1R,2S) or (1S,2R).

So, if the correct product is a trans-dibromide, then option A would be correct.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cis-dibromide, making option D correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the addition leads to the same configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol's geometry leads to a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting enol is such that the OH is on the same face as the methyl groups on C4.

So, when Br adds, the Br on C1 would be on the same face as the OH, and the Br on C2 would be on the opposite face, leading to the (1R,2S) configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (1R,2S), which is option A.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that the correct answer is option B or C, which are ketones.

Wait, but earlier reasoning suggested that the addition reaction is the main pathway, leading to an alcohol product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not addition but some kind of substitution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the enol is more likely to undergo oxidation to a dihydroxy structure, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol reacts with Br2 to form a bromoketone via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. But I don't remember such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol reacts with Br2 to form a bromide at the alpha position.

Wait, in the enol form, the alpha carbons are C2 and C5 (since OH is on C1). So, bromine could add to C2.

Wait, but in an enol, the alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl (if it were in the keto form). But in the enol form, it's adjacent to the OH.

Wait, perhaps the Br adds to the alpha position, leading to a mono-brominated product.

But in that case, the product would be a bromide at C2 or C5, but how would that proceed?

Wait, perhaps the enol is more reactive at the alpha position, leading to bromination there.

So, if the enol reacts with Br2, perhaps the Br adds to the alpha carbon (C2) leading to a bromide at C2.

So, the product would be 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Wait, but the starting material is an enol, not a ketone. So, would the product be a ketone?

Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So, the reaction would involve the enol tautomerizing to the ketone, and then bromine adding to the alpha position.

But why would it tautomerize? Without acid or base, enol and keto tautomerism is not favored. So, perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed bromination, but the question doesn't mention conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol's alpha position is more susceptible to bromine addition, leading to a bromide.

But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cyclopropane formation, but that's another topic.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the right approach is to think that the major product is a vicinal dibromide, leading to options A or D.

But looking back at the options, options A and D are 1,2-dibromocyclopentanol derivatives, while B and C are ketones with a single Br.

So, if the reaction is an addition to the enol, the product would be A or D. If the reaction is a substitution or tautomerization followed by bromination, the product would be B or C.

I think the most straightforward reaction is the addition of Br2 to the double bond, yielding a vicinal dibromide. So the product would be either A or D.

Now, to decide between A and D, which are enantiomers.

But without knowing the starting material's configuration, perhaps the question expects us to choose based on the major product without considering stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the product to be a racemic mixture, but the options don't present that. Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration is such that it's either R,R or R,S.

But how can I determine that?

Alternatively, perhaps the enol has a certain configuration that when Br adds, the Brs are on the same face, making a cis product.

Wait, but the bromine addition is typically anti, leading to trans.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's structure leads to a specific configuration.

Wait, in a cyclopentane ring, the addition of Br2 would lead to a trans-dibromide. So, the Brs are on opposite faces, which in terms of configuration would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R). So, option A is (1R,2S), which would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but the options don't reflect that. So, perhaps option A is the correct answer.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B or C, which are ketone products.

Wait, but the starting material is an enol, which is more reactive towards electrophilic addition than a ketone. So, the addition reaction is more likely.

So, I think the correct answer is either A or D.

But I'm torn between the two. Since the question doesn't specify whether the addition is syn or anti, but I know that bromine addition is anti, leading to trans.

So, the configuration would be (1R,2S), which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the chair conformation of cyclopentane. If the enol is in a certain chair, adding Br2 would lead to a specific configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is option D, (1R,2R), because the addition leads to the same configuration on both carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a meso compound, but for that, the configurations would have to be (1R,2R) and (1S,2S), making a meso form, but that doesn't apply here because the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol would have a plane of symmetry only if the Brs are on the same configuration, but with two methyl groups on C4, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D, (1R,2R), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a cis configuration, making option D correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. I think I'll go with the initial reasoning that the addition is anti, leading to the (1R,2S) configuration, which is option A.


The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine (Br₂) involves the double bond in the enol structure. Enols are highly reactive due to the conjugation between the hydroxyl group and the double bond, making the double bond electron-rich and susceptible to electrophilic addition. Bromine, as an electrophile, adds across the double bond in a typical anti-addition mechanism, forming a vicinal dibromide. 

The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, has the hydroxyl group on C1 and two methyl groups on C4. When Br₂ adds across the double bond between C1 and C2, the bromine atoms are added to these carbons in an anti fashion, resulting in a trans-dibromide. This anti-addition leads to the formation of (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol as the major product.

Options B and C involve ketones with a single bromine atom, but these would require tautomerization of the enol to a ketone and subsequent bromination at the alpha position, which is less likely under the given conditions. Options A and D represent the vicinal dibromide products, but only option A corresponds to the correct (1R,2S) configuration resulting from the anti-addition mechanism.

Thus, the major outcome of the reaction is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.
