Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the mean decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, how do I find the lifetime? Oh, the uncertainty principle! The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ.

Wait, but I should be careful with units. Let me jot down the steps:

1. Find the lifetime τ: τ = ħ / Γ
2. Then, the decay distance L is c * τ
So L = c * ħ / Γ

But wait, the production energy E is given. Hmm, is that relevant? Oh, wait, because the particle is produced with some energy, that affects its velocity and thus the mean path. Oh wait, no, wait. The mean decay length is c * τ, but if the particle is moving, then the actual decay length would depend on the velocity as well. Oh wait, no, I think the formula I have is correct because it's considering the particle's lifetime and speed.

Wait, maybe I should think about the relativistic gamma factor here. Because the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So τ = gamma * (ħ / Γ). Wait, no, because Γ is the total decay width, which is energy-dependent. Hmm, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think again.

The mean proper lifetime τ_0 is ħ / Γ. But because the particle is moving relativistically, the observed lifetime is gamma times τ_0. Gamma is E/(m c^2). Because E is given as 8 GeV, which is the total energy, so gamma is E/(m c^2) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So, the actual lifetime τ is gamma * τ_0 = gamma * (ħ / Γ). Therefore, the decay length L is c * τ = c * gamma * (ħ / Γ).

Wait, wait, wait. Hmm, let me get this straight. The decay width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ_0. So τ_0 is (ħ)/(Γ). But when the particle is moving, the lab frame lifetime is longer by gamma. So τ = gamma * tau_0. So the total decay length is L = v * tau. But wait, v is approximately c for high-energy particles. So L ≈ c * tau = c * gamma * tau_0 = c * gamma * ħ / Γ.

But wait, let me make sure about the units. All units must be consistent. Let's break it down.

First, calculate gamma: gamma = E / m. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so gamma is 8 /1.2 ≈ 6.6667. But wait, E is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. So gamma is (E)/(m c²), but since E and m are given in energy units where c² is accounted for, perhaps it's just E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 6.6667. So gamma is correct.

Now, let's compute tau_0: tau_0 = ħ / Gamma. But Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Gamma = 0.32 GeV. But ħ has units of GeV·s when using natural units. Wait, let me clarify the units.

Wait, ħ in natural units (c=1, ħ=1) is 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So, tau_0 (in seconds) is ħ (in GeV·s) divided by Gamma (in GeV). So:

tau_0 = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, wait: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056e-24 seconds.

Then, tau = gamma * tau_0 = 6.6667 * 2.056e-24 s ≈ 1.3707e-23 seconds.

But wait, that's the lifetime. Now, the decay length is L = v * tau. Since the particle is moving at approximately speed v ≈ c (gamma is large, so v is close to c), we can approximate v as c. So L ≈ c * tau.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So:

L ≈ 3e8 m/s * 1.3707e-23 s ≈ 4.1121e-15 meters.

Hmm. That's around 4.1e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15 m. Hmm, but my approximate calculation is 4.1e-15. So option B is 4.0655e-15, which is close.

But wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations. Let me recompute more accurately.

First, compute gamma: 8 /1.2 = 6.666666666666667.

Compute tau_0: 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Tau = gamma * tau_0 = 6.666666666666667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ let's compute 6.666666667 * 2.056875.

6 * 2.056875 = 12.34125. 0.666666667 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.37125. So total about 13.7125e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, 6.666666667 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Let me compute 6.666666667 * 2.056875:

2.056875 * 6 = 12.34125
2.056875 * 0.666666667 ≈ (2.056875 * 2/3) ≈ 1.37125
Total approximately 12.34125 + 1.37125 = 13.7125.

So 13.7125e-24 s, which is 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Then, L = c * tau.

c is 2.99792e8 m/s. Let's take c≈3e8 m/s for approximation, but perhaps using a more precise value.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = (3 * 1.37125) * 1e-15 m.

3 * 1.37125 = 4.11375, so L ≈4.11375e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, so why is there a discrepancy? Maybe I should compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Let me recompute the tau_0.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV. So tau_0 = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 * 20 = 6.4. 6.582 -6.4 = 0.182. 0.182 / 0.32 ≈ 0.56875. So 20 + 0.56875=20.56875.

So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Yes, that's correct.

Now, gamma is 8 /1.2 = 6.666666666666667.

So tau = 2.056875e-24 * 6.666666667 = ?

Let me compute 2.056875 *6.666666667.

6.666666667 is 20/3.

2.056875 * (20/3) = (2.056875 *20)/3 = 41.1375 /3 ≈ 13.7125.

So 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, L = c * tau = 2.99792e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Calculate 2.99792e8 * 1.37125e-23:

Multiply 2.99792 *1.37125. Let's compute that.

2.99792 *1.37125:

Compute 3 *1.37125 =4.11375, subtract (0.00208 * 1.37125):

0.00208 *1.37125≈ 0.002856. So 4.11375 -0.002856≈4.11089.

So 2.99792 *1.37125 ≈4.11089.

Multiply by 1e8 * 1e-23 = 1e-15.

So L ≈4.11089e-15 m.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 5.0223 *1e-16 m
B)4.0655 *1e-15 m
C)5.0223 *1e-15 m
D)4.0655 *1e-16 m

Hmm, 4.11e-15 is closer to option B (4.0655e-15) but not exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, maybe I should use a more precise value of ħ. Because I approximated ħ as 6.582e-25 GeV·s, but perhaps a more precise value is needed.

The exact value of ħc in GeV·fm is 197.327 MeV·fm, but wait, maybe I should stick to ħ in GeV·s.

Wait, Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s. ħ is h/(2pi)= 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Convert ħ into GeV·s. 1 GeV = 1.60218e-10 J. So 1 GeV·s is 1.60218e-10 J·s.

So ħ in GeV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.60218e-10 J/GeV) ) = (1.0545718e-34 / 1.60218e-10) GeV·s.

1e-34 /1e-10 = 1e-24. So 1.0545718e-34 /1.60218e-10 ≈ (1.0545718 / 1.60218 ) * 1e-24 ≈ 0.65867 * 1e-24 GeV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.5867e-25 GeV·s.

I used 6.582e-25 earlier, which is accurate enough. So that part is okay.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E/(m c²). Since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², the c² cancels out, so gamma is E/(m) = 8/1.2 = 6.666666666666667. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of L is more accurate if I use c=2.99792458e8 m/s, not 3e8. Let me compute that.

So L = c * tau.

c=2.99792458e8 m/s.

Tau is 1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply 2.99792458e8 * 1.37125e-23 = ?

Compute 2.99792458 * 1.3712
