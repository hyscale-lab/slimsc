Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? They also give c as 1, the speed of light in a vacuum.

Hmm. So the glass is moving, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. But wait, no—the glass is moving toward the observer, so if the light is propagating in the same direction as the beam is moving toward the observer... Wait, no, the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So as the glass moves, the light is moving within it.

Wait, no, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going through the glass, and the glass is moving towards the observer. That might not make sense, because if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, then the beam is moving towards the observer as well. But I'm a bit confused about the setup.

Wait, let me parse the question again. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, which is toward the observer. So both the glass and the light are moving towards the observer.

Wait, but the speed of the light in the glass is c/n, right? Because in a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c divided by n. But wait, the speed of light in the medium depends on the medium's velocity relative to the observer. Hmm, no, wait. The index of refraction is a property of the medium, so the speed of light in the medium is c/n, regardless of the medium's movement. But wait, no—because in reality, the speed of light in a medium depends on the frame of reference. Or does it?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's consider the problem more carefully. The glass is moving with velocity v relative to the lab frame. The light is propagating within the glass. So from the lab frame, what is the speed of the light?

In the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. Because in that frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n towards whatever direction. Now, given that the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, we need to apply a velocity transformation to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I remember the correct transformation. Oh right, the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab, and in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the lab frame would see a different velocity.

Wait, but the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, which is towards the observer. So in the glass frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity (let's say the positive x-direction). So the velocity transformation formula would apply here.

The velocity transformation formula in special relativity is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). Since c is 1 in our case, that simplifies the formula.

So u' is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, which is c/n (since the speed is c/n). So plugging into the formula:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) )

But wait, the glass is moving towards the observer. So if the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving toward them, then the velocity v of the glass is positive in the direction towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so in the glass's frame, it's moving in the positive direction. So both u' and v are positive.

Wait, but wait. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the light's velocity in the lab frame would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass frame, but adjusted for relativity.

But let me compute this. Let me write the formula again:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

Since c=1, it's (u' + v)/(1 + u' v )

But u' is c/n. So substituting:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (c/n) * v )

But wait, what's c here? Oh, in the problem, c is 1, so c=1. So u' is 1/n.

So plugging that in:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v )

Hmm, that would be the speed of light in the lab frame.

But looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v)

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1 + n v )? Let's see, if I factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator.

Wait, u = [ (1/n + v) ] / [ 1 + v/n ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to simplify:

Numerator: (1 + n v )

Denominator: (n + v )

So u = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Which matches option A.

So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, wait a second. But wait, the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So in the lab frame, the light's velocity is higher than in the glass frame. So according to the calculation, it's (1 +n v)/(n +v). But wait, when v is positive (towards the observer), and n is positive, the numerator is 1 + n v, denominator is n +v. But if v is positive, does that make the velocity of the light greater than c/n? Let's see.

Wait, if the glass isn't moving (v=0), then u should be 1/n, which is correct. So when v=0, option A gives (1 +0)/(n +0 )= 1/n. That's correct.

Another check: suppose v approaches 1 (the speed of light), but physically, that's not possible, but let's see. Then the numerator would be 1 +n(1) = 1 +n, denominator n+1. So u would be (n+1)/(n+1 )=1. Which is correct because in that case, the speed can't exceed c=1. So that seems right.

Hmm, but wait, could the glass moving towards the observer affect the speed of light? Because according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. Wait, wait! Wait a minute. Wait, that's a key point.

Wait, I'm making a mistake here. Because in any inertial frame, the speed of light should be measured as c. But wait, in this setup, the glass is moving relative to the lab, and the light is inside the glass, so according to the lab frame, the speed shouldn't exceed c. But according to my calculation, if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, the speed could be higher than c/n, but not higher than c. Wait, but according to the calculation, in the limit when v is very high, the speed approaches 1, which is correct.

Wait, but wait, the speed of light in the glass as measured in the lab frame can't exceed c, right? So the formula I used must ensure that.

Wait, but wait again. Wait, the speed of light in the glass (in its rest frame) is c/n, which is less than c. But when you add velocities, the sum can't exceed c.

Wait, the formula I used is the relativistic velocity addition formula. So it's correct because it ensures that u approaches c as v approaches c.

But in the problem, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light's speed in the glass is c/n. So according to the formula, the lab frame will measure the speed as (c/n + v)/(1 + (c/n v)).

But wait, another way to think: in the lab frame, the glass is moving with speed v. So the light's speed in the lab frame should be the speed in the glass frame plus v, but adjusted by relativity.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think differently. Suppose the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So for example, the glass moves towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be higher than in the glass frame.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I used the velocity addition formula, which correctly gives the lab frame's speed as (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² ). Since u' is c/n, which is less than c, and v is less than c, the sum won't exceed c.

But according to the calculation, when v is positive, the speed of light in the lab frame would be (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which I thought matched option A.

Wait, but let's think of another approach. The speed of light in the medium (glass) is c/n. But when the medium itself is moving, does the speed of light in the medium change? Or is it that the speed of the light as observed in the lab is v_light = v_medium + v_light_in_medium? But that's in classical mechanics, which doesn't hold in relativity.

Wait, but in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. So the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition.

So putting that together, the correct formula is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² ), which gives the lab frame speed as ( (1/n ) + v ) / (1 + (1/n ) v ), which simplifies to (1 +n v )/(n +v ), which is option A.

But wait, wait another thing. The problem says the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be towards the observer, but the glass's speed is also towards the observer. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement.

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n in the direction of the glass's motion. So in the lab frame, the light's speed is higher than c/n, but less than or equal to c.

So the result seems to make sense.

Wait, but another thought: the glass is moving towards the observer, so v is positive. The light is moving in the same direction, so u' is positive (c/n). So the velocities are additive in the same direction, but adjusted by the Lorentz factor.

So the calculation seems correct, leading to option A being the right answer.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Option B: 1 → That's the speed of light in vacuum, but the light is in glass, so unless the velocity addition gives speed c, which only happens in certain cases.

Wait, but when would u equal 1? Let's see:

(1 +n v)/(n +v ) = 1 → 1 +n v = n +v → 1 = n (1 -v) + v → Hmm, perhaps when v is in a certain relation to n, but generally, it's not 1.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) toward the observer, and the light beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the index of refraction of the glass, and \( c = 1 \) in this problem.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{1}{n} v}
\]

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. 

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) — This is the correct result derived from the relativistic velocity addition formula.
- **Option B**: \( 1 \) — This represents the speed of light in a vacuum, but the light is propagating through a medium (glass), so this is incorrect.
- **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) — This has an incorrect denominator and does not match the derived formula.
- **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) — This has an incorrect numerator and does not match the derived formula.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
