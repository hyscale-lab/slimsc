Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem gives me some information about their sizes, masses, wavelengths of brightness, and radial velocities. Then it asks about the ratio of their luminosities.

First, I'll read through the question again carefully.

So, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Both the radius and mass are 1.5 times larger for Star_1. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, respectively. We're told to assume they radiate as black bodies and find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

Wait, the key points are that both stars have the same wavelength of maximum brightness. Oh, right, that's related to their temperatures. Because for a black body, the wavelength at which the emission is a maximum is given by Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K). So if lambda_max is the same for both, their temperatures must be the same. Because lambda is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, is that correct? Yeah, because if lambda_max is the same for both, then T1 must equal T2.

So, the stars have the same temperature. Then, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, since both have the same T, the ratio of their luminosities will be (R1² / R2²). Because the other factors (4π σ) are the same for both.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1² = (1.5)^2 R2² = 2.25 R2². So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (2.25 R2² / R2²) = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2.

But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything else.

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s radial velocity, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. But how does that affect luminosity? Oh, wait, I think I might be confusing luminosity with brightness, which is flux. Because flux depends on distance, but luminosity is intrinsic. So if the question is about intrinsic luminosity, the radial velocity doesn't affect it.

Wait, the question says the astronomers computed the luminosity. Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, so it's independent of distance or velocity. So the radial velocities don't come into play here. So maybe I don't need to consider them. Hmm... but why are they given then? Maybe it's a red herring, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed wavelength, but since the problem states that the maximum emission wavelengths are the same, that's already accounted for the Doppler effect. Wait, the radial velocity is the Doppler shift. So if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength changes. But in the problem, the calculated wavelengths are the same. So perhaps that affects the temperature calculation.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The observed wavelength maximum is the same for both stars. But if the star is moving, there's a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength.

So, the formula for the Doppler effect is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, but it's a bit more precise. For velocities much less than the speed of light, the approximation is lambda_obs ≈ lambda_rest (1 + v_r / c). Depending on whether the star is moving away (v_r positive) or towards (v_r negative). But in this case, Star_1 has v_r=0, so lambda_obs_1 = lambda_rest_1. Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s, which is moving away, so lambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 (1 + 700e3 / c), where c is the speed of light.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2.

So:

lambda_rest_1 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But wait, Star_1's observed lambda is same as Star_2's observed lambda. Since Star_1 has v_r=0, lambda_rest_1 = lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2. And Star_2's lambda_obs_2 is lambda_rest_2 * (1 + 700e3 / c). So, setting lambda_rest_1 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + 700e3 / c).

But from Wien's law, lambda_rest is proportional to 1/T. So:

lambda_rest_1 = (b / T1)
lambda_rest_2 = (b / T2)

So,

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

But wait, wait. Since Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength. So the rest wavelength is shorter. So, the rest wavelength of Star_2 would be lambda_rest_2 = lambda_obs_2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Doppler shift formula correctly. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c ), assuming v_r is positive when moving away.

So, since Star_1 is at rest, lambda_obs_1 = lambda_rest_1.

Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so lambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + 700e3 / c )

But the problem states that both observed lambdas are the same: lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2.

So,

lambda_rest_1 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + 700e3 / c )

But from Wien's law,

lambda_rest_1 = b / T1

lambda_rest_2 = b / T2

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + 700e3 / c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + 700e3/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + 700e3/c )

But 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.002333.

So 1 + (7e5 / 3e8) ≈ 1.002333.

So,

T1 ≈ T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.00233) [using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.]

But wait, if the stars have the same observed wavelength, but one has a higher radial velocity, their rest wavelengths are different. So their temperatures are different.

Wait, so earlier I thought that T1 = T2 because their observed lambdas were same, but that was incorrect because of the Doppler effect. So that changes everything.

So, with that in mind, the temperatures are not the same.

Hmm, okay, so this complicates things. So I can't just say T1 = T2. I have to calculate the temperature ratio.

Let me re-calculate T1 and T2.

Given that,

lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2.

So,

lambda_rest_1 = lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2.

But lambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

lambda_rest_1 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But,

lambda_rest_1 = b / T1

lambda_rest_2 = b / T2

So,

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Now, with v_r2 = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s.

c is about 3e8 m/s.

So,

v_r2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.002333.

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767.

So, T1 is approximately 0.99767 times T2.

Wait, but that's a very small difference. So T1 is slightly less than T2.

Now, back to the luminosity.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2 )² * (T1⁴) ) / ( R2² (T2^4) )

Simplify,

= (2.25 R2²) * (T1^4) / ( R2² T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= 2.25 * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

We already found that T1/T2 ≈ 0.99767.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4.

Let's compute 0.99767^4.

First, 0.99767 is approximately 1 - 0.00233.

Using the approximation (1 - x)^n ≈ 1 - n x for small x.

n=4, x=0.00233.

So,

(0.99767)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*(0.00233) = 1 - 0.00932 = 0.99068.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps calculate 0.99767^4:

Let me compute 0.99767 squared first.

0.99767 * 0.99767 ≈ (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 → 1 - 0.00466 + 5.4289e-6 ≈ 0.99534 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.995345.

Then square that result to get to the 4th power.

So (0.995345)^2 ≈ ?

0.995345 * 0.995345 ≈ (1 - 0.004655)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004655 + (0.004655)^2 → 1 - 0.00931 + 0.00002166 → approximately 0.99068 + 0.00002166 ≈ 0.99070.

So, (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So, the luminosity ratio is 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Let me compute that.

2.25 * 0.9907 = ?

Well, 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275. Then 2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So, total is approximately 2.2275 + 0.001575 ≈ 2.229075.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but wait. Did I make any mistake in the calculations?

Let me double-check.

Because I think I might have missed a step in considering the Doppler shift correctly.

Wait, let me redo the Doppler shift part carefully.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c )

But wait, when a star is moving away (positive v_r), the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. So, for Star_2, which is moving away, lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars. So,

lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

But lambda_obs1 is the same as lambda_rest1 because Star_1's radial velocity is zero.

So,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Which leads to T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Which, as v_r2 is positive (moving away), so 1 + v_r2/c is >1, so T1 < T2.

So, T1 is less than T2.

So, the luminosity L = 4π R^2 sigma T^4.

So,

L1 = 4pi (R1)^2 sigma T1^4.

L2 = 4pi (R2)^2 sigma T2^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) ( (T1/T2)^4 )

= 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= 2.25 * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

We found that T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v_r2/c )

v_r2 is 7e5 m/s, c=3e8 m/s.

v_r2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0023333.

So,

(T1/T2) = 1/(1 + 0.002333) ≈ 0.997667.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.997667)^4.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 0.997667^2:

0.997667 * 0.997667.

Let me compute this using a calculator-like approach:

(1 - 0.002333)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.004666 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.9953394.

Then, square that to get the fourth power:

(0.9953394)^2.

Compute 0.9953394 * 0.9953394.

Again, approximate using (1 - 0.0046606)^2.

Which is 1 - 2*0.0046606 + (0.0046606)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0093212 + 0.0000217 ≈ 0.9906785 + 0.0000217 = 0.9907002.

So, (0.997667)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

Then,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 = ?

Let me compute 2.25 * 0.9907.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

0.0007 * 2.25 = 0.001575.

So total is approximately 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

So, the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~2.23.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since the stars radiate as black bodies, the luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Substituting this into the formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{1.5 R_2}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4}
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\)). Using Wien's law (\(\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}\)) and the Doppler shift formula (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c)\)), we relate the rest wavelengths and temperatures of the stars.

For Star_1 (at rest, \(v_r = 0\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,1}}
\]

For Star_2 (moving away with \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate the rest wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Using Wien's law (\(\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T\)):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}
\]

Substituting \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} = 7 \times 10^5 \, \text{m/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{7 \times 10^5}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.002333} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substitute the temperature ratio into the luminosity formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (0.99767)^4
\]

Using the approximation \((1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x\) for small \(x\), where \(x = 0.002333\):

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.002333) = 1 - 0.009332 = 0.99067
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99067 \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2.
