Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The system is isolated, so I guess that means energy isn't being exchanged with the outside, but that might not matter for calculating the potential energy. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges relates to the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But wait, since all the charges are the same, I think there's a formula for calculating the potential energy between multiple identical charges.

Wait, the formula for the potential energy of a configuration of point charges is given by U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Σ (q_i q_j)/r_ij), where i < j. Oh right, because each pair is considered once. So for identical charges, it's easier because all the q_i are the same.

In this case, we have 13 charges: 12 at a distance of 2m from point P, and one fixed at P. So the 13th charge is at P, and the others are around it at 2m. Let me visualize this—like a central charge with 12 others arranged in some way around it, each 2m away.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed at 2m, each. So, each of the 12 charges is a distance of 2m from P. The 13th is at P.

So, the system consists of one charge at P and 12 charges at 2m from P. So the potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

But wait, in this setup, the 13th charge (at P) interacts with each of the 12 charges at 2m. Then, each of the 12 charges also interacts with the others. So we have two components to calculate: the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 surrounding charges.

Wait, but wait a second. The 12 surrounding charges are all at the same distance from P. Are they spaced in a way that their mutual distances are more than 2m, or maybe arranged in a circle? Oh, but the problem doesn't specify their exact arrangement. Hmm, that complicates things because the mutual distances between the 12 charges would affect the potential energy. But wait, since they are all at 2m from P, perhaps they are arranged on a sphere of radius 2m. But without knowing the exact arrangement, how can we calculate their mutual potential energies?

Oh, wait, maybe the problem is simplified, considering only the potential between the central charge and the surrounding 12 charges, and perhaps the mutual potential among the 12 is negligible or not considered? No, that doesn't seem right because the problem states it's an isolated system, so all interactions matter. But wait, perhaps the
