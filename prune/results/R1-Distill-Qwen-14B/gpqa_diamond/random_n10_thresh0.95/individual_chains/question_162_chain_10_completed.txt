Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is like a surface of constant negative curvature, right? But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think.

The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Oh, so it's a two-dimensional metric written in terms of x and y coordinates. I think this might be describing some kind of space with curvature, perhaps a hyperbolic space?

Wait, pseudosphere is a specific example of a surface with constant negative curvature. But in differential geometry terms, the metric would look a certain way. What's the general form of a metric for a space of constant curvature? Oh right, in two dimensions, the metric can be written in isothermal coordinates, like ds² = (2r²/(R² - r²)) (dx² + dy²), where r² = x² + y² and R is a constant related to the curvature. Or wait, I might be mixing up some terms.

Wait, more accurately, the metric for hyperbolic space in the Poincaré disk model is ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate and θ is the angular coordinate. But the given metric is in terms of dx and dy, so maybe it's using Cartesian coordinates instead of polar.

So let me try to transform the given metric into polar coordinates. Let's set r² = x² + y². Then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So substituting that into the given metric:

ds² = [32 / (4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²)

Wait, but in the standard Poincaré disk model, the metric is ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). Comparing, our metric's denominator is (4 - r²) which is 4(1 - (r²/4)), so 4(1 - (r²/4)) in the denominator.

Let me write our metric as:

ds² = (32)/(4(1 - (r²/4))) ) (dr² + r² dθ²)
= (8)/(1 - r²/4) (dr² + r² dθ²)

Hmm, but the standard Poincaré metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, our metric's denominator is (1 - r²/4) and the numerator is 8. Let me see: 8/(1 - r²/4) = 32/(4 - r²). So the scaling factors are different. 

Wait, maybe I should compare the curvature. The curvature of hyperbolic space is negative, right? The Gaussian curvature K is given by -1/( (a)^2 ), where a is a scaling factor. Or perhaps for the Poincaré disk, the curvature is K = -1/(a^2), with a being the radius of the disk. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think more carefully.

The Gaussian curvature for the Poincaré metric is K = -1/(a^2), where a is the radius of the disk. In our case, maybe the metric is scaled differently. Let's see: The given metric's denominator is (4 - r²), so 4 is the radius squared. So that would correspond to a radius of 2, perhaps? Because in the Poincaré model, the radius is the boundary at r=1 (in their coordinates), but if our metric has 4 - r², then r can go up to 2. So maybe the model is scaled with a radius of 2.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, that's interesting. The pseudosphere is a surface embedded in three-dimensional space, but maybe here the metric represents it in a certain coordinate system.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. I remember that the area of a pseudosphere is 4π r². But wait, no, wait! No, that's the area of a regular sphere. For a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, the area is actually infinite. Because as you go to larger r, the area keeps increasing, right? Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, no, the area of a pseudosphere is actually finite because it's a finite surface. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and it's a complete surface. So its total area is finite. But wait, wait, does that make sense? Because in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a disk grows exponentially with radius. So, for a pseudosphere, which is like a surface that's everywhere negatively curved, the area might be finite. Wait, but in reality, the pseudosphere is a surface that's infinitely long in some sense. Hmm, no, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the metric given, and asking about the area of the pseudosphere embedded in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the area is being considered in the context of the metric given.

Wait, let's get back to the metric. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 -x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, we can write this as:

ds² = [32 / (4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²)

So, the line element is expressed in terms of r and θ. The area element would be sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dr dθ, since it's diagonal. So g_rr is 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ is 32 r²/(4 - r²). So the area element is sqrt( (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) dr dθ. Let's compute that.

sqrt( (32/(4 - r^2)) * (32 r²/(4 - r^2)) ) = sqrt( (1024 r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2 ) = (32 r)/(4 - r^2).

So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r^2) dr dθ.

So the total area would be the integral over r and θ. But what are the limits of integration?

r can go from 0 up to 2. Because the denominator becomes zero when r² =4, so r=2. So r goes from 0 to 2.

θ goes from 0 to 2π.

So the area is the integral from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π of (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral.

First, integrate over θ: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So total area = 2π ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫u=4 to u=0 [32 r dr / u ] = ∫4^0 [32 (r dr) / u ]

But since r dr = -du/2, we have:

32 * ∫4^0 [ (-du/2) / u ] =32 * (1/2) ∫0^4 (du/u )

Wait, let me make this substitution properly.

Wait, 32 r dr / (4 - r²) = 32 * (r dr) / u.

But r dr = (-1/2) du.

So substituting, it's 32 * (-1/2) du / u = -16 du / u.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (-16 du/u) = -16 [ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but wait, integrating from 4 to 0 would be:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this is -16 [ (-infty) - ln(4) ] → -16 [ -infty ] → positive infinity.

Wait, but let me check the substitution again.

Wait, when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the substitution would change the limits from u=4 to u=0. The integral is from 4 to 0 of [ 32 r dr / (4 - r²) ] becomes when we substitute u=4 - r²:

32 * ∫ (r dr) / u → 32 * ∫ ( (-du/2) ) / u → -16 ∫ (du/u )

So ∫ from u=4 to u=0: -16 [ ln u ] from 4 to 0 → -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so ln(0) minus ln(4) is (-infty - ln4), which is -infty.

Multiply by -16, the integral becomes (-16)(-infty) → +infty.

So the integral diverges, which means the area is infinite.

Wait, but wait, the area element depends on r, and integrating up to r=2 would be at the edge of the coordinate system. So the integral is diverging, meaning the area is infinite.

But the question is about the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but in this metric, r=2 is the edge where the denominator becomes zero. So perhaps the pseudosphere is represented up to r=2, but the area is infinite.

But wait, I thought the pseudosphere is a finite surface. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the concept. Alternatively, perhaps the coordinate system is only defined up to r=2, and beyond that, it goes to infinity, leading to an infinite area.

Wait, but in reality, the pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) has finite area. So maybe this is a case where the representation in this coordinate system leads to an infinite area, but the actual pseudosphere's area is finite. Hmm, but the question is about the area according to the given metric.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So it's a model of hyperbolic space. The area of the entire space would be infinite, but the question is about the pseudosphere, which is a surface. Oh wait, perhaps the pseudosphere is represented here, and its area is finite.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. The pseudosphere is a surface, so in this metric, what is its area?

Wait, no, the metric given is a two-dimensional metric. So the 'pseudosphere' in this context is the entire space described by the metric. So if the metric's coordinates go up to r=2, the area would be the integral we computed, which diverges. So the area would be infinite.

But wait, looking at the options: Option D is +infty. So that's an option.

Wait, but let me think again. What's the formula for the area of a pseudosphere? I thought it's 4π r², but that's the sphere. For a pseudosphere, perhaps it's different. Or maybe in this case, because the metric is a representation of hyperbolic space, the area is infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is actually representing a sphere instead of a pseudosphere, but that seems unlikely because of the denominator.

Wait, another angle. The given metric is conformally flat, since it's expressed as a function times (dx² + dy²). So the area element is just the function times dx dy.

So the area is the integral over the domain where the denominator is positive. The denominator is 4 - x² - y², which is positive when x² + y² <4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2. The area is ∫∫ (32/(4 -x² - y²)) dx dy.

Converting to polar coordinates: 32 ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) (1/(4 - r²)) r dθ dr.

The integral over θ is 2π. So:

Area = 32 * 2π ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-du/2) = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

32 * 2π ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 64π ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) ( (-du/2) / u )

Which is 64π * (-1/2) ∫4^0 (du/u ) = 64π * (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Which is 64π * (-1/2) ( ln 0 - ln4 )

But ln0 is -infinity, so it's 64π * (-1/2) ( -infty - ln4 ) → 64π * (-1/2) * (-infty) → 64π * (infty/2) → infinity.

So the area is infinite. So the correct answer would be option D) +infty.

Wait, but the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2". So according to this, the area is infinite. So option D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This describes a two-dimensional space with negative curvature, resembling hyperbolic geometry. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we compute the total area using the metric. Converting to polar coordinates (\( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \)) and noting that \( dx^2 + dy^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 \), the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in polar coordinates is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta}} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \( \theta \):

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Now, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the limits change from \( r = 0 \) (\( u = 4 \)) to \( r = 2 \) (\( u = 0 \)). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-16}{u} \, du = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln u\right]_4^0 = -16 \left(\ln 0 - \ln 4\right).
\]

Since \( \ln 0 = -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Thus, the total area is infinite.

The pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is represented by this metric, and the area diverges due to the curvature and the coordinate system's limits. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
