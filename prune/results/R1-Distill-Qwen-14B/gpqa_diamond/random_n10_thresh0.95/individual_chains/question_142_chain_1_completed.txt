Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, no, is that right? Oh wait, yeah, that's what's written. So I need to find where this matrix is located geometrically in the qubit space. The options are points in 3D space, so I'm guessing it's represented on the Bloch sphere or something like that.

Wait, what do I remember about density matrices? A density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (like a point on the Bloch sphere) and σ are the Pauli matrices.

Let me write down the given ρ. It's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Wait, that can be rewritten. Because |0⟩⟨0| is the outer product, same for |1⟩⟨1|. So when I add those two, they're diagonal matrices. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]], so adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal.

Wait a second, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because when a qubit is in a completely mixed state, it's in the completely depolarized state, which is the same as the classical state with no information. So this ρ represents a completely mixed state.

Now, how is this represented on the Bloch sphere? The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state is at the origin because it's the average over all possible states, so r would be zero.

Wait, but let me think about the general form again. The general density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So if the state is the completely mixed state, the density matrix is (I)/2 because the terms with r would be zero. So in that case, r would be (0,0,0), right?

So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the geometrical position is at the origin.

Wait, but let me make sure. The Bloch vector r determines the state. For the maximally mixed state, since it's ½ (|0><0| + |1><1|), which is the same as ½ I, that would correspond to r being zero. Because any deviation from r=0 would make the state have some coherence or a different mixture.

Therefore, the correct option is C) r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a qubit, which corresponds to a completely depolarized state. In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states lie on the surface, and mixed states lie inside. For the maximally mixed state, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is zero because there are no coherences or deviations from the completely mixed state. 

The general form of a qubit density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. For the given density matrix, the terms involving \( \mathbf{r} \) are zero, meaning \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).

Answer: C
