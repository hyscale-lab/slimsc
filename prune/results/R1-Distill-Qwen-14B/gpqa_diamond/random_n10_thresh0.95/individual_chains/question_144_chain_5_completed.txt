Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and there are four options to choose from.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula I think is L = γ * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime. But wait, how do I find τ?

Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ. The uncertainty principle says Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I need to make sure about the units here. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something like that. Let me think about the constants.

I remember that ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. Oh right, in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but when converting to SI units, I need to be careful.

So Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = about 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 6.582 / 0.32 is, let's see, 6.582 ÷ 0.32. 0.32 × 20 is 6.4, so 20.56875? So yeah, 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But wait, that can't be right. Because if the width is 320 MeV, which is a large width, the lifetime should be short. But 2e-24 seconds is a very short time. Hmm, maybe that's correct because larger width means shorter lifetime.

Now, moving on. The next step is to find the Lorentz factor γ. γ is given by E / (m c²), but since we're working in units where c is 1, it's E / m. So E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So approximately 6.6667.

But wait, wait. The production energy is E_X, but when calculating gamma, it's the total energy divided by the rest mass. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the velocity beta (β) is sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Wait, no, let me think again. The relation is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So β can be found as sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Alternatively, since γ is about 6.6667, β is approximately sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444))) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887c.

But wait, maybe I should calculate it more precisely. Let me compute 1/(γ^2) = (1.2/8)^2 = (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775... Hmm, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887.

The lifetime τ is the proper lifetime, so the actual lifetime from the lab frame is γ times that. So the lifetime in the lab frame is γ * τ. Wait no, wait. Wait, no. The proper lifetime is τ, the lifetime from the lab frame is longer by γ, so t = γ τ. Because moving clocks run slower, so the proper time is shorter. Wait, no, wait. Think about it: in the rest frame of the meson, it lives for τ. In the lab frame, which sees it moving, the lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma. So the mean lifetime is t = γ τ.

So the total lifetime in the lab frame is t = γ * τ. So that's (8/1.2) * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) GeV·s / GeV → the GeV cancels, right. So the time is t = (8/1.2) * (6.582e-25) / (0.32) seconds.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ as Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ. So t = γ τ = γ * (ħ / Γ).

So plugging in the numbers, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So ħ/Γ is about 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Multiply that by gamma, which is 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6666667.

So t = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ let's compute that.

2.056875e-24 * 6.6666667 ≈ 1.371047e-23 seconds.

Wait, but that's the time. Now, the mean decay distance is L = v * t, where v is the velocity. Well, v = β c. So β is about 0.9887, so v = 0.9887 * c.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.9887 * c * t.

So let's compute that.

v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

t is approximately 1.371047e-23 seconds.

So L = 2.9661e8 m/s * 1.371047e-23 s.

Multiply those together: 2.9661e8 * 1.371047e-23.

Let me compute 2.9661 * 1.371047 ≈ about 4.065. Wait, 2.9661 * 1.371047: 2 *1.37 is 2.74, 0.9661 *1.37 is about 1.318, so total around 4.058.

So 4.058e-15 meters.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

2.9661e8 m/s * 1.371047e-23 s = (2.9661 * 1.371047) * 1e8 * 1e-23 m.

2.9661 * 1.371047 ≈ let's compute that.

2 * 1.371 is 2.742.

0.9661 * 1.371 is approximately:

0.9 * 1.371 = 1.2339,
0.0661 *1.371 ≈ 0.0906.

So 1.2339 + 0.0906 ≈ 1.3245.

So total 2.742 + 1.3245 ≈ 4.0665.

So 4.0665 × 1e-15 meters, which is approximately 4.0665e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Because sometimes you can slip up on the exponents.

Wait, 2.9661e8 m/s multiplied by 1.371047e-23 s.

So 2.9661e8 is 2.9661 × 1e8, and 1.371047e-23 is 1.371047 × 1e-23.

Multiply them: 2.9661 * 1.371047 = approx 4.0665, as before.

Multiply exponents: 1e8 * 1e-23 = 1e-15.

So yes, 4.0665e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15. That's very close. So option B is the correct one.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for decay distance:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, given by \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} \),
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light, \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime, related to the width \( \Gamma_X \) by \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} \),
- \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
Using \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the lab-frame lifetime
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is multiplied by \( \gamma \) to find the lab-frame lifetime:

\[
t = \gamma \tau = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.371047 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( L \)
The decay distance is \( L = \beta c t \). Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( t \approx 1.371047 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 1.371047 \times 10^{-23}
\]

First, calculate the product of constants:

\[
0.9887 \times 3 \times 1.371047 \approx 4.0665
\]

Then, combine the powers of 10:

\[
L \approx 4.0665 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 4.0665 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
