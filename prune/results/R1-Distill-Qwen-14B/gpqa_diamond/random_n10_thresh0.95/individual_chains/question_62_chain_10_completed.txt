--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct reagent sequence to synthesize this compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, the target molecule looks a bit complex. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl (aldehyde) group attached. Then, attached to the cyclohexane is a methyl group, which is also connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group (hydroxy). So the structure would be something like a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde, and a substituent that's a methyl group linked to another cyclohexane and an OH.

Now, starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (a triple bond attached, so like CH2C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane). So I need to transform this into the target.

Let's think about the steps involved. I'll probably need to add groups to the ethynylcyclohexane in some way. Maybe functionalizing the triple bond.

Step 1: Looking at the options, the first reagent in each is either NaNH2 and some chloride or something else. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, like in elimination reactions or for forming enolates. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl, so perhaps a methyl group is being added. Wait, but where? If we have ethynylcyclohexane, adding methyl via CH3Cl under a base like NaNH2 might be a deprotonation and alkylation. So maybe the ethynyl group is being converted into something else.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So if we do a deprotonation with NaNH2, we might remove the acidic proton from the triple bond. The triple bond's terminal protons are acidic. So NaNH2 could deprotonate it to form a cyclohexenyl lithium or similar, but wait, another option is that the deprotonation leads to a nucleophilic acetylide. Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide. So that would add a methyl group to the triple bond.

Wait, the reaction would be: ethynylcyclohexane + NaNH2 (deprotonates) → cyclohexylacetylide. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react with the acetylide to form CH2C≡C-CH2-... but wait, let me think again. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating the terminal proton (which is on the C≡CH) gives cyclohexylacetylide: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- + NH2^-.

Then, treating with methyl chloride (CH3Cl): the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, giving cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. So, the product would have a triple bond now as part of a longer chain.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. After deprotonation and alkylation, the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3? Or is it CH2-C-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the acetylide (CH2-C≡C^-) reacts with CH3Cl to form CH2-C≡C-CH3. So the structure after step 1 would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

So the first step is adding a methyl group via an alkylation of the acetylide.

Next steps: Looking at the options, let's see what each option does.

Option A's second reagent is H2 with Pd. That's hydrogenation, which would add H2 across a triple bond, converting it into a single bond. So cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would reduce it to a single bond, so the triple becomes a single, so CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would make a four-membered chain? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, if I have CH2-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would add two H's across the triple bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the triple bond is C≡C, adding H2 would make it CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait, the triple bond is between the two carbons. So hydrogenation would make it a single bond. So CH2-CH2-CH3 would be ethyl, but wait, the structure is CH2-C≡C-CH3. So hydrogenation would turn that into CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me draw this.

The structure is:

cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3

Hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would add H2 across the triple bond:

cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 ?

Wait, no, because the triple bond is between the two central carbons. So CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right. Because the triple bond is between two carbons. So each C has two H's. So hydrogenation would make each have two H's on each C. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? But wait, no, the initial structure is CH2-C≡C-CH3. So after hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond, which would be a four-carbon chain, but that doesn't make sense because the triple bond is between the two middle carbons. So actually, cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, but then that's a four-carbon chain, but the starting material after step 1 is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3, so after hydrogenation, it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is cyclohexane with a butyl group. But that's not what the target molecule is. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a methyl, so perhaps that's not the right path.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond. Wait, no, because H2 with Pd is usually for full hydrogenation, turning triple bond into single. So this might not be the right path.

Looking at step 3 in option A: Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is often used for epoxidation? No, wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Wait, another option: Ba(OH)2 in aqueous conditions, like in the presence of H2SO4 and HgSO4, H2O. Oh, wait, the third step in option A is Ba(OH)2, then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like oxymercuration or some kind of hydration.

Wait, but that's more than one step. Let me reconsider the options.

Looking at option C: Steps are 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent which is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl.

So perhaps the substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane? So maybe the process involves adding a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group to a methyl group attached to the main cyclohexane.

Hmm. Let's think about the steps required.

Starting from ethynylcyclohexane.

Step 1: Maybe functionalizing the triple bond to add substituents.

Then, perhaps hydrogenating the triple bond to a double bond, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps adding a carbonyl group.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde group. So maybe we need an oxidation step.

Wait, the target molecule is a cyclohexane with a -CHO group and a substituent that's a cyclohexyl (which is another cyclohexane ring) attached via a methyl group that has a hydroxyl group.

Wait, so the substituent is a methyl group attached to both the main cyclohexane and another cyclohexane, and that methyl also has a hydroxyl group.

So perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl that also has a hydroxyl group. So maybe that comes from some kind of ring-opening or substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via some kind of addition.

Wait, maybe the synthesis involves forming a ketone, then reducing it to an alcohol, then oxidizing to a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about each option's steps.

Option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → adds a methyl to the triple bond, making CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, so CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diol or something? Wait, the compound after step 2 is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Ozonolysis would break double bonds, but if the molecule only has single bonds, maybe that's not the case. Wait, no, after step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated into a single bond, so it's now a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Hmm, this might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the steps wrong. Let me think about another approach.

The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a methyl group that also has a hydroxyl group. So perhaps that comes from a substitution reaction where a cyclohexyl group is added, and then an OH group is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed by some kind of ring-opening or cyclopropanation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the substituent is made via a Grignard reaction. But I don't see Grignard reagents in the options. Alternatively, maybe it's via a substitution on the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent comes from a cyclopropane ring opening. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydroxy group added via some kind of epoxide opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a pinacol rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible steps again.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The triple bond is between two carbons attached to the cyclohexane. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Step 1: Using NaNH2, which is a strong base. Deprotonates the terminal H of the triple bond to form the acetylide. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate the acetylide, giving cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

So after step 1, we have a four-carbon chain with the triple bond.

Then, step 2 in option C is H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate, which would hydrogenate the triple bond into a single bond, so the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So now, the molecule is a cyclohexane with a butyl group.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a methyl, so this doesn't match. So perhaps this isn't the right path.

Option B: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → adds ethyl group to the triple bond.

2. Li/liquid NH3 → likely a Birch reduction or a deprotonation.

3. O3, H2O → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, starting with ethynylcyclohexane, step 1 adds an ethyl group via alkylation, making cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Li is a strong base, maybe for deprotonation, but what's the structure after step 1? It's a longer chain: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Deprotonating where? Maybe the triple bond's H again. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, Li in NH3 is used for reductions, like in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, it's used for deprotonating to form enolates or for elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydroamination or some other reaction.

Then, step 3 is O3, which is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a triple bond? I'm not sure. Typically, ozonolysis is for double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So if after step 2, we have a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it.

Wait, maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation of the triple bond to a double bond. But how?

Wait, NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would add an ethyl group to the triple bond, making a longer chain. Then, step 2: Li/liquid NH3 could be for a deprotonation, perhaps to form a strong base to eliminate and form a double bond.

Wait, so after step 1, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, step 2 with Li/NH3 could deprotonate a hydrogen adjacent to the triple bond, leading to elimination to form a double bond. So the triple bond (C≡C) would become a double bond (C=C), and the molecule becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 → cyclohexane-CH2-C=CH-CH2CH3? No, wait, elimination would form a double bond. So perhaps the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 → cyclohexane-CH2-C=CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a 1,2-addition or some other reaction.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should think of the target molecule and see what functional groups I need to form.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) and a substituent which is a cyclohexyl group attached via a methyl that also has an OH group.

So perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution, adding a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group to a methyl chain.

Wait, but how would that happen? Maybe a hydroxy group is added via oxidation of an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent comes from some kind of ring-opening or cyclopropanation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a ketone, which is then used to form the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is functionalized to a ketone. Let's think: if we hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond, then epoxidize it and do some reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation.

Wait, O3 is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. But if the triple bond is hydrogenated into a double bond, then ozonolysis could break it into two carbonyls.

Hmm, but in option C, after step 2 (H2/Pd), the triple becomes a single bond, making a longer chain, which might not have a double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do much.

Option D: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps a deprotonation and alkylation, but methanol is not a good alkylating agent. Or maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Alternatively, deprotonation followed by alkylation with methanol? Not sure.

Wait, the first step is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe that's a deprotonation and then a quench with methanol, adding a methyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-OCH3? Or perhaps a different addition.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's overall process.

Option A: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → adds methyl to triple bond.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenates triple bond to single, making a longer chain.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination or ring-opening? Or possibly a base-induced reaction.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → oxymercuration? Or maybe some kind of hydration.

Wait, after step 4, which is H2SO4 and HgSO4 in H2O, that sounds like oxymercuration, which would add an OH group across a double bond.

But wait, after step 2, the molecule has a single bond, so where is the double bond? Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is Ba(OH)2 and step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Hmm, maybe step 3 is a hydration of a triple bond, but Ba(OH)2 is more of a base. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be involved in a cyclohexane ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Option D: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methanol → maybe deprotonates and adds a methyl group from CH3OH? But methanol is a poor electrophile, so perhaps it's not an alkylation. Alternatively, this could be a deprotonation leading to a metal acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But that would give an alcohol, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps after deprotonation with NaNH2, the acetylide is formed, which then reacts with methanol to give CH2-OCH3? No, because methanol is not a good alkylating agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a solvolysis, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation to form the acetylide, which then reacts with methanol in a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not certain.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to think of the overall process.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached via a methyl that has a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexylmethyl group with an OH on the methyl.

So, perhaps the steps involve adding a cyclohexyl group to a methyl, then adding an OH group.

How would that happen? Maybe through some kind of substitution reaction.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a methyl group that also has a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is in turn attached to the main cyclohexane.

So, maybe the substituent is formed via a substitution where a cyclohexyl group is added to a methyl, which already has an OH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed by some kind of addition, like a Grignard reagent adding to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the process is: Ethynylcyclohexane → add methyl (step 1) → hydrogenate triple bond (step 2) → functionalize to introduce OH (steps 3 and 4).

Alternatively, perhaps after adding a methyl group, the molecule is hydrogenated, then undergoes ozonolysis to form a carbonyl, which then is oxidized or something else.

Wait, but the target molecule has an aldehyde group on the main cyclohexane. So maybe the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol or via some kind of oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde group is introduced via an oxidation of a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the cyclohexane with a propyl group (from hydrogenation of the triple bond) is oxidized to introduce the aldehyde group.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option C: Steps are 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → adds methyl to triple bond, making CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → reduces triple bond to single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But after step 2, the molecule has single bonds, so ozonolysis won't do anything. So maybe this option isn't correct.

Option D: Steps 1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms the acetylide, then methanol acts as an electrophile? I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps step 1 in option D is deprotonation to form the acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But methanol is a poor alkylating agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not certain.

Option B: Steps include O3/H2O and NH4OH. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyls, then the workup (like with H2O) would give aldehydes or ketones.

Hmm, perhaps after forming a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's think about option B.

After step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → methylated to become CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 (if using ethyl chloride).

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Could this be a Birch reduction, which is used to reduce aromatic rings, but perhaps here it's used for deprotonation. Alternatively, maybe it's a reduction of the triple bond to a cis or trans double bond.

Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base and can induce elimination reactions. So, perhaps after step 1, the molecule is CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, step 2 with Li/NH3 could deprotonate and eliminate, turning the triple bond into a double bond. So CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 → CH2-C=CH-CH2CH3.

Then, step 3: O3, which would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So ozonolysis would break the double bond, and (CH3)2S as a workup would give aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, ozonolysis of CH2-C=CH-CH2CH3 would break into CH2-O and O=CH-CH2CH3? Or maybe into two smaller fragments. Alternatively, it would form two carbonyl groups.

Wait, the structure after step 2 is CH2-C=CH-CH2CH3. Ozonolysis would cleave between the two carbons of the double bond, producing two carbonyl compounds. So the left side would be CH2-O, and the right side would be O=CH-CH2CH3. But I'm not sure about the exact products.

Then, step 4 in option B is NH4OH, which is a workup. But I'm not seeing how this would form the desired substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis isn't the right approach. Maybe another option would make more sense.

Looking at option C again, step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. After step 2, which hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain. Then ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So maybe option C isn't correct.

Let me consider the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So perhaps the aldehyde is introduced via oxidation of a primary alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps from a Grignard reaction to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I should think about each step's purpose. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane.

Step 1 in all options is NaNH2 and some chloride or methanol. So the first step is likely converting the triple bond into something else. The triple bond is in the ethynyl group, so it's CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane.

Deprotonating with NaNH2 gives the acetylide, which can then undergo alkylation. So step 1 likely adds a methyl or ethyl group to the triple bond.

Then, step 2 might hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond or perhaps form a double bond.

After that, perhaps an ozonolysis step to break a double bond and form carbonyl groups.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde group. So maybe we need to form a carbonyl group somewhere.

Option B's step 3 is O3 followed by H2O and NH4OH. Ozonolysis would break a double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it, creating carbonyl groups.

Let me try to map this out.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylation adds ethyl group to triple bond: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → perhaps elimination reaction, converting the triple bond into a double bond. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C=CH-CH2CH3.

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

So after ozonolysis, the molecule would break into two parts. The left part would be cyclohexane-CH2-C=O, and the right part would be O=CH-CH2CH3.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which would correspond to the left part. So the left fragment would be cyclohexane-CH2-C=O, which is a ketone. But the target has an aldehyde, not a ketone. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, after ozonolysis, the left side (closer to the cyclohexane) would be CH2-O and the right side would be O=CH-CH2CH3. But that doesn't form an aldehyde on the cyclohexane. So perhaps this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, maybe the ozonolysis isn't between the cyclohexane and the substituent but elsewhere. But in this case, it's only the substituent.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the substituent after ozonolysis would form a carbonyl group, which is then reduced to an alcohol and then oxidized to the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis isn't the right step. Maybe the aldehyde is formed via oxidation.

Looking at option D: The steps are NaNH2 with methanol, then Li in liquid NH3, then O3/(CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

Wait, so step 1 could add a methyl group via the acetylide and methanol. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-OCH3.

Then, step 2 with Li in NH3 could deprotonate the hydroxyl (if any) or perhaps eliminate to form a double bond. Not sure.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave a double bond, but I'm not sure where it would be.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think about the correct reagent sequence leading to the target.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the substituent is a methyl group attached to the main cyclohexane, which is also attached to another cyclohexane and a hydroxyl group.

So, perhaps the substituent is formed by adding a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group to a methyl group attached to the main cyclohexane.

How would that happen? Maybe through a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via some kind of cyclopropanation and ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl that has an OH. So perhaps it's formed via a Grignard reaction, where a Grignard reagent adds to a carbonyl group, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

But where would the carbonyl come from? Maybe the aldehyde is formed first, then the Grignard adds to it.

Hmm. Let me try to outline a possible synthetic pathway:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → introduce a methyl group via alkylation → becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but that would cleave the molecule, which isn't helpful. Maybe instead, functionalize the triple bond differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. Ozonolysis of a triple bond doesn't do that, but maybe another method.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is oxidized to a diketone. But I don't remember the exact reagent for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then subjected to oxymercuration to add an OH group across the double bond.

Wait, but I don't see that in the options. Let me look.

Option A: Step 3 is Ba(OH)2, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That looks like the oxymercuration conditions, which would add an OH group across a double bond.

So, putting it together:

Step 1: Alkylation of the triple bond → CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but if the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, then step 3 (Ba(OH)2) and step 4 (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) wouldn't add an OH group because there's no double bond.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe step 2 isn't a hydrogenation of the triple bond but a hydrogenation of a double bond formed in another step.

Wait, perhaps after adding a methyl group to the triple bond, the molecule is treated with a reducing agent that converts the triple bond into a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, turning the triple into a double bond. That could be done with H2 and a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's catalyst, but the options don't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is using H2 with a different catalyst that only hydrogenates the triple bond to a double bond.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd is a common catalyst for hydrogenation, and without a poison, it usually fully hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. So in that case, the triple becomes a single.

Wait, but in that case, how do we get a double bond for the next steps?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the target again.

The substituent (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) suggests that the methyl is attached to both the main cyclohexane and a cyclohexyl group, with an OH on the methyl. So perhaps the methyl is part of a bridge between two cyclohexane rings, with an OH on it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a quaternary carbon, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the substituent is formed via a substitution where a bromide is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and an OH group.

But I'm not sure how to introduce the OH and the cyclohexyl group at the same time.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexane ring attached via a methylene group that has an OH. So maybe the substituent is formed via an addition of a cyclohexyl group to a carbonyl group, followed by reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction, where a Grignard reagent adds to a ketone, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylation to add methyl group (step 1 in options A, C, D).

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond (but how? Because the options don't have a poisoned catalyst for that. Alternatively, maybe a different approach).

3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

But then I'm not sure how to get the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps involve adding a methyl group, then hydrogenating to a single bond, then introducing an OH group via Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base and can cause elimination or substitution.

Wait, option A's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → adds methyl to triple bond.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenates triple to single.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe forms an epoxide or eliminates to form a double bond.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → oxymercuration.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about step 3: Ba(OH)2 is often used in the oxidation of alcohols or in elimination reactions. If after step 2, we have a butyl group, Ba(OH)2 might cause elimination, forming a double bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 → upon treatment with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, it might eliminate to form a double bond, but I'm not sure where. Alternatively, maybe it would form an epoxide if there's an adjacent leaving group, but there isn't one.

Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxidation, but that requires an epoxide precursor, which isn't present here.

Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for the oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone or aldehyde. But where would the alcohol come from?

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me think:

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → adds methyl to triple bond → CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates triple to single → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis; but after step 2, the molecule has no double bonds, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So this might not be the way.

Hmm, but maybe after step 2, the single bond is somehow converted into a double bond. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the step 2 in option C is not a full hydrogenation but a partial one. But I thought Pd usually goes all the way. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the reagents. For example, in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is often used as a CO2 scavenger in hydrogenation, but perhaps it doesn't affect the extent of hydrogenation. So the triple would become a single bond.

In that case, after step 2, the molecule is a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't work. So option C's step 3 would be ineffective.

Hmm.

Looking at option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms the acetylide, which then reacts with methanol to form a methyl ether. So CH2-C≡C-OCH3.

But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Then, step 2: Li/liquid NH3 → perhaps something like a Birch reduction, but I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, Li in NH3 could be a strong base, causing elimination.

So, perhaps after step 1, we have CH2-C≡C-OCH3. Then, step 2 could deprotonate and eliminate, forming a double bond.

So, CH2-C≡C-OCH3 → CH2-C=CH-OCH3.

Then, step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the structure after step 2 would be CH2-C=CH-OCH3. Ozonolysis would break between the two Cs, so the left would be CH2-O and the right would be OCH3-CH=O. Hmm, not sure.

Then, step 4 is NH4OH → workup.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target molecule.

Another thought: Maybe the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group via alkylation (step 1), then hydrogenating the triple bond to a cis or trans double bond (step 2), then ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups (step 3), and then some kind of reduction or oxidation to form the substituent.

But it's still unclear.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me think again.

After step 1: CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing happens.

Hmm, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that after step 2, the molecule undergoes some reaction that forms a double bond elsewhere. But I don't see that.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 in option C is something else. O3 followed by (CH3)2S is a workup for ozonolysis, so perhaps it's used to cleave a double bond that was formed in a previous step. So perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the triple but does something else.

Wait, perhaps in step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond. But earlier I thought that with H2 and Pd, it goes all the way. But maybe in this case, it's hydrogenated to a cis double bond. But I'm not certain about that.

Assuming that step 2 hydrogenates the triple bond to a cis double bond (CH2-C=CH-CH3), then step 3 (O3) would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls.

So, the left part would be CH2-C=O and the right part would be O=CH-CH3.

Wait, but that would produce two fragments, which wouldn't give the target molecule. So that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe I should look for the correct sequence of functional group transformations.

The target has an aldehyde group. So perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol or via some other method.

Wait, another approach: The substituent in the target has a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution where a leaving group (like bromide) is replaced by a cyclohexyl group, and the hydroxyl is added via another step.

But how would that substitution happen? Maybe through a nucleophilic substitution with a cyclohexyl group and OH, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a coupling reaction, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, going back to the step for the aldehyde group. The main cyclohexane has a -CHO group. So perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol or via some kind of oxidation of a methyl group.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the main cyclohexane has a methyl group which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

So, perhaps after adding a methyl group to the triple bond, we hydrogenate the triple bond to a CH2 group, then oxidize that CH2 to a CHO.

But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, if step 1 adds a methyl to the triple bond, making CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenates to CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Then, perhaps step 3: Ba(OH)2 does something, like eliminating to form a double bond. But I don't see how that would help.

Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option C, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a methyl with an OH. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group, and an OH is added via another step.

But I'm not seeing how that would fit into the reagent sequences provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a hydroxylation of a double bond, which is then followed by a substitution.

But again, it's unclear.

After considering all the options and possible reactions, I think the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group via alkylation, then hydrogenating the triple bond to form a single bond, then ozonolysis to cleave a double bond (but I'm not sure where the double bond would come from), and then some workup to form the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me outline it:

1. Alkylation adds methyl → CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenation → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis → but no double bond, so nothing happens. So this can't be correct.

Hmm.

Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the substituent again. It's a cyclohexyl group attached via a methyl with an OH.

So perhaps the substituent is formed by adding a cyclohexyl group to a methyl that already has an OH group.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction, where a Grignard reagent adds to a carbonyl group, forming a new alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via some kind of cyclopropanation, but I'm not familiar with that.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should go with option C as the correct answer, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe option D is correct.

Wait, another approach: The target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves introducing both groups via oxidation steps.

Looking at the options, option D's steps include O3 and NH4OH. So perhaps the aldehyde is formed via ozonolysis, and the OH via another step.

But I'm not certain.

After all this thinking, I think the correct answer is option C.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the analysis of the options involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to achieve the desired transformations. The target molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) and a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group attached via a methyl group, which also has a hydroxyl group (-OH). The synthesis requires functionalizing the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, to introduce these groups.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal hydrogen of the triple bond in ethynylcyclohexane, forming an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to add a methyl group, resulting in cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely acts as a base, but its role in this sequence is unclear without a double bond or a leaving group.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Oxymercuration conditions, which typically add an -OH group across a double bond. However, after step 2, the molecule has a single bond, so this step would not function as intended.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the triple bond and alkylates it with an ethyl group, resulting in cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely induces elimination, converting the triple bond into a double bond (cyclohexane-CH₂-C=CH-CH₂CH₃).
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, producing carbonyl groups. However, the resulting fragments do not align with the target molecule.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup step, but the earlier cleavage by ozonolysis makes this sequence unsuitable for forming the target.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the triple bond and alkylates it with a methyl group, resulting in cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis is ineffective here because the molecule has no double bond after step 2.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely acts as a base, but its role is unclear without a double bond or a leaving group.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the triple bond, but methanol is a poor alkylating agent, making this step ambiguous.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely induces elimination or reduction, but the exact outcome is unclear.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is not present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup step, but the earlier steps do not set up the molecule for the desired transformations.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the required transformations to synthesize the target molecule. However, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible, as it includes steps that could potentially lead to the formation of the aldehyde group and the substituent. The sequence involves alkylation, hydrogenation, and subsequent functionalization steps, even though some ambiguities remain.

**Answer: C**
