Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I think I should break this down step by step.

First, let's read the question again. Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their velocities like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So the relative speed v_rel would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me calculate that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c. So about 0.14c when rounded. Wait, but looking at options, option C and D have 0.14c as their relative speed. So that's one part done.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So for astronaut 1: mass is 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma1 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5mc², which is less. So the correct option must be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the velocities. Are they both moving in the same direction? Oh, yes, the positive x-direction. So I used the correct formula for relative velocity. And for the energy, I calculated each correctly and summed them.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c and the energy is around 5.96 mc². So the correct option should be C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 1
Mass \(2m\), velocity \(0.6c\):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 2
Mass \(3m\), velocity \(0.5c\):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of both astronauts:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
