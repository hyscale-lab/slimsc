Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Let me think.

Parallax, plx, is the angle subtended by the Earth's orbit as seen from the star. The formula I remember is that distance d is approximately 1 parsec divided by the parallax in arcseconds. Oh right, d = 1 / plx. So a star with a larger parallax is closer because plx is inversely proportional to distance.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So if I have a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since stars are uniformly distributed, I guess that means their number density is constant in space. Oh wait, uniform distribution in the sky doesn't necessarily mean uniform in three-dimensional space, because the sky is a two-dimensional sphere. Or wait, wait, the question says uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, maybe it's uniform in terms of their positions on the celestial sphere, but not accounting for depth. But wait, if they are uniformly distributed in three-dimensional space, that's different.

Wait, the problem says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, perhaps it's a uniform distribution over the celestial sphere, meaning that all directions have the same number of stars per unit solid angle. But that might not directly translate to distance.

Wait, maybe I should think about the volume of space. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density n is constant. So the number of stars between distances d and d+dd would depend on the volume between spheres of radius d and d+dd.

The volume between d and d+dd is 4π d² dd, right? Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the differential volume is the derivative, which is 4π d² dd.

So the number of stars in this volume would be n * 4π d² dd. But the question is about parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So let's express everything in terms of plx.

Let me change variables. Let plx = p. Then d = 1/p. So dd = - (1/p²) dp. Because d = 1/p → dd = -1/p² dp. Because if p increases, d decreases.

So the number of stars in a small range of parallax dp would be number = n * 4π ( (1/p) )² * ( - dp / p² )

Wait, wait, let's make it step by step. The volume element in terms of d is 4π d² dd. So in terms of p, since d = 1/p, substituting:

d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp

So the volume element becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp. Wait, wait, no, 4π d² dd becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² dp ). But wait, let's be precise.

Wait, the volume element is 4π d² dd. So when plx is p, d =1/p. So when plx increases by dp, d decreases by (1/p²) dp. So the volume element is 4π (d)^2 dd → substituting d =1/p, we get 4π (1/p²) * ( - dp/p² ). So, 4π (1/p²) (-1/p² dp) ) → which is -4π/(p^4) dp.

But wait, the number of stars is proportional to the volume. So number = n * volume. So the number is n * (-4π/(p^4) dp) )

But when considering the number per unit range of p, we can take the absolute value. So the number per unit dp is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait a second. Let's think again. The number of stars in a shell of radius d to d+dd is proportional to the volume of that shell, which is 4π d² dd. Since the star density is uniform (n is constant), number = n * 4π d² dd.

But since d = 1/p, and dd = - dp/(p²), the number becomes n * 4π (1/p^2) * ( - dp/p² ) → which is n * 4π * (-1/p^4) dp.

Since we're talking about a positive number of stars, the negative sign indicates that as p increases (since p is in the denominator, d decreases), which makes sense. But when we take the absolute value, the number of stars per unit dp is proportional to (1/p^4).

Wait, but the options are about the number per unit change of parallax. So the number of stars per unit plx (dp) would be proportional to 1/p^4? So as plx increases, the number of stars per unit plx decreases by 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is, how does the number of stars per unit range of plx change with plx? So it's N ∝ 1/p^4. Looking at the options:

Option A) ~1/p^4
Option D) ~1/p^3

Oh, so the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me go through the steps again.

Number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πd²dd. Since d = 1/p, and dd = - dp/(p²), then:

Number ∝ 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - dp/(p^2) ) → 4π * (1/p^2) * ( - dp/p² ) = 4π (-1/p^4) dp.

But as for the number per unit dp, we take the magnitude, so N ∝ 1/p^4.

So the number of stars per unit range of plx (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because when I think of the number as a function of plx, it's 1/p^4, so the number decreases as p increases. So the correct answer is A: ~1/p^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by analyzing the relationship between parallax and distance. The parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), given by \( d = \frac{1}{p} \). For a thin shell at distance \( d \), the number of stars is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density \( n \) is constant.

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dd = -\frac{dp}{p^2} \), the volume element becomes:

\[
4\pi d^2 dd = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{dp}{p^2}\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to the absolute value of this expression, which gives:

\[
\text{Number of stars per unit } dp \propto \frac{1}{p^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Comparing this result with the options provided:

- **A)** \( \sim \frac{1}{p^4} \): Correct, matches the derived result.
- **B)** \( \sim \frac{1}{p^2} \): Incorrect, does not match the derived result.
- **C)** \( \sim \frac{1}{p^1} \): Incorrect, does not match the derived result.
- **D)** \( \sim \frac{1}{p^3} \): Incorrect, does not match the derived result.

The correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).
