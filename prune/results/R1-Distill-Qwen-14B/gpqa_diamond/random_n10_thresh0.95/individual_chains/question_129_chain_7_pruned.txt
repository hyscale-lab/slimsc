Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending up with compound E. I need to figure out what E is based on the given information and the reaction steps. There are also some hints provided, which I should definitely use.

First, let's outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

Looking at the IR data first. IR peaks around 1750 typically indicate a carbonyl group (C=O). So compound A has a carbonyl. The peak for E is at 1715, which also suggests a carbonyl but possibly a different one. Maybe the carbonyl in E is a ketone, while A's is an ester or maybe another carbonyl compound?

Now, looking at hint a: When A reacts with a phosphorus ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Phosphorus ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes by reacting with ylides. So, if A reacts with a ylide to form an alkene, A must have a carbonyl group that reacts in the Wittig. So A is probably an aldehyde or ketone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclopentane with a substituted cyclopentane. Let me draw it out. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1,2, and 4. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a substituted double bond. So that suggests that the ylide added to a carbonyl group in A, forming a new double bond.

So, A must be an aldehyde or ketone where the carbonyl is in a cyclopentane ring. So perhaps A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Let's think about the structure. The Wittig reaction would form a new double bond adjacent to the substituents. 

Wait, the product after Wittig has substituents at 1,2,4. So if A is a cyclopentanone with substituents, the ylide would attack the carbonyl carbon, then after elimination, the ring would have a double bond. So, maybe the starting material is a cyclopentanone where the carbonyl is at position 4, and there are methyl groups at positions 1 and 2.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure. Suppose cyclopentanone (a five-membered ring with a ketone). Let's say the ketone is at position 1. Then, after the Wittig reaction, the carbonyl becomes a double bond. So the product would have a double bond between positions 1 and 2, but that's probably not matching the substituents. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is at position 4, and the ring has substituents at 1 and 2.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the ring has methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is (CH2)2C=, so it's like CH2-C(CH2?) Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the ylid group from the ylide. The structure would be CH2-C(=CH2)-. Hmm, perhaps the ylide is the part that adds to the carbonyl.

Wait, no. The ylide is a phosphorus ylide, like a Wittig reagent. So the ylide structure would be something like PPh3+–CH2–C(CH2CH3)=. Or maybe it's a substituted ylide. So when it reacts with the carbonyl in compound A, the carbonyl (C=O) becomes an alkene (CH2–CH2 group, but more likely with substituents).

Wait, perhaps the product is a ring with a new substituent. Let me think: the product has a cyclopentane ring, with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and at position 4, a substituent which is propan-2-ylidene. Propan-2-ylidene is probably a CH2–C(CH3)= group. So the substituent is a double bond attached to a methyl group.

So, if the Wittig reaction forms a new double bond, then the starting carbonyl (in A) must have been at position 4. So, the product would have a double bond between positions 3 and 4, maybe? Let me sketch this mentally.

Alternatively, maybe the ylide is adding to the carbonyl, and then the ring expands or something else.
