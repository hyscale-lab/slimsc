Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. I've heard about EDTA before; I think it's a chelating agent. So the question says there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means that all the EDTA is in a form that can bind calcium, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The K here is the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is. A larger K means the complex is more stable, so the metal ion is more tightly bound.

So the problem is probably about dissociating the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex is CaY²⁻, where Y is EDTA. The dissociation reaction would be CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²+ + Y⁴-. The K for this reaction is given as 5e10. Wait, actually, the formation constant (Kf) is usually written as the reverse of the dissociation. Oh right, Kf is the formation constant, so Ca²+ + Y^4- ⇌ CaY²−, and Kf is 5e10. So the dissociation K would be 1/(5e10). But wait, in this problem, they give KCa-EDTA as 5e10. Do I need to confirm if that's Kf or Kd?

Wait, the question states KCa-EDTA = 5e10. I think that's the formation constant (Kf). Because KCa-EDTA would typically be the formation constant for the complex. So Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we want to find [Ca²+], assuming that the dissociation is negligible compared to the complex formation, but with such a high K, the complex is very stable.

Wait, but if K is very large, the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free calcium ions would be very low. Oh, but the problem is asking for the concentration of Ca²+.

Let me think. The complex is CaY²−. The total concentration of the complex is [CaY²−] = 0.02 M. The dissociation is CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y⁴-. So the equilibrium expression is K = [Ca²+][Y⁴−]/[CaY²−]. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Kf is the formation constant for the complex, so Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]) = 5e10. So rearranged, [Ca²+] = [CaY²−]/(Kf [Y⁴−]). But wait, in the solution, the EDTA is provided as the complex, so the total EDTA comes from the complex, right? Because the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the EDTA in solution is mostly in the complex form.

Wait, but in solution, the EDTA exists as Y^4- and other deprotonated forms depending on pH. But the problem says pH is ideal, so we can assume that all the EDTA is in the Y^4- form. I think that's a standard assumption because EDTA has multiple pKa values, and at a certain pH, it's fully deprotonated. So we can consider Y^4- as the dominant species.

Wait, but if the solution is 0.02 M CaY²−, then the total EDTA concentration would be equal to [CaY²−], assuming a 1:1 ratio. So [Y^4−] is the same as [CaY²−], except for any dissociation that occurs. But since Kf is large, the dissociation is minimal, so [Y^4−] ≈ 0.02 M. Or is that correct?

Wait, no. Because when the complex dissociates, each mole of CaY²− produces one mole of Y^4− and one mole of Ca²+. So if x is the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium, then [Y^4−] would be x, and [CaY²−] would be 0.02 - x. But wait, Kf is 5e10, which is very large. So the dissociation (x) would be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Wait, but wait, the formation is Ca²+ + Y^4− ⇌ CaY²−, Kf =5e10. So the reverse reaction would have Kd = 1/(5e10), which is 2e-11.

So for the dissociation, we can write Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4−]/[CaY²−] = 2e-11.

Let me set up the variables. Let's let the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium be x. Since the initial concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M, the change would be: when some dissociates, [CaY²−] decreases by x, and [Ca²+] and [Y^4−] each increase by x. So the equilibrium concentrations would be:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small)

[Ca²+] = x

[Y^4−] = x

Wait, but that's not right. Because in the solution, the EDTA comes only from the complex. So if the complex dissociates, the Y^4− comes from both the dissociation and the initial solution. Wait, no, the initial solution is the complex, so the only source of Y^4− is from dissociation of the complex.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The complex is CaY²−, and when it dissociates, each molecule gives one Y^4− and one Ca²+. So the total EDTA concentration is [CaY²−] + [Y^4−] = 0.02 M. But since Kf is large, [Y^4−] is very small compared to [CaY²−], so [Y^4−] ≈ x, and [CaY²
