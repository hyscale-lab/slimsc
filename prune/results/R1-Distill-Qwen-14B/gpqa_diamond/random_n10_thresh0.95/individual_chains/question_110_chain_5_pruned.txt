Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let's read the problem again carefully.

ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES at Keck can observe brighter than V mag 16. So, a star must have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, no—wait, the question says, for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Brighter stars have smaller magnitudes. So if a star's apparent V mag is less than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars with V mag less than 16.

Wait, no, the question states, for ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So stars with V magnitude ≤17 are observable by ESPRESSO. Same for HIRES: stars with V mag ≤16. So a star must be ≤16 mag for both to observe it, but wait, no—wait, wait. No, because HIRES can see down to 16 mag. So any star brighter than 16 mag (V ≤16) can be seen by HIRES. ESPRESSO can see down to 17 mag (so V ≤17). So the star must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO? No, wait. The way the question is phrased is: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star's apparent V is ≤17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, if it's ≤16, HIRES can see it.

Wait, no. Let me think again. "Brighter than 17 mag" means magnitude less than 17. Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter stars. So, for ESPRESSO, the limit is V ≤17. For HIRES, V ≤16. So the star must be V ≤16 to be observed by both. Because if it's V mag 17, HIRES can't see it (since it can only go down to 16). Wait, no. Wait, the question says: with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, if a star has V mag less than or equal to 17, it's observable by ESPRESSO. With HIRES, stars with V mag brighter than 16 can be observed, so ≤16. So to be detected by both, the star must have V mag ≤16. Because if a star's V is 16.5, for example, it's >16, so HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. Wait, no, no: if a star's V is 16.5, that's brighter than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it), but dimmer than 16 (so HIRES can't). So for a star to be observed by both, it needs to have V ≤16.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase: the brighter the star (lower V mag), the better. ESPRESSO can go up to V=17, meaning any star with V ≤17 is observable by ESPRESSO. HIRES can go up to V=16, meaning stars with V ≤16 are observable by HIRES. So, to be detected by both, the star's V must be ≤16.

Wait, no. Because if a star's V is 17, it's too faint for HIRES. So a star must have V ≤16 to be detectable by both.

Wait, no. Let me think. If a star has V=15, both can see it. V=16.5: ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.5 <=17), but HIRES can't because 16.
