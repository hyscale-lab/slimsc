Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit strange. Let me parse it. So, the line element is scaled by this factor 32/(4 - x² - y²). I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor tells us about the geometry of spacetime. But here, we're probably just dealing with a 2-dimensional space because it's only got dx² and dy² terms.

The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Pseudosphere... Oh right, that's a term from hyperbolic geometry. A pseudosphere has a constant negative curvature. But wait, how does that relate to the metric given?

I think the first thing I need to figure out is what kind of geometry this metric is describing. The metric is conformally flat because it's just a scalar function multiplied by the flat metric (dx² + dy²). Conformal metrics usually represent spaces that are locally like flat space but with a scaling factor.

Looking at the denominator: 4 - x² - y². So, the scaling factor is 32/(4 - (x² + y²)). That means the metric is only defined where 4 - x² - y² is not zero. So, the domain of this metric must be where x² + y² < 4, right? Because if x² + y² equals 4, the denominator becomes zero, which would make the metric singular. So the space is like a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudospheres are surfaces with constant negative curvature. But here, I'm in 2D, so maybe this metric is describing a space with negative curvature. Let's think about the form of the metric for hyperbolic space.

In two dimensions, the hyperbolic metric can be written in various forms, like the Poincaré disk model or the Poincaré half-plane model. The Poincaré disk model has a metric like ds² = (4/(1 - x² - y²)^2)(dx² + dy²). Hmm, the given metric is 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me see: 4/(1 - (x²+y²)/4)^2 would be similar to the Poincaré metric.

Wait, let me scale the coordinates. Let me set u = x/2 and v = y/2. Then x = 2u, y=2v. Then, x² + y² becomes 4(u² + v²). So the denominator becomes 4 - 4(u² + v²) = 4(1 - (u² + v²)). So the metric becomes (32)/(4(1 - (u² + v²))) [ (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 ].

But dx = 2 du, dy=2 dv. So dx² + dy² = 4 du² +4 dv² = 4 (du² + dv²). Plugging back in, the metric is (32)/(4(1 - (u² + v²))) * 4 (du² + dv²). Let's compute that: 32 *4 [ (du² + dv²) ] / [4(1 - u² -v²)].

Wait, 32 *4 is 128, denominator 4, so 128/4=32. So 32 (du² + dv²)/(1 - u² -v²) ). Wait, but that's not matching the Poincaré metric. Because the Poincaré metric is (4/(1 - u² - v²)^2)(du² + dv²). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in scaling.

Alternatively, maybe the metric given is similar to the hyperbolic metric but scaled differently. Let me think about the standard form. The Poincaré disk model has ds² = [4/(1 - r²)^2 ] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. But in Cartesian coordinates, it's 4/(1 - x² - y²)^2 (dx² + dy²).

Wait, the given metric is 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let's factor out 4 from the denominator: 32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 )) → (32/4) / (1 - (x² + y²)/4 ) → 8 / (1 - (x² + y²)/4 ). So the metric becomes 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) (dx² + dy²).

Hmm, that's 8 times (1 - (x² + y²)/4 )^{-1} (dx² + dy²). Comparing this to the Poincaré metric, which is 4/(1 - (x² + y²))^2 (dx² + dy²). So the given metric is similar but with a different scaling.

Wait, perhaps I can write it as (8)/(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ) (dx² + dy²) = (8 * 4 )/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²) → which is the same as the original. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps this metric is representing a hyperbolic space with a certain curvature. The curvature is determined by the coefficient in the metric. For the Poincaré disk, the curvature is -1/(radius)^2. Wait, let me recall: the Poincaré disk has curvature -1, and the metric is (4/(1 - r^2)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²). So in Cartesian terms, 4/(1 - x² - y²)^2 (dx² + dy²).

In our case, the metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me factor 4 in the denominator: 32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 )) → 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ). So the denominator is 1 - (r²/4), where r is the radial coordinate in x-y plane.

So, to compare with the Poincaré metric, which is 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). Let's see: 8/(1 - (r²/4 )) (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, perhaps this is the metric of a hyperbolic space with a different curvature.

Wait, the general form of hyperbolic space in the Poincaré disk is:

ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²)

But our metric is 8/(1 - r²/4) (dr² + r² dθ²). Let's see, maybe if I adjust variables. Let me set r' = r/2. Then, r = 2 r'. So the metric becomes 8/(1 - (4 r'^2)/4 ) → 8/(1 - r'^2) ) (4 dr'^2 + 4 r'^2 dθ² ) → 8/(1 - r'^2) *4 ( dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ² ). So 32/(1 - r'^2) ( dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ² ) → which is 32/(1 - r'^2) (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ² ). 

Wait, but this is the metric of a space with curvature more negative than Poincaré's. Because the denominator is 1 -r'^2, which is similar to a Poincaré metric with radius 1. But in our case, the denominator is 1 - r'^2, so it's a hyperbolic metric of radius 1. But perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps this metric represents a hyperbolic plane with a curvature of -k, where k is a constant. The general form is ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(k (1 - k r²)^2 ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: in 2D, the Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = E dx² + 2 F dx dy + G dy² is given by a certain formula. But since our metric is conformally flat (E=G, F=0), the formula simplifies. For a metric ds² = λ² (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is -λ / (2 λ^3) = -1/(2 λ).

Wait, no, perhaps I should recall that for a conformal metric, the Gaussian curvature is given by (1/(2 λ²)) (Δ λ) where Δ is the flat Laplacian. Hmm, maybe it's better to compute the Gaussian curvature from the metric.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the Gaussian curvature to find the radius of curvature.

The Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = A(x,y) (dx² + dy²) is given by:

K = - (1/(2 A)) * Δ (sqrt(A)),

where Δ is the flat Laplacian. Alternatively, I might have this wrong; perhaps the formula is:

K = - (1/(4 A)) * ( ( ∂/∂x (A_x) ) + ( ∂/∂y (A_y) ) ) ), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, another way: the Gaussian curvature can be computed using the formula involving the coefficients of the metric. Since this is a conformally flat metric, perhaps it simplifies.

Wait, for a metric ds² = a(x,y)^2 (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is:

K = -(1/(2 a²)) * [ ( ∂(a_x)/∂x + ∂(a_y)/∂y ) ]

Wait, perhaps I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll try to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the Ricci scalar curvature for this 2D metric, which equals the Gaussian curvature. For a 2D metric with ds² = g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ² + 2 g_{rθ} dr dθ. In our case, it's only dx and dy, so in polar coordinates, it's equivalent to dr² + r² dθ² multiplied by a factor.

Wait, perhaps I should switch to polar coordinates to compute the curvature.

Let me define r^2 = x^2 + y^2. Then, the metric becomes ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²).

So in polar coordinates, the metric is:

g_rr = 32/(4 - r^2)
g_θθ = (32 r²)/(4 - r^2)
g_{rθ} = 0

The formula for the Gaussian curvature K in polar coordinates (assuming g_{rθ}=0) is:

K = - (1/(2 g_{rr})) [ ( ∂ g_{rr} / ∂ r ) + (g_{rr} (g_{θθ}/r^2)) / r ) ]

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula. Alternatively, another approach: for a metric ds² = a(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature K is -a''(r)/(a(r)) - (a'(r)/a(r)^2)(1/r) + (1/(2 r^2)) (a'(r)/a(r)) )? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Christoffel symbols and then the Ricci scalar, but that might take too long.

Wait, another approach: the area of a sphere in a space with curvature K is 4π r² (1 + Kr²/6 + ... ). But wait, this is for a small r. But when K is negative and r is the radius of the pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant curvature), then the area would be 4π r² (1 + K r²/6 ). But maybe for a pseudosphere of radius r, the area is 4π r² / (1 - (r^2 K) ) or something like that. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the area of a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature) is infinite. Because a pseudosphere is like a hyperboloid, which extends infinitely. Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, wait, in hyperbolic space, the volume (or area, since it's 2D) grows exponentially with the radius. So perhaps the area is infinite.

Wait, but the metric given is only defined for x² + y² <4. So the space is a disk of radius 2. Then, the area should be finite. Let me compute the area using the metric.

The area in 2D is the integral over the space of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y² ))^2. But the square root would be 32/(4 - x² - y² ). So the area element is [32/(4 - r²)] dr dθ, where r is sqrt(x² + y²).

Thus, the total area is the integral from r=0 to r=2 of the integral from θ=0 to θ=2π of [32/(4 - r²)] r dθ dr.

Let me compute that. The integral over θ is straightforward: it's 2π. So area = 2π * ∫ from 0 to 2 of [32/(4 - r²)] r dr.

Let me compute ∫ [32 r ]/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me make a substitution: let u =4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (r dr) / u = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ du/u.

So the integral becomes -16 ∫ du/u. The limits: when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral is from u=4 to u=0 of (-16) (du/u).

Which is (-16) [ ln(u) from 4 to 0 ] → (-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity. So [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = (-∞) - ln(4) → -infty. So the integral becomes (-16)(-infty) = +infty.

Wait, but let me check the limits again. Wait, when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches zero from above. So the integral is from u=4 to u=0, but we have a negative sign, so it's from u=4 to u=0, but the substitution gives us a negative, which flips the limits.

Wait, more accurately: initial limits r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0.

So the integral from r=0 to r=2 becomes an integral from u=4 to u=0. So the substitution gives us:

∫ [32 r dr ]/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [ (-1/2) du ] / u

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from u=4 to u=0.

So that's (-16) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0 → (-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → (-16)(-infty - ln(4)).

But ln(0) is -infinity, so ln(0) - ln(4) is -infty - ln(4) = -infty. So the integral is (-16)* (-infty) = +infty.

Wait, but that's not possible because the area should be finite. Did I make a mistake in the substitution?

Wait, let me recompute the integral ∫ [32 r dr ]/(4 - r²).

Let me change variables again: let u = 4 - r².

Then, du = -2 r dr → - (1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral ∫ [32 r dr ]/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [ (-1/2) du ]/ u = (-16) ∫ (du/u).

Now, when r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0.

So the limits are from u=4 to u=0. So the integral becomes (-16) ∫ from 4 to 0 of du/u.

Which is (-16) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0 → (-16) ( ln(0) - ln(4) ) → (-16)( -infty - ln(4) ) → (-16)(-infty) = +infty.

So the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm. So according to this, the area is infinite. So the answer would be option D, which is +infty.

But wait, I thought pseudospheres have finite area. Or does it depend on the model? Let me think again.

In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle of radius r is 2π r (cosh r - 1), which for large r behaves like 2π r^2 e^r, which is exponentially increasing. But in the case of a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, the total area is infinite. Wait, but a pseudosphere is a model of hyperbolic geometry, and it's a surface in 3D space, but here we're talking about a 2D hyperbolic space embedded in a certain metric.

Wait, but in this specific case, the metric is defined only for x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2. So in this case, the area would be the integral up to r=2. But as we saw, that integral diverges. So the area would be infinite.

So the correct answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This describes a 2-dimensional space that is conformally flat, meaning it is locally similar to a flat space but scaled by the factor \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) implies that the metric is only defined for \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), i.e., within a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane.

The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and in this case, the metric represents a hyperbolic space. The area of such a space can be computed by integrating the area element derived from the metric. The area element in this case is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( r \), \( \theta \)), where \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \( \theta \) is straightforward:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits of integration change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); and when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{u} \, du = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

Reversing the limits:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges logarithmically as \( u \to 0 \), meaning the area becomes infinite. Thus, the total area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.

**Critical analysis of the options:**

- **Option A (0):** Incorrect. The area is not zero; the space is non-degenerate.
- **Option B (\( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)):** Incorrect. This does not represent the area of the pseudosphere.
- **Option C (\( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)):** Incorrect. This is not a valid expression for the area.
- **Option D (\(+\infty\)):** Correct. The integral for the area diverges, indicating an infinite area.

Answer: D
