Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution reaction, maybe a substitution on a benzene ring or something else.

Let me look at the data provided. The IR and NMR spectra of Compound X. I'll need to figure out what Compound X is first, and then see what happens when it reacts under those conditions.

Starting with the IR data: 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That broad region suggests O-H stretching, perhaps from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, I also see a peak around 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids typically show a peak around 1700 cm-1, but it can vary. There's also a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which might be aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe Compound X has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, like a benzoic acid.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, no, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, wait, carboxylic acid protons are around 10-12 ppm. So this broad singlet is likely a carboxylic acid -OH proton. But wait, in D2O, carboxylic acids exchange and the proton doesn't appear. But in the NMR, it's present, so maybe it's an aldehyde, or maybe it's an aromatic OH? Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton elsewhere, but in this case, let's consider it's a carboxylic acid.

Then, the next peak is 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That's in the aromatic region, probably para-substituted since it's a doublet, integrating to 2H. So that suggests two protons in a para position. Then, 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), also a doublet, another two protons. So together, this looks like a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, no, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. For example, in para positions, you get two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps, the substituents are in the para positions relative to each other.

Looking at the lower ppm regions:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is probably a CH group, maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like a CH near a carbonyl. Or perhaps it's part of an isopropyl group or something else.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): This could be a CH2 group, maybe adjacent to a carbonyl or part of a chain.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet with 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, like a methyl adjacent to a chiral center. For example, in an isobutyl group, the methyl would be on the central CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, probably a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is part of a longer chain, like an ethyl group. For example, in a propyl chain, the terminal methyl would be a triplet.

Putting this together, the aromatic part is a para-substituted benzene. Let me sketch it out. So the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group (like a COOH group), and the other substituent is a side chain.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. So the substituents are either electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups. The 8.0 ppm protons are more downfield, which suggests they are next to an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl). So perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and an isobutyl group.

Wait, but let's think about the possible structure. The aromatic ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like COOH) and the other is an isobutyl group or something with a chain. Wait, the substituent with the chain would have the CH2 and CH groups in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and a group like CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't fit with the NMR data. Let me think about the possible substituents.

Wait, looking at the NMR, the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. The 2.9 ppm multiplet is one proton, perhaps a CH group attached to another CH2. The 1.7 ppm is two protons, maybe a CH2 connected to that. The 0.9 ppm triplet is a methyl, so perhaps a CH2CH2CH3 group. So putting that together, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH2CH3? Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group or an isobutyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene ring. Let's think: if the substituent is a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3), then the NMR would show the CH2 groups. But the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) which is the terminal methyl. The adjacent CH2 would be a quartet, but in the data, I don't see a quartet. Oh wait, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (m) for 2H, and the 2.9 ppm is one H. Hmm, perhaps it's an isobutyl group.

Wait, the isobutyl group structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, no. Isobutyl is (CH2CH2)2CH- attached to the benzene. So perhaps the group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me number the substituent chain. The substituent is attached to the benzene. Let's say it's an ethyl group or a propyl group.

Wait, looking at the substituents on the benzene, if there are two substituents, one is a carbonyl (like COOH), and the other is a side chain, perhaps a propyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring, and another substituent is a carbonyl group.

Wait, but that doesn't explain the downfield shift in the aromatic protons. Alternatively, the substituents could be a carbonyl group (like COOH) and an ethyl group.

Wait, let's think in terms of the reaction. When you treat a benzoic acid derivative with red phosphorus and HI, what reaction occurs? I think that's a typical example of the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes, but wait, wait, no, that's with Zn(Hg)/HCl. Clemmensen uses red phosphorus and HI, I think, to reduce ketones to alkanes. So if the starting material has a carbonyl group, the product would have that group replaced by CH2.

Wait, but wait: in the question, Compound X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. So if X has a carbonyl group, the reaction could reduce it to a CH2 group. Alternatively, if it's a benzaldehyde, it would be reduced to a benzyl group.

Wait, but in this case, the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which is more in line with a carboxylic acid (since carboxylic acids have higher wavenumbers for the C=O, around 1700-1725 cm-1). So if it's a carboxylic acid, then treating with red phosphorus and HI would do what? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the Clemmensen reduction is for ketones and aldehydes, not carboxylic acids.

Wait, so if the starting material is a benzaldehyde, the Clemmensen would reduce it to a benzyl group (CH2Ph). But in this case, the starting material is a benzoic acid. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzophenone, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about the reaction incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the reaction involves the elimination of a leaving group, but that's more about substitution reactions.

Wait, another possibility: the IR shows a carbonyl, but maybe it's an ester, not a carboxylic acid. Because esters have a carbonyl around 1740 cm-1. Wait, 1720 cm-1 is a bit lower than ester, but could be. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. But the 3400-2500 cm-1 region suggests an OH group. So perhaps it's a ketone with an alcohol group. But that seems less likely.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm in NMR is a singlet. If it's a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a ketone's alpha proton, but that's usually around 2.1 ppm. No, wait, the 10.5 is higher, which would make sense for a carboxylic acid's -OH. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but aldehydes are around 9-10, but if it's a para-substituted benzaldehyde, maybe the aldehyde proton is deshielded a bit more. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 is an acidic proton, like a phenolic OH. But phenol protons are usually around 7-8 ppm, so 10.5 would be more like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, so if Compound X is a benzoic acid with substituents, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would do what? Wait, I'm not so sure about that. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction to reduce carbonyl groups in ketones or aldehydes to CH2 groups, but I don't think they're used to reduce carboxylic acids. So perhaps I'm wrong about the starting material.

Wait, another approach: maybe the starting material is not a carboxylic acid but an ester. Because esters can be reduced. Let me think: the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which is more in line with an ester (since esters are typically around 1740 cm-1, but 1720 could be possible, maybe if it's a less electron-deficient carbonyl). And the 3400-2500 cm-1 region could be an -OH from an ester, but esters don't typically have OH groups. Wait, but maybe it's a methyl ester or something else.

Alternatively, the IR could also have a peak from a ketone, but I don't see that. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrile, but the peaks don't fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a phenyl ester. Like, for example, ethyl benzoate. Let's see, the NMR would have aromatic protons. If it's ethyl benzoate, the benzene would have substituents in the para position as an ester group (O-CO-OEt). Then, the ethyl group would have protons at 4.1 ppm (for the OCH2), but in the given NMR, I don't see any peaks in that region. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetyloxy group. Hmm, but again, the NMR doesn't show the expected peaks for that.

Wait, maybe the IR's 1720 cm-1 is a ketone. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ketone to a CH2 group. But then, what about the 10.5 ppm? That's still a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a phenyl ketone. Let me think: for example, acetophenone. But acetophenone's carbonyl is around 1680-1720 cm-1, and the alpha protons (CH3) would be around 2.5 ppm. In the given NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. Maybe that's a CH group, like in a secondary alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options provided. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which is the product.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Hmm. Let's see what each option is.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the benzene ring is at position 2, and the substituent is ethyl at position 4 of the benzene. The acid is propanoic acid attached to the benzene.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene has a sec-butyl group at position 4 and a carboxylic acid group at position 1, perhaps? Or maybe the substituents are at positions 1 and 4.

Wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky. So, for each option, the substituents are on the benzene ring in certain positions.

Wait, the reaction is treating with red phosphorus and HI. So if the starting material is a benzophenone (a ketone attached to the benzene), then the reduction would convert the ketone to a CH2 group. Alternatively, if the starting material is an ester or another carbonyl-containing compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde, which gets reduced to a benzyl group.

Wait, but let's think of the starting material's structure.

Looking back at the NMR:

The aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That suggests that the substituents are in the para positions, and the substituents are such that the adjacent protons are deshielded (higher ppm) and the others are less so. So, if one substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (like NO2 or COOH), the adjacent protons would be downfield. Alternatively, an electron-donating group (like OMe) would cause the adjacent protons to be upfield, but in this case, the 8.0 ppm is higher, so more likely an electron-withdrawing group.

So if the substituent is a COOH group in position 1, then the adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear around 8.0 ppm, and the protons in positions 3 and 5 would be around 7.2 ppm, assuming the substituent is in position 1.

Wait, but if the substituents are in para positions, perhaps the benzene has a COOH group and another group in position 4. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4.

So the structure would be 4-...-substituted benzoic acid. Alternatively, if the substituent is in position 2 and 4, but that's less likely.

Wait, the NMR data suggests that the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that indicates that the substituents are in para positions, causing the coupling between adjacent protons.

So, the benzene ring has two substituents opposite each other (para), each substituent causing the adjacent protons to be in a doublet.

So, the structure is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene.

One substituent is a COOH group, and the other is a side chain.

Looking at the NMR, the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group adjacent to a CH, as in an isobutyl group.

Wait, the isobutyl group structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, no. Isobutyl is (CH2CH2)2CH- attached to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps it's a (CH2)2CHCH2CH3 group, but that's more like a pentyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Let's think about the lower field shifts.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group attached to a carbonyl. Wait, if the substituent is a CH2COOH group, but that's not matching the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group, but that doesn't fit the NMR. Wait, the substituent might be a propyl group attached to the ring, and the side chain has a methyl group attached to a CH.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which would be an isobutyl group. Let me think: the isobutyl group would have a CH(CH2CH3) connected to the ring. So the CH would be the central carbon, attached to two CH2CH3 groups.

Wait, but the NMR data doesn't show a triplet for a CH2CH2CH3 group. Hmm.

Wait, the substituent's NMR signals: the 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be the central CH in an isobutyl group. The 1.7 (2H, m) could be the two CH2 groups adjacent to the CH. The 1.4 (3H, d) would be the methyl groups attached to the CH. And the 0.9 (3H, t) would be from a CH2CH3 group. Wait, but that doesn't fit because isobutyl doesn't have a terminal methyl as a triplet. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tert-butyl group, but that would have a singlet for the CH3 groups.

Wait, let me think about the substituent. The substituent is attached to the benzene ring. Let's say it's a group like CH2CH2CH2CH3 or CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, the substituent's NMR parts:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H):
