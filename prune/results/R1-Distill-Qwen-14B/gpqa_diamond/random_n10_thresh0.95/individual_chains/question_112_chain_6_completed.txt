Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, such that it is proportional to (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>. The |up> and |down> states are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator whose matrix representation has elements Aij. The Aij elements are hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Then, find the average value of that operator.

The options are A to D, each giving two probabilities and an average value.

Hmm, so I think I'll approach this in two parts. First, deal with the state |alpha>, then figure out the operator's eigenstates and compute the probabilities and expectation value.

Let me start with the state |alpha>. It's given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Since it's proportional, I'll need to normalize it. So the first step is to find the normalization constant.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. Let's compute that. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so when I take the inner product, it's the sum of the magnitudes squared of the coefficients.

Coefficient for |up> is (1+i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
Coefficient for |down> is (2-i). The magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator whose matrix is Aij. The matrix elements are Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because the state is two-dimensional (up and down). So the matrix would be:

For i=1, j=2: A12 = hbar/2, A21=hbar/2. The diagonal elements A11=0, A22=0.

So the matrix is:
[0   hbar/2
hbar/2   0]

Hmm, this looks familiar. This is similar to the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 1s off-diagonal and 0s on the diagonal. So the operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

But I think another approach is to diagonalize this matrix to find its eigenstates because the problem mentions measuring in the eigenstates of this operator. So when we measure, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the eigenstates in the given state |alpha>.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this. The operator has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, else 0. So the matrix is:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

So to find its eigenstates and eigenvalues, I can solve the characteristic equation.

The eigenvalues λ are found by det(A - λ I) = 0.

So:

| -λ     hbar/2      |
| hbar/2   -λ       | = 0

The determinant is λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0 → λ² = hbar² /4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenstates. For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I)|v> = 0 → each component equation:

(-λ - 0) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → (-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

Similarly, the other equation would give the same condition.

So the eigenstate is proportional to (1,1). But wait, wait, in terms of |up> and |down>, or in terms of the basis vectors.

Wait, the matrix is written in the basis of |up> and |down>, right? So the eigenstate vectors are in this basis.

So for λ = hbar/2, the eigenstate is (1,1), but normalized. The vector is |v> = (1,1)^T. The norm is sqrt(1² +1²) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2, the eigenstate would be (1, -1)^T, normalized as (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), since the Pauli X eigenstates are these.

Wait, but the operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenvalues are ±hbar/2, and the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x> as above.

So now, the state |alpha> can be expressed in terms of these eigenstates. The probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue are the square of the amplitudes of each eigenstate in |alpha>.

So, to compute the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>, and then the coefficients will give the amplitudes.

Let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

And the eigenstates are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),

|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me write |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

So,

a = < +x | alpha >,

b = < -x | alpha >.

Compute a:

a = [ (1/sqrt(2)) <up| + (1/sqrt(2)) <down| ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2-i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> 

+ (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) <down|down>

But <up|down> is zero, and <up|up> is 1, same for <down|down> is 1.

So,

a = [ (1+i)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) ) ] * 1 + [ (2 - i)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) ) ] * 0 (since <down|up> is 0) 

Plus the other terms which are zero because <up|down> and <down|up> are zero.

Wait no, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me recompute that.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.

The inner product is:

a = < +x | alpha > 

= (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So the terms are:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> 
+ (1/sqrt(2)) * (2-i)/sqrt(7) * <down|down> 
+ (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|down> 
+ (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down|up>.

But <up|down> is zero, same as <down|up> is zero.

So,

a = (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) ) [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i) * 1 ]

Wait, no. Wait, the second term is (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) times <down|down>, which is 1. So,

a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) )

Simplify the numerator:

(1+i + 2 -i ) = 3.

So a = 3/(sqrt(14) ).

Similarly, compute b = < -x | alpha >.

|−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), so:

b = (1/sqrt(2)) <up| - (1/sqrt(2)) <down| ) * |alpha>

= (1/sqrt(2)) (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> 
- (1/sqrt(2)) (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> )

Again, since <up|up> is 1 and <down|down> is 1.

So,

b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(2) sqrt(7) )

Compute numerator:

(1 + i -2 + i) = (-1 + 2i) → ( -1 + 2i )

So,

b = ( -1 + 2i ) / ( sqrt(14) )

Wait, but wait, because I might have made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, let me compute it again:

b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(14) )

= [1 +i -2 +i ] = (-1 + 2i )

So, a = 3/sqrt(14 ), b = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |a|² and |b|².

Compute |a|²: (3)^2 / (14 ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.64286.

Compute |b|²: [ (-1 + 2i) ] * [ (-1 -2i) ] / 14 

= [ (1)^2 + (2)^2 ] = 1 +4=5 → 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, so the probabilities are approximately 9/14 ≈ 0.64286 and 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which matches these approximately. But let me check all options.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of b.

Wait, a was 3/sqrt(14), so |a|² is 9/14 ≈ 0.642857, which is approximately 0.64.

b is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14), so |b|² is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14 ≈ 0.35714, which is approximately 0.36.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So that would correspond to the first part of option A.

But wait, let's double-check the calculation of a. Because when I compute a, I had:

a = (1+i + 2 -i ) / (sqrt(14)).

Which is (3) / sqrt(14).

Wait, (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3, correct.

So a is 3/sqrt(14 ), so |a|² is 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, for b:

Numerator is (-1 + 2i), so |b|² is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = 1+4=5 → 5/14 ≈0.35714.

So probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.642857 and 0.35714. So when rounded, that's about 0.64 and 0.36.

Option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7 as the average. Let's check the average value.

The average value of operator A is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, the expectation value is |a|^2 * (hbar/2) + |b|^2 * (-hbar/2).

So,

⟨A⟩ = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) 

= [ (9/14 -5/14) (hbar/2) ) ]

= (4/14) (hbar/2 )

= (2/7) (hbar /2 )

= (hbar /7 )

So the average is hbar /7.

Looking back at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, which matches. So the first part of option A matches.

Wait, but let me see if any other option matches. Option D has average 2hbar/sqrt(7), which is about 2.35hbar. But our calculation gives hbar/7, about 0.14 hbar. So only option A has hbar/7 as the average.

But wait, let me compute the expectation value another way just to be sure.

Another way: Since A is the operator with the matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], the expectation value is ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

Compute this as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So,

⟨alpha|A|alpha⟩ = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Compute A|alpha> first.

A|alpha> = (0)(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> 

+ (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (0)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, better to write A as:

A = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

So,

A |alpha> = (hbar/2) [ 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 1*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) |up> + [ 1*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) |down> ]

So,

A |alpha> = (hbar/2) [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (1 + i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Now, compute ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩:

⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩ = [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * (hbar/2) [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (1 +i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So,

= (hbar/2) [ ( (1 -i)(2 -i) )/(7) + ( (2 +i)(1 +i) )/(7) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 2(1) -1(i) -2i + i² → 2 -i -2i -1 (since i²=-1) → (2 -1) + (-3i) → 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i² → 2 +2i +i -1 → (2-1) +3i →1 +3i.

Sum both terms: (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So,

⟨A⟩ = (hbar/2) * (2) /7 = (hbar/2) * (2/7 )= hbar/7.

Yes, same as before. So the average is indeed hbar/7.

So, putting it together, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7.

Wait, but let me check if any of the options have these values.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 → yes.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29, 2hbar/sqrt(7) → different.

So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the probabilities. Because when I calculated the probabilities as 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.642857 and 0.357143, which are 0.64 and 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

So the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization condition is \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = 1 \). The coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are \( (1+i) \) and \( (2-i) \), respectively. The squared magnitudes of these coefficients are \( |1+i|^2 = 2 \) and \( |2-i|^2 = 5 \), so the total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \). The normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we analyze the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This matrix is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives \( \lambda^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} \). Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). The coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) in \( |\alpha\rangle = a|+x\rangle + b|-x\rangle \) are calculated as:

\[
a = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
b = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|a|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429, \quad |b|^2 = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

The average value of the operator \( A \) is given by \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Using the eigenstate decomposition, this is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |b|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting \( |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \):

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \hbar / 7 \).**

Answer: A
