Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The question is about identifying a compound after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds.

First, I need to figure out what the structure of Compound X is, based on the given IR and NMR data. Then, determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So maybe Compound X has a ketone group.

Looking at the IR data:
- The peak around 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests an -OH stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, another peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that's probably a ketone or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. But the 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid; they usually are around 1700. So maybe it's a ketone or an ester. Wait, but the IR also has a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those could be aromatic C=C stretches, which makes sense if there's a benzene ring in the compound.

Looking at the NMR data:

- The 10.5 ppm peak (bs, 1H) is probably an -OH proton, but wait, carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm. But if it's an aldehyde, that's also around there. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like from a phenol? Hmm.

Wait, the 1720 cm-1 in IR suggests a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's a ketone. But let's look at the NMR.

The NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehydes typically show around 9-10 ppm, so 10.5 might be a bit upfield but possible. So, if there's an aldehyde group, that could be part of the structure.

Wait, but let me think again. The IR has 1720 cm-1 which is a strong peak for a carbonyl. Aldehydes have lower carbonyl frequencies, like around 1700–1720, but ketones are similar. Wait, maybe it's a ketone. If it's a ketone, then the NMR wouldn't have an aldehyde proton. But wait, the 10.5 ppm in the NMR could be an aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. The 1720 is a bit high for that, but sometimes they can be higher if deprotonated or in certain conditions. But then the 10.5 ppm would fit for a COOH proton. But wait, the NMR shows a singlet for that peak, but it's broad. So maybe it's an -OH, such as from a phenol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let me think about the other parts of the NMR. There's a peak at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, each doublets. That suggests a para-substituted benzene, because each set of two protons would be in a doublet. So maybe the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. Let's say, maybe a ketone and another group, or an aldehyde and another group.

Wait, the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's typical for a para-substituted benzene. For example, in para-substituted benzene rings, the protons are split into two doublets, each integrating for two protons. So that's a para di-substituted benzene.

So, if the aromatic ring is para-substituted, then the substituents are on carbons 1 and 4 (or any para positions). Now, what substituents could be attached? Let's think.

Looking at the other NMR peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This could be a methine (CH) group next to an oxygen, like in a ketone or an ester. Or maybe a CH connected to an aromatic ring, such as a CH in a side chain.

Wait, but 2.9 ppm is a bit upfield for a CH attached to an aromatic ring. Maybe it's adjacent to an oxygen. If the structure has a ketone, perhaps a CH2 or CH group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Looking at the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): The 1.4 ppm, doublet, 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps as a geminal group. So maybe a CH(CH3) group. Because a doublet for the methyl would mean it's attached to a CH with another group, maybe an adjacent CH2.

Wait, perhaps this is part of a CH2CH(CH3) group or something similar. Alternatively, it's a CH with a CH2CH3 attached.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, suggesting an ethyl group perhaps. So maybe there's a propyl or butyl chain attached to the benzene ring.

Putting this together, the para-substituted benzene has groups attached that include a carbonyl group and an ethyl or propyl chain.

Wait, but if the carbonyl is a ketone, then perhaps the substituents are a ketone group and an alkyl chain. Alternatively, one substituent could be a carbonyl group, and the other substituent is an alkyl group with a branching.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures.

Suppose the benzene ring has a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and an ethyl group. But then the NMR doesn't show a carbonyl proton because it's a ketone, so the 10.5 ppm might be something else.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a ketone and another group, like a CH2CH(CH3)2 or something else.

Wait, let's look at the integration. The NMR has:

1H: 10.5 (1H), 8.0 (2H), 7.2 (2H), 2.9 (1H), 1.7 (2H), 1.4 (3H), 0.9 (3H).

So total H's: 1+2+2+1+2+3+3=14? Wait, no, wait. Let me recount:

No wait, the integrals are the number of H's each. So:

10.5: 1H

8.0: 2H

7.2: 2H

2.9: 1H

1.7: 2H

1.4: 3H

0.9: 3H

Total H: 1+2+2+1+2+3+3=14 H? So the molecule has 14 hydrogens. So molecular formula would be C10H14O? Or perhaps more.

Wait, let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the options:

Option C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Benzoic acid has a COOH group. IR would have a strong peak around 1700 (carbonyl) and an -OH around 2500–3000. Wait, the IR given has a broad peak from 3400–2500, which could be -OH. So if it's benzoic acid, the IR would have a broad O-H stretch. But the 1720 cm-1 would fit with the carboxylic acid's carbonyl. Wait, but carboxylic acids typically have a lower wavenumber, like around 1700. But 1720 is possible if it's a strong acid or in a specific environment.

So if Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then under Clemmensen reduction, the ketone (or acid?) would be reduced. Wait, Clemmensen reduces ketones to CH2 groups. But if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, would Clemmensen work? Wait, wait, Clemmensen is for ketones and aldehydes. Carboxylic acids are not directly reduced by Clemmensen because they don't have the alpha hydrogen (wait, no, they do). Wait, wait, no. Wait, Clemmensen uses H2O in HI and red phosphorus. It generally reduces ketones to alkanes. But carboxylic acids don't have alpha hydrogens unless they are adjacent to the COOH group, like in beta-keto acids.

Wait, wait, benzoic acid doesn't have alpha hydrogens. So if Compound X is benzoic acid with a substituent, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the carbonyl is a COOH group. So in the reaction with red phosphorus and HI, would that be reduced?

Wait, the Clemmensen reduction typically reduces ketones to CH2 groups. It doesn't usually reduce carboxylic acids because they don't have the necessary structure. Wait, but wait, that’s not entirely accurate. Clemmensen can reduce ketones, aldehydes, and also esters, but not carboxylic acids directly because the -COOH doesn't have the adjacent C-H bond (alpha H) that's necessary. So if the starting material has a ketone, the reaction would reduce it.

Wait, but looking back at the data, let me see: the IR has 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl group, and the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be an -OH (like carboxylic acid) or an aldehyde proton.

Wait, if the starting material is a ketone, what would the NMR and IR look like?

If it's a ketone, then the IR would show a strong C=O peak around 1720. The NMR would not have an aldehyde proton, but maybe an adjacent CH. Let's think about the NMR peaks again.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group next to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like:

Ar–CO–CH2–CH(CH3)2?

Wait, no. Wait, let's imagine a structure where the benzene ring has a substituent that's a ketone connected to a chain. For example, Ar–CO–R, where R is some alkyl chain.

But wait, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet integrating to 2H, and 1.4 is a doublet (3H), and 0.9 is a triplet (3H). That looks like a ethyl group attached to something. Because 0.9 is a terminal CH3, which is part of a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the structure is like (CH2)2CH2CH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the substituents on the benzene. The NMR shows two doublets, which suggests para substitution. So perhaps the benzene has a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and another substituent which is a branched alkyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group and a butyl group. Let's think about the substituents.

Looking at the 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which is a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is like a CH(CH3) group attached to a CH2.

So, maybe the substituent is something like CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– something. Wait, but the 0.9 triplet would be a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the substituent is -CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3? No, that's a pentyl group, but maybe part of a branch.

Wait, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–, but I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group where the middle CH is connected to a methyl.

Hmm.

Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would have a COOH group on the benzene ring, and a sec-butyl group on the para position.

So, the structure would be:

Ph–COOH (para) and Ph–O–(something else)?

No, wait, no. 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have the structure where the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 4, and a sec-butyl group at position 1 (if it's para). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the numbering would be such that the COOH is at position 4, and the substituent is at position 1, which is para to position 4. So the substituents are para to each other.

So the substituents are COOH and the sec-butyl group.

In that case, the IR would show a strong carbonyl (COOH) around 1700, and the broad O-H stretch around 3400-2500. That fits with the IR data given.

The NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets (8.0 and 7.2, each 2H) because of the para substitution.

What about the other peaks?

The 10.5 ppm is broad and 1H, which would be the COOH proton. That makes sense.

Then, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H), and 0.9 ppm (t,3H) correspond to the sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, a sec-butyl is –CH2–CH(CH3)–. Wait, wait, no. Let me get the structure right. A butyl group can be either n-butyl, iso-butyl, or sec-butyl.

Wait, for n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's a straight chain. Isobutyl is (CH3)2CH–. Sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the IUPAC nomenclature: the substituent is the longest chain possible. For a butyl group, the substituent is a four-carbon chain with the point of attachment on the second carbon.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2–, but that's not correct. Let me think again. The substituent is a four-carbon chain attached via the second carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–, but wait, that would be a pentyl group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a tert-butyl group, but that's a three-carbon substituent. Wait, no, the substituent is a butyl group, which is four carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH3)–. Wait, no, that's three carbons. Wait, no, butyl is four carbons. So, a sec-butyl group would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)–? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the NMR.

The substituent is a butyl group. So the NMR shows a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H), which is probably a CH group connected to something. Then, 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be two CH2 groups, and 1.4 (d,3H) and 0.9 (t,3H) could be methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let's say it's a CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but that's a branch on a CH2.

Wait, is it possible that the substituent is a sec-butyl group?

A sec-butyl group would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)–, but that's five carbons, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene, but that's only three carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2 group? No, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group, which may not fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to match the NMR data to a structure.

The substituent on the benzene ring has the following NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): Probably a CH connected to something, maybe a CH with adjacent CH2 groups.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): A methyl group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): A terminal methyl group, suggesting an ethyl chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. But that would be a pentyl group, which might not match. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but that's four carbons in total if attached via the first carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. That would make the NMR show a CH2 group adjacent to the benzene, then a CH(CH3)2. Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH(CH3)2 group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. Let me think about this.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which is a pentyl substituent, but I don't think that's one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So that would be a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group. But wait, the question is about the product after reaction, not the starting material. Wait, no, the options are the possible products.

Wait, the original compound is X. X reacts with red phosphorus and HI to give one of the four products. So the reaction is likely a reduction.

So, if X is a ketone, then after Clemmensen reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group. So let's think about that.

Suppose X is a compound with a benzene ring and a ketone group attached, along with a side chain. For example, something like Ar–CO–R, where R is a substituent with CH groups.

When reduced, the ketone group (Ar–CO–R) would become Ar–CH2–R.

Wait, but looking at the options, options A and C are acids, B and D are alkanes.

Wait, let me think again.

If the starting material is a ketone, then after Clemmensen, the ketone group would be reduced to a CH2 group. So, if X has a structure like Ar–CO–R, then the product would be Ar–CH2–R.

So, what would the product be? Let me look at the options.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's an acid with a propyl chain. If the starting material had a ketone, reducing it would not give an acid. So maybe option A is not likely.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl groups. Wait, but if X had a ketone, perhaps after reduction it would lose the carbonyl.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group. So if X were a benzophenone with a substituent, then reducing it would not give a carboxylic acid. So perhaps X is the benzoic acid, and the reaction is different. But wait, earlier I thought Clemmensen doesn't reduce carboxylic acids.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this reversed. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has an ester group. Because esters have both a carbonyl and an O-R group. The IR for esters would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1, which matches. Also, esters have another peak around 1050-1250 for the C-O stretch. But the IR given doesn't show that, so maybe it's not an ester.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol. But the IR would show a broad peak for the O-H in the 3400-2500 region, which it does. The 1720 would be the ketone.

So, if X is a ketone, such as Ar–CO–R, then after Clemmensen reduction, it would become Ar–CH2–R.

So, looking at the options, which of the products would result from a ketone being reduced?

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, that would be a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in para positions.

Wait, but how would that happen?

Suppose X is a para-dimethyl ketone, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative with a substituent that, when reduced, becomes a sec-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps X is 4-(propenyl)phenyl ketone or something else. I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's suppose X is 4-(propan-2-yl)benzophenone. Then, upon reduction, the ketone becomes CH2, so it would become 4-(propan-2-yl)benzyl something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a ketone and an isopropyl group. Let me think.

Wait, let's think about the NMR of X. The aromatic protons are 8.0 and 7.2, each 2H, so the substituents are in para positions. So, the substituents are a ketone group (CO-) and another group on the benzene ring.

The other peaks suggest that the substituent attached to the benzene is a CH group with a chain attached.

So, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group connected to a propyl chain with a methyl branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-C(O)- group attached to a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group.

Hmm, let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-C(O)- group connected to a CH2-CH(CH3) group.

But I'm not getting it clearly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to first try to determine the structure of X.

IR: 3400–2500 (broad, likely O-H), 1720 (C=O), plus aromatic peaks.

NMR:

- 10.5 (1H, broad, maybe -OH or aldehyde)
- 8.0 and 7.2 (aromatic, para)
- 2.9 (1H, m), 1.7 (2H, m), 1.4 (3H, d), 0.9 (3H, t)

So, perhaps X is a para-substituted benzaldehyde with a substituent that is a branched alkyl group.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton. So, if X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent in para, then the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, which matches.

So, the structure would be something like p-alkylbenzaldehyde.

But then, the substituent would have the NMR signals: 2.9 (1H), 1.7 (2H), 1.4 (3H, d), 0.9 (3H, t).

So, the substituent is probably a CH2 group connected to a CH(CH3) group, which is connected to a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, that would make the substituent a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group? Or maybe a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. But that would have a single methyl attached to the CH.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that seems too long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think: the substituent would be a CH2CH(CH3) group, but where's the rest of the chain?

Wait, the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) suggests a CH2CH3 group at the end of a chain.

So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. Wait, that's a pentyl group.

Wait, no, a pentyl group would have more carbons, but let's see: the substituent would be a four-carbon chain, with a branch.

Wait, the substituent's structure is likely to be: CH2CH(CH3)CH2– something. But perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: the NMR signals for the substituent:

- 2.9 ppm (1H, m): a CH connected to two CH2 groups.

- 1.7 ppm (2H, m): two adjacent CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (3H, d): a methyl group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (3H, t): a terminal methyl, suggesting an ethyl group.

So, the substituent is a CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3 group. Wait, that's a butyl group, but where is the branching?

Wait, no. Let's see:

- The CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3 would be a pentyl group, but the substituent is attached to the benzene. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– group, but that leaves the 0.9 t as a CH3 at the end.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3 group. That's a pentyl group. But the CH(CH3) would be the middle, so the substituent would have the structure CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3. But that would require four carbons, which would be a butyl group, but with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2–CH(CH3)2 group. So, a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3)2. That would make the substituent a isopropyl group attached via a CH2. But the NMR would show the CH(CH3)2 as a singlet, but in this case, it's a multiplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that would be a propyl group attached to a CH.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the substituent as a -CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– group, but that doesn't fit the integration.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that would be a four-carbon chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2–CH(CH3)– group, with a methyl group attached.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– group, making the substituent a pentyl group. But I don't see how that would fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2–CH(CH3)– group, which is a propyl group with a branch. So the substituent is a -CH2–CH(CH3)– group, but that's only three carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2–CH(CH2CH3)– group. That would make the substituent a butyl group with a branch. But that would require four carbons.
