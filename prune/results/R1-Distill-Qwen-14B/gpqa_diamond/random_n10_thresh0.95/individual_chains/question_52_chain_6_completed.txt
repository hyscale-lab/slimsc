Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The problem is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless versus when it has spots.

Hmm. So, the key here is understanding how the temperature affects the population of these energy levels. The problem mentions that the transition between these levels corresponds to about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. Since the problem states that the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I can use the Boltzmann equation for this calculation.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of particles in energy levels 2 and 1, respectively.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the energy levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

The ratio we're looking at is n2/n1. The problem says that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, but why would that happen? Well, when the temperature decreases, the exponential factor exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ) becomes smaller. So if the star's overall temperature drops, the ratio n2/n1 should decrease. That makes sense because higher energy levels are less populated at lower temperatures.

But wait, the star isn't uniformly at 5500 K. Only 60% of the surface is at 6000 K (no spots), and 40% is covered by spots. But I think the problem simplifies things by considering the overall effective temperature as 5500 K when spots are present. So perhaps we can model this as the star having an average Teff of 5500 K when spots are present, even though part of it is cooler.

So, the ratio when there are no spots (T1 = 6000 K) is R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )

And when there are spots (T2 = 5500 K), R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

The factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k) ) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, because when you take R1/R2, you get [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me compute that carefully. 

ΔE = E2 - E1. The exponent in R1 is -ΔE/(k T1), and in R2 it's -ΔE/(k T2). So when you take R1/R2:

exp( (-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / exp( (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no, let me check the signs. The denominator exponent is -ΔE/(k T2). So dividing the two exponents, the exponents are (-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) which is ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) 

Wait, that would be correct. So the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Alternatively, I can compute 1/T1 and 1/T2.

Wait, but ΔE can be expressed in terms of the wavelength of the transition. The energy difference E2 - E1 is given by the photon energy E=hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light, and λ the wavelength.

So ΔE = hc / λ

So the exponent becomes (hc/λ k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but wait, because E = hc/λ, and since E2 > E1 (because higher energy level), ΔE is positive.

So putting it all together, the ratio R1/R2 is exp( (hc/(λ k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, but wait, no. Because when T increases, the denominator increases, so 1/T decreases. So if T2 < T1, then 1/T2 > 1/T1, so 1/T2 - 1/T1 is positive. Therefore, the exponent becomes positive.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. Or maybe I should compute it as (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

So, in our case, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K. So T1 - T2 is 500 K.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (500) / (6000 * 5500 ) 

Wait, let me compute that numerically.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the exponent. Let me write:

Exponent = (hc/(k λ)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But I can compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) as (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2) )

Wait, no, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ). Because:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) )

So, Exponent = (hc/(k λ)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio R decreases. So R2 = R1 * factor, where the factor is less than 1. So R1/R2 = factor is greater than 1.

Wait, let me re-express the ratio R1/R2.

R1/R2 = exp( (hc/(k λ)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which is exp( (hc/(k λ)) ( (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) )

Because T2 is 5500 K.

Wait, but wait, 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1 because T2 is smaller. So (1/5500) - (1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(5500*6000) )

Hmm. Let me compute that.

Compute denominator: 5500 * 6000 = 33,000,000.

So 500/(33e6) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 0.0000151515...

Wait, that's roughly 1.515e-5.

Now, compute (hc)/(k λ).

We know that hc is approximately 12400 eV·Å. Because hc = 12400 eV·Å. Let me confirm that. Yes, hc ≈ 12400 eV·Å.

Wait, but wait, λ is given in Angstroms: 1448 Å = 1448 A.

So, hc/(λ) = 12400 / 1448 ≈ let me compute that.

12400 ÷ 1448 ≈ around 8.58 eV.

Wait, because 1448 * 8 is 11584, and 1448 * 8.5 is about 12308, which is close to 12400. So 8.58 eV.

Now, hc/(k λ) ?

Wait, k (Boltzmann constant) is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So hc/(k λ) = (8.58 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) ≈ 8.58 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 8.58 / 0.00008617 ≈ approximately 100,000.

Wait, wait, let's compute it more accurately.

8.58 / 8.617e-5 = 8.58 / (8.617 * 1e-5) ) = (8.58 / 8.617) ) * 1e5 ≈ (0.995) ) * 1e5 ≈ 99,500.

So, hc/(k λ) ≈ 99,500 K.

So now, the exponent is:

(99,500 K) * ( (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) 

Wait, no, it's (1/T2 - 1/T1) which is (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 500/(5500*6000) ) ≈ 500/(33,000,000) ) ≈ 1.51515e-5.

So, multiply 99,500 K by 1.51515e-5 1/K:

99,500 * 1.51515e-5 ≈ 99,500 * 1.51515e-5.

Compute 99,500 * 1.51515e-5:

99,500 * 1.51515e-5 = (99,500 / 1e5) ) * 1.51515 * 1e5 )

Wait, 99,500 is 0.995e5, so 0.995e5 * 1.51515e-5 = 0.995 * 1.51515 ≈ 1.507.

So the exponent is approximately 1.507.

So, the ratio R1/R2 = exp(1.507) ≈ e^1.507.

What's e^1.507? Let me compute that. e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, and e^1.507 is a bit higher.

Wait, 1.507 is approximately 1.5 + 0.007.

So e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

e^0.007 ≈ 1 + 0.007 + (0.007)^2/2 ≈ 1.00700245.

So, e^1.507 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.00700245 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.007 ≈ let's compute:

4.4817 * 1.007 = 

4.4817 * 1 = 4.4817

4.4817 * 0.007 = about 0.03137

Total ≈ 4.513.

Wait, but wait, let me check with a calculator approach. Alternatively, knowing that ln(7) is about 1.9459, so e^1.507 is less than that. Wait, but 1.507 is about 1.507, which is about 1.5. So e^1.5 is about 4.4817, as I thought.

Wait, but wait, perhaps my initial calculation is slightly off. Let me double-check the exponent.

Wait, let me compute (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = (6000-5500)/(6000 * 5500) )= 500/(33e6) ) ≈ 1.515e-5.

Then, (hc/(k λ))= 99,500 K.

Multiply them: 99,500 * 1.515e-5 = 99,500 * 1.515e-5.

Let me compute 99,500 * 1.515e-5.

1.515e-5 is the same as 0.00001515.

99,500 * 0.00001515 = 

Let me compute 99,500 * 0.00001515.

First, 99,500 * 0.00001 = 0.995.

99,500 * 0.00000515 = 99,500 * 5.15e-6 = 99,500 * 5.15e-6.

99,500 * 5e-6 = 0.4975.

99,500 * 0.15e-6 = 99,500 * 1.5e-7 = approximately 0.014925.

So 0.4975 + 0.014925 = 0.512425.

So total is 0.995 + 0.512425 = 1.507425.

So the exponent is 1.5074, meaning R1/R2 = e^(1.5074) ≈ 4.51.

Wait, but wait, I thought 4.5 was an option. Let me look at the options.

Options are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So option C is ~4.5. So the factor is about 4.5.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I made a mistake here. Because the ratio is R1/R2, and when the star has spots, the ratio R is lower. So when the spots are present, the ratio is R2, which is lower than R1. So the factor by which the ratio changes is R1 / R2 = 4.5.

Wait, the question says, "the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots." So that's R1 divided by R2, which is 4.5, so the ratio increases by a factor of 4.5. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait, no! Because in the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So if R is the ratio, then R_spot = R2 = R1 * (some factor) but less than R1. So R1/R2 is the factor by which it changes, which is greater than 1.

Wait, from our calculation, we found that R1/R2 is about 4.5, which would mean that when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is 4.5 times higher than when it has spots. So the factor is 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which matches. So the answer should be C.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, going back to the exponent: (hc/(k λ)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, but I think I might have confused the order of T1 and T2. Because when the star has spots, the effective temperature drops to 5500 K, so when computing the ratio R2, it's at T2=5500 K.

So in the exponent, it's (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = positive value, as T2 < T1.

So the exponent is positive, and that means that R1/R2 is exp(positive) which is greater than 1, which matches what we found.

So, the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]

Here, \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the transition (1448 Å). The ratio of the populations at two temperatures, \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (with spots), is given by:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \Delta E / k \)
The energy difference \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( hc \approx 12400 \, \text{eV·Å} \) and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Thus:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{12400}{1448} \approx 8.58 \, \text{eV}
\]

The Boltzmann constant \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \), so:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.58}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,500 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \)
For \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{500}{5500 \times 6000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
The exponent is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99,500 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.507
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.507) \approx 4.51
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
The ratio \( R_1 / R_2 \) indicates that the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times larger when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.
