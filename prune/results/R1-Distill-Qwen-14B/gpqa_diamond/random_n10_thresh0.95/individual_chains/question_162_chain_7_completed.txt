Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me try to think through this.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it only has dx and dy terms. So the space described by this metric is two-dimensional, probably a surface in higher-dimensional space, maybe a pseudosphere.

Wait, no, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Oh wait, in two dimensions, a pseudosphere would have a metric that represents hyperbolic geometry. But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Normally, the area of a sphere is 4πr², but for a pseudosphere, which is a surface with infinite area? Or maybe it's a different approach.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Pseudosphere is a specific shape, but in differential geometry, a surface with constant negative curvature would have a metric that's conformally flat, like the one given here. Let me see: the metric is conformally flat because it's of the form f(x,y)(dx² + dy²). So f(x,y) is 32/(4 -x² - y²).

Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which makes me think that this metric is defined where 4 - x² - y² > 0, so x² + y² <4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. That's interesting. So the coordinates are probably in polar coordinates, but it's written in Cartesian here. But in any case, the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, right?

Wait, no, in two dimensions, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. For a metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy², the determinant is g_{xx} g_{yy} - (g_{xy})². In this case, the metric is diagonal, so g_{xy}=0, and g_{xx}=g_{yy}=32/(4 -x² - y²). So det g is [32/(4 - r²)]^2, where r² = x² + y².

So the area element would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt([32/(4 - r²)]^2) = 32/(4 - r²). So the area is the integral of 32/(4 - r²) dx dy over the region where r² <4.

Wait, but in polar coordinates, dx dy is r dr dθ. So the integral becomes ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this. So the area A is the double integral of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ over r from 0 to 2 and θ from 0 to 2π.

So first, the integral over θ is straightforward. The integrand doesn't depend on θ, so integrating from 0 to 2π just multiplies by 2π.

So A = 2π ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Hmm, let's compute that integral. Let me substitute u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [32/(u)] * (-du/2) 

Wait, because r dr is [ - du/2 ].

So the integral is (32/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) (-du) ) 

Which is 16 ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) (-du) )

But the (-du) flips the limits to 0 to4, so it becomes 16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du.

Which is 16 [ ln u ] from 0 to4 → 16 (ln 4 - ln 0 )

Wait, but ln 0 is -infinity. Oh no, that's a problem. So the integral diverges. That would mean that the area is infinite.

Wait, but why? Because as r approaches 2, the denominator 4 - r² approaches zero, so the integrand behaves like 32 r/(4 - r²) ≈ 32/(4 - r²), which goes to infinity as r approaches 2. So the integral from 0 to 2 will diverge because near r=2, the integrand becomes unbounded.

So the area would be infinite. So looking at the options, option D is +infty.

But wait, the question was about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, but I thought pseudospheres have finite area but maybe not. Wait, no. A pseudosphere is a surface of infinite extent, but perhaps in this case, it's a specific case. Wait, but the metric given is for a model of hyperbolic space, maybe the Poincaré disk model. In that model, the entire hyperbolic plane is represented within a finite disk, but the area is still infinite because the curvature is negative, so the volume grows exponentially.

So in this case, the area of this space (which is a 2-dimensional pseudosphere or hyperbolic plane) would be infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

Looking back at the options:

A) 0 → No, the area isn't zero.

B) 4π(x² + y²) → No, that doesn't make sense because x and y are variables, not constants in the area.

C) 4π(x² - y²) → Same issue as B.

D) +infty → Yes, that's what I calculated.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space. The metric is defined for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), meaning the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. To compute the area of this space, we use the area element in two dimensions, which is \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy\). For this metric, \(\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2\), so the area element becomes:

\[
\sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area element becomes:

\[
\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then given by the integral:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\) is straightforward. The radial integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(-\frac{du}{2} = r \, dr\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{32}{u} \cdot \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
16 \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 16 (\ln 4 - \ln 0).
\]

Since \(\ln 0 = -\infty\), the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite. This result aligns with the fact that the given metric represents a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as \(x\) and \(y\) are variables, not constants in the area.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect for the same reason as B.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the area diverges due to the infinite extent of the hyperbolic plane.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
