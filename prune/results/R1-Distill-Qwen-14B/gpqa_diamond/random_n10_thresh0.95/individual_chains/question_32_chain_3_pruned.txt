Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking me to find the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions like gold nuclei, but here it's a different nucleus called X.

Wait, the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, Li is lithium. So, the standard lithium has 3 protons and variable neutrons. The most common isotope is Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. But if X has 3 neutrons, then the isotope would be Li-6 (3 protons +3 neutrons). So the mass number A is 6 for this nucleus.

So, the problem is about calculating the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I think this involves relativistic mechanics because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light.

I recall that the total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the equation E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, I'll need to calculate gamma first.

Let me plug in v = 0.96c into the gamma equation. Let's compute 1 - v²/c². That would be 1 - (0.96c)^2 / c². The c² cancels out, so it's 1 - 0.96². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784.

Then sqrt(0.0784) is... Hmm, 0.28, because 0.28² is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me check that calculation again. Because 0.28 squared is indeed 0.0784, so yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857... So that's about 3.5714.

Now, I need the mass of the lithium nucleus. Since it's Li-6, the atomic number is 3 (protons) and neutrons are 3, so total mass number A is 6. The mass of a single Li-6 nucleus would be approximately the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. But wait, more accurately, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum due to binding energy, but when calculating the rest mass for relativistic energy, perhaps we can use the actual rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, maybe I should find the rest mass energy of the nucleus. So, the rest mass energy is mc². Then, the total energy is gamma times that.

What's the rest mass of Li-6? I think I should look up the atomic mass of lithium-6. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate it. Wait, but I don't have a table right now. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So each proton is about 938, neutron about 939.

So, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so total mass would be approximately 3*(938 +939)/something? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each proton is 938 MeV/c², each neutron is about 939.5 MeV/c² or so. Let me get the exact numbers.

Wait, the proton mass is about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, mass would be 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = let's compute that.

3 * 938.272 is 3*900=2700, 3*38.272=114.816 → total 2814.816 MeV.

3 * 939.565 is 3 *900=2700, 3*39.565=118.695 → 2818.695 MeV.

So total is 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. But wait, that's the sum of the individual nucleon masses. However, the actual mass of the nucleus is less due to the binding energy (mass defect). So the rest mass of Li-6 is lower than 5633.511 MeV.

Wait, but perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is known. Let me think. I remember that the exact mass can be found using the periodic table. The atomic mass of Li is approximately 6.941 g/mol. Wait, but that's the average, and for Li-6, the exact mass is about 6.015122824 g/mol.

Wait, more accurately, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.015122824 u (atomic mass units). 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c².

So, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is m*c² = 6.015122824 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Calculating that: 6.015122824 * 931.5 ≈ Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. Then 0.015122824 * 931.5 ≈ approx 14.07 MeV. So total is about 5589 +14.07 = 5603.07 MeV, which is 5.60307 GeV.

Wait, but wait a minute. The atomic mass includes electrons, right? Because the atomic mass is the mass of the nucleus plus the electrons. Since Li has 3 electrons, we need to subtract their masses.

Wait, because the nucleus is Li-6, so the neutral atom has 3 electrons. So the rest mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Hmm, so the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.015122824 u. The mass of each electron is about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons would be 3 * 0.00054858 ≈ 0.00164574 u.

So the nucleus mass is 6.015122824 u - 0.00164574 u = 6.013477084 u.

Now, converting that to MeV: 6.013477084 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ let's compute.

6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.013477084 * 931.5 ≈ Let's see, 0.01 *931.5 =9.315, 0.003477084 *931.5 ≈ approx 3.237. So total 9.315 +3.237=12.552.

So 5589 +12.552=5601.552 MeV, which is 5.601552 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.601552 GeV.

Now, the gamma factor we found earlier was approximately 3.5714.

So the total energy E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.601552 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *5.601552. Let's compute 3.5 *5.601552 = 19.605432.

Then 0.0714 *5.601552 ≈ 0.0714 *5=0.357; 0.0714 *0.601552 ≈ approx 0.04296. So total about 0.4 (approx 0.357+0.04296=0.39996).

So 19.605432 + 0.39996 = approx 19.605432 +0.4=19.605432 +0.39996= ~19.6054 + 0.4=19.6054+0.39996=19.6054+0.4=19.6054+0.39996=19.6054 +0.4 is 19.6054 +0.4=19.6054 +0.39996 is 19.6054 +0.4 is 19.6054 +0.39996= 20.00536 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

3.5714 *5.601552.

Let me compute 3.5714 multiplied step by step.

I can write 3.5714 = 3 + 0.5 + 0.07 + 0.0014.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 3.5714 *5.601552.

Let me compute 3 *5.601552 = 16.804656.

0.5 *5.601552 = 2.800776.

0.07 *5.601552 = 0.39210864.

0.0014 *5.601552 ≈ 0.00784217.

Now sum them:

16.804656 +2.800776 =19.605432.

19.605432 +0.39210864=19.99754064.

19.99754064 +0.00784217=20.00538281 GeV.

So approximately 20.0054 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's close but not exact. Let me check where I might have made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps my approximation of gamma isn't precise enough. Let me recalculate gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c.

So, v² = (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, but let me compute 1/0.28 exactly.

0.28 is 28/100 =7/25.

So, 1/(7/25) =25/7=3.57142857... So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation of the rest mass energy is more precise? Let me redo that.

The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.015122824 u.

Number of electrons is 3, each is 0.0005485799 u.

So 3 × 0.0005485799 = 0.0016457397 u.

Subtracting that from 6.015122824 gives:

6.015122824 - 0.0016457397 =6.0134770843 u.

Now, multiply by 931.494 MeV/u to get the rest mass energy.

Wait, I should use the exact conversion factor. 1 u =931.494095 MeV/c², so let's use 931.4941 for precision.

So 6.0134770843 u * 931.4941 MeV/u = ?

Calculating this:

First, 6 * 931.4941 =5588.9646 MeV.

0.0134770843 *931.4941 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.4941 =9.314941
0.0034770843 *931.4941 ≈ let's compute 0.003 *931.4941=2.7944823, 0.0004770843 *931.4941≈ approx 0.4459.

So 0.0034770843 *931.4941 ≈2.7944823 +0.4459=3.24038.

So total is 9.314941 +3.24038=12.555321.

So total rest mass is 5588.9646 +12.555321 =5601.5199 MeV, or 5.6015199 GeV.

So, more precisely, the rest mass energy is 5.60152 GeV.

Now, multiply by gamma=3.57142857.

So 5.60152 *3.57142857.

Let me compute this accurately.

Break it down:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.60152 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857 =2.142857142.

0.00152 *3.57142857 ≈0.00543333.

So total for 0.60152 is 2.142857142 +0.00543333 ≈2.14829047.

So 0.60152 *3.57142857 ≈2.14829.

So combining both parts: 17.85714285 +2.14829 ≈20.00543 GeV.

Wait, but that gives 20.00543 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher than this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the rest mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong value for the atomic mass.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015122824 u. But wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is that atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons, as I did before. That gives 6.013477084 u, which multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u gives 5.6015 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact value using more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the total energy in a collider. Wait, in a collider, particles are accelerated to a certain energy, and the total energy per particle is given by E = gamma * m c².

Wait, but the question is about the energy of the RHIC. RHIC accelerates heavy ions like gold, but in this case, it's Li-6. So the energy per nucleus would be what I calculated, gamma times the rest mass energy.

Wait, but I think I should be precise with the calculation.

So, 5.60152 GeV *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.60152 *3.57142857.

I'll compute 5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.60152 *3.57142857 = let's compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 is 25/7, since 3.57142857 =25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So 0.60152 *25/7.

Let me compute 0.60152 *25 =15.038, divided by 7 →15.038/7=2.1482857.

So 0.60152 *3.57142857 ≈2.1482857.

So sum is 17.85714285 + 2.1482857 =20.00542855 GeV.

So about 20.0054 GeV.

Looking back at the options: option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is higher than I calculated. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual molar mass of Li-6 is different. Let me think: the exact mass of Li-6 isotope is 6.015122824 u.

Wait, and each electron is 0.0005485799 u. So 3 electrons =3 *0.0005485799 =0.0016457397 u.

So 6.015122824 -0.0016457397 =6.013477084 u.

Multiply by 931.4941 MeV/u.

6.013477084 *931.4941 = let me compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 6 *931.4941 =5588.9646.

0.013477084 *931.4941.

Let's compute 0.01 *931.4941 =9.314941.

0.003477084 *931.4941.

Breaking this down:

0.003 *931.4941 =2.7944823.

0.000477084 *931.4941.

Compute 0.0004 *931.4941=0.37259764.

0.000077084 *931.4941 ≈ approx 0.07192.

So 0.37259764+0.07192 =0.44451764.

So 2.7944823 +0.44451764=3.23899994.

So 0.003477084 *931.4941=3.23899994.

So total 0.013477084 *93
