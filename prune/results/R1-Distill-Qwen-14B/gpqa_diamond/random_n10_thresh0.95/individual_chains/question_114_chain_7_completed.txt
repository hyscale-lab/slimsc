Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the reactions given. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is a source of the cyanide ion, which is a good nucleophile. So, when a ketone reacts with CN-, it usually adds to the carbonyl group. But wait, what happens after the addition?

Oh right, after the nucleophilic addition, the product is a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. But wait, what's the exact reagent here? Since the problem gives NaCN as a reactant, maybe the reaction is done in a basic condition. Or perhaps another acid is needed for work-up.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, from butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO), adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Then, maybe during the reaction, we have some acid work-up. Oh wait, but in the reactants, the reagent A is added with NaCN. So, perhaps A is the acid that protonates the solution or is part of the reaction conditions.

Wait, when you make a cyanohydrin from a ketone, the reaction is typically done under acidic conditions. Because the mechanism involves the attack of the nucleophile on an activated carbonyl, which is protonated. Or wait, maybe it's done in a basic solution, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses an acid catalyst.

Let me think: the reaction of a ketone with NaCN under acidic conditions. Oh, wait, I think the reaction is done in a protic solvent with an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or another acid. So, for the first step, the reagent A would be H3O+ (which is option A or B). Or perhaps it's a base, but I don't think so because the product has an -OH group, which suggests that the CN added in a way that the proton is retained.

Wait, the cyanide ion is a strong nucleophile, and in a protic solvent, the ketone's carbonyl is activated by protonation. So, the acid (like H3O+) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack. So, in the first reaction, the reagent A is H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. That looks like a cyanohydrin because it's a secondary alcohol adjacent to a nitrile group. Then, reagent B and water are used to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, the transformation from a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form carboxylic acids. But wait, the conditions matter. If it's under acidic conditions, you typically use H3O+ and heat. Alternatively, sometimes using a strong acid like HCl.

Wait, but what about the presence of water. So, in the second reaction, the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So, hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid.

The general reaction for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid is typically done under strong acidic conditions, like HCl, with heat and water. Alternatively, in some cases, you might use a base, but that would give a carboxylate which then would need acid work-up.

Wait, looking at the product, it's a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must have been done under acidic conditions. Because if it's done in base, you'd initially get the carboxylate, which would then need to be acidified. But in this case, the B reagent is used along with water, so perhaps B is an acid catalyst, like HCl.

Wait, but the options for B are HCl (option A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D). Let me think again. The standard way to hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids is using a strong acid, like HCl, with heating. For example, the hydrolysis of nitriles under acidic conditions: R-CN + H2O (H+/H2O) → R-COOH.

Alternatively, sometimes it's done under basic conditions, but that would form the sodium salt, which is then acidified. But since in this problem, the work-up is with H2O and B, perhaps B is HCl.

Putting it all together. First reaction uses H3O+ (so A is H3O+). Second reaction uses HCl as B.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → This matches.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH → Not sure, but I think B needs to be HCl.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B=HCl → Probably incorrect because first step needs acid.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH → Also seems off.

So, the correct answer should be option A.


The first reaction involves butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl group of the ketone. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, acidic conditions are typically required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl group more electrophilic. Therefore, reagent A is likely H₃O⁺, which provides the necessary acidic environment.

The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B and water to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids is typically carried out under acidic conditions, such as with HCl, to ensure the formation of the carboxylic acid rather than the carboxylate salt. Therefore, reagent B is likely HCl.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl → Matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH → While A is correct, B is not suitable for nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.
- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl → A is incorrect for the first reaction.
- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH → Both A and B are incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
