Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves wave functions and normalization. Oh right, normalization is when the total probability of finding a particle in all possible states is 1. That makes sense.

So, the problem says we've got ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle that behaves under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, and the square root of -1 is i. Oh right, that's the imaginary unit.

The key point is that when they measure the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So the particles are only in that interval. That means the wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3. Or wait, maybe not exactly zero, but the probability is zero beyond those points.

Wait, no. Wait, the wave function is given as this expression, but the question says that when they measure, particles are only found between 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval, but in the given wave function, it's non-zero even outside. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the wave function given is only valid between x=1 and x=3. Because the problem says, "in a part of space where it can exist." So maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's a complex number. Hmm, but the square root of (1+x) would require that 1+x is positive, so x > -1. But our particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is zero outside that interval, but the part given is for the region where x is between 1 and 3.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero otherwise. But the expression given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps this is the expression in the region where it's non-zero, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the wave function is a complex function. The square of the absolute value of the wave function gives the probability density. So the probability of finding the particle between x=1 and x=3 is given by the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3, and that should equal 1 because all the probability is there.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, but only for x between 1 and 3. Elsewhere, ψ(x)=0. So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let me compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ is a complex number, its magnitude squared is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So:

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i

So the real part is a / sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the magnitude squared is [a² / (1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, no. Wait, the magnitude squared of a complex number a + ib is a² + b². So in this case, the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is (-0.5). So the magnitude is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the normalization integral becomes the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

So we can split this integral into two parts: integral of a²/(1+x) dx plus integral of 0.25 dx, both evaluated from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each integral separately.

First integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3 gives ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So combining both parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a squared is 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

Then a is the square root of that. So sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is approximately 0.849. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps. Did I make any mistake in the calculations?

Wait, let me recheck the wave function. The problem says the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I compute |ψ|^2, I have [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. That's correct.

The integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx.

Integral of a²/(1+x) is a² ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3: a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Integral of 0.25 dx is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and it is specified that the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). The probability density is proportional to \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition requires that the total probability over the interval \( [1, 3] \) equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]

   Thus, the first term becomes:
   \[
   a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \implies a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.849.
\]

Comparing this result to the options, the closest value is \( a = 0.85 \).

**Answer: B**
