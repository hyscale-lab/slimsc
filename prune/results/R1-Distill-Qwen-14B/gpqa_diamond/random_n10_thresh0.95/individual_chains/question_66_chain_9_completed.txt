Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this SMEFT question. SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that it's a framework used to describe physics beyond the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. But wait, what's the question again? Oh right, which symmetries must all operators in SMEFT respect.

The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. And the choices are combinations of these. Hmm, I think I need to recall what each symmetry entails and whether SMEFT includes them.

First, Lorentz Symmetry. SMEFT, being an effective field theory, should respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, so SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars. That means Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare a combination of Lorentz and translations? Oh right, Poincare symmetry includes translations, which means momentum conservation and stuff. But effective field theories like SMEFT are usually formulated in a way that respects Poincare. However, when you add higher-dimensional operators, do they automatically respect this? I think that in SMEFT, the operators are local, so they should respect Poincare symmetry as well. So option 2, Poincare, might also be a symmetry that operators must respect. Wait, but the question says "must be respected by all operators." So if all operators respect Lorentz and Poincare, then 1 and 2 would be correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because in some cases, maybe when you have certain terms, you might break some symmetries. But SMEFT is constructed in a way that the operators are renormalizable-like terms, so they should maintain the symmetries of the Standard Model. Hence, Lorentz and Poincare are respected.

Now, CP symmetry (option 3). The Standard Model respects CP, but not all of its operators. Wait, no, I think the Standard Model doesn't respect CP in weak interactions, right? Like, CP violation exists in the CKM matrix. But in SMEFT, the operators can violate CP because you can have higher-dimension terms that do. So SMEFT operators don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 isn't a must.

Then there's CPT symmetry (option 4). CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories respect CPT symmetry. Because in any Lorentz-invariant QFT, CPT is a symmetry. So since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT as well. So option 4 is a must.

So putting it together: the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the required symmetries are 1,2,4. Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So that would be the correct choice.

Wait, but wait a second. Poincare symmetry includes translations, which in effective field theories are handled differently. Because SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it's constructed to be valid below a certain cutoff. But when you write the operators, you don't include explicit momentum dependence because you're working in a certain scheme. So maybe the Poincare symmetry isn't a strict requirement because the effective theory is valid up to the cutoff. Hmm, I'm a bit uncertain here. Let me think again.

Wait, in SMEFT, the operators are local, so they're written in a way that respects Poincare symmetry. Because each operator is a product of fields and derivatives, which are covariant under Poincare. So I think that all operators in SMEFT do respect Poincare symmetry. So yes, option 2 must be included.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). So the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the four symmetries provided:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model. Since the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. This ensures that the theory remains consistent with special relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. In SMEFT, operators are constructed as local, Lorentz-invariant operators, which inherently respect Poincaré symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: While the Standard Model respects CP symmetry in many of its interactions, CP violation is known to occur in weak interactions (e.g., through the CKM matrix). In SMEFT, higher-dimensional operators can explicitly violate CP symmetry. Thus, CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental property of all Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
