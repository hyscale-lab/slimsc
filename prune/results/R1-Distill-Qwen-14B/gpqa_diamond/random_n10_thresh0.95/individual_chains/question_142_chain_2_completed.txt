Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that the density matrix is a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|, but here it looks mixed.

Wait, let me think: |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in (1,1) and zeros. So when we add them, the matrix becomes diagonal with entries 1 and 1. Then we multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal entry becomes 1/2. So the density matrix ρ is:

[1/2  0
 0   1/2]

Right, that's the matrix. Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this state in qubit space. I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize quantum states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

Wait, how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch vector? I remember that any density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh, right, because for a qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix and the three Pauli matrices (X, Y, Z).

So the given ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|) = (I)/2, because |0><0| + |1><1| is the identity matrix I. So ρ = I/2. Comparing that to the general form, (I + r·σ)/2, that implies that r·σ must be zero. Because I/2 equals (I + 0)/2.

So r·σ = 0. What does that mean for the vector r? The Pauli matrices σ are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The vector r would have components (r_x, r_y, r_z). So r·σ = r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z. But if that equals zero, then each component must be zero. Because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent. So r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0. So the vector r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but wait. The Bloch vector for a mixed state is a point inside the Bloch sphere. The origin (0,0,0) would correspond to the completely mixed state. Because when r is zero, ρ = I/2, which is the maximally mixed state. So this makes sense. For a pure state, like |0><0|, the Bloch vector would be along the z-axis, like (0,0,1). But here, since it's a mixed state, and the density matrix is (I/2), it's the maximally mixed state.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). That must be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For a single qubit, the general form of a density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z\right),
\]

where \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2}I\), it is clear that the term \(r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z\) must vanish. Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this implies \(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), and \(r_z = 0\). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

From the options provided:
- **A)** \(r = (1, 1, 0)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B)** \(r = (0, 0, 1)\): Incorrect, as this corresponds to the pure state \(|1\rangle\langle 1|\), not the mixed state.
- **C)** \(r = (0, 0, 0)\): Correct, as this corresponds to the maximally mixed state \(\frac{1}{2}I\).
- **D)** \(r = (1, 1, 1)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
