Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The first part of the question is about a reaction involving butan-2-one. The reaction is between butan-2-one, sodium cyanide (NaCN), and another reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part involves a compound called 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in the presence of water) to form a carboxylic acid, specifically 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options given are combinations of A and B reagents. So I need to figure out what each reaction requires and then match them to the options.

Let me think about the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Reacting that with NaCN. I remember that ketones reacting with HCN or cyanide can form cyanohydrins. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, in the presence of an acid catalyst, ketones can undergo the cyanohydrin formation. The reaction of a ketone with HCN in the presence of an acid gives a cyanohydrin. So the reagent A must be an acid, probably H3O+, which is option A in some choices.

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that HCN is used with NaOH, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses a base? Wait no, the formation of cyanohydrin usually requires an acid catalyst. So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

But wait, another possibility: sometimes, the reaction can be done using HCN and a base, but in this case, the product is a cyanohydrin. So the first reagent A is an acid, so H3O+ is correct.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, but substituted with a benzyl group. The product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydroxyl group is oxidized.

Wait, but the starting material is a nitrile and a secondary alcohol. To get a carboxylic acid from a nitrile, you typically do a hydrolysis. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions.

Two common methods: acidic or basic hydrolysis. Acidic conditions usually involve H2SO4 and heat, but sometimes other acids are used. Alternatively, with H3O+ and heat, maybe.

But the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Wait, the structure is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's like:

CH2-C(OH)-C(C6H5CH2Ph)-CN

Wait, no, perhaps it's butanenitrile with substituents. Anyway, the product is a hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) becomes a COOH group, and the alcohol (OH) remains as is.

So, to convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, the typical conditions are either strong acidic or basic. Let's think: nitrile hydrolysis.

Under acidic conditions, H2SO4 and H2O with heat, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if using a base, it might form a carboxylate, which is then acidified.

Wait, the reagent B is H2O. So, it's a hydrolysis reaction. The starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So in the presence of H2O and reagent B, which is either HCl or CH3COOH.

So for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, we can use H3O+ (acidic conditions) or HCl (another acid).

Wait, but looking at the second reaction, the reagent B is given as H2O. So maybe it's a hydrolysis step where B is the acid catalyst.

So, the second reaction would be the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

If the nitrile is in a position that's hindered, maybe it's a slower reaction. But in any case, the presence of a strong acid (like HCl) would facilitate the hydrolysis. Alternatively, using a weaker acid (like acetic acid) might not be as effective.

Wait, but in the options, the choices for B are either HCl or CH3COOH. So which one is more likely?

In the first case, for the cyanohydrin formation, we used H3O+ (reagent A is H3O+). For the second reaction, perhaps HCl is used as the acid to facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must go all the way. Let me think about the typical reagents for that.

Nitrile to carboxylic acid: under acidic conditions, it requires H+ and heat. So, using H2SO4 and water, perhaps. Or maybe HCl as the acid.

Alternatively, in some cases, using a base like NaOH followed by acid workup is another method. But here, the reagent B is H2O, so the reaction is in the presence of water. Hmm.

Wait, the second reaction is written as: compound + B (H2O) → product. So the reagent B is the acid, perhaps. So if B is HCl (option A and C), then the reaction is in HCl and H2O. Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, then it's acetic acid and H2O.

Which one would be better for the hydrolysis of the nitrile? I think in acid conditions, typically H2SO4 is used, but HCl could also work. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses a strong acid.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Option D: A= NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH.

But I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

The product is a cyanohydrin. The formation of the cyanohydrin involves the addition of CN- to the carbonyl carbon, followed by protonation. The reaction typically uses an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or H3O+.

So for reagent A, it's H3O+ (so options A, B, or C?), because option D uses NaHSO3 for A.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so options A or B are possible for A). So the first reaction, A is H3O+.

So that leaves options A and B as possibilities.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is a nitrile with an alcohol group. The product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile has been hydrolyzed. So for the hydrolysis, which reagent is better?

In the presence of B (H2O), the reaction must have the right conditions to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Typically, nitriles are hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using strong acid (like conc. H2SO4) and heat. Alternatively, using HCl with water could be a condition.

Alternatively, another method is using NaOH (a base) followed by acid workup. But in this case, the reagent B is H2O, perhaps with an acid.

So if B is HCl, that would provide the acidic environment needed for the hydrolysis. So in the second reaction, B is HCl (so option A would have B=HCl, which would fit).

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent B is written as (H2O). Does that mean that the reaction is conducted in water, perhaps with the acid as the catalyst?

So for the second reaction, the conditions are H2O and HCl. So option A, where B is HCl, would make sense.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about another possibility. The first reaction uses H3O+ (A), and the second reaction uses HCl (B). So option A would have A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Alternatively, is there another possibility?

Wait, another approach: in the first reaction, perhaps A is HCN. But no, the question says + NaCN and A. So NaCN is already providing the CN-.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first reaction is an example of a Michael addition or some other reaction. But no, the product is a cyanohydrin, so it's a ketone plus HCN.

Wait, another possibility: could the first reaction be done in the presence of NaHSO3? I'm not sure. What is NaHSO3 used for? It's a source of HSO3^- ion. That is, it's a bisulfite. Maybe it's used as a reagent in some kind of addition reaction.

Wait, but in the formation of cyanohydrins, the typical reagent is HCN (with an acid catalyst), or maybe in the presence of a base? Wait, no, I think the acid is needed for the protonation steps. So it's more likely that H3O+ is the right reagent.

So in the first reaction, A is H3O+. Which leaves options A and B.

Now, the second reaction: the product is a carboxylic acid. So from nitrile to acid.

Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid typically requires strong acidic conditions, like H2SO4 with heat, or sometimes, using HCl in aqueous solution with heat.

So if B is HCl, then the reaction would proceed.

But wait, another possibility: could the second reaction be a hydrolysis using a weak acid, like acetic acid? Because sometimes, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under milder conditions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when you have the cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon. Maybe the second reaction is oxidizing the nitrile. Or perhaps it's hydrolyzing the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the product is a hydroxybutanoic acid, which is a carboxylic acid with an adjacent hydroxyl group.

So the reaction is converting the nitrile (CN) group to a COOH group. So it's a hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid.

Which conditions facilitate that?

Well, in the presence of HCl and water, under reflux, perhaps.

So, if reagent B is HCl, then that would be the right condition.

So looking back at the options:

Option A has B=HCl.

Option B has B=CH3COOH.

So which is more likely for the hydrolysis?

I think HCl is more likely to provide the acidic condition needed for the nitrile hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid.

So the reagents for the first reaction are H3O+ (A), and for the second, HCl (B). So the correct option would be option A.

Wait, but I need to check all the options. Option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction uses a milder acid, like acetic acid.

But wait, I'm trying to remember: the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is usually done under strong acidic conditions. So HCl would be more likely.

So in that case, the correct option is option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, facilitating the addition of CN⁻ to the carbonyl carbon. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the most suitable acid catalyst for this reaction, making reagent A = H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires acidic conditions. HCl is a strong acid that provides the necessary acidic environment for this transformation, making reagent B = HCl the most appropriate choice.

Given these considerations, the correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
