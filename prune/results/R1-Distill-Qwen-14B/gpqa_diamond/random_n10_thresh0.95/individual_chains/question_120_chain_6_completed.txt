Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance somehow. Wait, right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx is like 1 over distance, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact relation.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So if stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their spatial density is constant. But how does that translate to parallax? Let's think about it.

Parallax (in arcseconds) is given by the formula plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. But wait, the number of stars per unit parallax would depend on how the distance relates to the parallax.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant. So in a given volume, the number of stars is n times the volume. But how do I express the volume in terms of parallax?

Distance d is inversely proportional to plx, so d = 1/plx. So for a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distance range would be from d to d + dd, where dd = d(plx) * dplx. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential elements.

Let me consider the volume of a shell at a distance d with thickness dd. The volume would be 4π d² dd. But since dd is the change in d for a change in plx, let's express that in terms of plx.

So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Negative because as plx increases, d decreases. But when considering the range, we can take absolute values. So dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

Now, the volume element (dV) in terms of plx would be 4π (d)^2 dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (1/plx²) dplx:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Oh, d^2 is (1/plx)^2, and dd is (1/plx²) dplx. So dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. Hmm.

But wait, the number of stars per unit volume is n (constant). So the number of stars in the shell is n * dV. So that's n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx, which is like the number per dplx. So the expression is (n * 4π) / plx^4 times dplx. So the number per unit plx would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the options don't have 1/plx^4 as the first option. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) ~1/plx^4

B) ~1/plx^2

C) ~1/plx

D) ~1/plx^3

Wait, I have it as proportional to 1/plx^4. So that would be option A.

Wait, but I might have messed up the volume calculation. Let me think again. Another approach: since the number of stars is uniform in space, the number per volume is constant. So for a given distance range, how does that translate to parallax?

Alternatively, think about the volume per unit plx. Let's say you have a small change in plx, dplx. What's the corresponding volume in space that this change in plx represents?

At a given plx, the distance d = 1/plx. The volume for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. So in terms of plx:

dd = (d^2 / d^2) * dplx? Wait, no. Let me write:

We have plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dd = (1/plx^2) dplx.

So the volume is 4π (d)^2 * dd → 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in this volume is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx = 1) would be proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the question is about the number per unit parallax, not per unit distance. So given that, the reasoning seems correct. So the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases with 1/plx^4.

So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a uniform distribution of stars, the number density \( n \) is constant, meaning the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself.

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is \( dV = 4\pi d^2 dd \). Since \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we can express \( d \) and \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \):  
\[
d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}, \quad dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]  
Substituting these into the volume expression:  
\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]  
The number of stars in this volume is \( n \cdot dV \), so the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Answer: A
