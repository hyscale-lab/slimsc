Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, but with some spots on one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. The problem says that these spots can make the star's brightness variations look like those caused by an exoplanet. We need to find the radius of such an exoplanet relative to the star's radius to produce the same brightness variation.

Hmm. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula I think is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because area scales with the square of the radius.

But wait, the question is a bit tricky because it's about a star with spots. So the star's brightness variation isn't just from a planet blocking light, but from the spots rotating into and out of view. Let me think about how that works.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor means the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So 20% coverage on one hemisphere. And each spot is cooler by 1000 K; the star's Teff is 6000 K, so spots are at 5000 K.

Wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Since it's only one hemisphere that's spotty, as the star rotates, the spots will come into the line of sight, causing the observed brightness to dip when the spots are facing us. But since it's only one hemisphere, the spots will only be visible when that side is rotating towards us. So the brightness variation due to spots would cause a decrease in brightness as the spots rotate into view.

But the question is saying that this situation can resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So when the spots are blocking some of the star's light, it looks like a planet is blocking it. Wait, no—actually, when the spots are on the side facing us, their lower brightness makes the star appear slightly dimmer. So the observed brightness variation is due to the spots' lower emission compared to the rest of the star.

So when the star rotates, the hemisphere with the spots comes into view, causing a dip in brightness because those spots are darker. Without spots, the same dip would be caused by a planet blocking a part of the star. So the problem is asking, what planet radius would cause the same dip as the spots do.

Wait, but the observed brightness variation is different. Because the spots are cooler regions on the star, they contribute less flux when they're facing us. So the star's total flux when the spots are in view is less than when they're not. So the variation is a dip in brightness as the spots rotate into view.

So the amplitude of this dip would be the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when the spots are visible. But how much is that dip?

Let me model this. The star's total flux without any spots is F0. The spots have a lower temperature, so their flux per unit area is less. Let me think in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law: flux is proportional to T^4.

So the entire star emits F0 = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4. But when spots are present, part of the star's surface is cooler.

The filling factor is 20%, but only on one hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² (because a hemisphere is 2π R²). Wait, wait, the filling factor is 20% per hemisphere. So the spot area per hemisphere is 0.2 * 2π R²? No wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2π R². So a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, no. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface area covered. So for one hemisphere, which is 2π R², 20% would mean 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the area of the spots is 0.4 π R².

The star's total flux when spots are facing us is the normal flux minus the flux from the spots plus the flux from the cooler spots. Wait, no: the spots are cooler, so the total flux is F = F0 - (flux from spots at Teff) + (flux from spots at lower temp). Or more accurately, the star's total flux when spots are visible is the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area.

Wait, the star's total flux when
