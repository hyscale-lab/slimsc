Okay, so I have this question about detecting transits of two Earth-like planets, and the researchers want to choose the one with the highest probability of transiting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

So the setup is that both planets are detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. We know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1's period is like, say, 100 days, and P2's is 300 days, just for example. Their orbits are circular, which probably simplifies things.

The stars: Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But wait, both stars have the same radius. That's interesting because usually, more massive stars are bigger, but maybe Planet_2's host is a subgiant or something, hence slightly evolved but same size.

So the question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The formula I vaguely recall is something like P = (R_planet + R_star) / a, but wait, no, I think it's more about the relative sizes and the distance. Let me think.

Oh right, the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective) is given by the formula P = (R_star) / (a), but wait, no, that's not right. I think it's actually P = (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. Or perhaps it's (R_planet + R_star) divided by a, but no.

Wait, I think the probability of a transit is actually proportional to (R_star / a) divided by something else, maybe the impact parameter or something. Wait, no, the actual formula for the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 + (R_planet / R_star)^2 )^(1/2) or something like that. Hmm, maybe not. I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit in the plane of the sky. So, it's approximately the formula: P ≈ (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (m_star / m_planet)^(1/3))) )? Wait, no, that's not right. Maybe it's simpler.

Wait, I think the probability is given by (R_star / a) multiplied by (something involving the orbital inclination). No, inclination is a factor, but we're assuming random distribution of inclinations, so the probability depends on the geometry. The formula I remember is P = (R_star / a) * (1/(1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3))) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, some sources say the probability is (R_star + R_planet)/a, but that seems off because R_planet is much smaller than R_star.

Wait, another thought: the transit probability is approximately the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet from the star. So P ≈ (R_star / a). But then, why would other factors matter?

Wait, but that can't be right because for Earth, the probability would be R_sun / (1 AU) which is about 0.00465, so about 0.46% chance. But Earth's actual transit probability is higher because the orbit is edge-on. Oh wait, but in general, the probability depends on how likely the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. So it's more about the relative size of the star's disk as seen from Earth.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the probability is (2 R_star / a) / (something else), but I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, I've read before that the probability is given by P = (R_star / a) * (sqrt(1 - (b^2)) ), where b is the impact parameter, but that's when you know the impact parameter. But since we don't know the inclination, the probability is averaged over all possible inclinations.

Wait, I think the correct formula is P ≈ (R_star / a) * (something), but I'm not getting it. Alternatively, the transit probability is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3)) ), but I'm not confident about that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the parameters given. Both planets have same mass, but different orbital periods and different host star masses. The host stars have same radius but different masses.

So, to calculate the transit probability, which factors are important?

Transit probability (P) is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by something else. Wait, no. Let me think again. I remember that the transit depth is (R_planet / R_star)^2, but that's the depth, not the probability.

Wait, the probability of transit is higher for planets that are closer to their star, because the orbital plane is more likely to be aligned edge-on. Hmm, no, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, the probability is actually a function of the star's size and the planet's distance. Closer planets have a higher chance of transiting because the orbital plane is more likely to align with our line of sight. Or is it the opposite.

Wait, the formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a * [ (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ] when considering eccentricity, but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So P = (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a.

But wait, the distance a is in the same unit as R_star. So R_star is given in some unit, a is given in the same.

Wait, but the question says that the host stars have the same radii. So R1_star = R2_star. Let's denote R_star as R for both.

So for each planet, the probability P is approximately R / a.

So to find which planet has a higher P, we need to find which has a smaller a (since P is inversely proportional to a).

But a is the semi-major axis, which for circular orbits is the orbital radius. The RV method gives the minimum mass, but we can find the semi-major axis using Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law: (a^3) / (P^2) = (M_star + M_planet) / (M_sun) ) * (something). Wait, more accurately, the formula is a^3 / (P^2) = (M_star + M_planet) / (M_sun) ) * (1/(4π²)) ) * (G in appropriate units).

Wait, but for exoplanets, the formula is often approximated as a^3 (in AU) = (P (in years))² * (M_star (in solar masses) + M_planet (in solar masses)) )^(1/3) ?

Wait, no, the actual formula is a^3 = G (M_star + M_planet) P² / (4π²), but since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So a ≈ cube root( (G M_star P²)/(4π²) )

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the formula a³ ∝ (M_star) * P². So for a planet with period P and star mass M, a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

So, let's compute a1 for Planet_1 and a2 for Planet_2.

Given that Planet_1 has P1 = P/3 (since its period is three times shorter than Planet_2's), and M1 = 2*M2 (because Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's).

So, a1 ∝ (M1 * P1²) ^ (1/3) = (2 M2 * (P/3)^2 )^(1/3) = (2 M2 * P² / 9 )^(1/3) = ( (2/9) M2 P² )^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 ∝ (M2 * P^2 )^(1/3 )

So a1 / a2 = [ (2/9 M2 P² ) / (M2 P² ) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9 )^(1/3 )

What's 2/9? Approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. So for each, the transit probability is P ≈ R_star / a.

Since R_star is the same for both, the planet with smaller a has higher P.

So P1 = R / a1 ≈ R / (0.606 a2 )

P2 = R / a2

So P1 / P2 = (R/(0.606 a2 )) / ( R / a2 ) ) = 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65. So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait a second, because the RV method gives the minimum mass, but for the transit probability, does the mass of the planet affect the transit probability? Because the transit depends on the size of the planet and the star, not the mass. So perhaps the same mass doesn't influence the transit probability, since the radius is what matters. But the question states that both have the same mass, but does that imply they have same radius? Or perhaps not necessarily? Wait, the question says "Earth-like" planets, so I can assume they have similar densities and thus radii. So R_planet_1 ≈ R_planet_2.

So the transit probability for each is (R_star / a) multiplied by (R_planet / R_star), but no, earlier I thought P ≈ R_star / a, but perhaps it's more accurately (R_planet + R_star)/ a, but since R_planet is much smaller, it's approx R_star / a.

Wait, let me check. I think the exact formula for the transit probability is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since e=0 for both, it's just R_star/(a). So yeah, the probability is R_star / a.

So with a1 = 0.606 a2, P1 is R/(0.606 a2) = (1 / 0.606 ) * (R/a2 )

But P2 is R/a2. So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

Therefore, Planet_1 has a higher probability to transit, so the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says it's 2.7 times higher. Hmm, so where did I get 1.65 from? Because a1 is 0.606 a2, so P1 is (1/0.606) times P2, which is approximately 1.65 times.

So the correct option is C.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation. The RV method gives the minimum mass, but the actual mass could be higher. However, for the transit probability, the actual mass doesn't matter as much as the distance a, which depends on the period and the star's mass.

So, a1 is proportional to (M1 * P1²)^(1/3 )

M1 is 2 M2, P1 is P/3.

So a1 ∝ (2 M2 * (P^2 / 9 )) )^(1/3 ) = ( (2/9) M2 P^2 )^(1/3 )

a2 ∝ ( M2 P^2 )^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3 ) = cube root of (2/9) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is smaller than a2, so R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So P1 is higher. P1 = (R/a1) = (R)/(0.606 a2) ) ≈ 1.65 * (R/a2) = 1.65 P2.

So the probability is higher for Planet_1, so the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. So the correct answer is option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit stars with the same radius (\( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \)), the transit probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) corresponds to a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( a \propto \left( M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \right)^{1/3} \), where \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1, \( M_{\text{star,1}} = 2 \cdot M_{\text{star,2}} \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \). Substituting these values:

\[
a_1 \propto \left( 2 \cdot M_{\text{star,2}} \cdot \left( \frac{P_2}{3} \right)^2 \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \cdot M_{\text{star,2}} \cdot P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

For Planet_2:

\[
a_2 \propto \left( M_{\text{star,2}} \cdot P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Taking the ratio of \( a_1 \) to \( a_2 \):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{\frac{2}{9} \cdot M_{\text{star,2}} \cdot P_2^2}{M_{\text{star,2}} \cdot P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

The cube root of \( \frac{2}{9} \) is approximately \( 0.606 \), so \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \). This means Planet_1 has a smaller semi-major axis and is closer to its host star, resulting in a higher transit probability.

The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
