Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a diatomic molecule, made up of elements X and Y. It's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. 

The given data are:
- Mass of X (Mx) is 20 amu.
- Mass of Y (My) is 2 amu.
- Bond length (R) is 2 angstroms.
- Angular frequency of vibration (w) is 4e14 rad/s.

The options are four different momenta values. Hmm.

I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, the energy transitions are related to both rotational and vibrational changes. But wait, the question mentions the rotation-vibration model, so maybe it's considering transitions that involve both rotation and vibration?

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the vibrational ground state, n=0, but what about rotational? For a rigid rotor, the rotational energy levels are quantized, but in the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps the bond length changes with vibration, so it's more complex.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the lowest energy transition would be the smallest possible energy change. Since the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So, the next state would be the next higher energy, which could be a transition to J=1 in rotation or a vibrational transition to n=1. But wait, the question says 'next state with the lowest possible energy'—so perhaps it's a combination of the two, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the molecule is in its lowest vibrational state (n=0), and the next state could be either a vibrational transition (n=0 → n=1) or a rotational transition (J=0 → J=1). Which transition requires less energy?

I should calculate the energy difference for both and see which is smaller. The photon's energy should match the lower of the two.

So, first, let's compute the vibrational energy difference. The energy levels for vibration are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So, the fundamental state is n=0: E_0 = (0 + 1/2) h w. The next vibrational state would be n=1: E_1 = (1 + 1/2) h w. The difference ΔE_vib = E_1 - E_0 = h w.

What about rotational transitions? The rotational energy levels for a diatomic molecule are E_rot = (J (J +1) ) (h^2)/(8 π² I), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

So, for rotation, the transition would be from J=0 to J=1. The energy difference ΔE_rot = E_J=1 - E_J=0. E_J=0 is 0, and E_J=1 is (1*(1+1)) * (h²)/(8 π² I) = 2 (h²)/(8 π² I) = (h²)/(4 π² I).

So, ΔE_rot = (h²)/(4 π² I).

Wait, but I need to compare ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot to see which is smaller. Because a photon can cause either transition, but the problem is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest energy—so the photon should have the energy corresponding to the smaller ΔE.

Hmm, but wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps it's looking for the transition that only goes to the next state, maybe only a single quantum change—like either a vibrational or rotational change, whichever has lower energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule transitions from the ground vibrational state but the lowest rotational state to the next higher rotational state. Or maybe a vibrational transition with J changing? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule's energy levels are quantized in such a way that the next state is a combination of both—like a transition to the next overall level, which might involve a vibrational and a rotational change. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a transition that involves both vibrational and rotational changes. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the lowest possible energy transition, which would be the rotational one if it's smaller than the vibrational.

So, let's compute both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot.

First, calculate ΔE_vib. w is given as 4e14 rad/s. So, ΔE_vib = h * w. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 2.6504e-19 J.

Now, calculate ΔE_rot. First, compute I, the moment of inertia.

I = μ R². μ is the reduced mass. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). 

Given Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So, Mx + My = 22 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / 22 = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but we need to convert amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So, μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately:

1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988, but let's compute it more accurately.

1.818 * 1.6605 = ?

1.818 * 1.6 = 2.9088
1.818 * 0.0605 = about 0.1102
Total ≈ 2.9088 + 0.1102 = 3.019.

So μ ≈ 3.019e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.818 * 1.6605 = let's compute:

1 *1.6605 = 1.6605

0.8 *1.6605=1.3284

0.01 *1.6605=0.0166

0.008 *1.6605=0.013284

Adding them up: 1.6605 + 1.3284 = 2.9889; +0.0166=3.0055; +0.013284=3.0188.

So, μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

Now, R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0188e-27 * 4e-20 = 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Wait, no:

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m². So yes, 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now, compute ΔE_rot = (h²) / (4 π² I).

h is 6.626e
