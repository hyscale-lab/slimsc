Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I remember that in stars, the excitation of atoms relates to their temperature. Oh right, it's something to do with the Boltzmann distribution. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

Wait, I think the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The population of a particular energy state is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, which is e^(-ΔE/(k*T)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. 

So for two different stars, star_1 and star_2, the ratio of their populations (n_1 / n_2) would be e^(-ΔE/(k*T1)) / e^(-ΔE/(k*T2)). Because the ratio is given as n1/n2 = 2. 

Let me write that down: 2 = [e^(-ΔE/(k*T1))] / [e^(-ΔE/(k*T2))]. 

Simplifying that expression, since dividing exponents subtracts them. So 2 = e^{ ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] }.

Wait, wait, because when you have e^a / e^b = e^(a-b). So yeah, that's correct. 

So taking natural log on both sides: ln(2) = ΔE/(k) * [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)]. 

Hmm, that's the equation so far. Let me rearrange the terms. 

Let me factor the bracket: [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ). Because 1/T2 -1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). 

So ln(2) = (ΔE /k ) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). 

But wait, the question is asking for an equation involving T1 and T2, and the options don't include ΔE or k. Hmm, maybe we can find a relation without ΔE. Or perhaps the given ΔE is a red herring because the options don't involve it? Wait, the options are all in terms of T1 and T2. 

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The ratio of the populations is n1/n2 = 2. So n1 = 2 n2. 

According to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio is (g1/g2) * e^{-(E1 - E2)/(k T)}. But if the energy levels are the same except for the excitation, perhaps the g factors (statistical weights) are the same, so the ratio is just e^{-(ΔE)/(k T)}. Wait, but wait, if the energy difference is ΔE, then E1 = E2 + ΔE, right? So the exponent would be -(E1 - E2)/(k T) = -ΔE/(k T). 

So for star 1 and 2, the ratio is n1/(n2) = [e^{-ΔE/(k T1)}] / [e^{-ΔE/(k T2)}] ] = e^{ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)} } = e^{ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) }.

So putting it all together: n1/n2 = e^{ ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) }.

Given that n1/n2 = 2, so ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Wait, but in the options, the equation doesn't have ΔE or k. Hmm. But the question says that the energy difference is given, but perhaps we can relate it to the temperatures without knowing the actual value. 

Alternatively, maybe I should express the equation differently. Let me write it as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1).

But perhaps I can factor this as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

So that gives ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Hmm. Now, looking at the options, which one matches this structure?

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that would be the case if (ΔE /k) is 1. But wait, that's not necessarily true. Because unless ΔE/(k) equals 1, which I don't think is given.

Wait, unless the given ΔE is such that ΔE/k = 1. Let's calculate. What's k? Boltzmann's constant is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. 

Oh! So ΔE = k * (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) → No, wait, k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So if ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, then ΔE = k * 1 K, since 1.38e-23 J = (1.38e-23 J/K) * 1 K.

So ΔE/k = 1 K. That makes (ΔE/k) = 1. So our equation becomes:

ln(2) = (1) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Which simplifies to ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Looking at the options, this is exactly option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2).

So the correct equation is option D.


To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population ratio of atoms in different energy states to the temperature of the system. The ratio of the populations of iron atoms in the excited and ground states for star_1 and star_2 is given as \( n_1 / n_2 = 2 \). According to the Boltzmann distribution, this ratio is proportional to:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{e^{-\Delta E / (k T_1)}}{e^{-\Delta E / (k T_2)}} = e^{\Delta E / k (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right).
\]

Rearranging the terms inside the parentheses:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \right).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and Boltzmann's constant \(k\) is also \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}\). Substituting this into the equation simplifies it to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options do not align with the derived equation.

Answer: D
