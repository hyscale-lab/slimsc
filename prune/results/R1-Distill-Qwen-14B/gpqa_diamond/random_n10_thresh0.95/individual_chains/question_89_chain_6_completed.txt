--- Full Content ---
Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

So the question involves several organic chemistry reactions, and I need to figure out the coupling pattern of a hydrogen in the final product. Let's break down each step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably has bromines at two opposite positions on the adamantane framework. 

Step 1: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. Since it's dibromide, I think an elimination reaction might happen. Wait, but with two bromines, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but with two good leaving groups (bromines), perhaps it's a double elimination. Hmm, but for elimination, usually you need adjacent leaving groups. Wait, 1,3 positions – are those adjacent? Let me think. Adamantane is a cage structure, so 1 and 3 might be on adjacent carbons? Or maybe not. Alternatively, KOH could cause a ring-opening or some kind of cleavage. Wait, no, more likely, when you have a dibromide and treat with a base, you might get a di-elimination, leading to a diene or a more substituted structure.

Wait, but another possibility is that each Br is eliminated, forming two alkenes. But with two Brs on the same carbon, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on different carbons. So, maybe each Br leaves, and each adjacent carbon forms a double bond. Wait, but if the structure is such that each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, elimination might not be straightforward because bridgehead alkenes are usually not allowed due to Bredt's rule. Oh, wait, Bredt's rule says that bridgehead alkenes are not stable, so elimination to form a bridgehead double bond is not favorable. Hmm, but adamantane is a highly strained structure. Wait, maybe the elimination leads to a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, but since there are two bromines, maybe each elimination occurs on adjacent carbons. If two adjacent carbons each lose a Br, then a double bond would form between them. But if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps that's two Brs on adjacent carbons? I'm not entirely sure about the structure. Maybe I should visualize it: Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions would be on adjacent carbons in the structure, so elimination would produce a double bond between C1 and C3, but that's a bridgehead, which is not allowed. So perhaps that's not the way.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the KOH causes a ring-opening via an elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbene or some other intermediate. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's an E2 elimination, but for each Br to leave, you need a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon. If each Br is on a different carbon, adjacent to another Br? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is similar to the dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides. Vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromoethane) when treated with a base like KOH eliminate to form an alkene. But in this case, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so maybe the two Brs are on carbons that are two apart. So elimination would form a double bond, but again, bridgehead positions are a problem. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, leading to a diol or something else. But no, KOH is a base, not a nucleophile. Wait, but in the presence of heat, perhaps it's a substitution? Unlikely, because KOH is more about elimination in such cases.

Wait, let me think about the product. The product is a light yellow solid. The NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). And IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester). So product 1 probably has a ketone group.

So the initial reaction is likely an elimination followed by some kind of oxidation. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm, maybe the elimination forms a diene, which is then oxidized. But I don't think KOH does oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a Hofmann elimination, but that typically involves quaternary ammonium salts. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism or something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, another angle: the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is likely a carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. So perhaps the reaction forms a ketone.

So if we start with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and heat with KOH, maybe each Br leaves, and the adjacent hydrogens are abstracted, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, that doesn't make sense because elimination would form a double bond. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a double elimination leading to a diketone? Or perhaps a single elimination forms a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation, forming conjugated double bonds. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Maybe after elimination, some rearrangement happens.

Wait, another thought: maybe two E2 eliminations occur. Each Br is on a carbon, and when the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, the Br leaves, forming a double bond. So for each Br, you get a double bond. So product 1 would be a diene. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe the product isn't a diene but a diketone. How would that happen? If the two Brs are in positions that when eliminated, form ketones. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination forming a conjugated diene, but with some ring strain, causing it to rearrange into a carbonyl group. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone. Let me think: suppose the 1 and 3 positions on adamantane are each substituted with Br. When KOH is added, each Br is eliminated as Br-, and the carbons form double bonds. But if the structure allows, perhaps the double bonds form in such a way that a carbonyl is formed. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a bridgehead double bond, which is unfavorable, leading to a rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: the elimination leads to the formation of a ketone via a diradical intermediate or some other mechanism. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a cyclopropane ring or another strained ring, which then opens to form a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structure of product 1. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Like an ether or an ester, but considering the IR, it's more likely a ketone. So perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a CH2 connected to an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is an OCH2 group. Wait, but in the IR, 1720 cm−1 is a strong carbonyl, so maybe a ketone or ester.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diepoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Hmm.

Alternatively, wait, let me think about the possible product. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes a double elimination to form a diene, but considering the IR, maybe that diene is further oxidized. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Wait, but maybe the product is a diol? No, because the IR doesn't show an OH stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's a diketone.

Wait, another approach: product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Or perhaps it's involved in some kind of elimination or dehydration. But in this case, product 1 already has a carbonyl group, so maybe product 2 is a more substituted carbonyl.

Wait, but then ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes. So product 2 must have a double bond. So product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is a ketone with an adjacent double bond, and product 3 is the result of cleaving that double bond.

So, putting it together:

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (a ketone)

Step 2: product 1 + Al(isopropoxide) → product 2 (a dienone or something with a conjugated double bond)

Step 3: ozonolysis of product 2 → product 3 (which would break the double bond into carbonyl groups)

So let's reevaluate step 1. If product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone via elimination.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: maybe each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridge. When KOH is added, perhaps each Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons form double bonds. Wait, but that would lead to a diene. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a cyclopropane ring opening, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a cyclopropane ring, but that might not fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the heating with KOH leads to a pinacol-type elimination. The pinacol rearrangement involves a diol losing water to form a carbonyl. But in this case, we have a dihalide. Wait, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of Br and forming a carbonyl group. So each Br would lead to a carbonyl, but that would require two eliminations, producing a diketone.

So if product 1 is a diketone, then the structure would have two ketone groups. The NMR would reflect that. But looking at the NMR data for product 1, the peak at 4.79 ppm is 2H, which might be a CH2 group, possibly next to an oxygen. Another peak at 1.94 ppm for 2H, maybe another CH2 group. The middle region is 10H, which could be several CH2 groups.

Wait, but a diketone would have two carbonyl groups, but the IR only shows one strong peak. Unless they are conjugated. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a single ketone. Let's imagine that the 1 and 3 positions are each on a carbon that, upon elimination of Br, forms a carbonyl.

Wait, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridge, perhaps elimination would form a ketone. Let me think about 1,3-dibromoadamantane structure: each bridgehead carbon (1 and 3) has a Br. When the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to the Br, the Br leaves, and the double bond forms, but since bridgehead alkenes are not possible, maybe the structure rearranges into a ketone.

So the elimination would form a ketone at each position? Or perhaps a single ketone with the other carbon being something else.

Wait, perhaps the elimination forms a bridgehead double bond, which is unstable, so it rearranges into a more stable structure, possibly a ketone. For instance, the double bond could shift to form a conjugated diene or a ketone.

Alternatively, think about the product's NMR. 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. But in the presence of a carbonyl, perhaps it's a carbonyl adjacent group.

Wait, considering the IR, which shows a peak at 1720 cm−1, a strong carbonyl. So product 1 has a ketone group. Let's imagine that the starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of HBr twice, forms a ketone. So each Br is on a carbon that, upon elimination, becomes a carbonyl.

Wait, but each elimination would require a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon. So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a different carbon. When KOH is heated, each Br could be eliminated with a β-hydrogen, forming a double bond. But if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, that would form a double bond. But again, bridgehead double bonds are not allowed, so perhaps the structure rearranges.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a single ketone, formed via elimination of two HBr molecules. So, perhaps the structure becomes a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic structure with a ketone. Let me try to think about it: 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Brs on opposite positions. When both are eliminated, maybe the structure becomes a more open cage with a ketone group.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a tricyclic compound with a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclo structure with a carbonyl group.

But maybe I should move to the next step, because the structure of product 1 is unclear, but the next step involves aluminum isopropoxide. Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess Al(isopropoxide). Since Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, it's often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 has a carbonyl, so perhaps product 2 is a result of some kind of acylation.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone, so maybe product 2 is an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and product 2 is a more substituted compound.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR data. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the second step forms product 2, which is then subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So, after the second step, product 2 has a double bond. How does that happen? Product 1 is a ketone (from step 1). So perhaps the second step is a dehydration, forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, then the second step would involve a dehydration. Aluminum isopropoxide could act as a dehydrating agent. So perhaps product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR data. Hmm. Alternatively, product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enone (conjugated enone), formed via elimination.

Wait, but how? If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is formed by elimination of a small molecule, like H2O or HBr, to form a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but product 1 is made from heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH, which would eliminate HBr. So perhaps product 1 is a diene or a ketone. If product 1 is a diene, then product 2 would be something else, but that doesn't directly lead to ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps the second step is a cyclization. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but again, the IR doesn't show an OH peak.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is an enone (conjugated dienone). So when product 1 is treated with a dehydrating agent, two beta-hydrogens are removed, forming a double bond next to the ketone.

So product 2 would have a conjugated double bond, like an enone.

Then, when product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis, the double bond breaks, and ozonide forms. Then, upon workup with dimethyl sulfide, which is a reductive workup, the ozonide breaks into carbonyl groups.

So the ozonolysis of an enone would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls. But wait, ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups, so the product 3 would have two new carbonyls.

Now, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded H would likely be near an electron-withdrawing group, such as a carbonyl.

So let's imagine that product 3 has two carbonyl groups, perhaps in a symmetric structure.

But to get the coupling pattern, we need to know the neighboring hydrogens.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. If product 2 is an enone (like cyclohexenone), ozonolysis would cleave it into two ketones. For example, cyclohexenone would become two diketones? Or maybe it's a dienone.

Wait, perhaps the enone is part of a larger ring, so ozonolysis would break it into two smaller rings or chains.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a bicyclic enone, ozonolysis would cleave the bridge, leading to a chain with two carbonyls.

But I'm not entirely sure, so perhaps I need to work backward.

In the third step, ozonolysis of product 2 gives product 3. Product 3's NMR is the focus.

The most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl. So in product 3, these Hs would be next to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring Hs.

If the H is adjacent to a carbonyl and has two neighboring Hs on either side, the coupling would be a triplet. Wait, but let's think more carefully.

Suppose the structure is something like (CH2)nCO. Wait, but in the context of ozonolysis, after cleavage, we have two carbonyls. So perhaps the structure is a chain with two carbonyl groups.

Wait, for example, if product 2 is a cyclohexene ring with a ketone, ozonolysis would break the ring into two carbonyl groups. Alternatively, if product 2 is a bicyclic enone, ozonolysis would break a bridge, leading to a chain.

Assuming product 3 is a chain with two carbonyl groups, say, O=C-(CH2)n-C=O. Then, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would each have two Hs. The Hs on CH2 groups adjacent to carbonyls would be deshielded and appear downfield.

But for the coupling pattern, let's say each CH2 group next to the carbonyl has two Hs on each carbon. So each H on a CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2's Hs.

Wait, for a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each H is split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet (n+1 where n=2).

Alternatively, if the structure is such that each CH2 is next to another CH2, then each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

But wait, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group is between two carbonyls. Each CH2 would have two Hs. The Hs on the first CH2 would be next to the second CH2's two Hs. So each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

But in reality, the coupling could be more complex if there are more neighboring Hs.

Wait, another scenario: if the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and it has two neighboring Hs on each adjacent carbon. For example, in a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R', each CH2 would have two Hs. The Hs on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH group next to a carbonyl, and it has two neighboring Hs, then it would be a triplet. But in the product 3 NMR, the most deshielded H is likely on a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

Wait, but looking back at the question, the product 3's NMR is to be examined. The most deshielded H, excluding those that exchange, would be next to a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each H in this CH2 would split into a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but in a structure where the CH2 is between two carbonyls, like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. So each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the next CH2, leading to a triplet.

But wait, what if the structure is more complex, such as a ring or a more substituted group.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH group that's adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, O=C-CH(CH2X)-CH2-C=O. Then, each H on the CH would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet.

Wait, but if the H is on a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to another CH2, then each H would couple with two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets? Or a more complex splitting.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible structures. If product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is between two carbonyls, each CH2 would have two Hs. Each H in the CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H would see two Hs on each adjacent carbon, but since each adjacent carbon has two Hs, that would be two neighboring Hs. So each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but if the H is in a CH2 that's between two other CH2 groups, like CH2-CH2-CH2, each H would have two neighboring Hs on each adjacent CH2 group. So for each H, there are two neighboring Hs on each side, but wait, that's four Hs? No, wait, each H is on a CH2, and each adjacent CH2 has two Hs, so each H would couple with two Hs (from the adjacent CH2) and another two Hs from the other adjacent CH2. Or wait, no, because each H is only next to two Hs on the next carbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure as O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each CH2 group is between the two carbonyls. Each H on the first CH2 is next to two Hs on the second CH2. So each H on the first CH2 would split into a triplet (n=2, so n+1=3). Similarly, the second CH2's Hs would also be triplets.

So, in the NMR, the most deshielded Hs (on the CH2 groups next to carbonyls) would appear as triplets.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is triplet, option B is triplet of triplets, etc.

But the question is, what's the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more complex. Suppose product 2 is a bicyclic enone, and upon ozonolysis, it breaks into a chain with branching, leading to a more complex coupling pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the H is on a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, R-CO-CH(CH2X). Then, the H on the CH would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group, which is itself adjacent to another CH2. This could lead to more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 which is adjacent to a CH group. Then, the H would couple with two Hs on one side and one H on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group that's adjacent to two other CH2 groups. Wait, that might not make sense, but let's imagine O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each CH2 in the middle would have two neighboring CH2 groups. Each H on the middle CH2 would see two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So for each H, that's four neighboring Hs, leading to a quintet (n=4, so n+1=5). But that's option D (pentet).

But the question asks for the most deshielded H, which is likely adjacent to a carbonyl. So if the H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but if the structure is such that the H is on a CH2 group that's next to a carbonyl and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2, then each H would see two Hs on each side. For example:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O

The middle CH2's Hs would each couple with two Hs on either side, leading to (n = 2 on each side → total of 4 neighbors), so each H would be a quintet. But wait, no, each H on the middle CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the left and two on the right. So each H would be split by 2 + 2 = 4 Hs, leading to a quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks).

But that would make the coupling pattern a quintet, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the middle CH2's Hs are split by the two Hs from each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets. Wait, no, because each splitting is from two Hs, so each would split into a triplet, and then each of those triplets would split again into triplets, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think differently.

In product 3, the most deshielded H is likely on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say that CH2 is between two carbonyls, like O=C-CH2-C=O. Then, each H on the CH2 would only have two neighboring Hs (from the same CH2), but wait, that's not possible because each H on CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same carbon and possibly others.

Wait, no, if it's O=C-CH2-C=O, that's a three-carbon chain. The CH2 is between two carbonyls. Each H on the CH2 would be next to two Hs on the same carbon, but since they're on the same carbon, they don't split each other. So each H would only couple with Hs on adjacent carbons. But in this case, the CH2 is between two carbonyls, so the adjacent carbons are the carbonyls (which don't have Hs). So in this structure, the CH2 would only have two Hs, and no adjacent Hs on either side (because the carbonyls don't have Hs). So the Hs on the CH2 would be singlets, which doesn't match any of the options except perhaps option B, but that's not a singlet.

Wait, but that can't be right because the CH2 is between two carbonyls, so each H on the CH2 wouldn't have any adjacent Hs to split. So they would be singlets. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, maybe I'm not considering the right structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone with a chain, like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, each CH2 group's Hs would have two neighboring Hs from the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

So in the NMR, each CH2's Hs would be a triplet. So the most deshielded H (on the CH2 next to the carbonyl) would be a triplet.

But wait, the question says 'the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)'. So it's the H that's most downfield, which is next to the carbonyl.

So, in that case, that H would be on the CH2 next to the carbonyl. Each of these Hs would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

But wait, what if the H is on a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group? For example, O=C-CH(CH2X)-C=O. Then, each H on the CH would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if the CH has two Hs, then each would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-C=O, then the CH has two Hs, which would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But this depends on the exact structure, which I'm not entirely certain of.

Wait, another angle: in ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and the result is the formation of carbonyl groups. If product 2 is an enone (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone), then ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. For example, cyclohexenone would become two diketones, but that's not a realistic structure. Alternatively, it would break into two carbonyl groups, perhaps forming a chain.

Assuming product 2 is a conjugated dienone, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups, creating a chain structure.

In that case, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be on CH2 groups, each having two Hs. Each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, product 3's NMR would show the Hs on those CH2 groups as triplets.

Therefore, the most deshielded Hs would be triplets, so the answer would be A.


The problem involves a multi-step organic reaction sequence, and the goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in the final product (product 3). Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   - The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, undergoes elimination upon heating with KOH.  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the formation of a carbonyl group (likely a ketone).  
   - The NMR data for product 1 (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure with a ketone group and CH₂ groups.

2. **Step 2: Reaction of product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates a dehydration reaction, forming an α,β-unsaturated ketone (enone).  
   - Product 2 now contains a conjugated double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming two carbonyl groups.  
   - The resulting product (product 3) is a diketone, with CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls.

4. **Analysis of the NMR spectrum of product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen atoms in product 3 are on the CH₂ groups directly adjacent to the carbonyl groups.  
   - Each hydrogen on these CH₂ groups couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
