Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I think I need to figure out what's happening at each stage. Let me break it down.

Step 1: Diluting acetic acid. The initial concentration is 0.05 M, and we add an equal volume of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Oh wait, when you dilute a solution by doubling the volume, the concentration halves. So the new concentration after dilution would be 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M acetic acid. Right, because M1V1 = M2V2, and since V1 and V2 are same, M2 is half.

So diluted solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, but first, let's figure out the moles involved before titration. The initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. Moles = conc. × volume(L). Volume is 0.04 L. So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

Now, during titration, let's think about 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001. At 25% titration, 0.25 of that, which is 0.00025 moles, have reacted. So the remaining acetic acid is 0.00075 moles, and the amount of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed is 0.00025 moles.

So the solution is a buffer solution. Because some of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base. To find the pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

First, let's calculate pKa. The given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → which is approximately 4.73, because log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733. So pKa ≈ 4.73.

Now, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3 ≈ 0.333. So log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253. Hmm, that's close to 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the concentrations of A^- and HA are in moles, but since they're in the same volume (because we added NaOH which is a solution, but at 25% titration, the volume added isn't too big compared to the original solution?), or wait, does the volume matter here? Because when using Henderson-Hasselbalch with concentrations, it's the ratio that matters, so moles would be proportional to concentrations if the volume is same. So maybe it's okay.

So the pH at 25% is about 4.26. Now, let's look at the options. Options A and D have pH values close to this. Let's check the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, so we have sodium acetate. Sodium acetate dissociates completely in solution, so the solution is a solution of acetate ions. Since it's a weak base (acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid), the solution will be basic, so pH >7.

Wait, but how do I calculate it? The solution will consist of CH3COO^- in water. The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The concentration of acetate can be found by considering the moles. At equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid are converted to acetate. The total volume at equivalence point is initial volume + NaOH volume. Let's compute that.

Wait, initial volume is 40 cm³. The moles of NaOH required at equivalence is 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the total volume is 40 +10 = 50 cm³.

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. Since Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb expression is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is the [OH^-], then:

x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Since Kb is so small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH around 9 at equivalence. Let's check the options again.

Options:
A) 4.26; 8.52 → Equiv pH is 8.52, which is acidic. That can't be right. Acetate is basic, so pH should be >7.

B) 3.17; 6.73 → equiv pH 6.73, which is acidic. Not possible.

C)4.73;7.00 → 7 is neutral. Not likely, but maybe if I made a mistake.

D)4.57;6.92 →equiv pH 6.92, still acidic.

Wait, did I make a mistake? Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me re-calculate the equivalence point.

At equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate in water. So the concentration is 0.02 M acetate.

Wait, let me compute the Kb again. Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. Right.

The hydrolysis equation: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is [OH^-], then [CH3COOH] = x, and [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kb ≈ x^2 / (0.02) =5.405e-10 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 14 -4.98 = 9.02.

But the options don't have pH around 9. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the volume. Let me check that again.

At equivalence, the volume is 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. The NaOH needed is 0.001 moles, at 0.1 M, so volume is 10 cm³. So total volume is 50 cm³. So moles of acetate are 0.001, concentration is 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, but none of the options have pH near 9. So maybe I'm wrong in the approach. Wait, perhaps the solution isn't just sodium acetate. Wait, no, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized, so it's sodium acetate and water.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a salt of a weak acid and strong base. The formula is pH = pKa + (1/2) pKb? No, that's not right. Wait, the pH for a solution of a weak base (like acetate) can be calculated using the same approach as before.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the Kb expression.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of x. Let me compute it again.

x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) → sqrt(1.081) is approx 1.04, so 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH ~4.98 → pH ~9.02.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dilution part.

Wait, initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 cm³ water, making 40 cm³. So the concentration is 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, but what about the volume when calculating the equivalence point? Let me think again. The initial acetic acid is 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. NaOH is 0.1 M, so to neutralize 0.001 moles, you need 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³. So acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05=0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the options are wrong, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question asks for the pH at 25% titration, but not considering the dilution. Wait, no. The problem says we dilute first, then titrate. So the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. So when we titrate, the volume of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence point volume. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the equivalence point volume.

Wait, equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. That requires 10 cm³ of NaOH, as before. So 25% of that would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but earlier I thought 25% titration refers to 25% of the acetic acid being neutralized. Which is the same as 25% of the equivalence point volume. So both approaches are the same. So perhaps that's okay.

Wait, but let me confirm: moles of NaOH added at 25% is 25% of 0.001 moles → 0.00025 moles. So that's correct.

So, the pH at 25% is about 4.26. So option A and D have 4.26 or 4.57 as pH at 25% titration.

Now, option D says at equivalence, pH is 6.92. That's less than 7, which is not possible for a sodium acetate solution. Because sodium acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so solution should be basic, pH >7.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, another approach. Maybe I should use the formula for a solution of sodium acetate.

The formula for pH of a salt of a weak acid and strong base is:

pH = (pKa + pKw - pKa')/2 ?

Wait, no. Alternatively, the pH can be calculated using:

pH = (pKa + pKw - pKa')/2 ?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is pH = ½ (pKa + pKw). Because for a solution of CH3COO^- in water, it's a base, so pH = (pKw + pKa') / 2. Wait, pKa' is the same as pKa of acetic acid, right?

Wait, wait. The pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base (like sodium acetate) can be calculated using the formula: pH = ½ (pKa + pKw). Because for a weak base (like acetate), the pH can be found using the same approach as a weak acid but adjusted for the Kb.

Wait, let's think: the hydrolysis of acetate is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈5.405e-10.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].

Assuming [CH3COOH] = [OH^-] = x, and [CH3COO^-] ≈0.02 - x ≈0.02.

So Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02 =5.405e-10 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5. So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH≈4.98 → pH≈9.02.

So why are none of the options close to 9? The options for equivalence are all below 7. That's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial concentration after dilution. Wait, let's recheck.

Original acetic acid: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that when I add the NaOH, the volume changes. But in the 25% titration, the volume change is only 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added to 40 cm³. So total volume is 42.5 cm³. Does that affect the concentrations in the Henderson equation?

Wait, but in the Henderson equation, since both [A^-] and [HA] are in the same solution, the volume would cancel out because they are in the same ratio. So the ratio (moles) is same as the ratio (concentrations).

But wait, in the 25% case, the moles are 0.00025 and 0.00075. The total volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Then the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. So same as before. So the pH at 25% is still 4.26.

Hmm, but the options don't have an equivalence pH around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the formula for a solution of sodium acetate, considering the dilution.

Wait, when you prepare sodium acetate solution, the concentration is 0.02 M, as before.

The pH can be found using the formula for a weak base:

pH = pKa + log([HA]/[A^-]) → no, that's for a buffer. Wait, for a solution of A^-, the pH can be found using:

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C), where C is concentration.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) → ~1.04e-5.

So pOH is 4.98, pH is 9.02. So I think that's correct.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the question is asking for something else.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D's equivalence pH is 6.92, which is acidic, which can't be. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculations.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider that after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M, but when titrating, the solution is not just the acetic acid but with NaOH added.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the moles in the 25% titration.

Wait, moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles reacted, so 0.00075 moles left, and 0.00025 moles of acetate.

So the ratio is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So pH = pKa + log(1/3) → 4.73 + (-0.477) =4.253 → ~4.26. So that's correct.

So the first part is 4.26, which is option A or D.

Now, equivalence point is 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another thought: when you dilute acetic acid with water, doesn't the pH increase? Because dilution usually weakens the acid, making it less strong, so pH increases. So initial acetic acid is 0.05 M, pH would be less than 4.73. After diluting to 0.025 M, pH would be higher, but still less than 4.73.

Wait, wait. Wait no. Let me think. The pH of a weak acid solution depends on the concentration. Higher concentration leads to lower pH. So when we dilute the solution, the pH increases.

Wait, wait, but in this case, the initial pH is more acidic than the diluted pH. Let's calculate the initial pH before titration.

Wait, but the question is about the titration, not the initial pH.

Wait, perhaps the key is that when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the pH at 25% is when 25% of the acid has been neutralized, but considering the dilution.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the equivalence point pH using another method.

Wait, perhaps using the exact expression without approximation.

So for the equivalence point, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M.

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].

But wait, it's more accurate to write it as:

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Since Kb is small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 =5.405e-10 *0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

Same as before. So the pH is 9.02.

Hmm, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the problem isn't asking for the equivalence point correctly. Let me re-read the question.

Question says: What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point?

So perhaps the options are correct, and I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the Kb. Let me compute it again.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5)= approximately 5.405e-10.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence is not just sodium acetate. Maybe I forgot that the solution is in a total volume that includes both the initial solution and the added NaOH.

Wait, moles of NaOH added at equivalence: 0.001 mol. Volume of NaOH is 10 cm³. Original solution is 40 cm³. So total volume is 50 cm³.

So acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the solution is not sodium acetate, but something else. No, it should be sodium acetate.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you dilute it, you have to recalculate the concentration.

Wait, but the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Let's calculate its pH without any titration.

pH = ½ (pKa - log C) → pKa is 4.73, C is 0.025.

So pH = ½ (4.73 - log(0.025)).

Log(0.025) = log(2.5e-2) = log(2.5) + log(1e-2) → ~0.39794 -2 = -1.602.

So pH = ½ (4.73 - (-1.602)) = ½ (6.332) = 3.166 → ~3.17. So the initial pH before titration is ~3.17.

But the question is about after titrating 25% and at equivalence.

Wait, perhaps the question is wrong, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the concentration of acetate at equivalence is not 0.02 M, because I added 10 cm³ of NaOH (0.1 M) to 40 cm³ of solution. So total volume is 50 cm³.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol.

Concentration: 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Wait, that's correct. So I'm back to the same calculation.

Hmm. Maybe the options are incorrect? Or perhaps I missed something in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is at 25% titration, not 25% of the equivalence point. Wait, no, 25% titration refers to 25% of the way to equivalence.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution after adding 25% of the NaOH has a different volume. Let me re-calculate the pH at 25% titration, including the volume change.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added: 0.00025.

Volume of NaOH used: moles / conc = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

So total volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³ =0.0425 L.

Moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.00075.

Moles of acetate:0.00025.

So [HA]=0.00075/0.0425 ≈0.017647 M.

[A^-]=0.00025/0.0425 ≈0.005882 M.

Ratio [A^-]/[HA] = 0.005882 /0.017647 ≈0.3333.

So pH = pKa + log(0.333) →4.73 + (-0.477)=4.253 → ~4.26.

So same as before.

So at 25% titration, pH is ~4.26, which matches option A and D.

Now, at equivalence, pH is ~9.02, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the half-equivalence point pH, which is the same as pKa. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation because I forgot that the total volume is larger, so the concentration of acetate is lower than I thought.

Wait, no. Wait, the concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol /0.05 L=0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the problem is that I should calculate the pH using the exact method without approximation.

Let me try that. So for the acetate solution:

At equivalence, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M.

The hydrolysis equation: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

Let me set up the ICE table.

Initial: [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M, [CH3COOH]=0, [OH^-]=0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: [CH3COO^-]=0.02 -x, [CH3COOH]=x, [OH^-]=x.

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, which seems valid since Kb is small.

So x^2 ≈5.405e-10 *0.02 →1.081e-11 →x=1.04e-5 → [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

So I can't find any mistake here. Thus, the equivalence pH should be ~9.02, which isn't among the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D has 6.92 at equivalence. That's close to 7, which is neutral. So perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.73.

Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 → let's compute that.

1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → approx 0.5405e-9 →5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial solution after dilution is not 0.025 M. Let me recheck that.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid → moles=0.05 *0.02=0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ water, total volume=40 cm³ → concentration=0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point calculation is wrong because the solution's volume is 50 cm³, but I think that's correct.

So I'm stuck. The calculated pH at equivalence is around 9, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the degree of dissociation for the equivalence point, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the solution is not sodium acetate, but another salt. No, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is about a weak base instead of a weak acid, but no, acetic acid is a weak acid.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the initial step.

Wait, after dilution, the solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. When titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point volume is 10 cm³, as before.

So the solution at equivalence is sodium acetate in 50 cm³, 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps the student is supposed to ignore activity coefficients and just proceed with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but that wouldn't help here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to calculate the pH at 25% titration before the equivalence point and at equivalence, but the options don't have 9. So perhaps the correct option is A) 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, why would the equivalence pH be 8.52? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point pH. Let me try an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the solution is that the pH at equivalence is calculated using the same approach as for a weak base, but perhaps the assumption that x is small is incorrect.

Wait, let me solve it without approximation.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Let me write it as x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

Assume x is not negligible compared to 0.02.

So x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a), where a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1.081e-11) → (2.92e-19) +4.32e-11 ≈4.32e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.32e-11)= ~6.57e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.57e-6 ] /2 → (6.57e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ ~3.285e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.285e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514.

Oh! So pH is approximately 8.51, which is close to 8.52. So option A says 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, that makes sense. So why did the earlier approximation give a different result?

Because when x is around 1e-5, and 0.02 -x is 0.0199, which is about 4.98% decrease. So perhaps the assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 is not valid here, so the quadratic solution is needed.

Wait, let me compute x² =5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x).

If I approximate 0.02 -x ≈0.02, then x ≈sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

But the actual x is 3.285e-6, which is smaller than the approximation. Wait, wait, no: 3.285e-6 is 3.285e-6, which is 0.3285e-5, which is less than 1e-5. Wait, but in the quadratic solution, x is around 3.285e-6, which is 3.285 x1e-6.

Wait, no, 3.285e-6 is 3.285 x1e-6, not x1e-5. So the approximation was overestimating x.

Wait, so if I redo the approximation with x=3.285e-6, then 0.02 -x ≈0.0199967, which is very close to 0.02, so the approximation holds. But why is the x value so much lower?

Wait, because when I did the quadratic, I got x=3.285e-6. So the [OH^-] is 3.285e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514. So that's around 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

Ah! So perhaps I made a mistake earlier by not considering that the approximation isn't valid, but in reality, the assumption holds because x is much smaller than 0.02. Wait, but the x obtained from the quadratic is 3.285e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2e-2 or 2e-2=2e-2 = 200e-3, while x is 0.003285e-3). So the approximation should hold, and the correct x should be 1.04e-5, leading to pH=9.02.

But when I did the quadratic, I got x=3.285e-6, which is much smaller. So I must have made a mistake in the quadratic calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the quadratic.

The equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a = 1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.92e-19.

4*1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

So D=2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 = approximately 4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible).

So sqrt(D)≈sqrt(4.324e-11) = 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 ≈ (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.

So x=3.288e-6. So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.485 → pH=8.515.

So the correct pH at equivalence is ~8.52. So option A's equivalence pH is 8.52.

Wait, but why is this different from the initial approximation? Because when we don't neglect x in the denominator, the result changes.

So the initial approximation gave x=1.04e-5, but the quadratic gives x=3.288e-6.

Wait, that can't be right because 3.288e-6 is smaller than the approximation, leading to a lower x.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.

Wait, the Kb expression is [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] = Kb.

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-]=0.02 -x, [CH3COOH]=x, [OH^-]=x.

So Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

So when x is small compared to 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 -x ≈0.02, leading to x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)= ~1.04e-5.

But when we don't make this approximation, we get x=3.288e-6. Which is a much smaller value, leading to a higher pH?

Wait, no. Because [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

But according to the initial approach, [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Wait, but why the difference?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. I think the Kb value is wrong.

Wait, what's the correct Kb?

Ka of acetic acid=1.85e-5 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 =5.405e-10.

Yes, correct.

So the quadratic calculation gives x=3.288e-6, leading to pH=8.52, which matches option A.

But then why did the approximation give x=1.04e-5, which leads to pH=9.02.

Ah! I think the mistake is that when we don't neglect x, the value of x is smaller, leading to a higher pH. Wait, no. Because [OH^-] is smaller, pOH is higher, pH is lower.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me compute both scenarios.

Approximation:

x=1.04e-5 → [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=14-4.98=9.02.

Quadratic solution:

x=3.288e-6 → [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.485 → pH=8.515.

Wait, but why is x smaller in the quadratic solution? Because when considering the denominator (0.02 -x), the actual x is smaller, leading to a smaller [OH^-], higher pOH, lower pH.

Hmm. So in reality, the pH at equivalence is 8.52, which is option A.

So now, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. So the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water) with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid
The initial moles of acetic acid are:
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]
After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:
\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 2: pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:
\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]
This reaction converts 0.00025 mol of acetic acid to acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻), leaving:
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]
The total volume of the solution is now:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentrations of CH₃COOH and CH₃COO⁻ are:
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]
where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\), we calculate:
\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

### Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate are:
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]
The total volume of the solution is:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentration of acetate ions is:
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]
The acetate ion acts as a weak base in water:
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \(K_b\), where:
\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]
Using the expression for \(K_b\):
\[
K_b = \frac{[\text{OH}^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]
Let \([\text{OH}^-] = x\). Then:
\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.41 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.08 \times 10^{-11}.
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pOH is:
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]
The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]
However, solving the quadratic equation without approximations gives a slightly different result:
\[
x = 3.288 \times 10^{-6}, \quad \text{pOH} = 5.485, \quad \text{pH} \approx 8.52.
\]
Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
