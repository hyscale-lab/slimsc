Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is currently in its fundamental state. I remember that in quantum mechanics, molecules can have rotational and vibrational energy levels. Since it's the rotation-vibration model, I guess this combines both aspects.

Wait, the fundamental state... Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So when it absorbs a photon, it must jump to the next higher state. But wait, does the next state mean the next vibrational state or the next rotational state? Or maybe a combination of both?

Wait, in the quantum rotor model, the energy levels are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are given by the sum of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the energy E is E_rot + E_vib.

The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. For rotation, the ground state is when the rotational quantum number J is 0. For vibration, the ground state is when the vibrational quantum number ν is 0.

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher state. The question is about the next lowest energy state. So what's the next state after the fundamental? I think the next possible state could be either the next vibrational level (ν=1) or the next rotational level (J=1). But wait, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are different.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B * J*(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (ν + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency.

So the fundamental state is J=0, ν=0. The next possible state would be either J=1 with ν=0, or J=0 and ν=1. Which one has lower energy? Let me calculate their energies.

Rotational: For J=1, E_rot = B * 2. B is given by h/(8π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ R², with μ the reduced mass. Let me compute B.

Wait, the vibrational energy for ν=1 is (1 + 1/2) h w = (3/2) h w. The rotational for J=1 is B * 2, because 1*(1+1) = 2. I need to compare which is smaller: 2B or (3/2) h w.

But wait, I don't know the actual value of B yet. Let's compute it.

First, calculate the reduced mass μ. The masses are Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. But I need to convert that to kg.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate that. 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.018, so 3.018e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = μ R² = (3.018e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20. So I = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Rotational constant B = h/(8π² I). Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J s.

So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * π² * 1.2072e-46). Let's compute denominator first: 8 * π² ≈ 8 *9.8696 ≈ 78.9568. Multiply by I: 78.9568 * 1.2072e-46 ≈ 95.325e-46 = 9.5325e-45.

So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / 9.5325e-45 ≈ let's see, 6.626 /9.5325 ≈ 0.695, and 1e-34 /1e-45 = 1e11. So B ≈ 0.695e11 ≈ 6.95e10 s^-1.

Wait, no, wait. Because 6.626e-34 divided by 9.5325e-45 is (6.626 /9.5325) ) * 10^(-34 +45) ) = 0.695 * 1e11 = 6.95e10 s^-1.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes B is given in cm^-1, but I think here it's in s^-1.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in energy per J. Wait, no, B is the rotational constant with units of energy when multiplied by J(J+1). But sometimes B is given in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), but I think in this case, it's in s^-1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it in terms of cm^-1. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. The rotational constant B is often expressed in wavenumbers (cm^-1) and is given by B = h/(8 π² c I), where c is the speed of light. Let me try that.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So B = (6.626e-34 J s) / (8 π² * 3e8 m/s * 1.2072e-46 kg m² )

Compute denominator: 8 * π² ≈ 78.96, multiplied by c (3e8) is 78.96 *3e8 ≈ 2.3688e10. Multiply by I (1.2072e-46): 2.3688e10 * 1.2072e-46 = 2.862e-36.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 2.862e-36 ≈ (6.626 / 2.862) * 1e2 → approximately 2.315 * 100 ≈ 231.5 cm^-1.

Hmm, that makes more sense. So B is about 231.5 cm^-1. But for energy, E_rot = B J (J+1). So when J=0, E_rot is 0. For J=1, E_rot is 2 * B, which is about 463 cm^-1 in terms of energy, but I need to convert that to joules.

Wait, actually, each energy level in rotational is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1, and E_rot in J is B (cm^-1) multiplied by hc, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light.

Wait, more accurately, E_rot (J) = h c B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1.

So for J=0, E_rot is 0.

Now, the vibrational energy is E_vib = (ν + 1/2) h w.

Given that w is 4e14 rad/s. So the vibrational energy for ν=0 is (0 + 1/2) h w = 0.5 * h w.

So the fundamental state is J=0, ν=0. The next possible state could be either J=1, ν=0, or J=0, ν=1.

I need to calculate the energy difference for both transitions and see which is lower.

Compute ΔE for J=1, ν=0: E_rot (J=1) = 2 * B * h c.

Wait, because B is in cm^-1, so E_rot in J is h c B J (J+1).

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The rotational constant B is in cm^-1. So E_rot (in J) is E_rot = h c B J (J+1). Because each cm^-1 corresponds to an energy of h c.

So, for J=1, E_rot = h c * B * 2. B is approximately 231.5 cm^-1. So E_rot = h * c * 231.5 * 2.

But h is 6.626e-34 J s. c is 3e8 m/s.

So E_rot for J=1 is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 * 231.5 * 2.

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Multiply by 231.5: 1.9878e-25 *231.5 ≈ 1.9878 *231.5 ≈ 460 → 460e-25 = 4.6e-23 J.

Multiply by 2: 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but I thought for J=1, E_rot is 2*B. Oh, right, J=1, so J*(J+1)=2, so E_rot = h c B * 2.

Wait, but I'm getting E_rot ≈ 9.2e-23 J for J=1.

Now, the vibrational energy for ν=1: E_vib = (1 + 1/2) h w = (3/2) h w.

w is 4e14 rad/s. So E_vib = 1.5 * 6.626e-34 *4e14.

Compute that: 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19. Multiply by 1.5: 3.9756e-19 J.

So E_vib is about 3.9756e-19 J.

Comparing the two:

E_rot (J=1) is 9.2e-23 J.

E_vib (ν=1) is 3.9756e-19 J, which is larger. So the next higher state is when J=1, which has lower energy than ν=1.

So the molecule will transition to J=1, ν=0. So the energy difference is E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but wait. The energy is the difference between the initial and final states. The initial state is J=0, ν=0 (so E=0). The final state is J=1, ν=0, so E=9.2e-23 J. So the photon's energy must be equal to that difference.

So the photon's energy E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the photon's momentum p is related to its energy by E = p c. Because for photons, E = pc. So p = E / c.

So p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.2e-23) / 3e8 = 3.066e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Because E_photon = h f = p c, so p = E_photon / c.

So 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.066e-31 kg m/s.

But looking at the options, the choices are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N s.

Wait, because 1 N s is 1 kg m/s. So 3.066e-31 kg m/s is 3.066e-31 N s.

Wait, none of the options are that small. The options are about 1e-27 or bigger. So I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of B. Let me double-check.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is μ R². Let's compute that again.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's compute 1.8 *1.66 is about 2.988e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R squared is 4e-20 m².

So I = μ R² = 2.988e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.195e-46 kg m².

Now, B is h/(8 π² I c) (when using cm^-1).

Wait, no, I think earlier when I used B = h/(8 π² I), I might have been wrong. Let me get the correct formula.

The rotational constant B is given by B = h / (8 π² I) in units of s^-1. Because the rotational energy is E_rot = (h/(8 π² I)) J (J+1).

Alternatively, when expressed in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), B = h/(8 π² I c).

Wait, that's correct because when you have E_rot = h c B J(J+1), so B in cm^-1 is h/(8 π² I c).

So let me compute B correctly. Using B = h/(8 π² I c).

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

I = 1.195e-46 kg m².

c = 3e8 m/s.

Compute denominator: 8 π² I c = 8*(9.8696) * 1.195e-46 *3e8.

Compute step by step: 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

78.9568 * 1.195e-46 ≈ 78.9568 *1.195 ≈ 94.47 → 94.47e-46 = 9.447e-45.

Multiply by 3e8: 9.447e-45 *3e8 = 2.834e-36.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 2.834e-36 ≈ (6.626 /2.834 ) * 1e2 → 2.337 * 100 ≈ 233.7 cm^-1.

So E_rot (J=1) is h c B J(J+1) = h c B * 2.

h =6.626e-34, c=3e8, B=233.7 cm^-1.

So E_rot = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 * 233.7 * 2.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Multiply by 233.7: 1.9878e-25 *233.7 ≈ 1.9878 *233.7 ≈ 464 → 464e-25 = 4.64e-23 J.

Multiply by 2 (for J=1: J(J+1) = 2) → 9.28e-23 J.

So E_rot for J=1 is 9.28e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy for ν=1 is (ν + 1/2) h w = (3/2) h w.

h =6.626e-34, w=4e14 rad/s.

So (3/2) *6.626e-34 *4e14 = (3/2 *4) =6. So 6 *6.626e-34 *1e14.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *1e14 = 6.626e-20.

Multiply by 6: 3.9756e-19 J.

So E_vib is 3.9756e-19 J.

Comparing the two, E_rot is about 9.28e-23 J, which is much smaller than E_vib.

Therefore, the next state the molecule will transition to is the J=1, ν=0 state.

So the energy absorbed is E = 9.28e-23 J.

Now, the photon's momentum p is given by E = p c, so p = E / c.

So p = 9.28e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.093e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, 9.28e-23 divided by 3e8 is approximately 3.093e-31.

But the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. Hmm, this is way smaller than the options given. So I think I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused the units for B? Let me think again. Maybe the energy difference is not E_rot, but a combination of rotational and vibrational.

Wait, no. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest state. The next state could be a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. The energy required for the next state is the smallest possible. So the transition is to the state with the smallest possible ΔE.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the next state as the first excited state, which might include a combination of both.

Wait, but earlier, the E_rot(J=1) is about 9.28e-23 J, while the E_vib(ν=1) is about 3.97e-19 J.

So the rotational transition is much lower in energy. So the photon's energy is about 9.28e-23 J, leading to p=3.09e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.09e-31 N s.

But none of the options are near that. So I must have made a mistake in calculation. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state, which is a vibrational state with J=0, ν=1. Because perhaps the energy levels are such that the next available state is the first vibrational state.

Wait, but E_vib is bigger than E_rot, so the molecule would preferentially absorb a lower energy photon for a rotational transition. But perhaps the question is considering the simultaneous change in both vibrational and rotational states?

Wait, maybe the question is not considering a pure rotational transition but a combination. But usually, in spectroscopy, each transition (rotational or vibrational) occurs separately.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the energy required to transition to the next vibrational state, since that's the next possible state in terms of the overall energy. Because even though the rotational transition requires less energy, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest possible. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the smallest possible ΔE.

But according to my calculations, the rotational transition is much lower in energy. So if that's the case, the photon's momentum would be in the 1e-31 range, but none of the options are that small.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of Joules instead of cm^-1.

Wait, B (rotational constant) is given by B = ħ² / (2 I), but I think I might have confused the units earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy difference between J=0 and J=1, which is (E_rot for J=1) - (E_rot for J=0) = E_rot(1) = 2B.

Wait, but I need to compute B in terms of energy.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy levels in Joules.

The formula for rotational energy is E_rot = (h² / (8 I)) * J (J+1).

Wait, because E_rot = (h² / (8 I)) * J (J+1).

So let me compute h squared: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

Divide by 8 I: 8 *1.195e-46 kg m² = 9.56e-46 kg m².

So (4.39e-67) / (9.56e-46) ) = approximately 4.59e-22 J.

Multiply by J (J+1). For J=0, E_rot=0; for J=1, E_rot = 4.59e-22 *2 =9.18e-22 J.

Wait, that's different from earlier. Oh, because I think I messed up the formula earlier.

Wait, the correct rotational energy formula is E_rot = (h² / (8 I)) * J (J+1).

So let me compute h squared: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

I is 1.195e-46 kg m².

So h²/(8 I) = 4.39e-67 / (8 *1.195e-46) ) = 4.39e-67 / 9.56e-46 ≈ 4.59e-22 J.

So E_rot for J=1 is 4.59e-22 * 2 =9.18e-22 J.

Ah, so earlier I thought E_rot was 9.2e-23 J, but actually it's 9.18e-22 J, which is a factor of 10 higher.

So the energy difference is E_rot =9.18e-22 J.

Now, the photon's energy is E_photon =9.18e-22 J.

Then, the momentum p is E/c = 9.18e-22 J /3e8 m/s = 3.06e-30 kg m/s =3.06e-30 N s.

Still, the options are about 1e-27 to 1e-28, which is about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than what I'm getting. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong in considering only the rotational transition. Maybe the molecule transitions to the next state which could involve both vibrational and rotational changes. Like, perhaps the molecule is in the fundamental state (J=0, ν=0). The next state could be (J=1, ν=0) or (J=0, ν=1). But which requires less energy?

E_rot(J=1) is 9.18e-22 J.

E_vib(ν=1) is (3/2) h w = (3/2)*6.626e-34 *4e14 = 3.975e-19 J.

Which is much larger than the rotational transition. So the rotational transition is easier.

So the photon's momentum would be about 3.06e-30 kg m/s, but none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0, ν=0 to J=1, ν=0, and is using the energy from the vibration model.

Wait, no, the question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy transitions combine both rotational and vibrational.

Alternatively, maybe the question is talking about the next state in terms of total energy, which could be a combination of both.

Wait, but the molecule is diatomic and in the fundamental state (J=0, ν=0). The next state could be (J=1, ν=0) with energy 9.18e-22 J, or (J=0, ν=1) with 3.97e-19 J, or (J=1, ν=1) with higher energy.

So the next state with the lowest energy is (J=1, ν=0), requiring a photon with energy 9.18e-22 J.

But the options are much larger than that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating h²/(8 I).

Let me recompute h squared: h =6.626e-34 J s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 x 1e-68 = approx 43.9 x 1e-68 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

I is 1.195e-46 kg m².

h²/(8 I) = (4.39e-67) / (8 *1.195e-46) ) = 4.39e-67 / (9.56e-46) = approx 4.59e-22 J.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2 *4.59e-22 = 9.18e-22 J.

Wait, but why are the options so
