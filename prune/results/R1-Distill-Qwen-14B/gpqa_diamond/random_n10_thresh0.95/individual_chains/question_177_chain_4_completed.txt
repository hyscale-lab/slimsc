Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities: Star_1 is stationary (0 km/s), and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. The question is about the luminosity ratio, assuming the stars are black bodies. The options are A to D, each a number around 2.2 something.

Hmm. I remember that luminosity for black bodies depends on temperature and radius. The formula is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, the problem says the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, no, same λ_max implies same T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. Are they saying that the observed wavelengths are the same because of Doppler shift? Because Star_2 is moving, which could affect the observed wavelength.

Oh, right! Because Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, its light could be Doppler shifted. Oh, wait, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength. Since Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, its emission isn't Doppler shifted. So when they measure the peak wavelength for Star_2, it's not the intrinsic λ_max but the observed one. So we need to correct for that to find the intrinsic temperature.

Let me clarify. The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So observed wavelengths (λ_obs) are the same for both. But Star_2 has a velocity, so its λ_obs is different from its intrinsic λ_emitted.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. But Star_1 is stationary, so λ_obs1 is just the intrinsic λ1. For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_emitted2 * Doppler shift factor.

Doppler effect formula: if a source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer, the observed wavelength λ_obs is λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) if moving away, but I think the exact formula depends on the sign. Wait, the relativistic Doppler shift is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ), where v is the recession velocity. Wait, no, I might have that backwards. If the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shift). So v is positive when moving away.

But in this case, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But which direction? The problem says radial velocity is 700 km/s. Typically, positive radial velocity indicates moving away, but I'm not sure. Wait, but for the Doppler shift, the direction affects whether λ_obs is longer or shorter than the emitted.

Wait, the formula for Doppler shift when the source is moving away (recession) is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is redshift. And z can be approximated for non-relativistic speeds as z ≈ v/c. So λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c). But wait, if the source is moving towards the observer, v would be negative, so λ_obs would be shorter than λ_rest.

But in the problem statement, both stars have the same observed wavelength at which they appear brightest. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

Since Star_1 has v=0, λ_obs1 = λ1. For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ2 * Doppler factor.

So we have λ1 = λ2 * Doppler factor.

But since λ is proportional to 1/T, because λ_max = b/T, then λ1 = λ2 * Doppler factor implies that T1 = T2 * (Doppler factor)^{-1}.

Wait, let's get this straight. If the star is moving towards us, its emitted wavelengths are blueshifted, but the observed wavelength is shorter. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ is shorter than the emitted.

But wait, the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. So maybe Star_2 is moving in such a way that the Doppler shift compensates for any temperature difference.

Wait, but earlier reasoning says that the stars' peak wavelengths are the same because they have the same T, but that's only if they're not moving. But here, they have different velocities, so their observed λ might be same but their intrinsic λ (and thus T) might be different.

So to find the intrinsic temperatures, I need to correct for the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with equations.

Let me denote:

For Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

For Star_2: λ2_obs = Doppler_shifted(λ2_rest, v2).

And λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So λ1_rest = Doppler_shifted(λ2_rest, v2).

But how does the Doppler shift affect the wavelength? Let's get the formula right.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, no, wait. The Doppler shift formula depends on the direction of motion. If the source is moving towards the observer, v is positive, and λ_obs < λ_rest (blue shift). If moving away, λ_obs > λ_rest (red shift).

But to get the correct formula, perhaps I should use:

λ_obs = λ_rest * ( (1 + v_r / c) / (sqrt(1 - v_r²/c²)) )

Wait, no, that's the relativistic Doppler shift. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds (v << c), the Doppler shift can be approximated as:

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c )

where v_r is the radial velocity (positive if moving away).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think. From what I recall, the non-relativistic approximation for the Doppler shift when the source is moving away at speed v is λ_obs = λ_rest (1 + v/c).

If the source is moving towards the observer, v is negative, so λ_obs would be less than λ_rest.

But in our case, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The problem states that the radial velocity is 700 km/s, but it doesn't specify the direction. Hmm. Wait, in astronomy, the radial velocity is usually given as positive when moving away from us (recession), and negative when moving towards us (approach). So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s, that means it's moving away, which would cause a redshift, making λ_obs longer. If it's -700, it's moving towards us, causing blueshift.

But the problem says that the observed λ's are the same. So Star_1's λ_obs is its intrinsic λ (since v=0), and Star_2's λ_obs is its intrinsic λ multiplied by Doppler factor.

So,

λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

And λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

But λ is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ1 = (λ2) * Doppler factor.

Which means T1 = T2 / Doppler factor.

Wait, but wait, λ_max = b / T. So λ1 = (b / T1) and λ2 = (b / T2). So λ1 = b/T1, λ2 = b/T2.

So if λ1_rest = λ2_obs, which is λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_rest (because v=0).

Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

Because Star_2 is moving, so its observed λ is Doppler shifted.

But the problem says λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

But λ1_rest = (b / T1) and λ2_rest = (b / T2).

So,

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * Doppler factor.

Cancel b:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * Doppler factor.

Which leads to T1 = T2 / Doppler factor.

Alternatively, T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

But let's compute the Doppler factor. Let's assume Star_2 is moving away, so v is positive, which would cause a redshift (Doppler factor >1). So let's compute the Doppler factor.

Doppler factor (D) = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, but for non-relativistic speeds, this is approximately 1 + v/c. Because when v is much less than c, the square root can be approximated as 1 + (v/(2c)).

Wait, no, actually the exact Doppler shift for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), but this is the non-relativistic approximation. The relativistic formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), which for v << c can be approximated as λ_rest * (1 + v/(2c)) ).

But the problem gives v as 700 km/s. Let's compute v/c: 700,000 m/s divided by 3e8 m/s. 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333. So v = 0.02333c.

So for Star_2, moving at 700 km/s, which is about 2.3% the speed of light. So it's a small v, so the non-relativistic approximation is acceptable.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's moving towards or away. Hmm. If the observed λ is same as Star_1, which is stationary, then perhaps Star_2's intrinsic λ must be shifted.

Wait, but let's think about the Doppler effect.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, its emitted light is blueshifted, so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c ). If moving away, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c ).

But in any case, we have to relate λ1_rest and λ2_rest.

So the equation is λ1_rest = λ2_obs.

But λ2_obs is either λ_rest * (1 + v/c) or λ_rest * (1 - v/c), depending on direction.

Wait, but the problem says the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Radial velocity is positive when moving away. So Star_2 is moving away. So v is positive, so Doppler shift is redshift: λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).

So equation:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c).

But λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c).

Cancel b,

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v/c).

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).

Which implies T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

Wait, but wait, that's the relationship between T1 and T2.

Now, the luminosity for each star is L = 4πσ R² T⁴.

So for Star_1, L1 = 4πσ (R1)² T1^4.

Star_2: L2 = 4πσ (R2)² T2^4.

The question asks for the factor by which L1 is greater than L2.

So, L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

We know that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

R1/R2 = 1.5 → R1²/R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Now, T1 and T2 are related by T2 = T1 (1 + v/c).

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).

So T1^4 = T2^4 / (1 + v/c)^4.

Substituting into L1/L2:

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (T2^4 / (1 + v/c)^4 ) / ( T2^4 ) )

Simplify:

= 2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4.

We can compute (1 + v/c) as (1 + 700e3 / 3e8) = (1 + 0.002333...) ≈ 1.002333.

So (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4.

What's that approximately?

We can compute it using the binomial approximation. Since x is small, (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + n x.

Here x = 0.002333, n=4.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4 * 0.002333 = 1 + 0.009333 ≈ 1.009333.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, calculate it more accurately.

Compute 1.002333^2:

1.002333 * 1.002333 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2 = 1.004666 + 0.0000054 ≈ 1.004671.

Then square that to get to the 4th power:

(1.004671)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.004671) + (0.004671)^2 ≈ 1.009342 + 0.0000218 ≈ 1.009364.

So (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.009364.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009364 ≈ let's compute that.

2.25 / 1.009364 ≈ 2.2286.

Wait, because 1.009364 * 2.22 = ?

Wait, let me compute 2.25 ÷ 1.009364.

Using a calculator approach: 1.009364 × 2.22 ≈ ?

Wait, 1.009364 * 2 = 2.018728.

1.009364 * 0.22 = 0.222060 approx.

So total ≈ 2.018728 + 0.222060 = 2.240788. But our target is 2.25.

Wait, let me do it accurately.

Looking for x where 1.009364 * x = 2.25.

x = 2.25 / 1.009364 ≈ let's compute.

Compute 1.009364 × 2.228:

1.009364 * 2 = 2.018728.

1.009364 * 0.228 = ?

Compute 1.009364 × 0.2 = 0.2018728.

1.009364 × 0.028 = approx 0.0282622.

So 0.2018728 + 0.0282622 = 0.230135.

So 2.018728 + 0.230135 = 2.248863.

Hmm, which is a bit more than 2.25. Wait, 2.248863 is less than 2.25.

Wait, 2.248863 is 2.248863, target is 2.25.

So 2.25 - 2.248863 = 0.001137.

So how much more do we need to add to x?

Each 0.001 increase in x adds about 1.009364 * 0.001 = 0.001009364 to the product.

So 0.001137 / 0.001009364 ≈ 1.126, so x ≈ 2.228 + 0.001126 ≈ 2.2291.

So x ≈ 2.2291.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is very close.

Wait, but let's check the calculation again. Because perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler factor.

Wait, let me recap. L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4).

We have R1/R2 = 1.5 → R1²/R2² = 2.25.

T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c) → T1 = T2 * (1/(1.002333)).

So T1^4 = T2^4 / (1.002333)^4.

Thus, T1^4 / T2^4 = 1/(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1/1.009364 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, earlier I thought that the Doppler factor is (1 + v/c) for redshift. So in that case, the denominator is (1 + v/c)^4.

Yes, so the calculation seems correct.

So the correct answer should be D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the problem using the given data and black body radiation principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_1 = 1.5 \cdot R_2 \)
   - Mass: \( M_1 = 1.5 \cdot M_2 \)
   - Radial velocities: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s}, v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Observed peak wavelengths: \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)

2. **Luminosity Formula**:
   Luminosity of a black body is given by:
   \[
   L = 4 \pi \sigma R^2 T^4
   \]
   Thus, the luminosity ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]

3. **Temperature Relationship**:
   From Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant. Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)), the intrinsic temperatures must account for the Doppler shift due to Star_2's radial velocity.

   For Star_2, the observed wavelength is redshifted:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
   \]
   Using the non-relativistic approximation (\( v_2 \ll c \)):
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
   \]
   Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we have:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
   \]
   Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T} \), it follows that:
   \[
   T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}}
   \]

4. **Substitute into Luminosity Ratio**:
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 \cdot R_2 \) and \( T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}} \) into the luminosity ratio:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_2}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}}\right)^4}{1^2 \cdot T_2^4}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{\left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)^4}
   \]

5. **Compute \( \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)^4 \)**:
   Given \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \):
   \[
   \frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
   \]
   Using the non-relativistic approximation:
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)^4 \approx 1 + 4 \cdot \frac{v_2}{c} = 1 + 4 \cdot 0.002333 \approx 1.009333
   \]

6. **Final Calculation**:
   Substituting into the luminosity ratio:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.009333} \approx 2.229
   \]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \( 2.23 \) times greater than that of Star_2. 

Answer: D
