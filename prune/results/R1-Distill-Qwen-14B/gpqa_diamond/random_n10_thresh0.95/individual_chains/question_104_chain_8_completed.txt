Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The idea is that as the planet orbits, it makes the star move a little bit towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift slightly.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, each having a Neptune-mass planet. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, same star masses, same planet masses, but different Doppler shifts observed.

Planet #1 has a spectral line shift of up to 5 milliangstroms. Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does this relate to the orbital period? I'm a bit confused. I think the RV method gives us the velocity of the star's movement, right? So the shift in wavelength is proportional to the star's velocity.

Oh wait, the Doppler shift formula is something like delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. But since both stars are similar (same mass) and the planets have the same mass, the velocity amplitude (K) should relate to the planet's mass and orbital period, right? Or wait, more precisely, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is K.

I remember the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 day) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, the formula for K is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) )

But since the exoplanets are Neptune-mass and the stars are solar mass, M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So this simplifies the equation. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so sqrt(1 - e²) =1. So the formula becomes:

K ≈ (2π G / (c P))^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / M_*^(2/3) )

But wait, sin i is 1 for edge-on orbits, which is optimal. So in this case, sin i is 1 because they detected the planet, implying it's edge-on. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But wait, in this problem, both stars have the same mass, M_*, and both planets have the same mass, M_p. So K should be proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). Because, K = (something) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * 1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, that makes sense. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). That is, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3)

So if planet #1 has a K of 5 milliangstroms and planet #2 has K of 7, then K1/K2 = 5/7.

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Let me write the equation for K:

K1 = (constant) / P1^(1/3)
K2 = (constant) / P2^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

But I want P2/P1. Let me rearrange:

(K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)
So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1 = (C) / P1^(1/3), K2 = (C) / P2^(1/3). So K1 = K2 * (P2/P1)^(1/3). Rearranging:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, but that can't be right because if K1 is smaller than K2, then (K1/K2) is less than 1, so (K1/K2)^3 is even smaller, making P2 smaller than P1. Which would be the case if the star's velocity is smaller, implying a longer period? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, when K is higher, that means the star's velocity is higher. A higher K might indicate a more massive planet or shorter period, because the planet's orbital speed is higher, or the star's velocity is higher, which could mean a more massive planet or a shorter period. But wait, in our case, the planet masses are the same, so higher K would imply shorter period. Because for a given planet mass, a shorter period (closer orbit) would cause the star to move more quickly. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K is larger, P is smaller.

So in this problem, Planet #1 has K1=5, Planet #2 has K2=7. So K2 > K1. So according to the formula, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). Therefore, K2 is larger, so P2 is smaller than P1.

Wait wait, but the question is asking: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So P2 / P1.

Wait, no. The question is, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So it's (P2 / P1).

Alternatively, if the RV method gives a higher K, that would suggest a shorter period. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1.

So P2 is shorter than P1. So P2/P1 is less than 1, meaning planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's, so it's not longer. Wait, but that can't be right because the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1, so if P2 is shorter, the ratio would be less than 1, but the options don't have a number less than 1 except option A (0.36), D (0.85), and the others are above 1.

Wait, but looking at the options: A is ~0.36, which is less than 1. B is ~1.4, C is ~1.96, D is ~0.85.

Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

Wait, but let's think again about the relation between K and P.

We have K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We can cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Given that K1=5, K2=7, so K1/K2=5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364, which is about 0.36. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's, meaning planet #2 is closer to its star, so it's moving faster, hence a larger K.

So the question asks, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1 = 0.36, which is less than one. So it's 0.36 times as long as P1. So the answer would be option A) ~0.36.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula is P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, no, earlier we had: (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So if K1 is 5, K2 is7, then (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 = 0.364. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Which would be P2/P1 = 0.36, so the answer is 0.36 times as long. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are the shifts given as the maximum shift? Because in RV measurements, the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity, which is the velocity semi-amplitude. So in the problem, they're talking about the periodic shift of a spectral line, which is related to K.

So the shift is proportional to the velocity. Since the velocity is K, the ratio of the shifts would be K1/K2 = 5/7.

So using the same formula as before, since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So that gives us (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364, so P2 is 0.36 times P1.

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1. So it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer is option A, ~0.36.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines, which is proportional to the star's velocity. The semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), as given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \) is approximately 0.36 times \( P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. The question asks how many times longer \( P_2 \) is than \( P_1 \), so the ratio is \( P_2 / P_1 = 0.36 \). Among the options, the closest value is:

**A) ~0.36**

Answer: A
