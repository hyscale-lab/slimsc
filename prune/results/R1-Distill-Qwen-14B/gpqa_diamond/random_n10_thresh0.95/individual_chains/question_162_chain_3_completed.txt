Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric given here is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a conformally flat metric. Right, because it's expressed in terms of a conformal factor multiplied by the flat metric.

The question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the radius of curvature for a pseudosphere is related to its curvature. I think the Gaussian curvature K is related to the radius of curvature R by K = -1/R². So if the radius is 2, then K should be -1/(2)^2 = -1/4. 

But let me think about the metric. The given metric is in terms of x and y. Maybe it's a 2D metric in conformal form. So in general, for a 2D metric in conformal coordinates, the line element is ds² = e^{2λ(x,y)} (dx² + dy²), where λ is some function. Comparing that to what we have here, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So that's e^{2λ} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), which implies λ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

Wait, but I'm not sure that's directly helpful yet. I need to find the area. The area of a surface with a given metric can be found by integrating the area element over the surface. The area element in two dimensions for a metric ds² = g(x,y)(dx² + dy²) is just sqrt(g) dx dy. Oh wait, no — actually, for a metric ds² = a(x,y) dx² + b(x,y) dy², the area element is sqrt(b) if a and b are functions. But in this case, it's a conformal metric, so a = b = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element is sqrt(a * b) dx dy? No, wait, no, for the area element in 2D, when the metric is diagonal, it's sqrt(g_{11} g_{22}) dx dy — but since it's conformal, g_{11} = g_{22} = a(x,y). So the area element is a(x,y) dx dy. So the area A is the integral over the surface of a(x,y) dx dy.

So in our case, a(x,y) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So,

A = ∫∫ [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, what are the limits of integration? Because the metric must be non-singular. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So 4 -x² -y² must be positive; otherwise, the metric blows up. So the region of integration is where 4 -x² -y² > 0, which is x² + y² < 4. So in other words, the region is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Ah, so the area is the integral over the disk x² + y² < 4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. Maybe it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let's let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The denominator becomes 4 - r².

So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32 / (4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

We can separate the integrals:

A = (32) * ∫0^{2π} dθ * ∫0^2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

The θ integral is straightforward: 2π.

So A = 32 * 2π * ∫0^2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Now, let's compute the r integral: ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ] = ∫ ( (-1/2) du ) / u = (-1/2) ∫ du/u.

Which is (-1/2) ln|u| + C = (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) + C.

Evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2: (-1/2) ln(4 -4) → ln(0) which is negative infinity. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, because as r approaches 2, 4 - r² approaches 0 from the positive side, so ln(0) is negative infinity, but with a negative sign. So let's compute the definite integral:

[ (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) ] from 0 to 2.

At r=2: (-1/2) ln(0) → (-1/2)(-infty) → +infty.

At r=0: (-1/2) ln(4) → (-1/2) * ln4.

So the integral is [ +infty ] - [ (-1/2) ln4 ] → ∞.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the area of a pseudosphere shouldn't be infinite, right? Or wait, maybe it is. Because a pseudosphere is a surface of infinite extent with finite area? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, a pseudosphere is an infinite surface, so its area would be infinite. Because in 3D, a pseudosphere is like a horn that extends infinitely, so its surface area is actually finite, but wait, no, I'm not so sure. Wait, I thought in 2D, a pseudosphere (which is a tractricoid) has finite area and finite volume when embedded in 3D. Hmm, but wait, in this case, perhaps the metric is given in a certain coordinate system that covers only a portion of the pseudosphere.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The metric is in the form ds² = (32)/(4 -x² -y²) (dx² + dy²). So the region where 4 -x² -y² >0 is x² + y² <4, which is a disk of radius 2. So the integral over that region would give the area as 32 * 2π * ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

But when I compute that integral, the integral from 0 to 2 of r/(4 - r²) dr is equal to [ (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) ] from 0 to 2.

Which is (-1/2)(ln(0) - ln(4)) ) → (-1/2)(-infty - ln4) ) → (-1/2)(-infty) → +infty. So the whole area becomes 32 * 2π * (infty) = infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right because the pseudosphere should have finite area. Or maybe I'm making a mistake in the setup. Another thought: perhaps the metric is for a compact surface, but that doesn't seem to be the case here because the denominator approaches zero at r=2, which is the boundary of the domain.

Wait another angle. Maybe the metric is defined on a disk of radius 2, but that disk is like a coordinate chart covering only part of the pseudosphere. But in reality, the pseudosphere is a surface that requires multiple charts to cover it because of the infinite extent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the metric. Let me think about the Gaussian curvature. The metric is conformally flat, so the Gaussian curvature can be computed from the conformal factor.

The formula for Gaussian curvature K in isothermal coordinates (which this is, since it's conformally flat) is given by:

K = - (1/2) e^{-2λ} Δ λ,

where Δ is the Laplacian in flat space.

So first, find λ such that e^{2λ} = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So 2λ = ln(32) - ln(4 -x² -y²).

So λ = (1/2) [ ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) ].

Compute the Laplacian of λ in polar coordinates. Laplacian in 2D polar coordinates is:

Δλ = (1/r) d/dr (r dλ/dr) + (1/r²) d²λ/dθ².

Since λ depends only on r, the θ derivative is zero, so:

Δλ = (1/r) d/dr [ r dλ/dr ].

Compute dλ/dr:

dλ/dr = (1/2) [ 0 - ( -2r ) / (4 - r²) ) ] = (1/2)( 2r / (4 - r²) ) )= r/(4 - r²).

So,

d/dr [ r * (r/(4 - r²)) ] = d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ) ].

Let me compute this derivative:

Let f(r) = r²/(4 - r²).

f' = [ 2r(4 - r²) - r² (-2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2

= [ 8r - 2r³ + 2r³ ] / (4 - r²)^2

= 8r / (4 - r²)^2.

So Δλ = (1/r) * (8r)/(4 - r²)^2 ) = 8/(4 - r²)^2.

So,

K = - (1/2) e^{-2λ} * [8/(4 - r²)^2 ].

But e^{-2λ} = (4 - r²)/32.

So,

K = - (1/2) * (4 - r²)/32 * [8/(4 - r²)^2 ]

Simplify:

= - (1/2) * (4 - r²) *8 / [32 (4 - r²)^2 ]

= - (1/2) * 8 / [32 (4 - r²) ]

= - (4) / [32 (4 - r²) ]

= - 1/(8 (4 - r²)).

Wait, but wait. I thought the Gaussian curvature of a pseudosphere is constant. Because a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. So if K is varying, that can't be right.

Hmm, that means perhaps this metric isn't that of a pseudosphere? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me redo the calculation of the Laplacian. Let me recheck the steps. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, λ = (1/2) [ ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) ].

So, dλ/dr = (1/2) [ 0 - ( -2r )/(4 - r²) ) ] = (1/2)( 2r/(4 - r²) ) ) = r/(4 - r²).

Then,

d/dr [ r * (r/(4 - r²)) ] = d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ) ].

Using the quotient rule: numerator u = r², denominator v=4 - r².

u’ = 2r, v’ = -2r.

So d/dr (u/v) = (u’ v - u v’) / v²

= [ 2r(4 - r²) - r² (-2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2

= [ 8r - 2r³ + 2r³ ] / denominator

= 8r / denominator.

So that's correct. Then,

Δλ = (1/r) * (8r)/(4 - r²)^2 ) = 8/(4 - r²)^2.

Then,

e^{-2λ} = e^{ - [ ln(32/(4 - r²)) ] } = (4 - r²)/32.

So,

K = -(1/2) * (4 - r²)/32 * [8/(4 - r²)^2 ]

Let me compute this:

(1/2) * (4 - r²) *8 / (32 (4 - r²)^2 )

= (1/2) * 8 / [32 (4 - r²) ]

= (4) / [32 (4 - r²) ]

= 1/(8 (4 - r²)).

So K = -1/(8(4 - r²)).

Wait, that's not a constant. So the curvature is varying with r, which suggests this isn't the metric of a pseudosphere, which should have constant curvature. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement? Or maybe the question is tricking me because the metric is presented as a pseudosphere but actually isn't.

But the question says, "What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?" So perhaps despite the curvature varying, the area is being computed in this metric, which perhaps corresponds to a portion of the pseudosphere.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere, so perhaps the integral I set up earlier is the correct approach, leading to an infinite area. But that would imply that the correct answer is D) +infty.

But wait, earlier when I computed the area integral, I found it to be infinite. Let me think: the area was ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ, which after substitution gives an integral that diverges at r=2, leading to an infinite area.

So if the area is infinite, the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the metric is that of a sphere with imaginary radius, but that's more about hyperbolic space.

Alternatively, perhaps the radius here refers to something else. Wait, the radius r=2 in the pseudosphere. Wait, the radius of curvature of a pseudosphere is the radius of the sphere that has the same curvature magnitude but positive. So for a pseudosphere with K=-1/4, the radius of curvature would be 2. So in that case, perhaps the given metric is for a pseudosphere of radius 2, but the area computed would be finite.

Wait, but according to the integral I computed, the area is infinite. Because the denominator approaches zero at r=2, making the integrand blow up. So integrating up to r=2 would give an infinite area.

Hmm, but that seems contradictory because I've read that the tractricoid (pseudosphere) has finite area. For example, the surface area is 4πa², where a is the radius. Wait, but in that case, maybe the metric given here is not correctly set up for that.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the metric of the pseudosphere in different coordinate systems. The standard metric for a pseudosphere can be written in terms of its radius a. Let me recall that.

Ah, wait, the metric for a pseudosphere can be expressed in terms of the tractrix coordinates. Alternatively, in conformal coordinates, it's often written as:

ds² = a² (dx² + dy²) / (1 - x² - y²).

Wait, but in our case, the metric is 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, so 32 is 16 * 2. Let me see: if a^2 is 16, then a is 4, but the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²). So maybe 4 corresponds to the radius of curvature, which for a pseudosphere of radius a, the curvature is K=-1/a². So if a=2, K=-1/4, which matches the radius given in the question (r=2). So the denominator in the metric would be a² - (x² + y²). So for a=2, it would be 4 - (x² + y²). So the metric would be [32/(4 -x² -y²)] (dx² + dy²). So 32 is 16 * 2. Hmm, wait, 16 is (4)^2, but a is 2. So perhaps the metric is scaled.

Wait, in the standard conformal metric for a pseudosphere of radius a, it's ds² = a² (dx² + dy²)/(a² - x² - y²).

So for a=2, it would be 4 (dx² + dy²)/(4 - x² - y²).

But in the given metric, it's 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²) = 32 (dx² + dy²)/(4 - x² - y²).

So 32 is 8 times larger than the a=2 case. So perhaps the scaling factor is off. Maybe the given metric is for a different radius or a different scaling. Alternatively, perhaps it's scaled by a factor, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the area calculation is going to be based on the given metric. So, regardless of standard forms, the area is as computed. So from the integral, it's infinite because as r approaches 2, the integrand becomes infinite.

So the area would be infinite, so the correct answer is D) +infty.

But wait, the options given are:

A) 0

B)4π(x² + y²)

C)4π(x² − y²)

D)+infty

So if the area is infinite, the correct answer is D.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: perhaps the given metric represents a compact surface, but that doesn't seem to fit because the denominator is 4 −x²−y², which would require x² + y² <4, a disk of radius 2, but the pseudosphere is non-compact, so perhaps the metric is in a coordinate system that covers the whole space, leading to an infinite area.

Yes, the integral over the entire disk of radius 2 (which is the domain where the metric is valid) would indeed give an infinite area. So the area is infinite, so the answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). This metric is conformally flat, meaning it can be written as \( ds^2 = e^{2\lambda(x, y)} (dx^2 + dy^2) \), where the conformal factor is \( e^{2\lambda} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The area of a surface with a given metric is computed by integrating the area element, which for a conformal metric is:

\[
A = \int\int \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. In this case, the metric is diagonal, so \( \sqrt{g} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). Thus, the area is:

\[
A = \int\int \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is where the metric is non-singular, i.e., \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), which corresponds to the disk \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \) with radius 2. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta, y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element becomes \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), and the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Separating the integrals:

\[
A = 32 \cdot \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The angular integral is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

For the radial integral, use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), so \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits of integration change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \), and when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Thus:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| \), so:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \frac{1}{2} \left[\ln|u|\right]_0^4 = \frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

As \( r \to 2 \), \( u \to 0 \), and \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \). Therefore, the radial integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Substituting back into the expression for \( A \):

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot (+\infty) = +\infty.
\]

This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere, as defined by the given metric, is infinite. While a standard pseudosphere has finite area, the metric provided here leads to a divergent result, likely due to the specific scaling and domain of the coordinates.

### Analysis of Options:

- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect. This is not a valid expression for the area.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect. This is not a valid expression for the area.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct. The integral diverges, leading to an infinite area.

Answer: D
