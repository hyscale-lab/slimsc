Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The problem says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

So let's plug in the values. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the first from the second's perspective would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that step by step.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator: the product is 0.3c², so (0.3c²)/c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. Looking at the options, both C and D have 0.14c as v_rel. So that's one part done.

Now the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c squared. So for each, I need to calculate their respective gamma factors.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute each.

First astronaut: v = 0.6c.
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is 1.25 * (2m) c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait wait, no. Wait, the astronaut's mass is 2m, so the energy should be gamma * mass * c². So yeah, 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, no: the astronaut's rest mass is 2m, so the energy is gamma * (2m) c². So (1.25)*(2m c²) = 2.5 m c². Hmm, okay.

Second astronaut: v=0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So their energy is gamma2 * 3m c². Let's compute that: 1.1547 * 3 ≈ 3.464 m c².

So the total energy is 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² = 5.964 m c². Approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2, and D says E=5 mc². So the correct energy is about 5.96.

So putting it together: relative speed is 0.14c, energy is 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C matches both. So the answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (\(v = 0.6c, m = 2m\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (\(v = 0.5c, m = 3m\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

From the options, the relative speed \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\) and the total energy \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\) correspond to **option C**.

Answer: C
