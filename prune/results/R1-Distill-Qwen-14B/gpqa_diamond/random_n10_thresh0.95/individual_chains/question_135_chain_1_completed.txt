Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the decay of a boson. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, the question is about the allowed decays of a boson X based on the interaction given and its mass.

The Lagrangian is provided as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I remember that the interaction term tells us which particles the boson X can decay into. The boson is X, and the fermions involved are ψ_f. So, the interaction is between X and these fermions.

The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So, for any decay product, the combined mass of the fermions plus their antiparticles must be less than the mass of X. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into others, the total mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the original particle. Otherwise, the decay wouldn't be kinematically allowed.

So, looking at the options, the possible decay channels are into different fermion-antifermion pairs. The options vary on which particles are included.

Let's think about the fermion masses. For a fermion pair to be produced, each fermion's mass must be less than half of X's mass. Because each would get some energy, but the main factor is that each must be less than 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV). So any fermion heavier than 3 GeV can't be a decay product.

Wait, but wait, fermions have rest masses. Let me list them:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV, negligible compared to GeV.
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV, same.
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV.
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV.
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV.
- Top (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV.
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV.
- Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV.
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV.
- Also, neutrinos are super light, but I don't see any in the options.

Wait, let me double-check the masses. So:

u: ~2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
d: ~4.7 MeV
s: ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
c: ~1.27 GeV (approx)
b: ~4.1-4.7 GeV (depending on source, but around 4.5)
t: ~173 GeV
e: ~0.000511 GeV
μ: ~0.105 GeV
τ: ~1.777 GeV

So, X has a mass of 6 GeV. So the maximum mass each fermion in the pair can have is 3 GeV because each would have to be at rest for the minimum mass case (which is when all energy goes into rest mass). So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can be produced.

Looking at each fermion:

- u: yes, way under 3 GeV.
- d: yes.
- s: yes.
- c: 1.27 GeV, yes.
- b: 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So, b and bbar can't be produced because each would need 4.5 GeV, and 4.5*2 =9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV. Wait, but wait, no, the combined mass of the pair must be less than X's mass. So each fermion's mass has to be less than half of X's mass.

Wait, the exact condition is that the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of X. For a fermion-antifermion pair, the sum is 2m_f. So 2m_f < m_X → m_f < 3 GeV.

So for each fermion, m_f < 3 GeV.

Looking again:

u: 0.0022 GeV → yes
d: 0.0047 GeV → yes
s: 0.095 GeV → yes
c: 1.27 GeV → yes
b: 4.5 GeV → no, too heavy
t: way over, no
e: 0.0005 GeV → yes
μ: 0.105 GeV → yes
τ: 1.777 GeV → yes

So, the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ. But not b or t.

Looking at the options, which include these.

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but the b fermion is too heavy. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, let me check: c is 1.27 GeV, which is allowed. s, u, d, tau (1.777 GeV), mu (0.105 GeV), e (0.0005 GeV). So all these fermions are allowed. So option B includes these. So B is a possibility.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, and t. But t is way too heavy. So C includes t which is impossible, so C is out.

Option D: X → b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But again, b is 4.5 GeV, which is over 3 GeV. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck: Is the tau allowed? Because tau is 1.777 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So yes.

So the allowed decay channels are into pairs of u, d, s, c, tau, mu, e.

Which option has all these? Let me see:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So yes.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So option B is the correct one.

Wait, but looking again. Let me check the options again.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all are allowed. So option B is correct.

Option A includes b, which is not allowed, so A is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, but the total rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of \( X \). For a fermion-antifermion pair, this means \( 2m_f < m_X \), or equivalently, \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The rest masses of the fermions are as follows:
- \( u \): \( 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( d \): \( 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( s \): \( 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( c \): \( 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( b \): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
- \( t \): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
- \( e \): \( 0.000511 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \mu \): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \tau \): \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)

From this, the allowed fermions for decay are \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \). The \( b \) and \( t \) quarks, as well as any other fermions with masses exceeding 3 GeV, are excluded.

Now, analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( b \) is too heavy. Hence, A is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), all of which are allowed. Hence, B is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( t \) is too heavy. Hence, C is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Hence, D is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \).

Answer: B
