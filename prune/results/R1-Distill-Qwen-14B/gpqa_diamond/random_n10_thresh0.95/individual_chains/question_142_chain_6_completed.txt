Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm. Right, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think I remember that when a density matrix is a mixture of the basis states, it might represent something like a completely mixed state. Oh right! For a single qubit, the completely mixed state is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So that's exactly what ρ is here.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. I'm not entirely sure about the geometric interpretation of density matrices. I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The Bloch vector for a qubit state is usually written as (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation value of the Pauli matrices. 

Wait, for a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector with components (x, y, z) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So for a pure state |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, the vector r has a length of 1 because it's on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But for a mixed state, the length is less than 1.

Looking at the given ρ, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me write this in terms of the identity and Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I for a qubit is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). So ρ can be rewritten as (I)/2. That means the 'r' vector in the expression (I + r·σ)/2 must be zero because there are no σ terms. So r is (0,0,0).

But wait, let me think again. The state (I + r·σ)/2. So if r is zero, then ρ is I/2, which is indeed the case here. That would place the state at the origin of the Bloch sphere. So the geometrical position is (0,0,0), which is option C.

Oh wait, no, the question asks about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I think in the Bloch sphere, the origin is the completely mixed state. So yeah, the state would be at the center. So the correct option is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the completely mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), it simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which means there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices (\(\mathbf{r} = 0\)). This places the state at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the point \((0, 0, 0)\).

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
