--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still trying to get the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy questions. But I'll take it step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, first, I think I should figure out what each of these products is. Let's break it down.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid. 1,3-dibromo would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbon atoms, probably in a bridgehead position because that's where the substituents usually go in adamantane derivatives.

When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, that's a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination or possibly some kind of ring-opening. Wait, elimination would lead to a double bond. Wait, but wait, if both Br are on adjacent carbons, heating with a base could lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules when treated with KOH, probably forming 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe 1,3-diene structure within the adamantane framework. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening if the structure is such that elimination is possible.

Wait, but when you eliminate two HBr molecules, you get an alkene. So, the product would be 1,3-diene adamantane? Or perhaps a bridge is formed. Hmm. Let me think. Adamantane has a structure with four bridgehead carbons. So 1 and 3 would be adjacent bridgeheads. If you eliminate two HBr's, perhaps you form a double bond between those two carbons.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. Could that be an epoxide? No, because KOH isn't typically used for epoxidation. Wait, maybe it's a diene. Let's think about the IR spectrum. The product has an absorption at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of an ester or a ketone or maybe an alkyne. Wait, 1720 is more like an ester (maybe around 1740 for esters, but sometimes a bit lower depending on substitution) or a ketone (which is around 1700-1750). Alternatively, an alkyne's C≡O would be higher, but maybe it's an ester.

Wait, wait, looking at the product 1's 1H NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Let's think about that. 4.79 is probably an -OH or maybe a CH2 group attached to an oxygen. But wait, after KOH treatment, perhaps it's an ether or alcohol.

Wait, but if product 1 is from the elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps it's a diene. Oh wait, another possibility: the product could be a ketone. If KOH is used under certain conditions, maybe it's a cleavage reaction. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane losing two HBr to form a diene. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene. But then, what's the structure of product 1?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But with two bromines, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a region where an -OCH2 group would appear. So maybe product 1 is a diol. Wait, but how? KOH is a base but perhaps under certain conditions, like elimination, but more likely, if it's a substitution, but with two bromines, maybe a diol forms via substitution. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane substituting with OH- would form a diol, but then what would the structure look like?

Wait, but if it's elimination, perhaps it forms a diene. Let me think about the IR. The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. Wait, could it be a ketone? So, maybe the reaction is some kind of oxidation. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But the IR for an epoxide would have a peak around 1250 cm-1 (C-O-C stretch), not 1720. So that's probably not it.

Wait, maybe the product is a diester. Wait, but how would that form from KOH? Hmm, perhaps the reaction is more about elimination. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → upon dehydrohalogenation, forms a diene (like 1,3-diene). So product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene.

But the NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's not typical for a diene, which would have protons around 5 ppm maybe, but more likely lower. Wait, perhaps those 2H are part of an ether or something else.

Wait, another approach: after heating with KOH, maybe the product is a cyclopropane. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a ketone is formed if there's a cleavage. But I'm not getting a clear picture.

Wait, maybe the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, and elimination forms a double bond. So the product would be a bicyclic diene. But then, where would the 4.79 ppm peak come from? Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alcohol. Oh wait, perhaps it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement or similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Since KOH is a strong base, perhaps it's a double substitution to form a diol. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-adamantane diol. But then, would the diol have an NMR signal at 4.79 ppm? For an alcohol, the protons would be broader, but perhaps if it's a diol, like a vicinal diol, the protons would be around 3.5-4.5 ppm. So 4.79 seems a bit high for an -OH proton, but maybe it's an -OCH2 group.

Wait, another possibility: the product is a ketone. But how? Unless the base abstracts a proton and induces a cleavage. Wait, if the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Suppose the two Br are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, and elimination forms a carbonyl group. That would mean each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead, so when they eliminate, a ketone forms. But for that, each Br would have to be on a carbon that can form a carbonyl upon elimination.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the Hofmann rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: KOH could cause a Birch reduction, but that's usually under high pressure and with a metal, so maybe not here. Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, which is more likely.

But if product 1 is an alkene, then the IR peak at 1720 might not make sense. Wait, unless the product is a ketone formed via some elimination. Maybe the base deprotonates and forms a double bond and a carbonyl group. So product 1 could be a ketone.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH2 group. If product 1 is a diol, then those 2H might be attached to an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether.

Wait, perhaps the product is a gem-diol. But if that's the case, the protons would be split, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, but how?

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the next step.

Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So perhaps product 1 undergoes some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, but product 1's structure is key here. If product 1 is a diol, maybe in the presence of Al isopropoxide, it could form an ether via an elimination reaction. Alternatively, if it's a diol, perhaps it undergoes some kind of esterification or other reaction.

Wait, but if product 1 is a diol, perhaps it's reacting to form an epoxide, but I don't know the conditions. Alternatively, under Friedel-Crafts conditions, maybe product 1 undergoes some alkylation.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkene, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some addition, like forming a carbocation or a diene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and when Al isopropoxide is added, it forms a more substituted double bond via hydride shifts or something. But I'm not sure.

Moving on to the next step: product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. That's a standard ozonolysis followed by reductive work-up (since DMS is a reductant). Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds. But the question is about product 3's NMR, specifically the most deshielded hydrogen.

Wait, but the most deshielded hydrogen would typically be near an electronegative group or in an environment with high electron withdrawal, like a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group, like in an aldehyde or ketone.

But let's think about the steps again.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid)
2. product 1 + Al isopropoxide → product 2
3. product 2 + ozone → product 3 (after work-up)

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups if product 2 had double bonds. So perhaps product 2 is a diene, which upon ozonolysis gives two carbonyl groups.

But let's think again about product 1. The NMR of product 1 is 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Let's think about the integration: 2 +10 +2 =14H. Adamantane has 10 hydrogens, but I'm not exactly sure of the structure. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has 10 H if each Br is on a bridgehead.

Wait, product 1's NMR shows 2H at 4.79, which could be a methylene group adjacent to oxygen. 10H from 2.41-2.23, which is probably all the bridgehead Hs. 2H at 1.94, maybe some other methylene group.

Wait, if product 1 is a diol, the 4.79 ppm would be the OH protons, but they usually show as broad signals, not sharp. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether's CH2.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diepoxide. But then the IR would have the C-O-C peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. But then, the NMR would show a peak at around 2 ppm for the carbonyl adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, product 1's 4.79 ppm could be an -OCH2CH2O- group, like an ether. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the reaction conditions. KOH and heat with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Maybe it's an E2 elimination, forming a double bond. So product 1 is a diene.

If product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene, then the structure would have two double bonds? Or a conjugated diene. Then, the NMR would show the protons on the double bonds. But the 1H NMR of product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H). Hmm. Maybe the diene protons are at higher ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bridged bicyclic ether, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the IR peak. 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, perhaps an ester or ketone. But how does that fit with the initial reaction?

Wait, another possibility: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's a substitution reaction forming a glycol (diol). So product 1 is a vicinal diol, 1,3-adamantane diol. Then, in the NMR, the two -OH groups would be exchanging and not seen, but the adjacent CH2 groups would show up. Wait, but the NMR shows 2H at 4.79, which is higher than typical for diols.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. How would that form? Maybe the base induces oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless it's an elimination to form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the Br atoms are on bridgehead carbons, and elimination forms a carbonyl group. So, for each Br elimination, a carbonyl forms. So product 1 would have two carbonyl groups, making it a diketone. But that would require the structure to allow for such elimination.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is adamantyl oxide, but I don't know the structure.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should move forward and see if I can figure it out based on the later steps.

So product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid. Maybe it's used in a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but only if product 1 has an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalyst for some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it loses water to form an alkene. So product 2 would be a diene.

If product 2 is a diene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-adamantadiene, ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls, but I'm not sure how the structure would look.

Wait, but product 3's NMR is what's being asked. The most deshielded hydrogen would be near a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl, like in a ketone or aldehyde.

But considering the reaction steps, let's try to reconstruct:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 is a diol (maybe 1,3-adamantane diol). Then, product 1 heated with Al isopropoxide → product 2 is the alkene (1,3-adamantadiene). Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis to form product 3, which would have carbonyl groups.

But wait, the initial structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If elimination occurs, perhaps the two Br are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, and elimination would form a double bond between them. So product 1 is the diene.

Wait, but then what is product 1's structure? Because the NMR is 4.79 (2H), which might not fit an alkene unless those are some bridgehead hydrogens, which usually are more downfield.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and the 4.79 ppm is for some other group.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone. If so, the IR would have a peak at ~1720, which fits. Then, the NMR would have the carbonyl adjacent protons. But in a ketone, the neighboring CH2 groups typically appear around 2-3 ppm.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, then Al isopropoxide could be a catalyst for some alkylation. Maybe product 2 is a more substituted ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: let's think about the product 3.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis of a diene would break the double bonds into carbonyl groups. If product 2 is a diene, product 3 would be two carbonyl compounds.

Assuming product 2 is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would yield two aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure.

The most deshielded proton in product 3 would be adjacent to the carbonyl group. For example, in an aldehyde, the aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, but that's a singlet because it's only attached to one carbon. However, if it's a ketone, the adjacent protons are usually around 2-3 ppm and might be split due to coupling.

Wait, but the question says, "the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)." So, maybe it's a hydrogen adjacent to an electronegative group or a carbonyl.

Wait, but another thought: if product 2 is a bridged bicyclic diene, ozonolysis would break each double bond, but perhaps generate two carbonyl groups in a ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a tricyclic compound with a double bond that, when cleaved, gives a carbonyl group attached to a bridgehead.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to think of the possible structures.

Another approach: Let's think about the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH.

1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. KOH is a strong base; perhaps it deprotonates and leads to elimination of HBr twice, forming a diene.

So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene. Then, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide, which may help in some kind of cyclization or further elimination.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some ring expansion or forms a more stable structure.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is a more substituted diene or an aromatic compound, but adamantane derivatives are usually non-aromatic.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is a monoene, perhaps via some hydride shift.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the NMR of product 3.

In product 3, after ozonolysis, the most deshielded proton would be near a carbonyl group. Let's say it's part of a ketone. The coupling pattern would depend on neighboring protons.

If the hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl and has two neighboring protons on either side, it might form a triplet. Alternatively, if there are more adjacent protons, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, but let's think about the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into two carbonyls.

But wait, ozonolysis of a diene would produce multiple carbonyls. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-adamantadiene, which is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would cleave each double bond, but I'm not exactly sure how this would break down.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a monoene. So ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds.

But the key is to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone or a dialdehyde. The most deshielded H would be on the carbonyl group, like an aldehyde proton. But aldehyde protons are usually singlets because they have no neighboring H (except in some cases like crotonaldehyde where there's a double bond adjacent, but that would have coupling). However, in most cases, aldehyde H is a singlet. But the options don't include a singlet.

Alternatively, the H is adjacent to a carbonyl and has coupling with two sets of neighboring Hs.

Wait, but the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Another approach: perhaps the H is part of an allylic position or part of a geminal coupling.

Wait, perhaps the H is next to two different sets of Hs. For example, if it's next to two Hs on one side and another two on the other, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. The Hs on CH2 would be split based on neighboring groups.

Wait, in the ozonolysis product, perhaps each carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group. So, the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have coupling with each other and perhaps with neighboring groups.

But then, each CH2 group would have two Hs, which in a simple case would be a triplet if each H is coupled to two others. But wait, in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, the Hs would typically be split by the neighboring Hs. But if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, the splitting might be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each H on the CH2 is coupled to two Hs on each side. So each H would be a triplet.

Wait, for example, imagine a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. The CH2 groups would each have Hs that are coupled to each other. Each H on the CH2 would be a triplet because each H is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but that might lead to a more complex splitting pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group next to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a cyclopropane ring adjacent to a carbonyl, leading to a particular coupling pattern.

But without a clear structure, it's challenging.

Wait, another thought: during ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and the resulting carbonyl groups are formed. If the original diene (product 2) was symmetrical, the ozonolysis product (product 3) would be a pair of identical carbonyl compounds.

But perhaps the H in question is part of a bridgehead structure in product 3, leading to specific coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a bridged bicyclic structure where it's adjacent to a carbonyl and has coupling with two different sets of Hs.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress. Let me think of the possible options.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

Which of these is likely for a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group, maybe part of a CH2 group next to the carbonyl, and perhaps coupled with neighboring Hs.

If the H is on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and coupled with two Hs on each adjacent carbon, then each H would be a triplet.

Wait, for example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-..., each CH2's Hs would be a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the neighboring CH2.

Wait, but each H in the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So each H would be a triplet.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which is likely the one closest to the carbonyl.

So in that case, the H would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is a triplet. But wait, option B is triplet of triplets, which would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is coupled with two different sets of Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

For example, if the H is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two Hs, it would have coupling with both, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the H is part of a bridge where it's coupled with two sets of two Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: perhaps the H is part of an allylic position, coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. But among the options, triplet is possible. Another thought: if the H is part of a CH2 next to a carbonyl, and each H is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, each H would be a triplet. So the splitting would be a triplet.

But then, if the adjacent CH2 group is also coupled with another group, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is coupled with two different protons, each with a different coupling constant, leading to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the H is part of a bridgehead, coupled with two adjacent Hs on one bridge and two on another, leading to a more complex splitting. For example, each H would be a doublet due to coupling with two Hs, but if each of those Hs is also coupled with another set, it could become a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group next to the carbonyl, and the CH2 is between two carbonyls. Each H on the CH2 would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not entirely certain. Given the options, I'm leaning towards a triplet, but option B is also a possibility.

Wait, but another angle: the NMR of product 3 would have the most deshielded H as part of a carbonyl-adjacent CH group. If it's a CH2 group, the Hs would typically be a triplet if each H is coupled to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. But if the CH2 is next to a carbonyl and another CH2, each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Therefore, the answer would be A) triplet.

But wait, another possibility is that the H is part of a bridgehead in a bicyclic system, where it's coupled with two different sets of Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

I'm a bit torn between options A and B.

Alternatively, considering the ozonolysis product, perhaps the H is part of a cyclopropane ring next to a carbonyl, leading to coupling with two Hs on either side, making a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not sure. Without a clear structural understanding, it's hard to decide.

Another angle: looking at the product 3's NMR. The most deshielded H is probably near a carbonyl. Suppose it's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. The two Hs on the CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. Each H would have two neighboring Hs, so each would be a triplet. So the splitting would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the adjacent group is a CH, then each H on the CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the CH, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm.

In the end, I think the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each H is a triplet. So the answer is A) triplet.


The problem involves a sequence of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to three products (1, 2, and 3). The goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3's $^1$H NMR spectrum.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH**  
   - The reaction likely involves elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a diene (1,3-adamantadiene).  
   - The IR absorption at 1720 cm$^{-1}$ suggests the presence of a carbonyl group, which could arise from a ketone or aldehyde.  
   - The $^1$H NMR of product 1 shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). These signals suggest a structure with a methylene group near an electronegative group (e.g., oxygen) and rigid bridgehead hydrogens.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Al isopropoxide**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates further elimination or rearrangement.  
   - Product 2 is likely a more substituted diene or a structure with a conjugated system, setting up for ozonolysis in the next step.

3. **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Ozonolysis**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl compounds.  
   - Product 3 contains carbonyl groups, and the most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is near a carbonyl group, likely part of a CH$_2$ group adjacent to the carbonyl.  
   - This hydrogen would couple with two hydrogens on the adjacent CH$_2$ group, resulting in a **triplet** coupling pattern.

### Critical Evaluation of Options:
- **A) Triplet**: Matches the expected coupling pattern for a hydrogen adjacent to a CH$_2$ group, where each hydrogen is coupled to two equivalent hydrogens.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: Would require coupling with two distinct sets of hydrogens, which is less likely in this scenario.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: Implies coupling with two different sets of hydrogens, which is not supported by the structure.  
- **D) Pentet**: Requires coupling with four equivalent hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the expected structure.

### Conclusion:
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group and part of a CH$_2$ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

**Answer: A**
