Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay. The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term and asks about the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the problem statement. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh, wait, perhaps it's L(y) = -λ ψ(y) f-bar (y) f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Yukawa-like interaction. So, the interaction term is something like λ f ψ̄ f X ψ_f, right? So the boson X interacts with fermions ψ and ψ_f.

Wait, but the main point is that X is a boson with mass 6 GeV. The question is about its possible decays. So, the boson can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because for a boson like a scalar, the decay would be into two particles, each with mass less than half of the X's mass. Because each fermion would have to have mass less than 3 GeV, because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

So, I need to find all fermions whose mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV. Because if a fermion has mass m, then 2m must be less than or equal to 6 GeV for X to be able to decay into that fermion and its antiparticle.

Wait, but wait, the mass of the fermion needs to be less than or equal to 3 GeV. Because for a decay into a pair, each particle must have energy at least their rest mass. So the maximum possible mass for each is when they are produced at rest in the center-of-mass frame, so each would have 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product.

But wait, let me check the fermion masses. Let me list the known fermion masses:

- Electron (e): about 0.000511 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.0035 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.0047 GeV (but in reality, the masses are a bit model-dependent; for example, in the Standard Model, the up and down are much lighter, but perhaps I should go with commonly accepted values)
Wait, but wait, the up and down quarks are actually very light. The current masses are approximately u ~ 2 MeV, d ~5 MeV. So their masses are way below 3 GeV.

Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
Strange quark (s): ~0.0095 GeV (again, but in some models, strange is about 100 MeV)
Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV (so more than 3 GeV)
Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so way over.

Wait, but wait. The strange quark: I think in the Standard Model, the strange quark is about 95-100 MeV. So less than 1 GeV. So that's under 3 GeV.

Charm quark is about 1.27 GeV, so that's under 3 GeV.

But bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV. So 4.5 >3, so X can't decay into b-bbar, because each b quark is 4.5 GeV, and two would need 9 GeV, but X is 6 GeV. So b-bbar is not allowed.

Wait, but wait, sometimes people use constituent quark masses that are higher, but for decay considerations, it's the current quark mass that matters. Because the Lagrangian interaction would be proportional to the mass term, which is the current quark mass. So for the interaction to happen, the fermion must have a mass, so for the X to decay into that fermion pair, the fermion's mass must be less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So, for each fermion f, m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So which fermions are lighter than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let's list all possible charged leptons and quarks.

Leptons:

- e: 0.0005 GeV → allowed
- μ: 0.105 GeV → allowed
- τ: 1.777 GeV → allowed
- neutrinos: negligible, but their mass is probably negligible, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can ignore them for X decays because X is a boson that couples to charged fermions? Wait, looking back at the Lagrangian, I see that the interaction term is f and ψ_f. Wait, perhaps the X field is coupling to some specific fermions. Let me look at the given interaction Lagrangian again.

Oh, the given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting the exact structure. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction term is of the form λ X ψ ψ, so X couples to fermions ψ and ψ_f. So perhaps ψ and ψ_f are specific fermions. Wait, but the question is about the decay of X into any possible pair, so I think the X can interact with any fermions that have a mass less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but the problem statement says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by" that Lagrangian. So perhaps X couples to all fermions, not just specific ones. Because the Lagrangian is written as a general interaction term, perhaps. So in that case, any fermion that's allowed (mass less than 3 GeV) could be a decay product.

So which fermion species have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let's list them:

Charged leptons:
- e: 0.0005 GeV → yes
- μ: 0.105 GeV → yes
- τ: 1.777 GeV → yes

Charged leptons with masses above 3 GeV: none.

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~0.0035 GeV → yes
- Down (d): ~0.0047 GeV → yes
- Strange (s): ~0.1 GeV → yes
- Charm (c): ~1.3 GeV → yes
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV → no
- Top (t): way too big → no

So X can decay into any quark-antiquark pair where the quarks' mass is ≤3 GeV, and any charged lepton pair where the lepton's mass is ≤3 GeV.

So the possible decay products are:

Charged leptons:
e+ e-
mu+ mu-
tau+ tau- (since m_taus ~1.777 GeV <3 GeV)

Quark-antiquark pairs:
u u-bar
d d-bar
s s-bar
c c-bar

But wait, what about the bottom quark? No, because m_b ~4.5 GeV, which is larger than 3 GeV, so X cannot decay into b b-bar.

So the possible decay channels are into each of these pairs.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b-bar,... but this is not possible because m_b is too high. So A is out.

Option B: includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, and the leptons e, mu, tau. So that's allowed.

Wait, option B is: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option C includes t t-bar, which is impossible. So C is out.

Option D includes b b-bar, so that's impossible as well. So D is out.

Option B doesn't include b b-bar, so it's the correct one.

Wait, but wait, let me check the options again.

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

That's all the possible fermions under 3 GeV.

So the correct answer must be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The boson \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, provided the mass of each fermion is less than or equal to half of \( X \)'s mass (i.e., \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fermion Mass Constraints**: For \( X \) to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of each fermion must satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This is derived from the requirement that the total energy of the two fermions in the center-of-mass frame does not exceed the mass of \( X \).

2. **Known Fermion Masses**:
   - **Charged leptons**:
     - Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.000511 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
     - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
     - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
   - **Quarks**:
     - Up (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.0035 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
     - Down (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
     - Strange (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
     - Charm (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
     - Bottom (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \))
     - Top (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \))

3. **Allowed Decays**: Based on the above, \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:
   - Charged leptons: \( e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \)
   - Quark-antiquark pairs: \( u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \)

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Rejected**.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+\e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Accepted**.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Rejected**.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Rejected**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) based on the given mass constraints.

Answer: B
