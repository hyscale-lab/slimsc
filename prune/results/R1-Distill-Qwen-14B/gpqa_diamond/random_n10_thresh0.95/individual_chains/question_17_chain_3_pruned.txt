Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration given is 0.02 M for the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, which I think probably means that the solution is such that the EDTA is in its deprotonated form, which is necessary for it to form the complex with Ca²+.

Hmm, right. So I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like Ca²+ in a 1:1 ratio, forming a complex. The formation constant (Kf) tells us about the stability of the complex. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable.

The problem gives me K_Ca-EDTA as 5x10^10. Wait, is that the formation constant? I think so. The formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the initial concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA²-], is 0.02 M. We need to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in the solution.

So, the approach is to set up the equilibrium expression. The formula for the formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since the complex is dissociating into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, in solution, the concentration of EDTA^4- is actually not the same as the concentration of the complex because the complex can dissociate. But if the solution is at stoichiometric conditions and the Kf is very large (like 1e10 or more), the complex would be very stable. So almost all the EDTA would be tied up in the complex, meaning that the free EDTA and free Ca²+ would be very low.

Wait, but the problem states it's a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, before any dissociation, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, it breaks down into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me think about the dissociation. The reaction is:

CaEDTA²- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So, the concentrations at equilibrium would be:
[CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kf is so large, x is probably very small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So substituting into Kf:
Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So 0.02 / x² = 5e10
Rearranged: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-13.

Wait, let me compute that step by step. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13, so square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M, which is approximately 6.3e-7.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Let's compute 0.02 divided by (5e10). Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So
