Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when acetic acid is titrated with NaOH. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

Wait, the question starts by saying we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So first, I should calculate the new concentration after dilution. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (M1 * V1) / V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, and V2 is 40 cm³ because we added another 20 cm³ of water.

Calculating that: 0.05 * 20 = M2 * 40. So M2 is (1) /40, which is 0.0125 M. Got it, the diluted acetic acid is 0.0125 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The next part is about the titration points: 25% and equivalence point.

Wait, what's the 25% titration point mean? Oh right, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find the pH at that point and at the equivalence point.

First, let's find the volume of NaOH needed for the equivalence point. For that, I need moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). The diluted solution is 0.0125 M in acetic acid, and the volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles = 0.0125 * 0.04 = 0.0005 mol.

Since the reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is 1:1 (each mole of acid reacts with a mole of base), the equivalence point will require 0.0005 mol of NaOH.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration. 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L, which is 5.00 cm³. So at equivalence, we've added 5 cm³ of NaOH.

But wait, the question asks for the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume is 5 cm³ * 0.25 = 1.25 cm³ of NaOH added.

But wait, no, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized. So moles neutralized is 0.25 * 0.0005 = 0.000125 mol NaOH added.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of moles. Let me clarify.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So for 25% titration, a quarter of that amount of NaOH has been added, meaning a quarter of the acetic acid is neutralized, and the rest is still in solution as acetate ions and unreacted acetic acid.

So, for the 25% point, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.0005 mol.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.0005 = 0.000125 mol of NaOH has reacted.

So, moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.0005 - 0.000125 = 0.000375 mol.

Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.000125 mol.

The total volume at this point would be the initial volume of acid solution plus the volume of NaOH added. The initial is 40 cm³, and the NaOH added is, let's compute that. Since 0.000125 mol of NaOH was added, and the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume is 0.000125 / 0.1 = 0.00125 L = 1.25 cm³. So total volume is 40 + 1.25 = 41.25 cm³ = 0.04125 L.

So now, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.000375 mol / 0.04125 L = 0.0090909 M ≈ 0.00909 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.000125 mol / 0.04125 L ≈ 0.0030303 M.

Wait, this looks like a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)). Let's compute that. Log(1.85e-5) is approximately log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733 (since -log(1.85e-5) is approximately 4.733).

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.0030303 / 0.0090909) = 4.733 + log(0.3333). Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Looking at the options, option D has 4.57 and 6.92, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Hmm, my calculation gives around 4.26, which is option A's first value. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the moles.

Wait, alternative approach: Maybe the total volume is not 41.25 cm³ but 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added at 25%. Let me recalculate the volumes correctly.

Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. Then, when we add 1.25 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 41.25 cm³, which is correct.

Another thing to check: The Henderson equation uses the ratio of concentrations, which I think I did correctly.

Wait, [A^-] is 0.000125 / 0.04125 = 0.0030303 M.

[HA] is 0.000375 / 0.04125 = 0.0090909 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.0030303 / 0.0090909 ≈ 0.3333, which is 1/3. Log(1/3)= -0.477.

So pH = pKa + (-0.477) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which rounds to 4.26. So the 25% point pH is 4.26.

Now, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value.

But wait, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate ions can be calculated.

At equivalence, moles of acetate is 0.0005 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm³ + 5 cm³ = 45 cm³ = 0.045 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.0005 / 0.045 ≈ 0.01111 M.

But acetate ions will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Using Kb, we can find the pH.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x^2 / (0.01111) = 5.405e-10.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.01111 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 1.111e-2 = 6.00e-12.

x = sqrt(6e-12) ≈ 7.746e-6.

So [OH^-] ≈ 7.746e-6 M.

pOH = -log(7.746e-6) ≈ 5.11. So pH = 14 - 5.11 = 8.89.

Wait, that's not matching any of the options. The options have equivalence pHs as 8.52, 6.73, 7, 6.92.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check calculations.

Wait, another approach for equivalence point: Maybe I should consider the dilution correctly.

Wait, at equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate (0.0005 mol) in 45 cm³ (0.045 L). So concentration is 0.0005 / 0.045 = 0.01111 M.

But when acetate ions react with water, they produce OH-.

So, Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10.

So the equation is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is [OH^-], Kb ≈ x^2 / (0.01111) = 5.405e-10.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.01111 ≈ 6.00e-12. x = sqrt(6e-12) ≈ 7.746e-6 M.

pOH = -log(7.746e-6) ≈ 5.108. So pH is 14 -5.108 = 8.892.

But none of the options have pH around 8.89. The closest is option A with 8.52. Hmm, that's way off. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe I miscalculated the Kb.

Wait, let me compute Kb again. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should account for the activity coefficients, but I think that's beyond the scope. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is not as I thought.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact value of Kb and not approximate
